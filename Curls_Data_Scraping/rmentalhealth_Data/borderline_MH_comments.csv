1,"I work in an inpatient psych ward and most of the patients we treat suffer from BPD.  Before working here, I had no idea what BPD was, or that it even existed.  I think a lot of people are in the same boat because it certainly isn’t talked about enough because too many people have inappropriately labeled BPD behaviors as “attention seeking”, which invalidates their severity and the near inability of someone suffering to manage these emotions and behaviors in healthy ways (not from lack of trying).  I understand it can be frustrating to be on the receiving end of some of these outbursts and it can feel tiresome to continue to support when it feels like someone isn’t trying hard enough to get better.  However, those feelings are nothing compared to the person suffering with this illness.  Unfortunately, it is a very difficult illness to treat, it is extremely complex and treatment resistant.  Never stop advocating for yourself and those who struggle in the same ways, you’re an incredible person for even being willing to share your experiences when there are so many who will dismiss that or try to invalidate you.  You are worthy, you are strong, you are valid, and we see you!  I hope you’re getting the help you need and never give up on working towards peace.  I’m so proud of you!",mayja21,tupibd

6,"Hey dude, as someone who has BPD this honestly gives a lot of insight, thanks for spreading awareness!~ I have a question though. As I have recently in the past year or so got diagnosed, and my parents are very in denial of having mental illness, my mom has the need to constantly remind me how temporary it is especially with the right treatment, but my confusion starts when most of the experiences and things I do related to my BPD don’t seem like much of a choice and are things I’ve basically done my whole life without thinking about it, so how “curable” is this mental illness, if even at all?",,tupibd

8,"Currently trying to get my sister diagnosed with this, because she displays almost every symptom you described. She's on medication, but I don't think it's the right one since she still has major outbursts and is unpredictable. I hate to say it, but she's ruined many events (including my birthday lunch) because of her illness. I try not to blame her, since I have mental health issues too, but I'm reaching my breaking point with her. She's mean to my mom, she makes stuff up, she barely had any trauma and thinks anything bad that happened to her is trauma. I know her brain isn't in the right state of mind, but how much can one person put up with walking on eggshells for? She has refused to get help beyond what she's taking right now, so that's why my patience is running think: she is doing nothing to help her situation and she has made my mom (who is the nicest and most considerate person I know) feel like a failure as a mother. I don't like how she treats my mom. Again, I know it's not her fault and I try not to blame her, it's just hard. We can't force her to get help because she's going to be 24. It's a tough battle.

Edit: if you have any tips on how to deal with this, please let me know. My family would greatly appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation.",beemill,tupibd
9,"I have BPD and it’s honestly the worst shit ever. I feel so drained from experiencing “emotional whiplash” from processing extreme emotions so quickly. I mean- how is it normal to be laughing and having the best day of your life to having something trigger you into spiraling and it can lead to violence towards others or yourself (physical or mental). And the constant need to feel important and loved and accepted but it never being enough. 

I hate that I feel so alone all the time and a burden to those in my life. I know I’m not- but I can never shake the feeling. And there is nothing anyone can do or say to make me shake that feeling. 

It can be so crippling. 

But what’s scarier is deciding if feeling is better than not feeling anything. Those days where you just feel so empty and devoid of any emotions because you’re so tired from all the emotions you spilled out in such a short period of time.

I know that the comments about ""these people"" with BPD are hurtful and unfair.

However, people who have had traumatic, abusive, or painful experiences with someone with BPD (and that is their only experience), it may make them want to avoid the disorder in general. People are often speaking about from a place of pain and hurt. 

I 100% understand that one experience of a person isn't applicable to ALL people with BPD. That is never the way. Just some thoughts on why the stigma is so much worse than some other MH Disorders.",Twentytwentyarts,tupibd

17,"For some of us (me included), it is hard to feel alot of sympathy for these people, especially the ones that refuse help.  My Mom has it.  She is a nightmare and has cause SO MUCH trauma for her children.  At what point do we stand up and force the person to FIX themselves or get help?  My Mom knew she was not quite right (her words), yet abused alcohol, beat her kids, had affairs, stole money, etc. etc.  She gaslights, CLINGS to anyone that gives her attention.  I am just DONE with people like these.  

p,s. I used to feel ""soo sorry"" for her b/c I knew about her upbringing. I defended her and tried to spread awareness but got the smear campaign when I spoke up.  We need to FORCE these people into treatment. They destroy people!

19,"Having BPD absolutely sucks. I wish I could be ‘normal’ and maintain a healthy relationship with others, but my symptoms cause me to get annoyed, offended, or cut off relationships all together. I have a constant emptiness and void after losing people close to me, and having all bridges burned due to my inability to let that continue smoothly. This illness has turned everyone against me, my family, my friends. I feel so alone, and depressed all the time. I currently am not in therapy but taking depakote, but it’s hard to want to. My mom forces me to take it, im F22 and live with my parents to save money. Living with them is bad for my mental health so hopefully I can leave soon, as they demoralize me and make me feel like I’m insane.  Back in November, my boyfriend of 2 years suffocated me, nearly killing me. My family was not supportive and even turned me away that night.

28,"It currently isn’t curable, however it is treatable. You can take medication to subside the symptoms but where it’s neurological there is no cure.",Accurate_Ad5797,tupibd
29,"I disagree that it isn’t curable, unless we’re using some strict definition. No you can’t take a pill to make it go away. But BPD is really about the way you look at life and relationships. So we were traumatized as kids & took on these beliefs/coping mechanisms right? So those same beliefs & mechanisms can be overcome with a lot of work. Working on your world view, unlearning maladaptive behaviors. It takes a lot of tough honesty about yourself, & willingness/humility to admit that your world view isn’t necessarily the “right” world view. Not to say we’re bad, but other people don’t see relationships the same way we do, so if we want to have the healthy relationships that we crave we have to learn to understand how they see things. So that we can understand not to feel pain or rejection when it isn’t warranted. Maybe you’ll always have to fight your instincts, or maybe you’ll practice so much you’ll unlearn those behaviors. None of this is to say it’s easy or a quick fix if you just “work hard enough”. I find it worrisome that your mom is causing this stress when it’s usually our parents who caused BPD in the first place. Either way, continuing to live in the same environment can make it almost impossible to cure at the moment. In our parents house we have so much less control over our lives & relationships. So how are we supposed to unlearn our coping strategies when we’re still faced with the same shit every day? & your mom is likely pushing the idea of a cure because she feels guilt or hates seeing you dealing with this. Either she caused it or “let this happen” to her kid. And once you’re “cured” she doesn’t have to feel as guilty anymore, whether that guilt is justified or not. Anyway all of this is to say it’s not some death sentence, you won’t be stuck taking meds for the rest of your life for a chemical imbalance that causes this, you’ll just have to do the work. And loved ones have a hard time understanding. They want to see a straight path towards the “solution” (ie you’re cured!) & while they’re sad & empathetic at first, they start to tire of our continued struggle with it. Your mom believes what she wants to believe, & you can’t exactly make someone change their mind. But you can try to establish healthy boundaries, here specifically about how your health is discussed. Anyways I hope all of this can help someone, or get them thinking. It’s just my thoughts & experience. I like to think the goal is to have healthy relationships & one day be able to take the BPD assessment & have it show negative. Not that that’s the “cure”, but if you can keep it that way over time then you’re doing good.",RynnChronicles,tupibd
30,"I’m not very good at advice but I have bpd and for me it feels like, I just want people to understand me and not be mad at me like I wish someone could just talk to me normal if I’m having a swing instead of be mad and look at me like an idiot. Lately I’ve been feeling when my swings are about to happen so I distance my self and go take a bath or do something to try to calm down. Mind you, it can still happen if something instantly triggers it and you can snap.

35,"Yes some of the comments are less understanding then others but I can’t shame other people on having an opinion. I was diagnosed with bpd around 14-15? I grew up in a low income family with lots of stress and an alcoholic father(I don’t have to go into to detail because I’m sure you can assume what every night was like) and my mother and step brother passed away in a tragic car accident on December 14. After my mother passed away, I ran away with my sister because that was my only way to cope and there was no good environment for me, I was constantly surrounded by drugs and alcohol and violence. I got sexually abused when I ran away as well. Those were some of the core things that happened to cause this disorder I believe. Also please don’t feel sorry for me or anything for this comment I just wanted to fit in here that the fact of the matter is things in life happen that you have no control over especially at some young age and just because someone’s mother has bpd and there life was hell doesn’t mean everyone with bpd is like that.",Accurate_Ad5797,tupibd

37,"There are multiple “types” of BPD. Not every single person who is diagnosed with this disorder is identical in their behaviors. For example, my mom has BPD and she is the type that is very manipulative, emotionally abusive, physically abusive, the world revolves around her, she can never be alone, ever. She is constantly dependent on others, can’t do anything herself yet manages to talk about how great she is in almost every possible conversation. She is always basically like “me me me me!” On the OTHER side of the disorder, you have people like me. I am stupidly TOO nice. I let people walk all over me and use me and take advantage of my niceness. I cry if there’s any sort of argument or conflict because I despise fighting with people. I don’t know how to say “no” to anyone. I have horrible self esteem and self-image and cannot genuinely say anything nice about myself besides the fact that I am “too nice”. I am the furthest thing from abusive and/or manipulative. I am literally the opposite of your mom. I hate alcohol. I could never in my life cheat on someone it would eat me alive, I have trouble asking anyone to borrow money much less would I ever STEAL from someone…also, I’ve been in treatment and on medication for over 15 years. 

What I’m trying to get you to understand is that there are multiple “kinds” of personalities when it comes to BPD. Try not to bunch us all together under the “evil” category. It’s not fair to those of us who are beyond nice…we aren’t monsters and we aren’t all the same person. The disorder does not define us.",duhmbish,tupibd

He must have the patience of a saint. I really do try not to blame her, but when someone refuses help that they obviously need, it makes it hard. It's also hard not to get upset when she's yelling and swearing in your face, calling you all sorts of names and making up lies about things you did to her. Is delusion part of BPD?

Sure, you can be a good presence in their path to overcome their problems, but many times, this isn’t even truly possible. In the se one place, since she is histrionic and borderline, it would be important to see if this relationship is being toxic or not, for you and her. If the relationship is being toxic, causing you problems and she is being manipulative for example, then the best choice for you would be to leave her, even if it hurts. I understand that you love her, but as I said before, you can’t truly “save” her.

They do not take introspection or responsibility, it is the fault of others, if they hurt you they have already prepared a story in their head that justifies them. They mold you to be someone perfect and give them support and validation. In the end your world ends up revolving around them. 

They have been getting their way through manipulation for a lifetime. You can't trust them. So in the end you can't have a peaceful relationship. If you are their friend, rest assured that it is because they can get some benefit. They don't want to have friends who contradict them. And they don't love you, not in the genuine and healthy way we know it. Their nature is to be an eagle and hunt/conquer people who love them, not love you for who you are, you are the sparrow here and they love you for what you give them. You are interchangeable to them because they don't get attached to people. Although they look for relationships because they cannot be alone, they are their trigger.

They don't know what it means to be intimate and for them, being intimate unfortunately means showing their worst side and believing that the other person deserves it or should tolerate it.

Just remember that the condition of your girlfriend could even worsen your situation, and potentially cause you more harm than good in the future.

12,"Yes, I agree, the best thing for me now is slowly find in myself the solution and happiness with the help of therapist and other people. But the most difficult part now is leave her complitely: I think that would take me months maybe, becouse it depends a lot on how I feel. These days most of the time I just did things for myself, but usually before sleeping it was almost impossible for me to not write her a message. And some nights we finish to message with positive vibes, but others not. I think I just need someone tell me: ""It's normal like that, slowly you're gonna menage this situation in the best way, but for now it's totally normal, you're gonna do it""",Massive-Ad-1902,17y3v6q

What you need is some affection and a genuine connection, and she isn’t the only possible way to have such things. You will simply look back at your past, at this moment, and even wonder how you could think it wasn’t possible for you to be genuinely happy. In every case, as an additional way of helping you, I suggest you to read about codependency. I am not a therapist so I am clearly NOT diagnosing you, but you might want to know (through some online tests, for example and through the help of your therapist) if you are codependent. Getting over codependency and working on it will also make the separation easier. You can do this. I believe in you, really.",,17y3v6q

I don't know if I explain it well, but I think this condition will mitigate in the future, when I will associate her more with the current situation and less with all the good memories.

Codependency from her side makes sense after all, but this is an ulterior sign your relationship with her might just worsen the situation. The irrational part is simply expressing your needs, but all you have to do is to control it. Not suppress your needs, but start to control them and not let them control you. It’s like a sort of addiction, isn’t it? You need to find fulfillment outside this relationship to be more dependent on that irrational, dangerous side. And no, you aren’t stressing me, don’t worry about that. I am here to help people who need it, and I am happy I am helping you, even if a little. I am available if you need support.

I'm happy to know that I could still have your support, now it's difficult for me to talk with friends, becouse I already talk with them before about her, but now I feel them more distant to me.

17,"I understand, after all therapy isn’t easy to afford for many people. But even a bit of it can give you solid benefits. Since you already have those chats with your therapists, have you thought about also using some workbooks that can help you with your feelings? There are workbooks for basically everything : Depression, anxiety, addictions etc. They can help you to recover if you take the advice to heart. Some of them are Ben free and there should be a post about them on this subreddit. Such workbooks and resources are indeed used as support for therapy, so you might benefit from them a lot. Regarding friends, actually you aren’t wrong. I mean, in most relationships people have some kind of problem with the other person, but only a relatively small part of people (compared to all the people that have a significant other of course) has to deal with histrionic and borderline partners. The problems you faced on this relationship and what you saw is NOT something common. The majority of people don’t face that and couldn’t even do so. Your feelings about the situation are completely normal. If your friends are more distant because they think your problems aren’t that big, then I don’t know if we can define them true friends. Surely telling people your problems may be annoying to some, but a true friend should listen in this case. Perhaps some of them understand you more, so you can talk about it with them. I also suggest you to engage in other activities with your friends (I would suggest the closest ones), since this will also help your mind to heal.

From how you describe your symptoms, BPD seems like a possibility. Paranoia and lack of trust are common, as are mood swings. There is also often a major fear of abandonment. DBT could teach you techniques to help break these negative thought patterns - building an ability to hold contradictory ideas simultaneously, mindfulness to keep you present and grounded in your body and sense-world, and distress tolerance to help you stay calm even when you are triggered.

5,">Se hai BPD, e anche se non lo fai, hai bisogno di un aiuto professionale. BPD è una condizione mentale piuttosto grave e deve essere affrontata da un terapeuta qualificato. Fortunatamente, gli ultimi 30 anni circa hanno visto grandi passi avanti nei metodi e nella qualità delle cure per i pazienti BPD. La terapia comportamentale dialettica, una modalità basata su una combinazione di CBT, filosofia dialettica e pratiche di consapevolezza, ha dimostrato di essere altamente efficace nel trattamento del BPD. Da come descrivi i tuoi sintomi, BPD sembra una possibilità. La paranoia e la mancanza di fiducia sono comuni, così come gli sbalzi d'umore. Spesso c'è anche una grande paura dell'abbandono. La DBT potrebbe insegnarti tecniche per aiutarti a rompere questi schemi di pensiero negativi - costruendo una capacità di mantenere idee contraddittorie contemporaneamente, consapevolezza per mantenerti presente e radicato nel tuo corpo e nel mondo dei sensi e tolleranza all'angoscia per aiutarti a rimanere calmo anche quando sei attivato. Cerca un terapeuta certificato DBT nella tua zona e vai per una valutazione.

Sometimes finding the right way to tip toe around an issue with people like your sister and my mom is to learn how to communicate with them. They are not processing information normally, so even though it sucks sometimes, kind of suggest stuff without sounding like you’re telling them what to do or think; they are so sensitive to the dumbest things. Even normally articulating a statement in an average tone can be offensive to them. If you can maneuver this, tell her to buy something with white noise (a fan, air purifier) and ear plugs- those items are a godsend when it comes to noise; also with the light, I’ve used a rolled up towel to block out unwanted light at the bottom of my door (living with other people sucks).

11,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is marked by acute emotional turmoil leading to unstable relationships, volatile sense of self, fear of abandonment, frequent mood shifts, self-destructive behavior and poor impulse control.

Yes, your sister struggles a lot. But that doesn’t make your suffering any less painful.

Having a family member with borderline personality disorder and caring about them can be a roller coaster ride. There are moments of appreciation and then there are moments of emotional abuse. Their mental illness often distorts their perceptions causing antagonistic behavior and making the world a perilous place. The pain and terror of abandonment and feeling unwanted can be so great that suicide feels like a better choice to them.

Having a sister with BPD means having a stormy sibling relationship as things will never be calm. Accusations, anger, jealousy, bullying, control, and arguments become a regular part of life due to their insecurity.

For them everything is either black and white. They have the quintessential Jekyll and Hyde personality. Fluctuating dramatically between idealizing and devaluing you, they may suddenly and sporadically shift throughout the day. You never know what or whom to expect. And this can leave you feeling confused and frustrated leading to a stressed relationship.

The first thing you need to do is set up personal boundaries around the house. Establish rules about what kind of behavior is acceptable for you and what you simply will not accept. Let her know gently that you care about her but you also need to protect your mental and emotional wellbeing as well. You need to be assertive and establish personal boundaries as this will snap them out of their delusional thinking.

People with BPD need structure and a combination of knowing that they’re cared for and boundaries that are communicated calmly and firmly.

Be assertive and set boundaries.

13,"I almost never say this, but it sounds like she needs to be hospitalized. I absolutely hate hate hate hate hate hospitalization (I'm bipolar type I) but physical violence in the household is absolutely unacceptable and I'm honestly surprised no one has placed criminal charges against her. Throwing a vase at you to the extent that you need stitches (or ... you know ... AT ALL) is insane and a form of assault/battery.

Is she off her medication? If not then she ABSOLUTELY should be seeing a psychiatrist to prescribe her a different regimen. This is absolutely a mental health crisis situation that it sounds like your mom is afraid to deal with herself. 

My recommendation to you would be that you have a serious talk with your mom about forcing her into treatment and the next time she does something violent (even if it's just a ""bad tempertantrum"" sort of thing) call the police and tell them your sister is mentally ill and presenting a danger to you/others. 

If you live in the US this is basically how it will go down:

Sister gets physically abusive or agitated to the point where she is acting violently (e.g. slamming furniture etc.)

You or your mom Call 9-1-1

A few cops and paramedics are going to show up at your house and talk to her and most likely detain her and take her to a psych ward where a judge will have a hearing with her and she will have the option to be voluntarily committed (civil commitment) OR if her symptoms are severe enough they may just involuntarily hospitalize her.

Hospitalizations usually last around a week and during that time she will be forced to see psychiatrists (so she can get on proper meds) and therapists on a daily basis and be under constant supervision.

I'm really sorry this is happening to you. I know that I caused a lot of disruption and stress in my house before I got on proper medication but it was never this extreme. The hospitalization experience was really rough for me, personally, but in extreme situations like this I think it's the best way to go for her.

Talk to your mom about this, I’m 16 and I don’t think I would be able to maintain in that house. In my opinion the best course of action would be to either 1.Have her go to the therapy necessary for treating BPD, and to have her tell her therapist about all of this meticulous bullshit so she and her therapist can work on this or 2.

No outsider will put up with her behavior and she will never have a life if you don't stand up to her and make it so that her behavior doesn't pay off. 

I assume she is lonely and can I guess, obese? 

Her unhappiness and need to control everything must be squashed. Also, you can't allow any person to treat you in this way. There's some things you can change, like get headphones for your TV, but the rest of it is total nonsense, door sounds, the microwave, that stuff lasts for seconds to minutes and to need to start ignoring her NOW. 

I would directly tell her, we aren't doing this any more. If she tries to hurt you, tell her you will call the cops. A woman like that, if you hit her, she will make stuff up to get you in trouble, I guarantee it.

20,"I feel so bad for you that you’re going through all that. I’m going through the same with my 19 year old daughter and it’s living hell. 
I’m constantly walking on eggshells in my own house when she’s around and the rules that you have are basically what goes on here although they’re not rules as such but that’s exactly how she behaves. It feels like a control thing. The most bizarre one that angers me cos I don’t know if she’s telling the truth is that I’m not allowed to bite my nails because it reminds her of rape... she knows that’s a sensitive subject to me and I’m wondering if she just says that as she’s no other excuse to tell me why I can’t bite my nails?
She’s not been diagnosed with bpd but she’s recently been diagnosed with Aspergers and adhd, I believe she does have bpd she has all the symptoms and I even thought that before she was diagnosed with her recent ones.
She also speaks to me like sh@@ and also my cats that I have.
I have to stay calm all the time because if I lost my temper I would do something I’d probably regret.
I really hope you greet help for yourself as it’s alot to deal with and cope with and you need to look after you. I’m sorry I don’t have any suggestions as I don’t have any for myself but can only wish you good luck and I understand how you’re feeling.

21,"Aww! I'm sorry you have to go through that! You're allowed to feel how ever you feel! :)

I really think you need to talk to her, and get her to address the issues! Sit with her, and ask her, ""Sister, do you not love me?"" Tell her that your intentions for doing whatever you do aren't to hurt her, but because of what you want to do. You need to make her understand that your intentions matter. If you want to use the microwave, you should, and that you'll try your best to get it before the microwave beeps. I'm sure deep down, she loves you! You might feel like you don't love her, but you do too! :) If you ask her how she feels about you, she would have to understand what she feels, and why she feels it! :) Give her time to think even if she says stuff. Also, you should get her earplugs, or the eye covering things you get in flights! If she sees you making an effort, and that your intentions are not to mess with her, she'll have to understand how she feels about you! If how she felt was baseless, she might start being nicer, you know?

I know you feel trapped, and it's extremely hard, but you could try to explain it to her. Every time you get tilted, do something that you like for 10 mins or something to reset, that might help! :) But you should talk to her to make sure this doesn't happen again! :)

Plus, if these things bother her, treat her like a baby, you know? You might be 17, but you could try being the adult for her, and understand that she is like this, but not enable her as well, you know? I'm saying, take the first steps, get her candy or something, and also tell her what you want to say to her! :) She's an adult so she would understand, she just needs a little bit of help! :)

I wish the situation gets better for you, bro! Let me know if this helped! :)

Also, always look after your mental health! It's extremely important! :)",Dakshina7,i6xu9n

24,"man, this is very familiar to me.

my sister had bpd. she moved in with us a few times, all due to her inability to live on her own. so i lived with her in very close quarters on a number of occasions. i was not happy. there was always chaos. she was up all hours of the night and slept all during the day, which meant we always had to tip-toe around her and reschedule our activities around her sleep schedule. she had no sense of boundaries. she would make all sorts of demands. she lived with me once after i had moved out and gone to college, and she would just go through all my things and complain if i had people over and drink all of my alcohol. i won't get super into it, but at one point my parents were threatened eviction because of her behaviors.

and yes, they were fairly intolerable. my parents enabled her 100%. but a few years ago she died by suicide and after that i chose to pursue a career in mental health. and knowing what i know now about bpd, i feel like i could have handled it much better for both myself and for her.

your feelings are totally valid. absolutely, it sucks to have these restrictions on your life when they weren't there before and they really only affect one person. it sounds like she is struggling too, at the very least for some sense of control in a life that, with that personality disorder, is very much out of control. i am glad you see a psychologist, and i am hoping that she is also receiving appropriate clinical care. this is a very shitty time in the world just in general, and then with her having to live in your world and you having to share your world and whathaveyou, all i suggest emphatically is to have compassion <3",funyunonions,i6xu9n
25,"Forgot it say It’s not selfish. These people will make you apologize for their bad behavior. For example you just said you were being selfish. NOPE, it’s her that’s selfish.",,i6xu9n
26,That’s just abusive behaviour. She’s controlling you and being completely unreasonable. Being mentally ill is not an excuse to manipulate and abuse others,deepthroatcircus,i6xu9n
27,"I too have BPD and just wanted to give you my take. As everyone has already correctly stated, this is not an acceptable regime to have to live under. Her BPD and Aggressiveness are not okay and should not be tolerated or glanced over. Someone (you and your mother) need to start directly telling her ""no, that's not how this works"".

As far as the noise thing is concerned I'd like to point out two things. The first is that BPD is a trauma disorder. It's primarily the result of an intense trauma and is often comorbid- occurs alongside- PTSD. This is important because if she indeed has PTSD she will likely have a much larger ""startle response"" - that moment you jump because there's a huge fucking spider on your leg- this causes numerous different sounds to act like sirens, anything associated with a particular sound or if it sounds similar enough will trigger a response and cause fear which is often followed by either flashbacks or depressive states. This can also occur in people with Autism, as pointed out, as well as in anyone with trauma or even ""normal"" people, who hear the song taps and have flashbacks to their grandfather's funeral. That's a very sketchy psychological overview for it, but the point still is she needs to change her behavior and the rules are only making her worse. She's going to have to learn to live with squeaky doors, or light from the bathroom. If you don't like the sound of the microwave get the hell out!

If your mom doesn't want to bother changing the rules, (which you're going to have to talk to her about) then here's what you need to do:

Tell your sister-

Go into the attic with long pants and sleeves and gloves, and find out if your house has open gaps between the walls (if you do or it's not full, i.e. you can move it around a bunch) you will need the fiberglass

Go to the store, at sister'ss expense, and get 2 rolls of fiberglass, a weatherproofing kit for a door-complete with the shim at the bottom, and lubricating oil.

Stuff the insulation down between her wall and yours and her wall and anywhere else. This will act as an acoustic baffle and deaden noise either going in or coming out of her room. 

Oil the hinges on your door. Best way is take a hammer and flathead, pop the bolt out of each hinge, lubricate the bolt and inside of hinges and slide em back in. Also lubricate the doorknobs. 

Or you could just do these things yourself. But it would be better for her to have to fix things that bothers her. It will make her aware that she's not dictating everyone's behavior, and that if something is wrong she'll have to do something about it.",smishmortion,i6xu9n

40,"This is only my extreme perspective and approach. Treat her like shit, even if she starts to throw shit at you, stick up for yourself. Treat it like an exorcist situation. In a exorcist movie they will fight tooth and nail until you lay down the rules and lay down some order.  Intentionally make noise, intentionally get her pissed off, again don't take this advice if shes the type to have a knife under the pillow and stab you.

Assert your dominance.

These people act tough to people they think are weak, once you start to act strong and tough, they will cry and have a mental breakdown. They are broken and weak as well as severely distorted, get her to become preoccupied with things that annoy you  and once it is you who is displaying behavior above hers and turning the tables on her, she will listen and crawl to you. Show no remorse, they need to be put in their place.

When she's having a sook at you, argue back, tell her she is crazy and needs help, do everything in your arsenal to make her feel like she is ''insane'', drive her nuts, their biggest weakness is people tougher than them and more assertive/violent than them.

That will never give you the right to talk about a diagnosis, or any other group for that matter, with a broad stroke of hatred.",smishmortion,i6xu9n
82,"I'd say go for it. What do you have to lose? Can she physically drag you back? If she were to try to do something legal to bring you back you can tell her you will seek help somewhere else. Given that she begs you not to go she is absolutely aware she's in the wrong and causing you suffering. I'm sure it's a tough place to be for her as well, however she can't have the cake and eat it too while you just wilt away. 

Maybe call you uncle and explain the situation is unbearable, your sister is throwing stuff around and see if he will let you stay, maybe helping to pay some if you can get a part time job. If your mom were to tell your uncle (is it her brother or from the other part of the family?) to not let you, he might plead for you and say ""he's no bother let him be while things stabilize"" or who knows, just something that makes your mom think? 

Look you've got nothing to lose, do you? How much worse can it be if she ""tries to drag you back""? I'm sorry you have little support, I know how it feels, so just know that you are enough. It's scary but you gotta stand up for yourself. I can imagine all those rules to not trigger your sister and I remember myself not trying to trigger my ex husband. The sooner you can get away from that the sooner you can start healing mentally, and draw a clear boundary: either the situation gets under control or you don't come back. Either way, how long until it's time for you to leave the nest and do your own thing? I get she doesn't want you to leave earlier but she's giving you such a hostile environment for someone to live in. These things spill into the rest of your life in the long run. You my friend gotta think about yourself first, and do what you have to do. For your well being and your future.

0,"My partner also has BPD (and so does my sister and cousin). It's hard, honestly. It takes a lot of love and patience, and unless your partner is actively working on themselves in therapy (specifically DBT and trauma based therapy), or has recieved therapy long term to the point their symptoms are considered in remission, it'll be hard. 

This is in no way an attempt to demonise those with BPD, but the way that their symptoms can present, it can become abusive towards their partners. The black and white thinking, the devaluation when they split, the impulsivity and the self harm behaviours (usually related to an impulsive mood swings, at least in the case of the people I know) can all be extremely stressful and abusive towards someone who is not prepared or able to handle these behaviours. 

I'd suggest making sure your partner is actively participating in therapy, and that you also try therapy if ever needed (trust me, when some of them split, they can say some really hurtful things).",Fancypotato1995,1bxt2oi

2,"**He takes medication for mood stability and anxiety and depression.**

Researcher, no medication has been proven effective for the long-term treatment of borderline personality disorder. BPD is believed to be caused by an inherited gene and/or by a childhood trauma (e.g., abuse or abandonment) occurring before age 5. Because the trauma occurs so early, it blocks the child's emotional development at age 3 or 4.

The child therefore has no opportunity to develop a strong stable sense of self identity -- and has no opportunity to learn the many emotional skills needed to be able to control his own emotions.

This is why a pwBPD cannot learn those missing emotional skills by swallowing a pill or talking about his childhood. Like a person learning to play a piano, he must work hard for many years in a weekly training program (e.g., DBT) to acquire those missing skills. One study (by John Gunderson & Frank Yeomans) estimates that 8 to 16 years are required.

**My husband has PTSD, anxiety and depression. He takes medication for mood stability and anxiety and depression.**

Although medication won't make a dent in the BPD itself (or his piano playing skills), nearly all pwBPD are prescribed meds. The reason is that the vast majority of pwBPD also suffer from 2 or 3 co-occurring clinical disorders -- e.g., bipolar, depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, or ADHD.

For example, 74% of pwBPD have a co-occurring anxiety disorder, 75% have a mood disorder such as depression, and 39% also have PTSD. The medications are targeted to treating those co-occurring disorders. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

**Please share advice.**

Researcher, I suggest you take a look at the r/BPDlovedones sub, where you will find hundreds of members sharing their experiences of living with -- or walking away from -- their BPD partners. In the right-hand column of that sub, you also will find a list of good books and links pointing to online resources. Moreover, Reddit's biggest BPD resource targeted to the abused partners is the r/BPDWiki",Up-Town,wog9ax
3,"**He randomly will become so angry with me and he does so in front of our infant son.**

When you're in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, Researcher, it is difficult to know that you're doing more good than harm by staying in the relationship. Whatever you do will be hurtful to him much of the time. A comment or action that pleases him on one day may greatly offend him when repeated a week later. Moreover, he often will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T do it.  
  
This conundrum is due to the position of his two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.  
  
Your predicament is that the solution to calming his abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers his engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming his engulfment fear (moving back away to give him breathing space) is the very action that triggers his abandonment fear.  
  
As you move close to comfort him and assure him of your love, you eventually will start triggering his engulfment fear, making him feel like he's being suffocated and controlled by you. Granted, he likely craves intimacy like other adults do but -- due to his weak self-identity and lack of personal boundaries, he cannot tolerate intimacy for very long. He thus will start feeling like he is becoming enmeshed in your strong personality. Yet, as you back away to give him breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering his abandonment fear.  
  
In my 15 years with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution -- between ""too close"" and ""too far away""-- where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate his own emotions and tame his two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away (by creating fights over nothing) and pull-you-back (by love bombing you).  
  
Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, an untreated pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. His subconscious does this to protect his fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside his body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, he consciously will be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU.  
  
Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you will often find yourself hurting him -- i.e., triggering his engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering his abandonment fear as you draw back, and sometimes triggering his fears even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing. This, at least, has been my experience, Researcher.",Up-Town,wog9ax

10,"**He does not blow up at others nor does he do it in front of others. That makes me question the BPD part.**

If he suffered from IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder), he would blow up around ANYONE (e.g., road rage against total strangers). If he is a pwBPD, however, he very likely does not show anger to strangers and casual friends. Most pwBPD are good and caring people -- as long as you don't get so close in a personal relationship that you start triggering their two fears. Their problem is not being BAD but, rather, being UNSTABLE.

Indeed, the vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning."" This means that they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, clients, casual friends, and total strangers. None of those people are able to trigger his fears of abandonment and engulfment.

There is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment. Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually appear only when someone (e.g., a casual friend) draws very close to the pwBPD.

This is why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to excel in socially difficult jobs such as being a social worker, professor, salesclerk, or doctor. And this is why most pwBPD can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers -- but often will go home at night to abuse the very people who love them.

Importantly, this does not mean that a pwBPD *chooses to control himself* around casual friends and strangers. Rather, it means that he experiences no strong anger around those people and thus *has no anger that needs to be controlled*. He experiences frequent anger around you and family members because, as noted above, you frequently trigger his abandonment fear whenever you draw away and you trigger his engulfment fear whenever you draw close.

This is why his very WORST behavior typically occurs during the very BEST of times -- e.g., the morning after an intimate evening, during a family holiday celebration, or in the middle of an expensive vacation. During such special events requiring prolonged periods of closeness, you eventually will start triggering his engulfment fear, making him feel like he's being suffocated and controlled by you.

Granted, he likely craves intimacy like other adults do but -- due to his weak self-identity and lack of personal boundaries -- he cannot tolerate intimacy for very long. He thus will start feeling like he is becoming enmeshed in your strong personality. Because his subconscious often projects those uncomfortable feelings onto you, he will be consciously convinced that YOU are the source of the unpleasant feelings. In this way, a pwBPD will start fights (over nothing) to push you away.",Up-Town,wog9ax

Impulsivity can be dangerous, no matter what case it may be. You can want to be loved and feel it, but the moment they take one step back, it all comes crumbling down and you are left with nothing.

1,It just means you have traits of borderline personality disorder. Probably not enough to diagnose you because you do need to meet 5 of the 9 criteria but you can still meet traits of it without the entire disorder. A lot of professionals don’t like diagnosing BPD at all which is probably why she said that. It’s extremely stigmatized and even professionals themselves have their own negative feelings towards it. Some of them won’t even treat borderline patients.,whitedoggal,qwjny9
2,"I have been diagnosed with BPD. You can look up the 9 traits that they use to diagnose you. There is a new therapy that has been shown to be effective in working on BPD it's called Schema Therapy. Very interesting. Don't let it scare you. You're still you, but it is hard sometimes especially on the people who love you.",,qwjny9
3,I don’t why that freaks me out a bit. It’s not something I’ve ever expected to be told. But it makes sense. The only traits I really have are intense fear of rejection and intense responses to it. As well as stress related paranoid and detachment from reality. Just insecure attachment stuff,S3thr3y,qwjny9
4,"It was just really unexpected. I didn’t expect what I’m going through to get comparable to a personality disorder. And I feel like a lot of my own biases and stigma that I hold is coming out. I’m a little young to be diagnosed and I don’t feel I personally fit the criteria. So it’s confusing me. We just really talked about my attachment issues and fear of rejection as well as this stress detachment from reality and paranoia. 

Part of me is curious why she’s thinking borderline traits rather than other issues. Im not sure how you determine what it should fall under",S3thr3y,qwjny9
5,Yea intense responses is like one of the main symptoms. Borderlines have very poor emotional regulation and coping mechanisms.,whitedoggal,qwjny9
6,"Well I know it's personal, but if a lot of trauma happened to you in early child hood that's an indication that it could be BPD because that's where most of it stems from. Having to go through trauma at a young age your brain creates a personality that put you into survival mode. So when you have something trigger you as an adult that persona comes to the surface mostly through disassociation or manic moods that only happen for minutes compared to bipolar which can happen over a span of days. It's not the same as full personality disorder. My personal theory is it's your subconscious mind that takes control and the subconscious mind is all about survival and can turn emotions off basically. For me my episodes I become very cold towards people around me and I can be very hurtful with what I say. In the moment I don't care, but the guilt afterwards is horrible and puts me in a hole so to say of depression because I criticize myself for what I did in that moment.",,qwjny9
7,Also I understand your stigma about it. It doesn't mean you're crazy it just means you went through some shit emotionally and/or physically on your past and your brain adapted to protect you.,,qwjny9
8,"Ahhh. But I also have ADHD that comes with rejection sensitive dysphoria, which is an intense reaction to real or perceived rejection. And sometimes if someone is even mad in my presence I’ll get borderline suicidal, which matches up with what I’m experiencing and is often confused with BPD. I wouldn’t necessarily say I have very poor emotional regulation, I don’t express being upset usually. I can keep my emotions down enough that I don’t really have outbursts. So I’m not sure what to do",S3thr3y,qwjny9
9,"I wouldn’t say I have intense trauma, but I do have a history of emotional neglect associated with chronic pain/illness as well as my mom having a mood disorder/hormonal that results in extreme mood swings for a week every month. But I’m never sure if any of it would be enough to end up with the disorder. No one ever hit me and my parents were home and we didn’t have a lot of financial issues. I had food and all that, I just didn’t get my emotional needs met, but sometimes I did. And my mom only yelled sometimes. 

I feel like I’m in survival mode but I don’t think I have any trauma that would warrant it. I do experience dissociation and my psychiatrist believes that my paranoia, detachment from reality, and delusions are stress responses associated with disassociation. I don’t think I get manic, but maybe once a month or so I’ll get into this mental state where I feel like I don’t need to sleep or that I’ll never die, but I’m not excessively happy or hyper or anything. 

I used to do a similar thing. Sometimes I just wouldn’t care or I’d feel hurt and I’d start hurting people around me. I tend to flip flop between hyper empathetic and apathetic. 

But there’s also the chance that it’s just teenage mood swings. I am still young so it’s hard to diagnosis me and a lot of teenagers experience some BPD symptoms to a lesser extent",S3thr3y,qwjny9
10,I just dont know what happened that made me like this. It wasn’t that bad. I feel like I’m just trying to figure out if this matches for me but part of me is in denial that I have any traits,S3thr3y,qwjny9
11,"I can say since you are a teen I'd hold off on medication and express to your therapist you want to learn cognitive therapy. I've recently started it and it's been very helpful along with my bf now telling me that I'm about to have an episode because there are signs before you go into the episode so I've been trying in these moments to separate from him and my daughter. I don't want her to see that side of me. 

Any amount of emotional neglect can warrent survival mode. Your brain is very powerful and everyone handles trauma differently. You can't measure how someone feels since everyone feels differently and reacts to those feelings differently. 

For me my biological mother would leave me locked in a room by myself never checking on me and isolated me until cps came when I was 2 yrs old. Early childhood connections especially to their parents is Important. Being left alone and never showed love or safety causes your stress as a child to rise putting you into survival mode. You stop crying because you realize no one is coming to save you and if you keep crying primally your subconscious knows predators or harm can come so you disassociate from your emotions to survive..... That's my best explanation over txt sorry. It goes much deeper, but your therapist can work with you on how to cope and to find out specifically where it stems from.",,qwjny9
12,"I can say therapists don't throw that diagnosis out lightly. As someone else stated a lot of therapists don't want to work with BPD patients. For the longest time they had no way to treat it so to say. New therapy has been researched, but isn't full proof. I'd trust your therapist as they know more about you than I or the internet does and they look at you non biased where you'll look at yourself biasedly. You won't want to believe it because it's human nature to believe that you are fine. The brain doesn't like to remember trauma and what hurt you so it blocks it from you and Denys it basically. Psychology is very interesting if you plan on college I suggest it lol",,qwjny9
13,"The psychiatrist wanted to give me a low dose of atypical antipsychotics for a little bit but I think I agree that I should hold off on the medication. I have been taking anti depressants and I’m trying out some stimulants for adhd. 

I’ve tried CBT and it wasn’t working out but my psychiatrist suggested DBT and IPT as well as just general psychotherapy and psychodynamic therapy when I’m older. Most of which are centred around just recognizing behaviour and learning to change it in various ways. 

That sounds like a lot for the nervous system. And it makes sense to need that survival technique. None of your emotional needs were met and you had to learn that no one was coming. 

My mom spent a lot of my childhood locked in her room just bawling her eyes out. And they fought a lot. They still do. One time my brother didn’t bring dishes down from his room and she screamed ‘f*ck you’ at us and then tried to kick my dad out. You never know what’s going to set her off. 

My therapist explains it that children can’t emotionally regulate themselves and experience like that kind of taught me that I was a burden for having my own emotions and needed helping. A lot of my childhood contradicted itself. I’d be loved and met with attention one day but the next I’d be criticized or yelled at.",S3thr3y,qwjny9
14,The psychiatrist said that she didn’t even have to write it down because she understands that it’s not ideal at all. And she only knew me for all of three sessions and told me that. I worry my therapist will disagree with it. I went into psychiatry almost excited to figure out what was up because something felt wrong. Just didn’t think it would be this,S3thr3y,qwjny9
15,Yeah my doctor just started me on Wellbutrin 150mg to help the intrusive thoughts. They've gotten worse from me hiding everything. And he said it'll help me get motivated in the last week I left my apartment once because I had to.,,qwjny9
16,Right and doctor's/therapists aren't always right and since you are young your brain is still developing. I'm glad you sought out help now though because it just gets harder as you get older. I hope the meds do help. Those thoughts can be very hurtful. I always say I'm my worst critic. If you're therapist hasn't suggested it I'll say from personal experience find an outlet in drawing or journaling. I do both and an example of journaling my therapist suggested when I was a teenager was to write down the intrusive thoughts and then analyze them. Try to find proof that supports those thoughts and then apply logic from there. It really helped ground me to reality that most of my thoughts were irrational.,,qwjny9
17,"Yeah, I’m getting some rough intrusive thoughts so we are kind of going to see if the stimulants cut the anxiety or if it makes anything worse and then go from there",S3thr3y,qwjny9
18,"I talked to my therapist and she says that she doesn’t agree with the psychiatrist in that regard. Her personal theory is that it’s more likely that my mother has BPD or something similar and I’ve picked up some of the behaviours. 

I have a very hard time believing myself and my own experience so I often rely on other peoples opinions and I’ll hold negative opinions much higher than positive ones. 

Writing down intrusive thoughts could be good, they just hurt quite a bit. It’s hard to get them out when I just don’t even want to think about them",S3thr3y,qwjny9

1,"I (19f) was diagnosed about two years ago. There is a lot of information about BPD that can be terrifying when learning about it. The more you research the more you realize that not every symptom applies to every person and not every scenario is yours. I took a big hit when I was told that long lasting healthy relationships would be difficult or even impossible. I’ve now been in a very healthy relationship for over a year now. The most helpful thing I’ve found is a phrase that can bring my head closer to reality. “I’ve been through this before, I can do it again”. Because even if the lies that BPD tells me seem like reality I know that I’ve lived thousands of days like that and survived every single time. At the bottom of this post I’ll add a link to a website that helped me more fully understand what BPD is. Once you know what you’re dealing with you can find your triggers and self soothing methods easier :) (journaling was also a big help for me, now everyone’s thing though!)

https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder",Younganddumm,z1wmkw
2,"Strain, as a person with BPD (""pwBPD""), you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from an inherited gene and/or childhood abuse) that stunted your emotional development at an early age. I say this because BPD (borderline personality disorder) is believed to be caused by heredity and/or some trauma occurring before age 5.

The result is that, to survive childhood, you likely held on so tightly to the primitive defenses that you would not let go of them long enough to learn some more mature emotional skills. You therefore never had an opportunity to learn the emotional skills needed to control your own emotions -- and never had an opportunity to integrate the good and bad aspects of your personality into a cohesive, stable self-image.

This is why the only proven treatment for BPD is not medication or ""talk therapy."" You cannot learn those missing skills and strengthen your self identity by swallowing a pill -- or by just talking about it. Rather, the treatment proven to be successful is a training program that will teach you those missing skills and teach you how to develop a more integrated, stable self image.

Like learning to play a piano, such training requires years of practice so that the emotional skills become so automatic and natural that they are readily available whenever you need them.

Absent such training, a pwBPD often will experience having very distorted perceptions of his lovedones' intentions. To a lesser extent, everyone occasionally experiences these same distorted views of loved ones. The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings -- and hence the distorted perceptions -- far more frequently than other people. At least, this is my understanding, Stain. I lived with my BPD exW for 15 years.",Up-Town,z1wmkw
3,"Yeah so I was thrown around with diagnoses of depression, anxiety, bipolar t2 for a while because I never knew that even though I had rough patches of emotions, I never really knew what part of me caused the most self sabotage and destruction in my life. I'll explain a bit about myself that I'm obviously ashamed of and working fervently through and have improved so much. I was once married out of college and was never a day had gone by without being with my spouse at the time. I went off to medical school, and she could not follow me due to work. I ended up finding a group of friends and began to feel a bit isolated and alone even though we studied and my spouse at the time would put effort to be there for me through whatever means. I ended up making a friend that would later become my love interest and it ended up shredding my past marriage. We had total issues between us but I will say it ended because of me and I never knew why. Fast forward to rotations at the end of medical school several years later and my girlfriend then and I were doing OK. We had good days for the most part but everything still ate at me so that I was always paranoid of what she was doing, I hated being alone without her, I would have violent mood swings from frustrated and angry to upset to even super crazy submanic events that I never batted an eye at at the time. So my partner and I at the time had a lot of ups and downs during this time but I knew wholeheartedly I still cared for and loved her. But here's where it gets weird. She goes and does rotations and during these feelings of elevated moods or elevated persona like feelings I would meet people. I would start friendships and even what you can call relationships with people. It's disgusting look back on these but I was able to pull off having relations with like 3 women in true relationships without even thinking about it. All the while I was somewhat aware of it and hated it but it was during those intensely elevated emotional days that I wouldn't even think about it. I was also more Inclined to risk taking in other ways, drinking way too much in excess or experimenting with ""pharmaceuticals"". All the while still portraying thos professional persona in clinic to patients. It slowly ate at me and made me feel horrendous during the bad days that I just wanted it all to end and to end all this madness that I started but I just would fall back during times when I would emotionally just flip a switch and not feel guilt at those times. I find myself a very charismatic and decently attentive dude so it was easy to be suave in both the public eye or toward those around me ""in that moment"". All the while I was still sure I cared for the one person I fell for several years back but still proceeded with the shit as basically a different type of me. I basically built several lives with multiple people during my most labile states and would be of lowest lows and just do alcohol or drugs to preoccupy and numb myself on the others days. All the while none of these people had a single clue for over a year. And I don't just mean online or technological relationships. I mean fully dating and talking of futures in person with etc. But even with them I tried to put my best foot forward at all times and still my shitty days would slip through the cracks and it felt bad knowing they cared for someone I truly considered a monster, me. 
It took me to start realizing these higher emotional days are when I was more inclined to destroy myself and the other days were just to cope. It took 2 therapists and a psychiatrist to walk me back from that ledge and open up directly with them all. It took me realigning my entire world and my view on everything and especially my self and relationships to even consider futures with people or caring for anyone again. I was definitely what I consider a monster in those days. I can't defend my actions and I never lied after coming clean to them all. Understandably all hated my guts and the worst part was they even wanted to help me work through it but after the trauma I dealt to them it was not the best course for them and I am still haunted by the destruction and trauma I caused them for blindsiding them with such unexpected news. I was able to open up and be clear with everyone in my life: parents, friends, all. I even changed my number and deleted all socials just so I never have that looming reminder of my past. I gave those close access to track my life through apps just to hold me accountable at least in the interim so there are no worries about me straying from this path. 
 I regularly work my therapists now. One I use exclusively for my mental stability and the other for how to improve on my relationships for me and others. I was on SSRIs in the past and they were only exacerbating things back then. I tried Seroquel but just was sleeping and numb and then I used and kinda like Zyprexa. Don't wanna take meds but I promised people close with me that I would. 
I just think about it this way, look at what you know now. You have a diagnosis. You have an understanding of what is possible or what your mind may try to trick you into believing. Work on being cognizant of yourself and your emotions at all times. It's OK to be having great days and bad days but don't let actions in either of those states devastate your life. Self reflection, journals, breathing exercises, anything to give you self awareness and mindfulness more actively I think can keep you grounded. 
You got this. You are never your diagnosis. You are only you and who you truly wish to be.",docterrrrswoles,z1wmkw
4,"Dialectical Behavior Therapy was better than the other treatment for BPD in 8 studies (source - book by Roemer and Orsillo, Mindfulness- and Acceptance-Based Behavioral Therapies in Practice. ) There is some evidence for Schema Therapy.

6,"u/Broad-Strain-3305 please read my friend Up-Towns complete post history on BPD, it's the best out here. 

Also sign up for DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) designed for BPD folks. Usually this is done as a group therapy once a week but it requires you to have a regular ""main"" therapist. But if you have the resources, you could sign up with a DBT therapist 101 and the group. Talk therapy or CBT doesn't directly impact a BPD's behavior in my experience but it does provide a motivational support system and a sounding board to suggest different techniques if one doesn't work ( also keeps you safe from harm). Also important tip: do not go into the deep end on some other subreddits like BPDLovedones which is a meeting ground for divorced or separated spouses venting out their anger on BPD persons. It sounds like a BPD support group but it isn't. Just stick to this subreddit only.",,z1wmkw

I know a guy who thinks his ex is one or both of those plus a NARC and maybe APD and has ""anxiety"" (I think he thinks SAD and GAD..) and depressed and suicidal...but he also knows NADA about psych....he doesn't even know the criteria of COMMITTING someone against their will...and that the Nurse Practitioner or MD provider have the FINAL say and sometimes COPS can suck because they are crooked and in cahoots with an abuser...",mydadcheatsonmom,rrv92w
2,"Buttercup, these two disorders often occur together. About 30% of bipolar sufferers also have BPD and about 40% of people with BPD (pwBPD) have co-occurring bipolar. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

The distinction between these two disorders is important. Whereas bipolar is caused by a change in body chemistry, BPD is believed to be caused by something occurring before age 5 (heredity and/or a childhood trauma) that prevents the child from acquiring the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions and establish a strong, stable self-identity.  
  
Hence, whereas bipolar sometimes can be treated fairly successfully by swallowing a pill, BPD can only by treated by years of hard work -- in a weekly training program such as DBT or CBT -- to acquire those missing emotional skills and to build a stronger self-image. Like learning to play a piano, learning those skills requires many years of practice and strong commitment.

I describe the major differences in behaviors associated with these two disorders in my list of [12 BPD/Bipolar Differences](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9mj9u8/how_do_bpd_warning_signs_differ_from_those_of/). This list is largely based on my experiences with a pwBPD (my exW) and a bipolar-1 sufferer (my foster son). If this list rings some bells and you have questions, Buttercup, I would be glad to join the other respondents in discussing them with you.",Up-Town,rrv92w
3,"You can have both but BPD, BP and ADHD all present similarly and are often misdiagnosed. It’s very important to have the correct diagnosis as the treatments are very different. 

There is a lot of information about how the 2 differ online that I think will answer your questions, but it’s really important to have a proper diagnosis from a psychiatrist. 

One difference is the mood swings, BPD mood swings are rapid and can change several times in 1 day. BP You’re manic for days-months then deep bottom of the barrel depressed. 

When I am manic I easily function on 1-2 hours a sleep a day, spend ridiculous amounts of money on things that I lose interest in within days, scrub my house from top to bottom. Then days later I can barely get out of bed, my house looks like a bomb blew up and I have been known to not show in days and days.",,rrv92w
4,"I definitely need to take that list and go over it with my therapist and psych. I’ve been diagnosed bipolar-2 for many many years, and some of that list definitely applies to bipolar, but I also have huge abandonment issues and codependent behaviors that seem to favor BPD. I’m glad I have meds and therapy. I think I apply in the co occurring group here and both are going to continue to be necessary probably long term for me, and I’m totally okay with that.

I can give you information about treatments for PTSD. What I cannot do is tell you what your priorities should be, what you should start with. For that you need the help of a professional.  
  
The recovery rate for people who get help for their PTSD is good. However there are stories in which people say that they were re-traumatized by therapy. If at any time you feel that your therapy is making things worse, you can put a stop to it then and there.  
  
If you go to the Amazon ad for The PTSD Sourcebook by Dr. Glenn Schiraldi, you'll see from the reader reviews that people with the disorder really appreciate this book, which says that there's a variety of symptoms associated with PTSD, some of which respond to self-help. For example, there's a simple but effective remedy for recurrent nightmares.  
  
A psychologist named James Pennebaker has written a book on journaling as a treatment for trauma victims, Expressive Writing: Words That Heal. It's based on his clinical research.

1,"A big thing that I deal with, with my bpd is a black and white thinking and a push and pull on relationships.

1. The black and white is simple but hard to cope with. Everything is all bad or all good it's hard to see the middle ground so you can have conflicting thoughts of it being good or bad like them wanting to go out and not go out.

2. The push and pull is a bpd trait that people with the disorder deal with they keep people close the shove them away and try to bring them back because they are afraid of abandonment or loosing people. Also note this thinking isn't always rational and can be an imagined crisis.

0,"Patty, BPD is a spectrum disorder that we all have to some degree. It is a pattern of primitive ego defenses we all use. They become a problem only when our BPD symptoms become so strong and persistent that they undermine our ability to sustain very close LTRs with other adults.

The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because she lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate her own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings far more frequently than other people.  This is why a pwBPD's perception of you is almost entirely dictated by whatever intense fear or other feeling she is experiencing at THIS VERY MOMENT.

1,"The main thing with borderline personality disorder is that I have let my close friends and family know, because with an illness like this, I need a lot of support from others.

2,"I don't think you should hate yourself for having a disorder, as long as you are trying to learn about it or get help for it which it sounds like you are.

It also sounds like you could be suicidal, in which case this post might help: [How to Deal With Suicidal Feelings](https://www.reddit.com/r/MindOverMatterScott/comments/cfej01/how_to_deal_with_suicidal_feelings/)",Sbeast,y07hsn
3,"You're not a bad person. How are you a bad person for having something out of your control? You have a condition that you didn't ask for and don't want, that is highly stigmatised by people who don't know shit about personality disorders or mental health in general.

It's incredibly tough to not internalise all the ableism about bpd, and I think you need to get in touch with services or organisations that specifically support people with bpd. You can ask your therapist to find them for you, and if you can, tell her that she's not helping, you feel she isn't taking you or your worries seriously, that you feel she's being dismissive, and it's making you feel like you don't deserve to live, which is the opposite of what she's supposed to be doing to help you.

If it's possible, you can ask her to find you a different therapist, or an extra one who specialises in treating people with personality disorders, because it sounds as if she's not hearing you, and just telling you that you're overthinking things isn't at all helpful to you.

There are lots of people with bpd who are online. There's probably a bpd subreddit here, and there are groups on Instagram, twitter, Facebook, and there are dedicated mental health websites that will have their own forums where you can find other people to talk to and get support.

Reddit in general is hella ableist. People on this site are ignorant and will label any behaviour that doesn'tfor their very narrow definition of ""normal"" as 'personality disorder', without having the slightest bit of knowledge about what a personality disorder actually is.

All their ignorance, hatred and stigmatising of personality disorders says more about them than it says about you. There will always be people who hear 'personality disorder' and instantly think that everyone with the condition is a cardboard cutout from a horror film, but they're not the people you should be dwelling on, and their shitty, uninformed opinions are not the ones to kill yourself over. 

It sounds like you might need to do a bit of research into your condition, and find and speak to other people with bpd, to help empower you, because at the moment you're paying attention to the wrong people and feeling bad about yourself as a result.

You've internalised their ableism and are now using their erroneous judgements to punish yourself. It's not right and it's not fair. You know yourself best, and you don't have to feel beholden to these nameless, faceless know-nothings to the point you don't want to live anymore. Fuck those people. You don't have to care what they think.",Fearless-Golf-8496,y07hsn
4,"Hey there, I also have BPD and I understand how you feel. There have been countless times where I felt like I acted horribly and to be fair, some of that was certainly true. But another part of it was just my flawed perception of reality. As you know, people with BPD tend to feel things more strongly so while we might do something that hurts others sometimes we might perceive it as a bigger issue than it actually is. 

On top of us, in some cases, like in mine, some people tend to hand manic like episodes and it is especially in those time that I become truly unhinged.

In particular there was an incident that lasted 4 days and happened a year and a half ago which I have trouble talking about because of how messed up it was. However, every time I have the courage to talk about it, I can assure you that people do not perceive me as a monster despite how horrible and stupid I feel like my actions have been. Instead, they support me and try understand me as best as they can. They do not blame me but instead understand that, at that time, I wasn't really me.

Because that is the truth, BPD ISN'T you, it does not reflect your true personality but rather is a disturbance of it. At s certain point you have to recognise that it is not YOU committing those actions but your disorder bringing you to do them. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try not to do those things and try to control it but rather that you shouldn't blame yourself but instead be kind and understanding just like other people are.

Only once you start being kind to yourself can you truly start to get on top of your disorder, trust me. I still get very dark thoughts and still think of ways to get my way which would be, at least, hurtful to the people around me but I've become self aware to the point that I can realise that is not the way I should deal with my feelings and I try to control them. I'm still under the criteria for BPD but at least I'm not hurting anyone anymore. It is still hard on myself internally, but just know you can get better, it takes time and love",DullIntroduction7621,y07hsn

1,"I have struggled with bpd for about 4 years now. Been on a shit load of different drugs including seroquel ( I call it quetiapine as from uk) was on it for about 4 months but was taken off of it due to side effects which where tremors but I am really sensitive to medication, even in tiny amounts. I have a few friends with bpd who have taken it and it has really helped them so it really is different for everyone. Finding helpful medication is somewhat trial and error but 90% of the time it pays off. I have taken other antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabiliser and benzos which have helped in different times to various degrees but for me medication wasn’t the main way forward so I eventually came off all my meds. DBT is the go to course of therapy for bpd and it’s hard to get used too at first but when you stick with it it makes a lot of sense. I’m going through the worst period of my life I’ve experienced at the moment (external factors not mental health related) which have had an impact but it’s incredible how well I’m coping and dealing with everything and honestly that is down to therapy. And tbh it isn’t that difficult if once you accept it’s the best path and even if it doesn’t ‘fix’ everything it will help in ways you won’t comprehend until you can look back. I fought against it for ages but still went to sessions and just did the bare minimum but I eventually realised it helps. You can and will get through this, everything is manageable, no matter how your brain works. You will learn to understand yourself and accept that this is the way you process emotions and that’s totally okay. If you’re anything like me, you might start to get impatient and just want to be better now but trust me when I say it’s worth waiting for. I’m by no means recovered but DBT and medication when I needed it in the past, together got me to a point in life where I can cope on my own in the community without 24/7 watch in hospital. I really hope this helped and I wish you the best of luck with your journey! X",borderlinebaggage,j46ygc

1,"Oh my.....reading this whole thread has made my heart and spine have sadness and chills. 
I am desperately seeking some sort of help with the same situation......I know what must be done. But I just  on the point of breaking as well and I wanted to see who had similar stories. 
And wow.  I have always had the big hunch that my wife has bpd....it has been five years as of this coming week, married and one child. 
Every single solitary day I get belittled, she's always upset at something and or someone. 
I barely speak to my family. She has made me distant with my family.....she's never happy ! 
I have spent so many hard worked hours to try to save money and nothing saved. 
She does not and will not do anything she does not want to do......so the only thing she cares to do is be on her phone, watch tv, and super super super slowly attempt at laundry. But that never gets complete either. 
I come from a fresh style of living. I like organizing,, and this is pure chaos. No organization no compassion just fake love and anger. 
And I'm so upset and tight from this. 
The other night I felt heart pain like never before, and I'm quite healthy.....but the emotional dissonance and punishment has torn me to the core. I need to vent somewhere. So I'm hoping this is heard by one of you. 
I know I need to leave but the circumstances are very intricately put. 
I just want to cry and sleep. 
The up and down emotions every single day and night are totally fucking exhausted. I can't do it anymore.  
I know you have written suggestions on how to escape. I'm not scared of many humans, and I never thought I'd be scared of my wife. But I hate to admit. She terrifies me. My heart rate speeds to fear when I'm close to her because of her swings. 
Oh god please help me.",Chemical-Beginning91,qfwmqt
2,"I was in a verbally, emotionally and psychologically abusive relationship with a woman who had BPD and I dealt with her for 2 years until I couldn’t take it anymore and escaped. I have no regrets except for getting with and staying with her for so long. I didn’t even know what BPD was and I was being gaslit the entire time. My advice would be to leave. Let me tell you that you will never be able to help her. BPDs are impossible to get help for because many don’t want help, don’t think they have a problem and they aren’t reliable on carrying out commitments. 

Even many therapists will not take them because of how exhausting and difficult they are to deal with. As much hate I might get here the best thing you can do is to develop iron in your heart and say goodbye to her. She will be the end of you if you stay. She will destroy you. The psychological scars are real and are tough to heal from. I left my ex 4 years ago and although I have healed, some parts of my brain are still not right and may never be right again.

Please get a doctor level therapist who has a background in BPD and read that  book. That book is available on Amazon Audibles. I listen to it on the way to work and it has helped me make sense of all of this. There are treatment centers and therapy for BPD but if she can’t admit she as a problem really the only thing left to do is to start planning your divorce. Please, please talk to a therapist about this. If you can’t find one I can recommend one. She does phone sessions so it doesn’t matter where in the country you live.",No_Lavishness6896,qfwmqt
4,"Thank you for the support and advice. My therapist tells me the same and I know what you said is true and I’m going to start the divorce process but it is just so difficult to break up a family when we have a child involved. I know it must be done, but it’s not easy.",No_Lavishness6896,qfwmqt
5,"I know. I was there when I had to leave and it felt like a divorce too. It’s not easy and you will deal with lots of pain and fallout due to this person continuing to pull at your heart strings. Be prepared for huge fallout and possibly a violent altercation if you file for divorce directly from them. Consult with a therapist and lawyer but you might have to get yourself and your child to safety. A few things that worked for me that perhaps will work for you too.

1. Self care: This is SO important. Eat well, get your sleep, go out for walks, read books, listen to relaxing music, work on bettering yourself. Take care of yourself physically as well as mentally. You deserve it. Come up with a system/ process for doing so. You will thank yourself later.
2. Therapy: Do not neglect therapy. You have and will continue to go through some of the toughest tests of your life. You need a good therapist who will be in your corner and help you along the way.
3. Have a team: Family, friends, etc. You need these close relationships to help you navigate through all of these tough situations.
4. Read the book I Hate You Don’t Leave Me. This is the Bible for BPD. You will see it for what it is and the people for what they are.
5. Once you’re able to go NO CONTACT with your BPD SO: Obviously consult a therapist on when and how to go about this but this is huge. BPDs are no different than parasites without a host, they wither and die. They are miserable and suffer horribly without a host to leech off of. They will scream, holler, pull at your heart strings, threaten you, guilt trip you, etc. You must be strong and get them out of your life and make sure they never sink their hooks into you ever again.
6. Rely on checklists to manage your life: Dealing with this will take a toll on your mental health and ability to recall information and events. Make a checklist to make sure you‘re doing what you need to do every day. It will get better trust me.

&#x200B;

There is probably more but this is a good starting place. I hope you do well, I wish you all the best, and please follow up with me later on. I don’t wish this even on my worst enemies. I hope this was helpful.",,qfwmqt
6,"Thank you for taking the time to offer some helpful advice. I greatly appreciate it. I just downloaded the  book you recommended on Amazon audibles and I will be listening to it on my way to work.

I have experienced her being a parasite for a very long time and always thought, if I did just this one more thing it would be enough, but it never was.

The second time I was more careful and escaped. She harassed me for months, one of those days she left over 100 calls and over 70 text messages. That does not include emails.",,qfwmqt
0,"First off, you should be very proud of yourself for realizing that what you did wasn’t acceptable, and you got the help you needed. Regardless if your partner was male, female, etc, it’s never okay to verbally or physically abuse them. You knew this and knew this wasn’t who you were, and sorted yourself out. 

For your question, unfortunately it seems this person has only see you without treatment and have possibly met their breaking point. You cannot convince someone to think or do anything. I feel that you are looking at this situation all wrong. Maybe focus on your healing, and then go from there. Mental illness should never be used as an excuse for violence. Everyone has different symptoms. I also don’t want you taking that sentence out of context.

Sounds like your already trying to walk on eggshells around her and coddling her but her habit of breaking up shows that she probably isn’t really willing to commit to making any meaningful changes in her life at this moment to put toward the relationship and your going to be stuck in the same loop chasing and caring for her despite trying to balance your own issues :/,ProbablyNotACrab,18bkr3s

The fact is that no matter how much you care about her. A relationship is only going to work if you manage to both have open communication and put in as much energy into the relationship as the other. Otherwise it just turns into someone being and feeling used. If your broken up and want to get back together; instead of doing all the chasing let her chase you. Let her show you how much you mean to her instead of constantly trying to prove to her how much she means to you.

1,"I'm not a professional but I did take AP Psych. My best guess is that it's because labelling can be very dangerous. When you label yourself or others, it will manifest in itself and you'll most likely live up to the title (self-fulfilling prophecy), which is why you shouldn't put yourself down (if you needed a reason). If you incorrectly diagnose someone, they will most likely convince themselves they have that disorder and it can even worsen their recovery process. Borderline Personality Disorder, like other disorders, can easily be mistaken for other illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and ptsd. Not to mention that each case varies, depending on the person.

1,"The thing about BPD is that there is no medication to treat it because it’s a personality disorder. It’s treated by a type of therapy called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). This type of therapy is usually done in groups and I highly recommend it. It gives you the skill sets you need to help manage the disorder.

BPD can also cause depression however, so your doctor may recommend medication for that. But again, if it’s just BPD and you don’t want to be on meds, I would do some research and find out if there’s any therapists in your area that specialize in DBT. It’s incredibly helpful!

Here’s a link to the DBT workbook, you can work on it yourself although a group is recommended.

1,"The incident you mentioned with him getting arrested, did it involve you? Like was he aggressive towards you, or made you feel threatened (even if it wasn’t intentional on his part?) 

If not than I wouldn’t worry too much.. He’s got a diagnosis, and that’s the first step in getting help, and if you’re his best friend he’s going to need some support from you at some points.. 

Same thing happened with my best friend from high school [He’s male and I’m female] He always had anger issues, mainly with his parents.. I never understood it, his parents were legit the nicest and coolest parents I’d ever met. Both my parents were complete train wrecks, and I would have given anything to have parents even half as cool as his were... He was NEVER aggressive with me, stubborn and childish sometimes but never in a harmful way. As we got older and he started dating other girls I noticed his relationships were always dramatic, and he was very aggressive and irrational with his girlfriends (Not to the point of being abusive, but I wouldn’t have let a guy treat me like that) he got diagnosed with BPD the exact same way as your friend, police were called because of him fighting with his GF and he ended up getting very aggressive with the police.. and they ended up arresting him instead of bringing him to the hospital. They kept him at the police station to be evaluated by a doctor.. When I found out he had BPD a lot of stuff suddenly made sense. Unfortunately knowing what’s wrong is only half the battle. I feel like you are in a very similar situation as I was with him, which is why I feel like he won’t act that way with you, no matter how mad my friend got, and how irrational his thinking was me being his friend helped him.. he would be going insane on his girlfriend for no reason and then turn to me and act completely normal.. as if I was the only one who was able to calm him down in a way. He would listen to me, and trust what I was telling him even if his brain didn’t understand.. Don’t underestimate the power and trust a close friendship can have.. you clearly care about him, and I’m sure he feels the same about you. 

The reason I say he will need you now more than ever is because treating BPD, and any mental illness in general is tricky compared to any other illnesses. Just because a certain combination of meds work for someone, they can have the complete opposite affect on the next person.. Doctors basically play a guessing game and work by trial and error.. It can take a while to find a proper combination of meds and dosage that will work for him specifically, he will get there eventually but he will probably get worse before he gets better... he won’t feel like himself, some meds will make him feel tired, depressed, loose his sex drive, make him hungry, or loose his appetite completely, his moods can be all over the place. This would be discouraging for anyone to go through.. so imagine already struggling mentally to begin with. This is the unfortunate reason that a lot of people with mental illness disorders tend to stop taking the meds they are prescribed, it almost feels worse than the illness.. a lot of the time they stop taking the meds, and get back on, then off again.. which just delays the body from fully adjusting, making it harder to find a good balance and combination. He will need some help with toughing out the rough parts. My friends girlfriend used to call me in the middle of the night so I could convince him to tough it out and stick with the treatment.. It took a bit but he’s really happy I cared enough about him to yell at him to take his meds even if he didn’t want to. He thanked me for sticking with him even if it was hard sometimes, and he says he feels normal for the first time in his life.. 

I wish you luck && strength, and I really hope this helps you. Also if you ever feel like you need to talk to someone don’t hesitate to DM me, I truly understand what your going through!",HighOnSomething_,kuf9q4

2,communication? without triggering them? i have a friend who’s diagnosed with bpd and ive been very careful with my words so that she will not be triggered or think about suicide impulsively whenever she has a problem :/,yourlocalsadgurl,jj1t5i
3,"That's really sweet of you to be so considerate of your friend. BPD is a conplex condition, many people with it aren't even aware of what their triggers are as they can be so subtle. My advice would be to just talk to your friend. Have a very open and honest dialogue with her, don't be afraid to ask her difficult Q's like 'Are you suicidal atm? Do you have a plan?' Being mindful to be validating of her feelings is a huge thing. Lots of people with BPD have a history of not having their feelings validated. 
Also, if you feel you can commit to being supportive, do, but don't make promises you can't keep. 

Other than that, I think just being honest with your friend is good enough. Explain to them that you're willing to discuss anything with them, but they need to be as mindful as you that you are both only human and you may at times say the wrong thing. 

Being friends with someone with BPD shouldn't leave you feeling like you're walking on eggshells when you're with them. People with BPD often struggle to control their emotions, but ultimately, they are in control of their actions, and should take responsibility for them. 

Hope that all helps.",Few-Director-3357,jj1t5i

2,"**It's so hard for me to look within and identify what I'm feeling.**

ByFire, yes, it is very difficult to look within and figure out what you're feeling when experiencing very intense feelings. As you know, people with BPD (pwBPD) frequently experience very strong feelings until they have completed training to learn the emotional skills needed to better control their own emotions.

To a lesser extent, everyone has to deal with this same problem. The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations.

Whenever we are very angry or scared, our corpus collosum shuts down, blocking communication with our frontal cortex. This forces us to fully rely on our amygdala, which performs a primary role in the processing of emotional responses, memory, and decision making.

Simply stated, we have instantly switched from relying on the logical ""adult"" part of our minds to relying on the emotional ""child"" part of our minds. In this way, our brains are hardwired to instantly switch to black-white thinking whenever we are suddenly startled or experience intense feelings.

The beauty of B-W thinking is that it is incredibly fast and thus likely has saved your life many times. For example, when you are in a crosswalk and suddenly look up to see a truck bearing down on you, your mind is capable of thinking only ""jump left"" or ""jump right."" B-W thinking nonetheless produces disastrous results when used to understand the intentions and motivations of other people, particularly when you're in a close relationship.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. And this is why, when we are very infatuated or in love, we try to wait at least two years before buying the ring. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently and intensely because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions.",Up-Town,t8f5wy

1,"I have felt more or less the same for a little over a year now...and I've been out of college for almost six years. There are a lot of reasons why I think I've been stuck in this cycle, but you're definitely not the only one who knows what they need to do and can't ever seem to just get up and do it.

The worst part is how it feels like a self-sustaining cycle. I know what I need to do, I can never make myself do it, I start beating myself up over it, I stay sedentary even more, rinse and repeat. But sometimes, just knowing you're trying is far more important than anyone realizes. Even if others claim otherwise, as long as YOU know you're trying that's what's important. Just keep at it, chip away at everything however quickly or slowly you need to, and never forget that the light at the end of the tunnel is that much closer for it. :3",MagicHat42,mor5yu

3,"Start making small goals to accomplish every day. Clean something up, read a chapter for class, go for a walk. Feel proud of yourself when you do them. Build up slowly.

4,"Just start, don't let yourself think about it too much and force yourself to do it. That's my tactic, and it's the only one that's properly got me to do something I wanted done, but didn't feel like doing. 

Also, make regular exercise an absolute priority. It'll make you happier and things will come 10x easier, I promise.

As someone who's had depression + suicidality I've been in a similar pit before, and the only way out is to climb upwards, as tiring as it may feel in the moment. Otherwise you just sink deeper.

That's my advice, anyways. I really hope you get better and it gets easier to be caring towards yourself. It's a tough fight, but know you're not alone, and once you make it out you love life like never before :))",,mor5yu

2,"definitely mention it. they may offer you DBT therapy which supposedly does wonders for BPD and illnesses similar to it. also i've seen a lot of people with BPD feel the same way about the ""what if i'm just making it up"" concern so you definitely aren't alone with that feeling. If you do get diagnosed, you might not believe it, but it will make sense eventually and you will be able to move forward from there. if you don't get diagnosed, it could definitely be the PTSD causing a lot of the symptoms. either way, it won't hurt to mention your concern of BPD, although a lot of psyhiatrists like to wait a while before making certain diagnoses because they want to get a better understanding first, so he might not diagnose immediately.  best wishes \*edit\* forgot to mention: if you aren't satisfied with your psychiatrist after a while or feel like they aren't understanding you even after you explained your concerns, remember that there's a lot of other doctors out there!! it won't be the end of the road",void333111,jbf4hz
3,"I have BPD and I frequently wonder if I legit do have it, or not, due to how I was diagnosed. I was inpatient, my first admission, and I remember saying to the Consultant, the psycotherapist and the nurses, over and over that I really felt I had BPD. In the end, they didn't actually tell me I'd been formally diagnosed until I was discharged. I always look back now and wonder if I bullied/manipulated everyone into diagnosing me, or if they really do think I have it. Not truly believing you have it at times is a really common feeling with BPD though. Because your ability to regulate your emotions is impaired, you can feel one way one minute, and then feel/be thinking completely different the next, and so on. 
I think it is definitely worth mentioning to your psych though. Like someone else said, they are the professional. If you feel the symptoms on BPD help you accurately express how you feel, it is up to the professional to consider the evidence and diagnose appropriately. With BPD as well, you need a minimum of 5 of the 9 main symptoms for a diagnosis. 
If they do diagnose you, have a good look at the different therapies available. DBT is the main one, but it's only really helpful if you self harm and things. I'm currently having Mentalisation Based Therapy (MBT) and although it is definitely hard work, it's proving worthwhile.",Few-Director-3357,jbf4hz

I can’t use my parents because they are a contributing factor to my mental health issues. 

One of the major things that you will do in DBT (honestly I think everyone can benefit from it, not just DBT students) is diary cards, or documenting your ups and downs. It seems stupid but honestly it’s so helpful. You are able to track what biological and external factors and how they affect your mental health. I cannot stress how important the diary cards are.

0,"It means your emotions are more intense and longer lasting than those of neurotypicals. You have an excessive tendency to fear rejection and abandonment and this fear can dominate your life if you allow it to - so don't. You are in charge of yourself. You are the only one who chooses how you react to your emotions. It is in your power to react to emotions constructively or destructively. It is important first and foremost to pay close attention to yourself, to your mind.

Watch your mind like a hawk. Stand like a TSA agent at the gateway of your mind. Check everything that goes in and everything that comes out. Find out why you do every single thing you do, why you believe what you believe, why you want what you want. This takes time and diligent effort but the insights you will gain will be worth it a zillion times over.

You must learn how to stop yourself from saying hurtful things to other people no matter how strongly triggered you are. You must *never* blame another person for your pain. You must refrain at all costs from taking on the self-image of ""the victim"" for this will destroy relationships faster than anything. No one is responsible for how you feel but you. No one can change your self-esteem but you. No one can make you feel like shit or like god.

You cannot control your emotions once triggered but you do have a lot of options about how to react to these emotions. You can give them more energy until they're so powerful they overwhelm you or you can give them so little energy that they wither away in a short time. All this takes practice but all can be done if one is sincere and persistent. Do not suppress your emotions and try to avoid feeling them. No matter how much they may hurt, do not run away from them. Instead, look at them like a detective solving a crime. Where do these emotions come from? Why do they trigger you in this way? Investigate them. Never ever take them for granted and assume their strength and tenacity mean they are appropriate. Emotions can lie and confuse. Be very very careful about how you react to them. If you do, you can turn them around and make positive use of your hypersensitivity. 

You must learn to observe your mind at all times. You must also learn to read other people. What are they feeling? How are they responding to you or to circumstances? All people need affirmation. If you make people feel bad about themselves, they will not want to be around you. It's as simple as that. Do your best not to make anyone feel bad when you feel bad and make sure you don't make them feel bad about themselves or blame themselves for your pain or your problems. You are the only one in charge of your mind. Only you can cause yourself to suffer; no one else. Only you can become enlightened, aware and free to use your intelligence without it being influenced or distorted by your conditioning. (Enlightenment means knowing the true nature of the self and of phenomena. Buddhism can be very helpful as a means of attaining insights into the nature of the essential ""I"" that, unlike the brain, cannot be conditioned. Look into it. Marsha Linehan invented DBT based on her Buddhist meditation practice.)

Learn all the social skills you can and make learning these into an ongoing, lifelong study. Educate yourself. Information will be your greatest weapon against pain, confusion and frustration. Know what to expect of yourself and others. Question yourself when you think you are 100% sure about something. Never allow yourself 100% certainty because that's not how things work in this universe. Never allow yourself to simplify a situation until it looks all good or all bad. Black and white thinking is not accurate; it is a mistake. Do not ever believe than any person is either all bad or all good. Good deeds don't negate bad ones and bad deeds can't negate good ones. Learn that all people have both good and bad traits including yourself. Try to view things as accurately as possible at all times, especially your own mind.

Learn that you are responsible for your mind and your own mental turmoil. You must learn how to deal with your emotions skillfully, quickly and effectively. Marsha Linehan and DBT training is *very* helpful. Master DBT and then master it again and again. DBT has great tips for *all* of us not just those with BPD.

Tread lightly. Look for happiness in small things. Be gentle to yourself and to others. You will never regret being gentle and tentative rather than forceful and brash. Whenever pain arises, take it as a warning that you may be making a mistake. Don't trust emotions to be accurate. They never are. They cannot ever be trusted. Use cognition every time strong emotions try to take over. An emotion should never be allowed at the steering wheel. Be on the alert for rouge emotions and keep them in their place at all times like a boss.

Don't allow yourself to explode and rage and yell and insult other people. Don't attack anyone no matter what your emotions tell you they deserve. Sit quietly and investigate when emotional problems arise. Investigate each one very carefully, just like a scientist. Where did this emotion come from? Why is it here? Is it legit or not? Don't lash out at yourself or others. There's no point to it. It NEVER helps to be mean and self-hate is a complete waste of time. Nip it in the bud before it grows into a monster. When you are in pain, you must be gentle to avoid creating more pain for yourself and for others. Be very careful about how you create and reinvent your self-image. Be very humble and always ready to admit your mistakes with utter sincerity - especially to yourself.

Don't let your self-image become that of a helpless victim. This is a critical point. If you allow yourself to view yourself as a victim, this mistake will cripple you and destroy relationships. Cultivate self-restraint at all times like an Olympic athelete cultivates the skills required by their sport. Slow down when problems arise. Never panic. If something isn't urgent, don't treat it as if it were to motivate yourself. Never use negative reinforcement on yourself. Treat yourself like a very sensitive, very intelligent animal you need to protect and love and care for.

Never think ""I am the victim of so-and-so"". Never think ""so-and-so hurt me"" or ""so-and-so is responsible for how bad I feel and the terrible things I've said and done because so-and-so made me feel bad."" These are lies your troll brain will pull out often during life. There is a small, persistent, petty and misguided part of us that seeks to blame others for our troubles. You must never feed it. You *must* own your own mind and all that it puts forth - there is no other option.

Fear will be your greatest obstacle. It is that way for all of us. Fear will preclude love, creativity and understanding. If fear becomes a problem for you, look into it with scientific precision. Don't just look into the fear of this or the fear of that; look into fear itself. Look deeply and then more deeply. What is fear? Where does fear come from? Why does fear arise? Can fear be trusted? Is it beneficial? Does it have a role in your life or not? Whatever else you do, pay special attention to fear whenever it pops up, and always be its master- not the other way around. If fear is allowed to guide the course of your life, it will bring only more fear; not security.

Do not make self-concern your entire preoccupation in life. Do not worry about your own security - either psychological or physical - above all other things. Don't turn your desire for security into a prison from which you cannot escape. Don't allow *worrying about yourself* to dominate your life. Whenever you feel fear about your own personal security, stop and find out whether or not it is legit. Look around yourself objectively, like a zebra scenting a predator. Are you in real danger? Are you facing a life or death situation or not? Your emotions will tend to be too strong, too overpowering and so you must not trust them or allow them to overpower your intelligence. Do *not* let fear for your own safety to be your guide. Don't trust it. Don't give into its demands or it will destroy your ability to enjoy life. Understand that love and fear cannot coexist in one mind. Choose love.

Don't demand that love come to you from outside of you. Never think that you can fulfill your need for love by seeking it outside of yourself. Those who seek love from outside will *never* find it. *If you want more love, you must love more.* There is no other way. Love always comes from within you even when you think it is coming from another person. Love is not a thing that can be asked for or held onto. If you try to grasp it, you will kill it for it is alive. All those who seek love outside of themselves will only find frustration, loneliness and sorrow. When you yourself are full of love, you will not worry about whether or not you are loved by any others. Love is a type of activity. It cannot be stored up and used later. Love is always new. Love isn't an object that anyone can posses. It is not like money in the bank. It is, rather, a way of relating to what's around you. It comes from within you. Always.

Cultivate the ability to endure pain without giving rise to the slightest bit of aggression. This is of immense value. If pain, emotional or physical, causes you to lash out and become aggressive, you will suffer even more pain and so will all those around you. If you forget everything else, at least remember this: You must learn to endure pain without giving rise to the slightest aggression. It's worth saying twice or even more. If you master this skill, your life will be easier and happier. You will have better relationships and fewer problems and conflicts. If pain makes you attack and say or do hurtful things, this unskillful behavior will lead to more pain. Once this fact is understood, you will be able to stop yourself with a simple reminder: ""I want LESS pain. I will not do anything that might lead to MORE pain.""

No one is simply a disorder. We are all people who have disorders. The vast majority of our disorders are NOT our fault. We live in very difficult times. Our society is harsh, cruel, misguided, unpredictable, selfish, primitive, confused, violent, merciless, twisted and destructive. This is obvious. When a person is forced to grow up in a sick and coercive culture, disorders are the consequence. I have a theory that these days, almost all of us humans are insane or terribly crippled because our culture is profoundly sick. We must learn how to be appropriate without the guidance of mainstream sources.

Here are a few sources, besides Marsha Linehan, you will find helpful: YouTube videos or articles about the causes of mental illness in our time by Bruce Levine, Gabor Mate and Bruce Alexander. These will point you to others. Humans who have influenced me most recently include J. Krishnamurti - who describes very accurately what freedom is and how to have it. He also has profound insight into the nature of fear, love, interpersonal conflict and all the rest of the problems we humans face. Jacque Fresco is an engineer who is also a genius and a visionary. His recent Venus Project fundraising campaign was very successful. His ideas about how humans might organize themselves and relate to one another differently are incredibly inspiring. Watch the short documentary called *Paradise or Oblivion* on YouTube and see for yourself. Fresco pinpoints why our current way of life is making us sick, hurt and desperately lonely. Another smart guy is Slavoj Zizek though I only recently discovered him. He understands that our culture must be transformed if our species is to survive. He tends to be a tad too academic and philosophical for my tastes, but he's got a very good brain and gems can come from his mouth at times. He also ha a great deal of strength and self-assurance which are admirable.

4,"To reiterate what someone else said, be careful about what you read. A lot of people, including therapists, seem to think of BPD as a kiss of death. However:

I just bought a book for my fiance called ""Loving Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder"" by Shari Manning. And of course, I started reading it before he even got a chance. And it shocked me. Because this author doesn't behave like so many other authors and tell readers to run like hell away from anyone with BPD. She... she actually loves people with BPD. She thinks we're beautiful, despite our chaos. And holy shit, this is the first thing I've read that doesn't make me feel like a monster.

So, I'd highly recommend the purchase. Even if it's just for you. It doesn't matter that the book is directed at those on the outside looking in. The author is also super into DBT, which is pretty much saving my life right now. =)",SheistheLorax,1uob43

I find myself friendless, tired, coming out of a very tough back surgery that I think I may have overinflated to justify my need to curl up in a ball and hide. I'm injured: pity me. I came online to try to find a therapist in my area who could help me overcome my lack of social skill and this miasma of loathig and blame that I live in. I have wondered for many years what this was, why I can't find friends, why I feel so strongly that it overwhelms my common sense, why I piss people I look up to off, and strangers think I am an asshole so often.

One thing that I would like to add is that I took the time for extramural group therapy when I was diagnosed at 19. This more than anything else gave me the handles I needed to cope. Not only did I learn the very things you describe, the need to be introspective and place blocks between emotion and action but the recognition I found in other peoples experiences with the same thing also helped a great deal. It allows you to observe your own behaviour as expressed by another person, which grants an entirely new perspective on yourself. Another very important thing was realising that I was not wrong in a unique way, there were other people like me who had the same difficulties and we were all in it together.

I think that more than anything else my therapy helped me realise a semi-normal life where I can function in society and I can really reccommend it to anyone with BPD.

Self-acceptance is also important. I am an emotional man and always will be. All I can do is make sure I get upset about the right things and not something unconstructive or irrelevant.",Merari01,1uob43

7,"Honestly it depends on her. I’m usually the bill stressing person and very black and white. BPD doesn’t make everyone with its personality the same. I would assume she is a runner from hard to deal with things where as I’m the opposite and then the stress makes me act out in usually not so good ways like driving crazy or drinking or losing my shit for a couple of days. 

If she is the running type you should try and approach it gently and explain that it’s important but not a big deal  and you are there to help take care of it/support her. Do what you know soothes her. Coming at her hard and in a defensive way will just frighten her. Also I find that sometimes calmly side barring the discussion and letting it cool down before addressing it again helps because it gives you time to think. If she is anything like me maybe having to make decisions RIGHT THAT MINUTE freaks her out. Giving her some time may help? Ultimately you know her best. 

Oh and remember that when she does lash out (not saying it is ok because you can control it once you learn how) don’t take it personally because it isn’t. It’s her coping mechanism. What people don’t understand is that not all trauma has to be horrific to make someone have this illness. It tends to be PTSD based so if you know what triggers her or what caused the disorder in the first place, you can figure out what to avoid. For instance, I grew up with very abusive parents who would physically and mentally hurt me and was molested by a family member as a child and repressed the memory until I was 25. If someone comes at me in a passive aggressive way, attacks my intelligence, or stands in a defensive and aggressive way and is taller than me I lose all of my control.

I would even consider online counseling (I’ve heard BetterHelp is actually fantastic from a friend who currently uses it for depression). Whatever you do, keep the conversation open and non threatening. She’s not a child, she doesn’t need to be punished or reprimanded. She knows what she’s doing is wrong that’s why she’s hiding it, but she obviously doesn’t see another option to cope. Try finding healthier escapes for her, or even things you can do together.

It is important to get all the symptoms in order to have a better picture, but in short you are going through mood swings, severe by the looks of them. Most importantly here is to rule out the ""great"" duo, them being Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Do you take any meds? any drugs( serious question), do you gradually spiral or plummet. The main thing here is to do everything possible to avoid misdiagnoses. If you start treating those 2 above with what they would regularly treat MDD with you are in for a very bad experience. Also , describe ""good"" mood. Like just overall sense of stability, or you are becoming euphoric? has anybody ever mentioned that you sometimes act differently even   if everything seems fine? Are you impulsive? What helps you to ease the symptoms? if you want you can pm all of that if you dont wanna post. Good luck!",ponodmitry,udprl0

The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
   
   
Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down, also a safe hotline. No one will bother you if you call.

1,"100% agree. I often come across mental health professionals who judge and stigmatize people who seem to have borderline traits, it is very disappointing. The complex of behaviors that come together to make up a BPD diagnosis are learned for survival in a disorganized and traumatizing childhood, these lead to difficulty in regulating emotional states and taking drastic measures to try to do so. I think it is so harmful to further stigmatize people who are essentially reexperiencing their attachment trauma when professional providers reject them for trying to cope with rejection in the only, albeit off-putting, ways they know how. 

Important to note that trauma can even reflect something like chronic invalidation of someones lived experience. For example, trans folk can show BPD traits often because of this constant reminder from parents, the world, etc that their experience is “wrong”. In effect, being gaslit and abused by caretakers leads to an inability to know and regulate your internal state, and sometimes this leads to BPD.",pathological_lyre,se3ygg

1,"Hey I just wanted to send some words of encouragement. I did a year and a half of intensive DBT and it changed my life for the better. I was given a sort of unofficial juvenile diagnosis at 15, after being identified as being very at-risk, and did 5 hours of DBT (individual and group) each week. Diagnosis was confirmed when I was 18. At 22 now, I’ve been using DBT skills and mindsets for several more years and all the psychiatrists I’ve seen since have said they can’t technically give me the diagnosis because I no longer qualify! They say it sticks with you forever, but it’s possible to get to a place where the symptoms don’t interfere with your life NEARLY as badly. 

So my advice to you is, take the DBT very seriously. It sounds like BS at first, a lot of it does anyway. But it really truly works if you break down your exact thought and emotion processes and follow the steps they give you to handle different situations. It becomes more natural and automatic to use these skills as time goes on. Think of it like a “how to be a person” class. It’s a matter of relearning reactions/responses, and thought processes. It’s hard, it’s intense, but it seriously works wonders.",mackeyart,qcp8zo

1,"**I’ve developed very unique ‘personalities’ that awaken based on the type of people I’m with.**

Dev, you actually have only one personality. Yet, if you are a person with strong and persistent BPD traits (a ""pwBPD""), you never had an opportunity in early childhood to develop a strong and stable self image. That is, you never had a chance to fully integrate the good and bad aspects of your personality into a cohesive, integrated self identity.

This is why you probably never realized that you are an essentially good boy who sometimes exhibits bad behavior. Instead, you likely still alternate between thinking of yourself as ""all good"" or ""all bad."" This is why you likely sometimes experience a period of self loathing or very low esteem. And this is why you likely sometimes get the feeling that you don't know who you are.

This lack of a strong, stable self image is a hallmark of being a pwBPD.  The result is that you quickly learned to mirror the strong personalities of people you interact with.  Significantly, you don't do this to deceive or manipulate them.

Rather, you do it to fit in, to be accepted, and to be loved. When you're in an intimate relationship, you also will do the mirroring as a way of being grounded and provided with a sense of direction.

Although there are many disadvantages of not having a strong, stable self image, there are some advantages too. One is your ability to move effortlessly among a wide diversity of groups of people. For example, you likely will find yourself being just as comfortable interacting with a group of bikers as with a group of attorneys or engineers. This, at least, is my understanding, Dev.",Up-Town,lkjyzg
2,"Damn, that is enlightening, thanks. Mind me asking what experience you have regarding the matter?",DevDunMan,lkjyzg
3,"Dev, I was married to a pwBPD for 15 years, during which time I took her to 6 different psychologists for weekly therapy -- and to a psychiatrist for meds and to 3 MCs. I also have a foster son who suffers from bipolar-1.",Up-Town,lkjyzg
4,"That is a respectable amount of experience. Hope me asking didn’t offend you, I was just curious",DevDunMan,lkjyzg
5,"**My Psych. said I fit the bill at least 80% for having BPD.**

Dev, as your psych indicated, BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either *""has""* or *""doesn't have.""* Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means every adult on the planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).

At issue, then, is not whether you exhibit BPD traits. Of course you do. We all do. Rather, at issue is whether you exhibit those traits at a strong level (i.e., are on the upper end of the BPD spectrum).  BPD traits are primitive ego defenses that we all have to ensure our survival, particularly during childhood. 

They become a problem only when they are so strong that they undermine our efforts to sustain close LTRs with other adults. How serious the problem is depends not only on how strong our BPD traits are but also on whether they are *persistent*, i.e., constitute a full lifetime problem. 

Black-white thinking, for example, is one of these primitive defenses. Our brains are hardwired to instantly switch to B-W thinking whenever we are startled or experience intense fears or feelings.

The beauty of B-W thinking is that it is incredibly fast and thus may save your life. For example, when you are in a crosswalk and suddenly look up to see a truck bearing down on you, your mind is capable of thinking only ""jump left"" or ""jump right.""

B-W thinking nonetheless produces disastrous results when used to understand the intentions and motivations of other people, particularly when you're in a close relationship. These primitive defenses thus become a problem when our BPD symptoms are so strong and persistent that they undermine our ability to sustain very close LTRs with other adults.

Moreover, the human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings -- and hence the distorted perceptions of his loved ones -- far more frequently than other people.

If you suffer from strong BPD traits, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or your environment) that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills. Most major cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach you the emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions. 

They can teach you how to do self soothing; how to regulate your own emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

They also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's personality is essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.",Up-Town,lkjyzg

Here is an article discussing what I mean.  I am currently working with the VA now since I suffered a head injury from being attacked from behind when I served.  I had two seizures a few months down the road.  We are not thinking there is a link to that and my ADHD, GAD, Bipolar, BPD, MDD and PTSD.

My entire neck and back muscles are so tight that it literally gave me flat neck.  When going to physical therapy, they just can't seem to get my next and back muscles to relax from the therapy.    This in turn limited my range of motion in my neck and shoulders.  On top of tinnitus, ear fullness, barely any gag reflex and a host of other issues that are connected to people with head trauma.  Such at degenerative disc disease and my spine has a c-curve as well from the tension of my back muscles manipulating my spine.

There are people who will go their entire life on meds who never get better.  Then there are those who discover its all from a spinal injury.  They go on traction or have surgery and then its like they are a different person and no longer need medication.

1,"Yeah sorry. I probably didn’t do well describing it. 

I have pretty bad agoraphobia, panic, gad, and ocd. Ive lived on my own before but that was during college and i didnt feel so isolated. 

I got my first full time job out of school in 2018 but only lasted 3 weeks cause thats when my agoraphobia was real bad. I was pretty much housebound after that for a while. I started getting better after about a year. Got a part time job i worked for a while. Then i felt it was time to start putting my resume out again even though i didnt think i was ready. But i needed to make more money. 

I put my resume out there and surprisingly got hired. The job is like 1.5 hours from my parents home where ive been “comfortable” with my agoraphobia. Now, Im committing all sorts of money to move over near the job as ive been using airbnb during the work week to get through my first 2 weeks. 

So my issue is with a few things: the new job and the fact its full time. I dont feel i can take the time off I need because then im screwing an already understaffed department. But my mental health could care less how badly i need to make it into the office. Im having constant panic and dread. Im so depressed cause my work feels meaningless and not at all what I expected based on my studies. 

Its also with committing money to an expensive apartment (which is still my cheapest option in the area because i need a month to month lease due my instability) when im not even sure ill make it through the next two weeks of work let alone next several months to keep up with rent (its a month to month lease but you need to give 30 days notice effectively making it a two month lease. Rent will be well over 1,000). 

And last of all, its the job itself. I have a lot of busy work that i guess is typical of people in their first job in this field. But it feels like i wont make it long enough to actually practice what i studied. The anxiety just eats me alive and every weekend I feel it build because im afraid im not progressing fast enough, or that if my anxiety builds up enough itll knock me out and ill give up. 

In addition im dealing with really bad loneliness. I already only had a few friends nearby along with my parents who are a good support system for me, but over on the other side of town there aren’t many things to do or people to meet that i feel ill share commonalities with. Its just a different world i cant explain it. And i know noone over there, and my friends in the metropolitan area i live in i hardly saw anyways, but living even further away i cant imagine theyd drive over to see me as ive always been the one who has to make the effort (cause they have kids, are too busy, have lots of other friends than me etc). 

Does that clarify a bit? I can give more details if needed. Im just feeling so shit right now my brain is scrambled",getfuckedrogerstone,f5gbql
2,"Thanks for clarifying.  It sounds like you have a lot going on right now.  You know that saying ""One day at a time""?  It sounds like that might be really helpful for you right now, because it sounds like a lot of your worries are coming from what 'might happen', and I expect that really adds to your anxiety. Kind of like ""fortune telling"" thinking (read about it here---https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/f2usch/info_on_how_to_recognize_selfdefeating_thoughts/

I get that it is probably very overwhelming, worrying about how your job is going to go, considering you aren't enjoying it right now, and the fact that you are moving and have the whole lease issue to deal with.  Then add on top feeling lonely and isolated from friends and family. It's a lot to have to handle all at once, even more so when you have depression/anxiety going on.

Do you have a doctor and/or therapist/counsellor that you see?  If you do, maybe a good idea would be to check in with them, and have you come up with a reasonable plan of action to deal with the anxiety and coping with your new job and moving.  If not, maybe it's time to look into seeing someone.  I am wondering if it would be more helpful if you broke down all these stressors into smaller, manageable pieces, so you don't feel so overwhelmed.  (Like the one day at a time idea, even 'one thing at a time').  For example, just focus on going to your job each day.  Try to focus on one day, and just what can you do (anxiety and depression wise) to focus on getting through that day.  Do you use relaxation techniques?  Do you work on getting rid of intrusive thoughts(if you have that)?  Do use distraction techniques?  Focus on doing things that get you through the day.  
Then when it comes to your new place you are moving to, just try to focus on living there each day.  Don't project into what might happen in the future.  Just get through one day.  

Here are some articles/suggestions of things I just mentioned above, maybe they can help a little------

If you are having negative and/or intrusive thoughts there is something that is called the S T O P technique that might help. (it is something that takes practise to work, it doesn't help just doing it once or twice)---

Relaxation techniques. They can be helpful to get us through those challenging moments in our day. There a few I can list here for you (I prefer # 2 & 3; it does take practise, one or two times won't do much)----------

1. Breath focus. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations. Breath focus can be especially helpful for people with eating disorders to help them focus on their bodies in a more positive way. However, this technique may not be appropriate for those with health problems that make breathing difficult, such as respiratory ailments or heart failure.

2. Body scan. This technique blends breath focus with progressive muscle relaxation. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. A body scan can help boost your awareness of the mind-body connection. If you have had a recent surgery that affects your body image or other difficulties with body image, this technique may be less helpful for you. https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400

3. Guided imagery. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes—just make sure to choose imagery you find soothing and that has personal significance. Guided imagery may help you reinforce a positive vision of yourself, but it can be difficult for those who have intrusive thoughts or find it hard to conjure up mental images.

4. Mindfulness meditation. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future. This form of meditation has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years. Research suggests it may be helpful for people with anxiety, depression, and pain.

using distraction techniques (also called self-soothing) can be helpful. Here is a pre-made list of ideas I have to try and distract from thoughts/feelings, and to self-soothe. Maybe a few things on this are things you could do (I find having a list ready to go helps more, because if you are having a hard time, it can be too hard to think of things you like to do, so have the list ready to go for when you need to distract from thoughts)-------

Self-Soothing Ideas (and Distraction Ideas)----------

go for a walk (pay attention to the sights/smells/sounds/the environment; to get out of your head)

listen to music/songs you like eg: water sounds/thunder & lightening storms/etc

go for a drive

go to your local coffee shop for your favourite hot drink

go to a park (play on the swings, it's fun)

1,"I have borderline and sadly I won’t be able to tell you when or what triggers it’s polarizing emotional impact on you given it’s different for everyone.truly it’s any event that brings you uncomfortable emotions that strike deeper regarding childhood. Emotional reactions are intense as a self defense mechanism learned by your needs only ever being met by having to get emotional. Primarily in childhood as well, i don’t blame you for being at your wits end that’s all this ever feels like. So mentally exhausting feeling like your emotions have more control over your mind than you consciously do. Very tiring but hang in there, mindfulness can be an extremely beneficial practice. Let all your senses be the only thing your mind experiences, like a level of dissociation but instead focusing purely on sensory feelings. I’m glad you learned to be comfortable alone, loneliness still impacts me. I hope things get better for you and I understand how non-sensical trying to rationalize emotions that inherently aren’t can be.",,ociilx
2,"Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is supposed to help. If you could find a DBT group therapy in town, it might also help you find social support. The counseling students at our local college run one in my town.",MegSaysHey,ociilx
3,"i’ve actually attended a DBT workshop recently, sadly i dont use the skills even though it’s at the back of my head, i will usually give these tips to my friends instead. and i would agree with it being a childhood issue because my motto was to always give my friends happiness even it sacrifices my own. 

thing is, i’ve never been okay to be alone as i have a twin. and i guess it’s some sort of twin connection that could have trigger that, i have abandonment issues when it comes to this. my therapist brought it up w me that i’m unintentionally trying to be “okay” being alone. because i guess in a way it’s better for the people i’m surrounded with. 

i’m really grateful for ur input, but i somewhat feel like i’m not in control of my mental health and it’s affecting me in every way.. really hope things will get better in my head. i guess when we hit rock bottom, the only other way is up haha!",jaibakoo,ociilx
4,"sadly in singapore where im from therapy is expensive and not subsidized, hence when i went for my DBT session it was crammed into 3-4 months! i’ve learnt quite alot from there but applying the skills have been difficult for me in times of crisis",jaibakoo,ociilx
5,"DBT is what taught me mindfulness but a level of that self sabotage will even sabotage the method you use for coping because it’s so extreme, it’s like i have control over my mental health but i’m out of control with what i do with it. I can barely practice anything taught to me just out of a lack of willpower but I have no clue probably just self sabotage as well.",,ociilx

1,"Absolutely NOT and that goes for any mental disorder. Isolation is considered a form of torture even for incarcerated violent felons. Even in extreme situations mental health isolation is very temporary -- minutes to hours at the very most -- to restabilize the person so that they are no longer an imminent harm to self or others. Even in federal prison isolation is often considered cruel and unusual punishment. Six months is not normal. 

IF she has borderline pd or any other attachment disorder and is isolated additionally from her support system the torture aspect is even worse. Her husband should press criminal charges if she has committed a crime. If she has not, he has no legal or human right to deprive her of basic human rights, nor do the captors more aptly named than ""treatment providers"".

This is a crime against humanity. Please find a lawyer as soon as possible to help save your friend's life.",NatashaSpeaks,qg7ku5

0,"Hey, Hi, Hello!

I am a mental health therapist and was wondering if you had ever considered Dialectical Behavior Therapy? It’s specifically for individuals with Borderline, and many people benefit not only for the therapy but also meeting others who are battling the same thing. 

I’m sorry that you have to endure this hardship. I can tell that these thoughts and feelings of loneliness and abandonment are affecting you deeply. 

Keeping you in my thoughts and rooting for you! You can overcome this.",Kelz0b,92r1da

2,"I resonate with this post as someone who does something similar. In undergrad, I had two best friends and the three of us were a really tight-knit trio. But my BPD always convinced me that they like each other more than they like me. I would get ridiculously jealous and convince myself I’m just “dead weight” and eventually they’ll never want to see me again, and I would bottle up these thoughts until I took it out on them and on myself in various unhealthy ways.

I think my biggest regret is not swallowing my shame, embarrassment, and fear of rejection/abandonment and just talk to them about what I was feeling. Are you close enough with your friends that you think you can open up to them about at least some of these emotions you’re feeling? If not, have you considered turning to some online BPD communities? 

I also think that you should try therapy (DBT) if you are able to (I know it’s easier said than done for most people).",herolance,92r1da

8,"That's exactly how I feel. I feel like the dead weight of the group and they always leave me out. I would try talking to them, but I'm sure they'd just say they hang out with each other more because they smoke weed together and I quit smoking so I can't do the same activities as them. It sucks that because I'm an addict too, I have to change my behaviors and lose relationships in the process. I feel like they replaced me with each other because I no longer have common interests with them and sober me just isn't worth it. :/

1,"I mean for one, DBT is evidenced based for borderline and has positive outcomes.
I do think borderline is over diagnosed especially in women who display ""difficult"" behaviors in treatment settings but I think it's false to say there is no useful treatment.
The behaviors exhibited in the diagnosis are often trauma related too and stem from the person coping the best they can given their skills at the current point. The behavior works for something for them either in primary or secondary gains.

WR, the human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings or fears, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings -- and hence the resulting distorted perceptions -- far more frequently than other people. The key to avoiding these distortions is to learn the emotional skills needed to control your own emotions.

If you suffer from BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or your environment) that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills. Most cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach you the emotional skills needed to control your own emotions. They can teach you how to do self soothing; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

They also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's personality is essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.",Up-Town,hk4txb

2,"Codeesha, yes, you are describing many of the warning signs for BPD. Of course, only a professional can determine whether your symptoms are so strong and persistent that they constitute a full-blown disorder. 

I therefore suggest you see a psychologist for evaluation. If he/she decides you have the disorder, the recommended treatment likely will be DBT or CBT -- treatments that are available in most cities because this problem is quite common. 

I caution that BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either *""has""* or *""doesn't have.""* Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means every adult on the planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).

At issue, then, is not whether you exhibit BPD traits. Of course you do. We all do. Rather, at issue is whether you exhibit those traits at a strong level (i.e., are on the upper end of the BPD spectrum). These traits are primitive ego defenses that we all have to ensure our survival, particularly during childhood. 

They become a problem only when they are so strong that they undermine our efforts to sustain close LTRs with other adults. How serious the problem is depends not only on how *strong* our BPD traits are but also on whether they are *persistent*, i.e., constitute a full lifetime problem.

**Temporary BPD flareups.** Codeesha, most occurrences of strong BPD traits you see in other people are not caused by lifetime BPD. Instead, they are only temporary flareups of the normal BPD traits we all have. These flareups can be caused by drug abuse but most often are caused by a strong hormone change.

For example, BPD flareups can be caused by hormone changes occurring during puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, PMS, or perimenopause (or any other life event starting with the letter ""P,"" LOL). Severe PMS can cause strong BPD behavior to occur for several days each month. With perimenopause or postpartum, the temporary BPD flareup may last several years.

**Persistent BPD traits.** If serious hormone and drug problems can be ruled out, the remaining common cause of strong BPD traits is a stunted emotional development, i.e., something occurring before age five that caused emotional development to freeze at the level of a young child. 

This is a far more serious problem because it is results in BPD traits that are permanent unless the person with BPD (pwBPD) undergoes years of intensive therapy to acquire the emotional skills she never had an opportunity to learn in childhood.

The pwBPD needs to learn, for example, how to do self soothing, how to regulate all of her emotions, how to avoid black-white thinking by tolerating strong mixed feelings, how to trust, how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as self-evident ""facts,"" and how to stay aware of the present instead of escaping through daydreams into the past and future. 

Absent those emotional skills, a pwBPD must continue to rely on the primitive ego defenses used by young children: projection, denial, temper tantrums, dissociation, magical thinking, and black-white thinking.",Up-Town,jnaumg
3,"Might be bpd, but also sounds like bipolair disorder with major insecurity issues.",MakethemsufferNL,jnaumg
4,"Idk about borderline cause I’m not a psychologist, but yeah that seems possible. Could be trauma tho? Idk.

But one thing that might help you and another person is to have a code word. If she notices you becoming unpleasant, she uses the code word and you acknowledge it. If she says “Texas” for instance, that means you should treat it as a “uh oh I’m getting started” signal, and re-evaluate your thought processes and intervene before she says “California” at which point she must completely remove herself from the situation and you need to do something else, preferably to use a healthy coping skill and some “time out” time. This will help stress her out less, and will make you feel less guilty about stressing her out later on. Having this system might help you and her separate your mood swings from your actual personality, and if done right, will stop feelings from potentially being hurt

Same goes for if you get sad. You could have “Florida” for I need a hug or cuddles, “New York” for I need to be left alone, “Illinois” for I need to be distracted, and “Pennsylvania” for I need to talk through this",Rosa_litta,jnaumg
5,"Thank you so much for replying, you have no idea how much that means to me. I completely understand what you mean by flair ups. But these feelings that I have aren’t just flair ups; it’s like they are the permanent, unending baseline to my entire life. 

About the stunted emotional development, my mother left our family at age 5, and it left an emptiness inside of me. My father, while caring for me, was never emotionally present. He also had a pattern of accepting new girlfriends into the family, and having them become my “mom”. The gf and I would become very close, but then suddenly, they would break up, and it’s like the trauma happened all over again. 

(btw, I am male, so we can rule out the PMS postpartum stuff.)",Codeesha,jnaumg
6,"Codeesha, the human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings -- and hence the distorted perceptions -- far more frequently than other people. Because it is impossible to think clearly while feelings are intense, the ""trick"" for avoiding this problem is avoid the intense feelings by learning the many emotional skills needed to control your own emotions. 

These missing skills are the techniques taught in a program like DBT. If you suffer from BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (e.g., the abandonment by your mother at age 5) that prevented you from acquiring those emotional skills. Significantly, like learning to play a piano, acquiring the techniques themselves is the EASY part. What is HARD is practicing them over and over on a daily basis for many years -- and attending a weekly individual therapy and a group therapy --  so those techniques eventually feel so natural and automatic that they are readily available when you need them.

If you actually do have full-blown BPD, your chances of doing well in therapy likely are very good. I say this because you appear to have an amazing level of self awareness. As you likely know, self awareness is very rare among pwBPD, especially among those who are high functioning like you are. By their very nature, BPD behaviors typically are invisible to a high functioning pwBPD. 

This is why BPD behaviors are said to be ""egosyntonic"" -- i.e., are in such complete harmony with the needs and desires of the ego that, to the pwBPD, they seem to be perfectly reasonable and natural defenses to the many ""threats"" he sees all around himself.

If you are a pwBPD, having this high level of self awareness means you are already past the largest stumbling block that prevents nearly all high functioning pwBPD from seeking therapy. Yet, although self awareness is a necessary condition for success, it is not sufficient by itself. Also required is the ego strength needed to remain in therapy long enough -- and to work hard enough at the therapy -- to learn those missing emotional skills. 

The first step, of course, is to be evaluated by a professional to find out whether you have a serious issue that warrants therapy. But, regardless of the outcome of that evaluation, Codeesha, I wish you the very best! I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your mother.",Up-Town,jnaumg

Adjustment Disorder and BPD are two wildly different things. There may some small overlap in symptoms, but their presentation is vastly different.

In the DSM-5, Adjustment Disorder is under the umbrella of Trauma disorders, and relates to a specific trigger within a period of more than 1 month but less than 6 months, and consists of symptoms related to anxiety and a small trauma response. There may be some other symptoms associated (that's what the qualifiers are for) but that is the base. Generally, functioning is mildly to moderately impaired (work, school, ADLs, socializing, etc.). Adjustment Disorder tends to have more in common with something like PTSD (diagnosed after 6 months of trauma symptoms).

BPD has shown to have some co-morbidity with PTSD, which may find some drawing connections between that and Adjustment Disorder, but it is a personality disorder with chronic, persistent behaviors, thought processes, and underlying beliefs that make up it's presentation. One at times might say that presentation of BPD can be indirectly caused by a trauma disorder, but Adjustment Disorder does not persist long enough nor is it typically severe enough to cause changes in personality on its own.

Mental health professionals may diagnose Adjustment Disorder in order to lessen stigma associated with more major diagnoses, and sometimes it fits better than the more vague ones. Also, if using insurance, companies will cover Adjustment Disorder more than they will cover the vague depression and anxiety disorder diags. So it also does increase access to care. There are definitely legitimate presentations of Adjustment Disorder, though.",Siggykewts,eiysic
1,"I'm a mental health counseling student. 

The concept behind adjustment disorder is that you're having a hard time adjusting to a specific life stressor or a particularly hard period in your life. It is supposed to resolve in 6 months and this process can be helped along with therapy, support groups, etc. If it lasts longer than 6 months, it's supposed to be diagnosed as something else because that's beyond what they have decided is a normal adjustment period. You also have to be suffering beyond what is considered typical in your culture for the diagnosis. The symptoms required for diagnosis are basically generic mental health symptoms.

Examples of things that could kick it off include divorce or break up, major job/income change, scary medical diagnosis of you or a loved one, your kid moving out of the house, graduating and not being sure where to go in life, etc. etc.

Sometimes the diagnosis is used as a placeholder because those 6 months haven't passed and the clinician doesn't want to make assumptions about how long the presenting symptoms will last after the stressor. That's pretty ethical. Other times it's used less ethically as a placeholder by clinicians who don't believe in diagnoses but need to put one down because of insurance companies, or it's used because it's the least stigmatized diagnosis and has temporary connotations.

If you're asking whether BPD and adjustment disorder are causally linked, they definitely are not. But a person with BPD might be more likely to have negative feelings that are beyond the norm in response to life stressors. They shouldn't be receiving a diagnosis of adjustment disorder if they already have a BPD diagnosis, though, because BPD already explains those symptoms.",Badger-Nat,eiysic

3,Um I just have a question what is adjustment disorder in more simpler terms? I'm no5 really good with big words and odnt really understand it.,,eiysic
4,"Portal, AD (Adjustment Disorder) and BPD are generally unrelated and very dissimilar.  AD is predominantly characterized by anxiety and/or depression and is a temporary over-reaction to a stressful event.  It usually ends within about 6 months.

In contrast, lifetime BPD is not temporary. It is believed to be fully entrenched in the mind at a very early age, causing emotional development to freeze at age 3 or 4.  The child thus has no opportunity to develop an integrated sense of self. He grows up emulating other peoples' personalities because he doesn't know who he is. 

Moreover, the child has no opportunity to learn the many coping skills needed to regulate his own emotions, to have a strong sense of object constancy, or to trust other people.  Further, because he doesn't learn how to tolerate two strong conflicting feelings at the same time, he is fully reliant on black-white thinking whenever his feelings are intense in close personal relationships. 

Most major cities offer therapy programs (e.g., DBT) that can teach a pwBPD those missing coping skills if he is willing to work hard -- for many years -- in a weekly program under professional guidance. Sadly, it is rare for a pwBPD to have the self awareness needed to recognize the problems and the ego strength needed to work hard in therapy for many years. 

Therapists generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwBPD the name of his disorder because they often feel it is not in the patient's best interests to be told.  It thus is common for the diagnosis to include only the names of co-occurring clinical disorders.  This is easy to do because nearly all pwBPD also suffer from 2 or 3 clinical disorders too. A 2008 study found, for example, that 81% of female pwBPD also have an anxiety disorder (e.g., PTSD, OCD, or ADHD) and 80% of them also have a mood disorder (e.g., depression or bipolar).",Up-Town,eiysic
5,PTSD and ADHD aren't anxiety disorders. OCD isn't an anxiety disorder in the DSM-5 but that's a bit more controversial.,Badger-Nat,eiysic
6,#,harrassedbytherapist,eiysic
7,"Badger, thanks for the corrections. Interestingly, the U.S. Dept. of Health is still quoting NIH as listing both PTSD and OCD as 2 of the 5 types of anxiety disorders.  See [What are the five major types of anxiety disorders? | HHS.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/mental-health-and-substance-abuse/what-are-the-five-major-types-of-anxiety-disorders/index.html).  Similarly, many other professional websites still list them mistakenly as anxiety disorders. See, e.g., [VeryWellMind](https://www.verywellmind.com/ptsd-and-other-anxiety-disorders-relationship-2797549). 

As you correctly observe, that categorization was true for DSM-IV but it changed in 2013 when DSM-5 removed PTSD and OCD  from the anxiety disorder category and placed them in new adjacent categories.  [Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/answers/286227-14511/according-to-the-dsm-5-which-diagnoses-are-classified-as-anxiety-disorders) explains that *""these disorders are closely related to anxiety disorders and the sequential order of these chapters in the DSM-5 reflects this close relationship.""*",Up-Town,eiysic

Having to deal with my mother still having episodes well into her seventies isn't very much fun on my side, I can't imagine she enjoys it. 

But since you're posting about your problem, you probably don't have much in the way of narcissism. That's good. Narcissism is personality cement- it takes up all the extra room and doesn't allow things to shift as you learn, because you're too busy thinking you're already doing things well all around. 

If you can post about it, you can probably do something about it.

0,"Raven, I agree that you are describing warning signs for BPD, not bipolar-2.  One possibility, however, is that you have both.  A 2008 study found that 40% of pwBPD have co-occurring bipolar.  I therefore suggest you see another psychologist to obtain a second opinion.

I also suggest you take a quick look at my list of [12 BPD/Bipolar Differences](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9mj9u8/how_do_bpd_warning_signs_differ_from_those_of/)  and my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/) to see if most BPD traits sound very familiar.   If so and you have questions, I would be glad to discuss them with you. 

Of course, learning  to spot BPD warning   signs will not  enable you to  diagnose your own issues.  Although  strong BPD  symptoms usually are easy  to  spot,  only a  professional can  determine whether  they are so  severe and  persistent  as to constitute  a  full-blown  disorder.  Learning the red flags also can help you decide when professional  guidance is needed.",Up-Town,bd3yvu

A lot of people tell me they have to walk on eggshells around me (I think they're overexaggerating tbf) I have major lows and highs within hours. I'll be very upset and crying and the next minute I'll be raging and ranting and throwing stuff on the ground. I am constantly arguing with my partner and very often think about wanting to break up with him but then I panick and cry about how I don't want that. I'm all over the place really. 
I have high suicidal ideation and have attempted and I very very often think I'm a bad person and that everyone hates me which leads me into a frenzy of trying to coax info out if people to find out if anyone has been talking bad things about me. I hate it. I hate myself for it. 

So far I've found that I have the detached self soother, angry child, impulsive child and punitive parent modes (schema therapy) 
Working on it now and honestly I hope it works but sometimes I feel like I'm not taken seriously. 

I'm not going to say that that specific diagnosis is my issue because it's probably not and I know I'm quite obsessive sometimes. Plus it'd be dangerous for me to say something that's not true

The doctor said that could be a sign of it not being what was wrong. And reading all the stuff about the hatingyourself and the everytime something goes wrong wanting to die and always either hating or loving no inbetween, I’ve fit everything of it I read and that’s why my parents and partner say it is, I have no clue tho I’m trying to get a evaluation for this very reason . It fits a lot of stuff ",AquariusGemini,b43bof

And I know with the up and down thing but it was always really fast periods of good and bad like hours or days instead of weeks and months. The weeks and months have just started happening last year, it’s really strange a lot of my symptoms have also got with schizophrenia, it’s been very confusing. My partner is the one who found the borderline personality by researching my symptoms and there’s a lot I didn’t include in this mostly because it’s really embarrassing. And I get horrible self doubt and literally anytime something goes wrong I just am like ok I wanna die, anytime my partner gets mad I’m convinced he is gonna leave me, anytime my mom gets mad I’m convinced she hates me, I get really mad and say things then realize how hurtful I was and take it back, 
I don’t want to have any problems but reading about the borderline stuff it’s the first time I’ve felt like maybe I’m not just making all this up and it’s actually real and it happens to not just me, I’ve done research on the hallucinations and voice and it says that it’s really rare but some borderline personality disorder people develop it.

My boyfriend told recently he is afraid to talk to me about how he feels and it’s like he has to tip toe around me so I don’t explode, my whole life people have been afraid of me just snapping and switching into what my dad calls “Satan(my name)” I’ve always been called over dramatic and crazy and all of it like you said. I cry like it’s the end of the world like scream crying like I’m legit dying, I sound really crazy when it happens.

I made it very clear I’ve never hurt someone physically or wanted to just myself and objects around me. It was super hurtful and caused me super bad episodes and started my self harm thing back up so. It was like that a lot when I was younger with places I go to and they wouldn’t help me just put me in a in care program for a week then send me home (obviously they can’t do that seeing im not under 18 anymore).

1,"There are a few big differences. Bipolar is characterized by mania or hypomania. Mania is when someone's mood is really high - they often feel invincible and can make some really dangerous decisions. A lot of people get something called pressured speech, which means that they can't stop talking about everything going on in their mind. It can do some serious damage to relationships. People experiencing mania don't sleep a lot. Hypomania is a lot less obvious. For a lot of people, it shows up as periods of extreme productivity and little sleep. Bipolar can have just mania, but most people experience mania or hypomania and those mood episodes alternate with depression.
Borderline (BPD) is classified as a personality disorder, but it's actually a trauma disorder. People with borderline often get mood swings, hurt themselves, and act impulsively. The distinguishing characteristics of BPD are a pervasive fear of abandonment and frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, as well as an unstable sense of self and chronic feelings of emptiness. BPD is often confused with CPTSD because both come with impulsivity, shame, and a lot of shame. Some people have both BPD and CPTSD.

So in short, bipolar is about mood episodes and borderline is about a fear of abandonment as a trauma response from early childhood. Both can really hurt relationships if they go untreated and both are highly stigmatized. Neither disorders are something to be ashamed about - no one can help their biology or the environment they grew up in.

I hope that helps!",Fickle-Palpitation,jrxj20
2,"Just4Fun,  I describe how they differ in my list of [12 BPD/Bipolar Differences](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9mj9u8/how_do_bpd_warning_signs_differ_from_those_of/) and my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/904mky/i_24m_am_currently_married_to_my_emotional_abuser/e2nploz/). Those descriptions are largely based on my experiences with a pwBPD (my exW) and a Bipolar-1 sufferer (my foster son). If most warning signs ring a bell and you have questions, I would be glad to join Fickle in discussing them with you. 

Significantly, these two disorders oftentimes occur together. About 30% of bipolar sufferers also have co-occurring BPD and about 40% of people with BPD (pwBPD) have co-occurring bipolar. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

The distinction between these two disorders is very important. Whereas bipolar typically is caused by a change in body chemistry, BPD is believed to be caused by something occurring before age 5 (heredity and/or a childhood trauma) that prevents the child from acquiring the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions and establish a strong, stable self identity.

Hence, whereas bipolar oftentimes can be treated quite successfully by swallowing a pill, BPD can only by treated by years of hard work -- in a weekly therapy program such as DBT or CBT -- to acquire those missing emotional skills. Like learning to play a piano, learning those skills takes years of practice and strong commitment.",Up-Town,jrxj20

0,"1) I'm curious what you feel are the biggest triggers for emotional changes? I have a friend with BPD and it seems like very specific situations lead to quick snaps to anger.  

2) How did you suspect BPD enough to attempt a diagnosis? What symptoms led you to be suspicious?",cjazz108,3ftfby
1,[deleted],,3ftfby
2,"Were you diagnosed with something else previously that didn't ring true?
What advice would you give to somebody in your position? Something you've learnt that youd want others to know, how to manage emotions etc..",kerbang,3ftfby
3,"I've tried looking up and reading about BPD, but I don't really understand.

What does BPD ""look"" like?  What is it the experience of going through a BPD episode (not sure if that's the correct term) like?",soladeda,3ftfby
4,"I'm actually really interested in your story from a professional perspective. I'm just starting my study in clinical psych, and I work with a number of people who research BPD and DBT. Just curious to hear what your impressions of treatment are? What has or hasn't worked? Have you or are you currently attending DBT sessions by chance? Any notable good/bad experiences? As a researcher and clinician-in-training, I'm always really curious to hear what the client's impressions are.",katowjo,3ftfby
5,"1) That is an interesting and difficult question, but I'll try my best to give you an insightful answer. Different environments have different triggers and different levels of reaction, with friends or acquaintances, my triggers usually come from laughter, usually directed at me, sometimes I take it the wrong way and I think I'm being belittled or ""laughed at"", also when someone makes a (seemingly) negative comment about my mannerisms or personality or something like that, it'll hit hard, I'll become defensive and spiteful, even verbally aggressive at times. When it comes to more intimate relationships with women, I'm much more hair-triggered, even the slightest odd glance could cause a chain reaction, sending me into a fit of rage, breaking and throwing things, screaming and yelling, threatening to do stupid things. The worst is when I'm alone and unoccupied, my mind can cook up the most ridiculous things which leave me doing even more ridiculous things (self harming, abusing drugs/alcohol, e.t.c) with little to no apparent trigger. So it's quite vague when it comes to what my exact triggers are, but they usually have something to do with attacking my ego, feelings of inadequacy, or feelings of betrayal. 

2) I actually knew very little about BPD before my diagnosis, I was thinking that I was Bipolar at the time, due to online self-assessments and whatnot. I only started looking into things after a long, hard reflection of my life, not really looking at specific criteria and symptoms, like I said, I was under the impression that I had a mood disorder, not a personality disorder. I hope I have been somewhat informative. ",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby
6,"Oh, in various ways. It has seriously affected my family and intimate relationships, by way of my emotional irregularity and temper issues leading to me being an abusive son, boyfriend, brother, cousin, e.t.c. Workplaces are also a prime area for my erratic behaviour to arise, being such a critical environment and my work ethic varying so much that I more often than not end up receiving reprimands and nearly becoming physical with my superiors because of a shift in mood. I have very few friends, but they do accept my ways and have learned to understand me. Truth is, I see that it has impacted my life rather negatively, leading to broken relationships and closed doors all around me, but at least I accept myself and I am seeking treatment, so things will get better, I'm sure.",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby
7,"The only psychiatric diagnosis I had ever received previously was of ADHD when I was a young boy. I can't really give advice in terms of tips to manage your emotions and whatnot, that is best left to a specialist who can tailor treatment personally for you, since everyone is different in how their condition affects them, but I can give one piece of knowledge which is that you CAN change, things CAN get better, there is ALWAYS ways to help yourself, the trick is to actually use them, I sat miserable for years because I didn't want to accept that I had a problem, but when I finally came to terms, things became easier to assess and analyze, and I could come up with a solution. So to anyone in my shoes, just keep pushing forward really, a happy life is indeed within your reach.",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby
8,"Just imagine talking to somebody who will idealize one thing one day, then hate it the next day, and when you call them out on it, they'll try to manipulate you into thinking you got it all wrong, or just be a plain asshole about it. And it isn't something that you go through ""episodes"" with, its a personality disorder, meaning the aforementioned (along with other) behaviours are ongoing rather being episodic. Now what is the experience like? Well, shitty I guess, I don't have many friends and I can't keep a relationship of any sort with women and my family tends to alienate me and whatnot. ",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby
9,"Ah unfortunately I have not yet begun therapy as I am still in waiting to see a specialist who handles that sort of thing, however I am very eager to begin. I'm especially interested in the group therapy aspect of DBT, to see and listen to others with the same difficulties as I. Sorry that I couldn't give you a better answer, but I am quite new to the whole thing, just received my diagnosis 2 months ago. If you don't mind, what are your impressions of DBT? Has progress been made enough to truly help people with BPD, or do we still have a long way to go?",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby
10,"I really appreciate this.  My friend who seems to have BPD (not a formal diagnosis but an informal one by a trusted psychologist friend) seems to have a somewhat slippery cognitive process - in that if there is any blame in a situation, then she will do anything and everything to confuse the discussion.  If I or anyone else attempts to gain clarity from that situation, anger comes out as a last ditch attempt to keep the ""secrets hidden"".  I appreciate your response, in that it shows me something I had guessed at before, but didn't know conclusively, but that men seem to use aggression where women seem to use manipulation as their primary defense mechanisms.

For what it's worth, do not believe that BPD is impossible to treat, and know there are more options than just DBT.  If you haven't guessed, I'm a counseling student who has done quite a bit of my own work, and I have experienced good friends with BPD become just about cured through emotional and cognitive restructuring.  After you've gotten some work under your belt, let me know, and I can offer suggestions from time to time as to things to try if you're interested. Really good luck to you, and know that there is a solution!  Peace!",cjazz108,3ftfby

12,[deleted],,3ftfby
13,"How long did it take, from when you first sought help, to get the diagnosis of BPD?",TheDoomKitten,3ftfby
14,"Hey there, so sorry for my delayed response. I'm not the most consistent redditor these days. First off, congratulations on getting the diagnostic piece behind you. The issues you've been dealing with now have a name, and you can start working with trained professionals to make plans and move forward with your life. That's a huge accomplishment; one that plenty of people never achieve.

Now about DBT. I'm not yet fully trained in the treatment itself, but I've studied it quite a bit and work with people who use DBT daily. My impressions are that it's immensely helpful, but it does take time and hard work. You may or may not know this already, but the developer of DBT, Marsha Linehan, actually struggled with BPD symptoms herself growing up. She was able to combine her personal experiences with a huge body of related literature on mental health treatment to put together a treatment that uses group and individual therapy together to teach skills to manage difficult thoughts, emotions, and troubled relationships. Compared to 25 years ago, the outlook for individuals with BPD is much, much brighter. And even though improving multiple areas of your life and coming out on the other side may take 1 year (or more) of real effort and perseverance, just remember that there's a mountain of research out there to show that DBT works and it lasts.

Good luck getting started, and thanks again for doing the AMA!",katowjo,3ftfby
15,"I'm dying to meet a woman who shares my condition, just so we can sit down and butt heads together, see what lovely ridiculousness our minds will produce hahaha. I definitely will be wanting some of those suggestions, I haven't started DBT just yet as I am awaiting a specialist, tell me, what are some of the main things I'm going to be learning, focusing on and doing as part of my treatment? ",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby
16,"Yes I am, I don't want to put anyone through anymore pain or confusion, it's painful for me because us borderlines tend to yearn for intimate company, but it's for my own good I guess. ",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby
17,"If you're referring to methods and skills learned in DBT (Dialectical Behavioural Therapy), then I haven't learned anything yet because I am still awaiting to see a specialist to place me in the appropriate program. However, independently I have learned that I can stop myself before I react, usually by ""freezing my thoughts"", stopping and thinking about what's running through my mind and taking very deep breaths until the situation blows over. This is only a quick fix because it'll pop up in my head later and bother me throughout the night, but it helps to avoid mistreatment of others.",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby
18,"It only took a month for the psychologist to make a diagnosis, however I was and still am quite aware of myself, made his job easier because I could answer his questions thoroughly. ",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby
19,"Well, depending on the facility, you'll attend group skills classes, have one on one sessions, do daily diary cards, and have 24 hour access to quick check-ins from therapists or assistants to make sure triggers can be contained, and that you feel supported.

Depending on the therapists, you may get some exposure to EMDR or Somatic Experiencing as a part of your one on one sessions - which would be spectacular, and I hope you have the chance to participate with as much of that as possible.

If they don't have those facilities, then know that they are available for when you are done with the program, and there's even more possible out there.  The sad part is that this treatment isn't more widely available and that not everyone seeks it out whether they have BPD or not.  The cool part is that if you have a good therapist, working through the issues will start waking up different parts of your brain, and it will almost feel as if you will be leveling up - like in a comic book or video game.  It's amazing how much of our brains are about process, and when we develop more streamlined processes, our brains are able to process more emotions and information!  

If you can - I would recommend keeping a diary for yourself.  If you are like me, it will be fun to have record of the changes, and after a couple years, you might not even recognize the things your were writing early on - you are so different!",cjazz108,3ftfby
20,"You will likely meet several women in the DBT group (you can't be in a relationship with any of them while you are all in therapy-DBT rules- but there is nothing stopping you from making friends). Some of those present may have hostility towards you due to their own issues with men, but try not to take it personally. Some of them will be interested in learning more about what life's like for men with BPD. I knew a few men who have completed DBT and they were much happier with their lives. ",Welshgirlie2,3ftfby

23,"I'm usually all three, in that order. I'll start by trying to convince the other that they are wrong and that they had the wrong idea, or that I had meant something else as opposed to what I said or did,which usually ends the conflict right then and there, if that doesn't work for me, then I will outright become verbally aggressive and usually say something abrasive or insulting, a way of showing my teeth I guess, and if they continue to fight and push me, I'll fall over the edge and breakout unexpectedly into physical action, this is rare however, as most people just see how irrational I'm being, find it pointless to contest me and walk away from the situation, but some people just won't put up with my bullshit haha. One event will continuously anger for no more than a day, however the memory of it will pop up in my head in the following days and I'll become angry and begin plotting against the person, only to later realize how silly I'm being and begin idealizing the person. My friends just let me have my fit, they know that's the easiest and quickest way, but I'm not the only one with emotions, they get upset too and sometimes don't have the patience to deal with me, which has led to an altercation here and there. ",Tenebrae_Et_Lux,3ftfby

25,"The smallest reason I had for a confrontation was when I once slammed my friend onto the floor and slapped him in the face several times because he had playfully patted me on the back and I took as belittlement, at least that's what I can remember. One of my main reasons is to avoid humiliation, since I dealt with that a lot when I was young, also I feel like that my character is always being tested somehow, like I'm always getting checked for my genuineness or something.

Talk to your regular doctor and ask to be referred to a psychiatrist.  My experience with primary care physicians is that they underequipped to diagnose these type of issues.  When you find a psychiatrist, be 100% honest, or they really aren't going to be able to help you.

1,"Hey there, wanted to give my 2 cents on this but first and foremost I wanna be clear and say that I haven't been diagnosed properly either. Just a few weeks after getting into therapy, the coronavirus thing exploded and I couldn't continue.

I had my issues for years now, I didn't take them seriously enough until suicidal thoughts started approaching me. Won't go deeper into that since I will write pages about that.

The thing is, i hit rock bottom, I went to look for help and the therapist told me on the first session ""I don't wanna scare you and I don't wanna rush into things, but you might have a condition, we will look into that in the next sessions"".

That took me into searching by my own (not really healthy or recomendable BTW), and turns out that I check every symptom box for borderline (and 75% of DID, but that's another whole story).

While I am not completely sure that I have that cause I have not been diagnosed by a professional, all the research I did points out that I do. I think the most important thing to think about is equilibrium.

Every time I get my equilibrium tainted, my emotions go into a rampage and I tend to ruin any kind of relationship I have, go into a self destructive behavior or I just can't hold myself together to do simple things. It requieres me way more effort to stay focused into simple things like reading for homework or even don't get insanely depressed while working and leave all together.

It's really annoying to be enjoying something and the next second just want to sleep and not wake up.

I wonder if it becomes hard to remember that these people are sick too, when everything is going on inside someone's head and all they see are the physical and verbal manifestations. No one blames the chemo girl for throwing up, because everyone emphasizes with cancer. It's not her fault her cells are rapidly multiplying. 

We've come a long way from just shocking everyone's brain and loading them up on lithium, but society still blames people for what in malfunctioning in their brain. 

I've met a lot of inpatients who were mostly at risk of harming themselves not patients and staff. Having seen first hand a young woman try to swallow metal cutlery, experiences like that change you.

6,I've worked in mental health for the past 13 years and unfortunately there are professionals out there who are like this but thankfully not all.

I worked with someone for a number of years who was like this and she saw it as a way of protecting herself from burnout. She'd worked for years on the wards and saw caring as something you could do too much of and viewed too much empathy as a sign of inexperience and not being tough enough to do the job. Thankfully things are changing but not quick enough by the sounds of things.

James was a 12 year old who suffered with severe autism and had difficulties comprehending certain social concepts. He was constantly yelled at and cussed at. I and a small number of the staff tried to be his friend. I played with him in gym sometimes.

The staff... Was odd. Most were great, but some of them were just mean. Yelling and screaming... Ugh:/ I remember that time someone tried to escape because he missed his girlfriend. He was takled and sedated. 

There was also Lee. He was 17. The staff didn't punish him correctly. He bullied people. He was mean. He called names. Nothing was said. He got a girl pregnant, left her and her child, and dated someone else. He is a ""Satanist"" (he knew nothing about the actual concept of Satanism, just how to draw pentagrams and upside-down crosses).

And finally- some people just do not have the patience or temperament to work in this field. 

When I worked at a psychiatric hospital, there were many compassionate staff members who worked hard to help the patients that were there (even when the patients didn't realize that they were actually trying to help).

29,"I'd be willing to argue the emotions point. No, you can't control your emotional responses, but learning to monitor them and control your reactions to these emotions is an important part of healthy mental functioning. BPD is often characterized by an inability to do just that. The most successful and widely used treatment for BPD--Dialectic Behavioral Therapy--is all about accepting your strong emotions and being able to react in a constructive, rather than destructive, way. ",Hazc,2lfdxl
30,"I didn't read much of that thread. I was speaking about ""everyone is responsible for their own emotions."" which is the only part of what the nurse said that I read.

Everyone in my profession regards (with good evidence) feelings as a result of one's own thoughts (therefore, it is one's own thinking that causes feelings, not the actions of someone else). Having Borderline Personality Disorder without a diagnosis of depression or bipolar is basically stating that the feelings are not the result of a chemical flaw but a thinking pattern flaw, which is much more difficult to ""fix."" BPD by nature is a fixed, fault pattern of thinking - which in turns, causes bad, volatile feelings.

Again, I don't know what the nurse said about sympathy, but if it was about sympathy being a no-no (don't get too involved with/don't feel your client's/patient's feelings) and empathy being key (*understanding* their emotions) I'd have to agree.

3,"Thanks for your question. It’s barely possible, here are the reasons:
1. BPD is incurable. Therapy can only help you to learn how to live with it and minimize the impact on your life.
2. Lack of therapists that are able to work with BPD, especially in my country.
3. The therapy needs perfect relationship w/ your therapist, but one of the most common symptoms of BPD is “splitting” – it’s when your perception totally changes due to random reason. People w/ BPD either idealize or hate the person and it changes immediately person does something that triggers your “splitting”. So it’s very hard (sometimes even impossible) to be in perfect relationship with your therapist.

As for me, nothing helps and my symptoms are getting worse.",mr11akobes,g5d21z

I am on pharmacological (antidepressant and antipsychotic) therapy for my comorbid OCD and my anxious, depressive and psychotic symptoms.

It took me years to understand that I have a personality disorder, because when you have it, you feel that it’s just your strange character. My psychiatrist dotted all the i’s when he wrote down my diagnosis in terms of treatment. By then I already thought I could have BPD, also I was already diagnosed with OCD, anxiety and depression. It’s impossible to ignore symptoms of BPD – it’s ruining your social life and traumatizes you and everybody around, so I had no choice not to read tons of information about various mental illnesses. You can’t imagine how many online tests I went through to put up with this.

My mother emotionally and physically abused my for my entire life, my father left me when I was 11, also I had experienced abusive romantic relationship, and finally I’ve experienced many traumatic events like my partners suicide event etc. I believe this all triggered the development of my BPD.

0,"The problem with self diagnosing BPD is that the symptoms are things everyone can relate to because we all have those things - everyone struggles with self-esteem and self-worth, everyone has mood swings, everyone fears abandonment, everyone has unhealthy coping mechanisms, everyone loses friendships and has tough interpersonal relationships, etc. Particularly as teenagers and young adults. It's only BPD when it is at a true extreme. I'm not saying you do or don't have it, but don't walk into the appointment with that already set in stone in your mind or feeling as though you have to try to paint it as BPD. Just tell the doctor how you're feeling and let them diagnose you. They're the expert. And keep an open mind to whatever their conclusion is. ",GrotiusandPufendorf,ad945x
1,"Heart, I applaud your decision to see a professional to have your issues evaluated.  I suggest you start with a psychologist.  If he determines that you have a clinical disorder that responds well to medication, he will refer you to a psychiatrist for medications.  (Alternatively, if you start with the psychiatrist, he likely will refer you to a psychologist for weekly treatments.)

The human condition is that, whenever we  experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window  because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other  peoples' intentions and motivations.

Significantly,  this is true for ALL adults.  This is why, whenever we are very angry,  we all try hard to keep our mouths shut-- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool  down.  We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are  experiencing intense feelings.

Well, if a professional determines that you have full-blown BPD, you are like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far  more frequently because you  lack the emotional skills needed to  regulate your own emotions.  This  is why a pwBPD experiences very  intense feelings far more frequently than  other people.

If  you suffer from full-blown BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood  (from inherited genes and/or your environment)  that prevented you from  acquiring certain emotional skills.  Most major cities offer excellent  treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP,  and CBT) that can teach you the  emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions.

They  can teach you how to do self soothing;  how to regulate your own  emotions; how to  intellectually challenge  intense feelings instead of  accepting them as  ""facts""; and how to trust  others.

They  also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in  the  room  instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to    perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's  personality  is essentially unchanged day to day);  and how to avoid  black-white  thinking by learning to tolerate strong  mixed feelings,  uncertainties,  ambiguities, and the other gray areas of  interpersonal  relationships.

0,"Congrats for being so willing and open about your diagnosis!  I’m a therapist who specializes in treating BPD and I can tell you that Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) will work wonders.  It’s all about creating a life worth living, with meaning and purpose.  It teaches you specific coping skills to create that life.  My clients have gone from chronically suicidal and self-harming to living lives they enjoy with jobs and intimate relationships.  That being said, you’ll get out of DBT what you put into it.  Go to group, do the homework, practice the skills, and call for coaching with your therapist!  Eventually, you will no longer meet criteria for BPD!  

One of my favorite books is called “The Budda & the Borderline: how I recovered from bpd with DBT, Buddhism, and online dating.”  It’s written by a woman in recovery from BPD and it’s phenomenal.  It really shows what living with bpd is like and how DBT can be effective.  It’s a nice way to not feel alone too :)

0,"1. Yes, I did DBT for a year.

2. Yes, it helped me a lot.

3. Yes, I completed my DBT sessions in 2015 and the skills have stayed with me and offered a huge amount of help for my continued recovery.

4. To make it more efficient, honestly the big thing is deciding for yourself in your head if you really want to put the effort in. I was really against it at first and got kicked out of a few different therapy programs the first time around — they always said it was because I had such a severe personality disorder that they weren’t capable of helping me. But with this particular one, after I was asked to leave, I spent a year going through a DBT workbook by myself to teach myself to be more open to what they were teaching. Really had to work hard to sort of train myself out of the rigid black and white thinking, at least enough that I was able to take in what they were teaching when they went back. Then they did welcome me back to that group, and I had to put in a lot more hard work to make sure I wasn’t just taking up time fighting with the counsellors instead of admitting that I was uncomfortable. The way it worked for me was, 2 repeats of basic mindfulness practice, then cycle through each section of DBT going through each part twice in total.

5. For me, it wasn’t until my second time going through each section that I actually started to notice I was able to make changes that were helpful to me. That took about 5-7 months of just sticking through, taking the time to listen, and reminding myself that these people were not trying to attack me as a person, that they really were trying to help. By the final 5/6 months, the instructors were commenting on how I had become a grade A student in their course. Not gonna lie, that feeling of validation really kept me going through to the finish even though I didn’t say so at the time.",nilherm,7lokct
1,"For me, despite having borderline (comorbid schizoaffective) I didn't find it extremely useful however it was still pretty useful.

Disclaimer: While it was not for me to the fullest extent I do believe that it is great for most and will still promote it.

I have done DBT 3 times and what I found was that I had already practiced a lot of what was taught. I also grew sick of distracting myself from my problems so a lot of the self soothing techniques became quite redundant for me. Though they did help for a long time. 

One thimg I had a lot of trouble with was recognizing the emotions because it became apparent my emotions don't feel like other people's. For example they describe worry and fear as being in your stomach but for me its above my shoulders (like a feeling that exists outside my body). I am not sure if this is due to having a psychotic disorder though. 

The best advice I can give is don't quit even if it's not working out you need to try and try again before figuring out what works and what doesnt. 

Not everything they teach will apply to you in some cases but nonetheless keep at it.",unusuallyalice,7lokct

3,"Thanks for replying!
What helps you not to think so much in black and white?

Even after the training do you still use the skills you learned today?",druggedmonkey,7lokct
4,"Thanks for replying,

How did you found out what worked best for you? And was it a good thing to stop using some techniques even if they did not work that well? Didn't you miss out on some things?",druggedmonkey,7lokct
5,"One part would be asking questions and actually listening to the answer. For example, at first I was confused and uncomfortable because it didn’t seem ‘right’ to me to try and erase all free thinking with constant mindfulness. When I asked for clarification on that, they said it’s not about always being mindful and never letting your thoughts roam. It’s a grey area and it’s about finding balance. That was hard to grasp at first, but then with assessing situations when I found myself confused in the all or nothing thoughts, it slowly got easier to pick out what balance means in different situations. 

Another big part was confronting my attending counsellor to tell her that I had been viewing her in an ‘all bad’ way and hadn’t been able to acknowledge any of her good traits, and apologizing for being so argumentative with her when she was trying to help. Then also saying it would take time for me to learn to see her as a balanced person and there would still be times I’d see her as all bad, but that I was willing to work with her and learn. Ended up being hugely helpful to talk with her about that and we still have really positive appointments to this day.

Yes, I do still use the skills I learned. For me, as I got more into practicing the skills every day (for real, every single day) they slowly became my go-to reactions for difficult situations instead of a conscious effort to correct the harmful reactions.  Now they sort of just keep going all the time, every day, as a subconscious processing style to go through my day. It does take a lot of energy even though it’s not a conscious effort though, and I notice it when I get really sick because then I have to revert back to actively practicing the skills as my body doesn’t have the left over energy to keep it running in the background.

Edit: I would like to add — the biggest improvements that I noticed came long after I finished DBT and happened very slowly, over time, as I continued practicing every day. So the other user’s advice of sticking with it (even if it doesn’t seem to apply to you or really make sense at the time) is pretty important. And for me, through the consistent practice, I was able to find ways or make little changes that made the teachings more helpful for me personally than they were originally.",nilherm,7lokct
6,"I think all of them can be uaed depending on the situation and the person. I wouldn't say I stopped using techniques completely they just are hardly needed for me to function better.

Just to give an example.

I am more often than not in wise mind except when it is really bad-- i tend to go between the cold/logical/rayional mind and wise mind a lot. When I slip into emotion mind it is nowhere nearly as bad as it was before (though I've had my days).

Number 1 thing: don't let bad days discourage you either. This therapy will not work 100% of the time lile anything, 'radical' acceptance can be key sometimes. (I hate yhe word radical tbh)

0,"I have BPD, and one thing that helps me is when people remind me that my brain is lying to me. Remind him that you love him, remind him *why* you love him. He’s probably terrified you’re going to leave (I feel that...a LOT), so being reassuring can be helpful. Listen when he goes off, there are nuggets of what’s really going on in between the out of nowhere random bits. He might go off for 15 minutes about the dinner being too salty and someone cutting him off in traffic and his favorite show being cancelled, but in the middle he might be saying that he’s scared of losing his job. Get that nugget and work on it with him.

None of this might be true for him, but it has helped me. I think most of all, ask him what he needs. You’ll learn along the way too.",rustincolor,cgoemn
1,"The only real advice I can give is don't lose yourself trying to save them. Its ok to work on things, as long as your pwBPD is getting help and doing the therapy and atleast the majority of the time attempting to fight this head on. Its not all about realizing they have a mental disorder and now they have an excuse. What it does mean is that at least now you know why they say or do the things they do. But it doesn't excuse it or make it ok. Set clear boundaries, and chances are you need some therapy also. It doesn't hurt, could even help you learn different ways to react or deal with the rage, outburst, dissociation etc... its a journey, and it can be a good one for the most part, but make sure they put in the effort too.",clm77539,cgoemn
2,"Hi, I just want to say, I really admire your desire to educate yourself further and I know how difficult it must be for the two of you to deal with this illness. I have been in this situation before when someone really close to me was suffering from this disorder. He would easily get triggered with the things that I would say and would often result to verbal abuse which I then take personally (because he would use really hurtful words). It felt like I was walking on eggshells. I was even afraid that maybe the reason why we got close, was because he was splitting when he met me and that I maybe, I was on the “good side”. I found it very difficult to create boundaries with him without making him feel like I was drifting away or that I assume the worst in him or that I don’t trust him etc. 

What I learned from that was that you should never forget to take care of yourself. The illness should never excuse any ill behaviors towards you or other people. You will help him out by making him realize and experience the consequences of his negative actions. Also, it would help to acknowledge his feelings. His extreme reactions over what may seem to be trivial to other people,  may be a manifestation of something bigger that is worrying him. 

All the best and take care!",joievelasco,cgoemn
3,does anyone have insight on motivating the person to get help and to help in the little ways I can in the moment-without being too pushy and actually causing more turmoil? it’s as if he’s so accustomed to pain and he does not deal with change well,rinacantina,cgoemn
4,"I just want to personally thank everyone who took the time to comment, I’ve felt so alone--friends and family don’t understand and they make me feel guilty for still seeing that this person still deserves love and support. I know they just don’t want me to lose myself in the process but until people go through it themselves they don’t understand it’s not so black-and-white.",rinacantina,cgoemn
5,"* copying from another one of my threads because someone mentioned my ""excusing""* In regards to me saying something about trying to set boundaries, I mentioned try because I am still learning and I’m still learning what kind of boundaries work for someone who deals with something like this. pretty much that’s what I’m asking for in my post--advice on what kind of boundaries to set, if the boundaries I’m setting are more harmful than good etc. advice and information on the disorder in general. Possible common triggers I'm oblivious to. I know I am in no way a professional and I’m not trying to fix him but if there are ways that I can go about to make little things better to have better reactions and healthier reactions that would help and even just help him feel better in the moment to then lead to him going to get the help that would be great. And I know I’ve heard the excusing thing before. I always get caught up in that because I feel like all right you have this person who goes through something awful that they can’t fully help especially while untreated, I try to look at all perspectives and all areas. I for sure know there’s certain things that happen between us that are unacceptable and I would never allow from another human being but at the same time this person can’t control it??? Idk it’s very confusing and lonely.",rinacantina,cgoemn
6,"Thank you so much it’s really helpful, the mass majority--although I appreciate it is mainly being negative, but I truly love this person and I don’t think he deserves love any less because of the way he is. Is it common for someone with BPD to hurry and leave because they’re scared that you’re going to leave anyways?",rinacantina,cgoemn
7,"This is good advice! And very very true. It is important that your pwBPD feels like he is being listened too. Regardless of what's being said. Validated... like ""I hear you saying your upset about blah blah blah""",clm77539,cgoemn
8,Thank you so much. People tend to make me feel guilty for still seeing the light and love in him aside from his problems and I appreciate feedback that’s realistic and honest and not just pure negativity. What kind of boundaries do you think works best?,rinacantina,cgoemn
9,Thank you so much for sharing. I can definitely relate to all of that.,rinacantina,cgoemn
10,"For some people that’s definitely true. I don’t know if personally I’m as much the hurry and leave, I’m more be prepared the person will leave at any minute. And that’s not just my fiancé, it’s my boss (who has been nothing but kind and complimentary to me), friends (who have been nothing but supportive and loving), family.....a lot of it for me is being logically able to see their actions as signs of affection, but my bpd saying “nope it’s all a lie they really hate you and you’re a burden.” So people reassuring me that I’m not a burden and that they do actually care about me (and the why they care is a big part of that....they’re not going to have specific reasons why they love me if they’re lying to me) is really helpful.",rustincolor,cgoemn
11,"Be patient. Learn to pick your battles. Learn when to walk away, and keep quiet. The boundaries I've set are that while I understand there is something much deeper going on it does not excuse abuse of any kind. I don't take blame or apologize for things that are not my fault like I used to. I've learned (for the most part) to separate the things he says while in a rage or disassociating. And once you recognize triggers and warning signs you will learn when what they are saying or doing is simply out of spite or to hurt. Sometimes it still hurts to hear. And it takes a lot to take it in a process it and not respond back. But once you can situation diffuse a lot quicker and you're able to bring those things that were said or done up to them and they can talk about what they were feeling and 9 times out of 10 tell you they didn't even mean it.",clm77539,cgoemn

13,"Thank you so much!!! It's so helpful to hear from someone else whose partner also deals w it. The Disassociation thing, would you be kind enough to inform me more about that? Is that when he seems like he's on autopilot, like he's just in a shell and/or his rage as well? Are they disconnected from the world?",rinacantina,cgoemn

1,"First and foremost, remember that your friend hasn't changed. A diagnosis is a label. An informative one, but it doesn't change anything about a person, merely expresses it.

Things that tend to help are clear communication that avoids blaming language. (Same with most people, tbh.) Your friend did something uncool? Try and avoid, hey, that thing you did was shit, and veer towards hey, could you possibly not do X again, it was hard for me. Neither is a walk in the park with BPD, hearing you fucked up never is, but the latter is less likely to trigger anger especially.

Clear communication also includes letting them know if you're going to be unresponsive for a while. Long plane journeys, unexpected parties, battery is dying in the middle of a convo. If you go ""no contact"" BPD can make your friend think they've done something wrong and now you've finally decided they're not worth talking to. Knowing you're just dealing with a dead battery lets them self-soothe instead.

Your friend may ask for reassurance more than the average person. Try and be chill with this. They're probably biting back a lot more requests than they let out.

Encourage him (gently and occasionally) to find methods that help him be calm when he gets angry or upset. Favourite music, movies, food, photographs, key phrases or quotes (from movies or self-help books or things he makes up) that he can write on bits of paper, and maybe help him make a crisis box with a lot of these things in.

Basically, BPD gets read as a condition where the person is abusive and angry, but think of it more like living in fear. Mild or severe, it's a pretty fearful disorder. The anger you sometimes see in it is a response to fear and distress. Mitigate those fears and you often create a much calmer individual.",magpiegoo,dmuf6s
2,"Look up splitting. Your friend may often love someone one day and then hate them the next. It's important to know why this happens and be prepared to help them understand things aren't always black and white, there are often shades of grey.",,dmuf6s
3,"My wife had BPD and over the years it was the primary cause for our divorce. May not be helpful for me to communicate and not particularly applicable to you as he is only your friend and not your partner, but an important tactic is to learn to disengage. People with BPD will often shift between putting you up on a pedestal then swiftly knocking you back off. One minute you're the greatest person in the world, the next you're trash. It's important when drama builds to put distance between you and him. When you sense he's on the warpath, stay away, don't say more than you need to, don't give him something to work with. Protect yourself and stay safe until the period has ended.",BillysGotAGun,dmuf6s

0,"My opinion of BPD Im also diagnosed with it. It is not a disorder in itself, its a description of several different factors. I'm not sure without looking it up but i blieve you must have six out of nine criteria to receive a diagnosis, its night and math isnt my best but I looked it up and that means theres 256 distinct combinations that can be considered BPD

If you loom around on the internet you will see a lot of terrible stuff about people with BPD, likely because they were misdiagnosed or were sociopaths who happened to meet one of the set of criteria

As you've said you feel like mess with all these labels remember you are a person, BPD IMO isnt something that appears in a vaccum it is a result of having to deal with all these other problems, I have my own hypothesis on it but I wont share stuff that is still experimental here unless I am asked.

Im having a really hard time now and Il I can say is that just because you have this diagnosis nothing has changed, somebody just matched some stuff up on a chart

As for saying you have so many issues I understand how you feel, but at least IMO it doesnt mean your any more ""fucked up"" its human nature especially for a scientifically minded person to to contextualize and categorize everything, some or most of these diagnosis just may be ways of describing specific effects of the same underlying problem, for example I could tell you have acute bronchitis, histamine release, cytokine release, pyrexia, congestion, myalgia, or I could just say you have the flu, if what Im saying makes anysense ",JuliustheWise,9f4a0e

Theres a whole debate about the usefulness of diagnostic labels. At the end of the day they are purely and entirely what you decide to make of them.  Part of the deabte is that we can feel like we have been 'slugged' with each one thats applied, and whether thats doing harm or helping us. Remember that even if proper diagnostic protocols are applied - which they rarely are - the diagnoses are often incorrect, either in terms of category, or in terms of what they mean for us growing and moving forward.

&#x200B;

Not saying they are crap. Diagnostics can be really, incredibly useful 'signposts' of where we are at, and, more importantly, of where we need to go from where we are. They can help us to see what patterns exist for people who have had similar experiences, and, if we adopt them, they offer us community and an informal family of people who share part of our story, and our experience - and that can be a rare and valuable thing, for personal growth, to be a member of.

&#x200B;

What I am saying is, ""its a label someone has stuck to you"". Do what you need to with it. You can look at it, you can research it, you can talk to others with it and see how their stories relate to yours, you can consult knowledgeable or experienced people about it, you can read about it, you can pick it up, screw it in a ball and put it in the bin if you want. You can adopt it like a kitten, cling to it, find solace in it. You can keep it permanently or temporarily, - picking it up when its useful to you and putting it down when its not -  or opt to reject it outright at face value with no further consideration. All of these are real choices available to you from the moment its applied. Its just a label. It is what you make of it.",,9f4a0e
2,"Diagnosis in mental health isn't as clear cut as say a broken arm. 
Think of it as differing opinions of why you are having difficulties rather than a stack of seperate difficulties. That will be less overwhelming to get your head around. 

If you make progress with one aspect of your life-say learning ways to reduce the severity of your distress, you are pretty much making progress with all of the diagnosis boxes at the same time.

It's not uncommon for doctors to change their mind about the cause of difficulties, if you try meds for depression for a year or so and it doesn't fix things then they start reconsidering diagnosis. 

Let the dust settle and then research and learn about BPD. Get to be informed and knowledgeable about it, don't be passively accepting - I don't mean you should be aggressive,but you should try and have a learning/growth mindset and have a plan to work to improve things. Nothing is unchangeable. 

There are subreddits for BPD, you might find useful to see if you identify with the people there.

Read somewhere that breakups for people with BPD are difficult so I googled something about coping with breakups BPD. 

Literally all I saw were people saying that their ex who had BPD ruined their life and made them feel awful. For every single person I am close to I go through intense periods of hating them so incredibly much before needing them back more than anything, and I don't know how you can love someone like that. That's the reason why I hate myself, it's more that I hate the way I feel than the person I am. I think I'm a good person at heart but I'm fucking stupid and can't just be normal.

I totally get the boredom, emptiness and the hopelessness. That's all I feel nowadays. I just want it to end.

I'm doing well in school, I'm 21 as well and in my last year for a BS in chemical engineering with a ~3.5 gpa looking at grad school for polymers or material science. My point in bringing this up isn't to try to flex on you or something obviously. It's just to tell you that you'd feel like you do now regardless how well you do in school. The solution is something else, and I just can't figure it out. From my perspective, I thought it'd be someone stable who loves you for you but it doesn't sound like that's helping you much.

Either way though, I understand what you're going through but I don't have any advice. If you need someone to talk to or vent at I'll listen, although I can be bad about remembering to respond sometimes. It's funny, I'm not busy or anything, I just feel so drained all the time. I'm hoping all of this gets better after coronavirus runs its course.",ninhnin,jzz53q

1,"Forklift, did your psychologist or psychiatrist recommend you start participating each week in an individual session and a group session of DBT or CBT? Both of those training programs will teach you the emotional skills you never had a chance to learn in childhood.

If you are having to wait for admission to a DBT program, you can make some progress on your own -- if you're very strongly self-motivated -- by acquiring a DBT workbook to start training at home.

Toward that end, I would recommend [*Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder*](https://www.amazon.com/DBT%C2%AE-Skills-Training-Manual-Second/dp/1462516998/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=marsha+linehan&qid=1642017201&s=books&sr=1-2) by Marsha Linehan and [*The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook*](http://www.newharbinger.com/bookstore/productdetails.cfm?sku=5136) by Matthew McKay, Ph.D., Jeffrey C. Wood, Psy.D., Jeffrey Brantley, MD.

A wealth of DBT information is available at [https://www.dbtselfhelp.com/](https://www.dbtselfhelp.com/), which contains many DBT videos and links to resources. This site was primarily written by pwBPD who have taken the DBT training and are describing what they experienced and learned. They also provide a list of recommended DBT workbooks. Some professionals also contribute to that site.",Up-Town,k7enub
2,I’ve been off medication and haven’t had a therapist in a long time because I my swings were getting less severe as I got older and then I lost all health insurance and life just kept happening and keeping me busy until this hit so this is really my first reach out in a long time and I would like to try to try to grasp the tools I need on my own and really build myself back up. I will look into these books thank you very much for the resources.,Madddmatforkliftroad,k7enub
3,"As I noted above, Forklift, you can make some progress on your own with the workbook and the videos at that website I cited. You would make much faster progress, however, by participating in a DBT individual training program (together with a DBT group meeting) held once a week -- under professional guidance. I wish you the very best with your progress!",Up-Town,k7enub
4,So dbt is a form of therapy where some one spots the places that I make emotional jumps and helps me identify them easier?,Madddmatforkliftroad,k7enub
0,"Congrats on seeking help, that’s really brave and vulnerable. It’s great that you know the trigger and sought to distract yourself. It sounds like, you have a great foundation. Know, that BPD is often tied to a significant trauma history. We do what we have to, in order to survive, and it ends up as BPD. You are not alone. 
It also sounds like you need someone to talk to. I dk where you’re at now, there’s lots of online based counseling services, if you can’t/it’s not safe to talk in person. ",lndsea,agi39s

2,"Thank you for your kind words. At the moment, I've been feeling in emotional turmoil -- I wanted to talk to people but at the same time, it's so hard to talk to anyone. ",Azlan-Senpai,agi39s
3,"It is! It’s really vulnerable & scary. It’s all about testing the waters first and figuring out who is safe. It can feel overwhelming, so I’ve found it helpful to start small and work my way up. 
I wish you the absolute best & congrats again on your willpower to keep pushing through. It might not be there daily or it might waiver & it’ll still be there. It’s okay to take a day to rest and get back out there the next day. ",lndsea,agi39s

1,"Thank you for sharing this. One of my exes has BPD and he struggled so much in our relationship 
.. I care about him a lot even after everything he put me through, but I can never reach out to him, I don't want to cause him any emotional pain or confusion. It took him a while but he is doing better now, without me. The best thing you can do is give yourself space. You can exist independently of your ex. I know it's hard, but working towards blocking him out completely is the best thing you can do. You're doing the right things by avoiding his insta and not texting him. Keep it up, do it for yourself!",WandaWhiter,ee6s8q
2,does it get better?,ghegs_,ee6s8q
3,"Yes it really does. My best advice is delete his number, block his number, block him on all social media. Block his friends, block that girl. Get rid of anything that reminds you of him. I had to do a whole purge because I would do basically what you said and it cause a year long manic episode and that landed me in the hospital. I attempted suicide after a really embarrassing drunk encounter with him and I thought there was no point in living anymore.

That whole year leading up to the attempt I put on this show of pretending I was okay and I felt on top of the world. And by on top of the world I mean: abusing my ambien and klonopin prescription, drinking to the point of blacking out, messaging and calling him sober and not sober, telling people how awful he is and how much better I deserve when in reality I was manipulative. He did do a lot of shitty things but I was for sure at fault but for that whole year I was in denial and it was a lot easier to just hate him

It’s been a year since I got out of IP and yes I’ve relapsed (ED)  this past year but my mood is a lot more stable. I am trying to get better, but for myself.

It gets better if you try to move forward. For me work was a really good distraction. It was my place where I knew I had to leave personal shit at the door and focus on what I’m doing (I work in the food industry and it’s very busy). I spent a lot of time with close friends as well. But forreal no contact is my best advice.",,ee6s8q

Your positive introspection will take you far. BPD is a struggle, like many of the ""Personality Disorders"", the researchers called out the faster thinkers and called them ADHD, and the super sensitive and percetones BPD, and the open high energy ones bipolar..but I digress.

Sensitivity is your super power. Use it well. Also keep reading and learning.",ghostiewm,a1wix5
