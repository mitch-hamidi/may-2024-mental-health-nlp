I've excessively looked up the symptoms and (i know they aren't a form of diagnosis) have done several test not a single one saying I don't display bpd symptoms. I have an intense fear of abandonment and in the past I have gone a bit extreme to try and keep people in my life even if they aren't good for me or if they are trying to leave. I'm constantly terrified of people hating me or changing their opinions of me. I get paranoid that people talk shit about me or I'm not important to people etc. I have rapid mood swings though most of it is internal as I'm quite quiet and I don't like causing a scene however sometimes its unavoidable with things such as panic attacks or breakdowns. I have a history of self harm and dangerous/ self sabotaging behaviours such as binge eating, drug use, not letting myself sleep even though I'm obviously tired and alcohol use. I also have feelings of complete emptiness, not feeling real and I don't really know who I am most of the time if not all of the time. Can someone tell me wether or not I display bpd symptoms or if I'm just imagining it and what I should do about it?

Really? The majority of people who experienced abuse from narcissistic parents, at least from my experience meeting people, have BPD… needless to say, I left the sub immediately, as I am no longer welcome and they obviously aren’t educated. 

Really though, it’s so disheartening. Not only are we having to constantly manage medical discrimination… but now I’m seeing an uptick in people banning us from support groups.

24,Need advice for family member with BPD. ,"
Mother is very mentally and physically ill and we need advice on coping, next steps, and medical authority in NJ. As a brief summary, she abused prescribed Xanax for 20+ years until two years ago when she decided to quit cold turkey in a rehab facility, we’ve come to realize that was not the right approach; this damaged her mental state further. She experiences intense anxiety and depression, among physical conditions, i.e., Ramsay Hunt, knee swelling, and more. 

She’s been in and out of psych facilities (short term stays), goes to group meetings (or she says she does), and sees a therapist/psychiatrist. NOTHING helps. She gets worse and worse and now she is the worst we’ve ever seen. 

She’s also a compulsive liar. At a few of the facilities, they’ve diagnosed her with Borderline Personality Disorder, her mother had Narcissistic Personality Disorder so it makes sense. She lies about everything it seems to get our attention. You can’t trust a word she says about what the doctors said, she lied about losing her job and we caught her, she lies about complying with doctors but she does the opposite, as some examples among many others. 

On top of this, when she’s home, she is not taking care of herself or her other son who is mentally disabled. She lays in bed all day, and smokes cigarettes constantly. She recently got pneumonia and a blood infection that caused her to pass out. She was in the hospital for one week now back in the psych ward for 7 days. We fear when she comes home, she will be a danger to herself, and others, because she doesnt take care of herself and she doesn’t understand what she needs to do to get better despite everyone telling her. I am working on becoming her medical authority in NJ because it’s clear she can’t make medical decisions for herself. 

We are exhausted. She constantly calls begging for us to do something and visit her but what she doesn’t realize is that’s all we are doing, supporting her, answering every call. On top of calling insurance companies, doctors, her former job, organizing finances and managing her other sons’s care. 

We are thinking she needs a long term stay at a mental hospital (3-6months at least) but she lies so much. Everytime she goes she says she is better after 1 week but NOTHING changes, honestly it seems like she is worse. 

Any advice on how to cope, next steps, medical authority in NJ. For example, if we become her medical authority, can we commit her long term? Any advice is helpful. Thank you!

27,Struggling (BPD),"Hey guys, to tell you a little backstory about me I've been struggling with Bipolar Disorder for a while now (2 coming up on 3 years, not a long time for some but it is for me) and while it was getting better recently it seems like it has been getting worse. I am a college athlete that rarely has time to talk to people about how I am feeling and what is going on in my personal life (how I act around my teammates is separate from how I feel so that I don't come off as a mood-killer and odd to some people--> this may seem like a big problem but it has pushed people from me in the past and I would like to not repeat that)  so I came on here to ask/vent and get other opinions.

I recently have been feeling worse than I have in a while, its been harder for me to do things and it seems like the smallest or most subtle inconvenience for makes me feel the worst feelings that I can muster. I have been off medication for around 10 months now and up until this last month I had been feeling more put together, more positive, and overall great. Feeling this way has thrown me back into a place that I never want/wanted to visit again and I don't know how to cope. On one hand it seems that I should talk to a doctor, the doctor might get me back on track with medication as they did the first time which theoretically should solve the problem. On the other hand the reason that I stopped taking medication in the first place was because it made me feel unnatural, like I wasn't human and the only thing that was giving me these emotions was a little white pill just like a script would do to a computer. I know this view of medication is far from the truth and these medications help many people in many different situations but in mine that's just how it made me feel and I hated every second of it.

They say the hardest things in life are the most rewarding, does anyone have any advice that they could offer to me should I keep walking this path and hope it gets better with willpower alone or should I seek an alternate method such as therapy and doctors visits.

Like for instance, right now as I type this, my stomach is grumbling (and feels empty) but I just can’t be bothered getting anything to eat — it almost feels like it’s a waste of time preparing a meal and that I should be spending my time doing other productive things. This happens mostly when I’m at work, although it does happen a lot of home too. 

Is this common with BPD? The moment I think about it in-depth my brain just tries to convince me that I’m lazy. Surely I cannot be the only one!",1707882595.0,False,2,1,omgitsdemi,None,1aqdhyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1aqdhyx/bpd_issues_with_meals/

And all of my friendships have been unstable, mainly because I can be pretty sensitive and lash out at others, Ive fucked up a few of them because of my anger issues and paranoia of them not being genuine. I think I'm a people pleaser? At least I can't really communicate my feelings because I always feel like I'm going to be looked at as a narcissist. I can put others on a pedestal too much and that messes things up a lot.

34,BPD and MDD,"BPD: I’m currently watching like 3 different shows that I’ve seen a million times. And none of them are filling that void for me like they usually do. I’m literally bored but, not the bored of “I want to go hangout with someone” it’s a kind of boredom I can’t fill, no matter what I do. I literally feel nothing, at all. My mind is spinning with a million thoughts in my head, but I can’t seem to get them out somewhere. It’s like my brain is all jumbled and I can’t think straight. I feel like I’m stuck in a void, that doesn’t get better. It’s like I’m constantly going backwards, not forwards. I feel stuck all the time. I feel like my emotions are constantly disregulated, I feel like I’m spiralling into a BPD episode(it’s more quiet than anything tho). Most days I can barely leave my bed, because of how depressed, overwhelmed and exhausted I feel. I really wonder if therapy is working for me or it’s just making me worse? Part of me, wants to quit therapy because it doesn’t feel like it’s working…but then again, I don’t want to. I like therapy, and it’s nice to have someone to talk to about my struggles.

 MDD: Major depressive disorder is a hard thing to live with too. I’m newly diagnosed with it. I’ve had depression my whole life but MDD is new for me.

35,Does my girlfriend have BPD?,"So things with my girlfriend have been quite great as of last night. I went to see her on her lunch break, we joked, we laughed, she bought me a pastry, I teased her about giving her something extra special for Valentine's Day (we have spent more than a week planning what we're going to do on Valentine's day and the day before since it's holiday in our country) and after an afternoon of work we were sending each other dumb memes. Also, last saturday I met her mom for the first time. So, all in all I have been living fairy tale recently

Then, close to midnight she sent me an article about uterus cancer with lots of facts that I didn't know and I replied that I had found the article ''interesting''. Somehow she took this to mean that I had found the article ''interesting'' in a ''it made me laugh'' kind of way when it was really just an off-hand remark. Apparently she had wanted me to engage in some sort of deep and serious conversation about a type of cancer that she had never before shown any interest in (that I know of) and that, as a man, I can't be affected by anyhow (not to say that it wasn't an interesting issue because it was). I was obviously baffled by this and said I was sorry. Then she started giving short answers like ''I don't want to talk, I'm tired, Leave me alove''. This is usually her pattern: she says something, I don't respond how she expected, she lambasts me and then completely shuts down and refuses to talk to me for 24 hours or so. At this point I just let her cool off and don't try to force the issue

This type of stuff (extreme mood swings) happens quite frequently and probably isn't even in the top 10 stupidest things we've had fights about. She will often start talking a topic out of nowhere, I won't respond in the exact way that she expected and wil immediately resort to shouting, calling names and adopting extreme positions like saying that I ''care about nothing and am insensitive''. This literally happens two lines of diologue into a conversation...

I suspect she might have BPD or be bipolar or something. I really don't know as I'm not an expert on that. She has repeatedly refused to see a therapist and any sort of conversation about it tends to shut her up

I’m an only daughter amidst 4 brothers, 3 are 23+ years old. My parents can’t even sit in the same room together, they’re planning on a divorce. Living separate lives as if they’re two neighbors in one building. Vaping is self harm and it’s preyed upon in Islam, harming yourself physically is forbidden. All my older brothers do it, my dad too. Our house never bonds with one another even during our best of holidays (Eid). I mean we never sit together in one room, if we meet one another we act like distant friends. I’ve been sexually assaulted once when I was younger, and harassed twice by two different relatives. To maintain our family’s stand, I withhold that fact to make sure no further incidents occur. I’m a devoted Muslim, I pray five times a day, respect everyone, very trusting in God and what fate he had for me. I’ve been drowning in my sorrows this year and due to previous nicotine encounters with my sibling I tried to vape. It helped me a lot, it calmed me down, it set my brain right. The thing with BPD is that we have intense anger issues, we can burst out at any minute and harm either other or ourselves. Another thing abut the disorder is unstable self image and constant fear of abandonment. I’ve struggled losing valuable friendships and loved ones my entire life. BPD made me laugh at my grandmas funeral. Not because I didn’t care or love her, but because I took in the shock so fast. BPD makes you accept shocks no matter how big. Here comes the core of my post, I confessed that I vaped to my mom. She said that I was trash, she said if she ever saw me do it I won’t be her daughter anymore, and she’d leave the house once and for all. I know my mom’s threats, what she said was plain and discreet. She meant every word. I got addicted to nicotine. I respect her so much that I took the entire stash and thee it in front of her. To the extent that I forgot a pod in my room, never considered touching it despite my intense desire to do so. I’m traveling between the strings of addiction and the fear of losing her. I don’t wanna lose my mom. I haven’t cried in months and my tear just dropped writing this. My mom was the only person I was determined to stay with me, my BPD never interconnected with her.

Wasn’t sure how to word this one, so google helped me. But I idealize someone one moment and then I suddenly feel like they don’t care about me.
I also feel empty constantly. (Although I do have depression so maybe that’s it?)

But anyways, there are moments that I have with my boyfriend where if he doesn’t do something exact, or doesn’t do what he said he would do, it triggers me and sadness just takes over me completely. I say things that I don’t mean, or I type things I didn’t think about before sending. 
For example, my boyfriend said he would call me at 10 pm, and he didn’t. I waited over an hour and then I started feeling really intense sadness and somewhat started being aggressive towards him even though I wasn’t angry.

49,Signs of BPD in a young woman? ,"Thank you for your time and consideration. I’d truly appreciate if anyone gave advice.

TW - self destructive behavior 

I (17F) have experienced some horrible nervous breakdowns in the last few years, the worst lasting around four-five months and was so severe I could barely take care of myself. It’s usually self isolation, self destructive habits (self harm, suicidal ideation), being extremely on edge and sensitive to any changes in routine, violence, or confrontation. 

The worst was where I could barely eat, and if I did I’d throw it up right after. It wasn’t a physical sickness, but the most intense and soul-crushing anxiety you can think of. I completely spiraled. Couldn’t leave the house without having an anxiety attack. Missed so much school my coordinator had to get involved, my grades dropped substantially, I’d sleep 12-14 hours a day because being unconscious was better than the maelstrom I felt.

I’ve blown up a lot recently, but it might be due to the suppressal of emotions. I live in a household that’s very tense. My father has anger issues, and has said and done some pretty nasty things. My mother blames me for a lot of things wrong, and tends to justify my father’s behavior. Both are aware I self harm, neither care. 

This could very well be the symptoms of living in such a household, as well as hormones and stress. I feel so empty and null, while other days I live off the high of false self-elation and constant media consumption. Relapsing, trying to understand if I exist as a person made of flesh and blood, or cutting myself because I want to ‘repent’. I have very strong feelings of self hatred, shame and guilt I’ve carried most my life.

53,Could I have BPD?,"TW: SOME TALK ABOUT SELFH*RM AND ATTEMPTING

Lately I’ve been thinking I could be having a form of BPD (borderline personality disorder) I have done some tests online and the answers I’ve gotten is likely to have it. I know they aren’t accurate but I just wanted to see. Though I have looked up like symptoms and signs of having BPD and I’m kinda conflicted with it.

When I have looked at the symptom there are a lot that I have like fear of abandonment, lack of sense of self (I have change my life goals drastically as well as made some major career changes before), mood swings from irritability/anger to sadness and stress, paranoia when stressed, feeling depressed and empty sometimes, and sometimes have a hard time controlling anger. One that has me a bit iffy is it has says people with BPD experience impulsive behaviour and they list impulsive behaviour with sex, SH, substances, binge eating, gambling and spending. I do have impulsiveness when it comes to eating and spending money, I’ve never had thought of harming myself or using drugs or alcohol (I do have a drink here and there but that’s it) 

As well I’ve looked and seen a lot of people with BPD try to attempt or harm themselves and end up in the hospital due to having sh tendency’s. 

My issue is I have never had a thought of trying to harm myself or end my life, but my issue is I have never had a thought of trying to harm myself or end my life, but majority of the things that are listed for symptoms of BPD. I relate to, and some of the questions that I would answer in some online assessments would be agree most of the time else. 

Even though I do not have those impulsive thoughts to harm myself, or use substances impulsively, could I still potentially have could I still potentially have BPD?

I want to clarify that I am planning on going to my doctor to talk about this since I know I can get the most accurate diagnosis from my doctor, and the online tests aren’t as accurate. I just wanted to do them just to see so then I can reference it to my doctor saying I have done these tests I know they’re not accurate but it did say I could potentially have it",1703041949.0,False,2,0,Captainsquishi,None,18mkeqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18mkeqi/could_i_have_bpd/
54,Dad won't recognize my BPD,"When I was 16, I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I'm 27 by now, so I've been living with bpd for over 10 years. I've done tons of therapy, spent a hell lot of time in mental hospitals and other therapeutic facilities again and again. Thanks to therapy I turned from a violent, extremely impulsive, manipulative teenager with a suicidal tendencies into a mostly stable introverted adult, managing my everyday life in a rational, machine like manner. I take my meds, got a girlfriend and a job and my life is kinda ok, but I still experince BPD symptoms like reoccurring severe identity problems, a strong lack of self confidence, episodes of paranoia and a tendency towards impulsive, self harming descision making (like leaving university within a matter of days without a backup plan, just cause I failed thermodynamics a second time). 

Now here is the issue: 
Ever since my parents divorced (20 years ago), my dad and me got a kinda difficult relationship. At least it's difficult for me. I feel like he never accepted that I have BPD, even though I tried to explain it to him many times, but somehow he still seems to not accept it. When I was in psychiatry he used to say that I wanted to go there and back in the days he asumed, that I just didn't go to school. He keeps saying things like I should change my attitude, blames my mom, cause she spoiled me and so on. I'm pretty sure most of these things come from his wife, since she already told me, that I shouldn't see a psychiatrist, cause they just wanna fill me up with pills from the pharma companies and that I got a problem with authorities (which I honestly don't, I just got a problem with people in general), cause she was to anti-authoritarian, that she should have beaten me sometimes and so on. Besides I know from my uncle, what she used to say about me, when I'm not there (things that are not quite nice). 
Now I don't wanna loose my dad, but I feel like I can't go on like that. I keep thinking about him all day long, especially at work and I can't focus. Even my boss already critizised me for my dropping performance.
But I'm so afraid to come up with that topic again, cause I know it will cause more trouble. But he keeps beeing sarcastic, he even wrote a song about me, mocking me for quitting university. 
I had a really hard time around that time, which ended up in an episode of paranoia, where I thought I was surveilled by the cops, cause they think I'm a terrorist or sth. He still keeps mocking me for that from time to time and I'm pretty sure he thinks I was faking it or went to psychiatry cause I didn't want to work or sth. I hate it, cause it really hurts and makes things worse and always adds additional problems whenever I'm already having a bad time.

I just don't know what to do and will be greatful for any (well intended) advice. Feel free to ask me anything, if you need further information.

55,Could my boyfriend have BPD?,"
I don’t want to be an armchair psychiatrist but I’m not sure what else to do. I also have a close friend with BPD so I have some experience. Basically we’ve been seeing each other since July but made it official in November so like 6 months of dating. I’ve started to notice some behavior patterns.  

First of all he did have a traumatic childhood, his biological father was abusive to his mom when he was a baby but he was out of the picture early on. However his step dad who raised him was just as bad, he told me his parents would fight everyday and his dad would physically abuse his mom as well as verbally. He would basically tell her she had no where to go because he knew people in the police force but regardless the cops were constantly called on them. He was also a serial cheater and narcissistic according to him, he completely blames their divorce on his mom even though he was the perpetrator of their issues. His mom isn’t perfect either both is parents kind of use him for money and just don’t seem like loving people compared to my parents and other parents I’ve known. 

First thing I have noticed is whenever we argue it’s way more intense than any other relationship I’ve been in. He tells me he wants to communicate but when I try to it’s like he has this black and white thinking. Like he sees me as “bad” or a threat in that moment. He’ll even bring up breaking up when it’s never that serious to me. It honestly feels like he wants to break up with me before I will with him. He told me he has abandonment issues from his past. He also has been cheated on before.

One thing he always tells me is that he feels emotionally numb, and especially when he feels like I hurt him in some type of way. Like he will feel this numbness towards me for days at the time when the whole time I think we are moving past things. Like there will be a fast shift.

He is also extremely moody and has bad mood swings like his reactions to things are disproportionate to what they should be. Like something that I may see as slightly annoying or a slight inconvenience seems like the world is ending  to him. 

 A breakout incident for me happened a few months ago. He walked in our room, I was smiling at my phone. I was honestly just looking at embarrassing stuff on Reddit and didn’t think much of it. But he was convinced I was doing something shady or talking to someone and it blew up in my face. What is crazy is a month later I go on his phone and see he was talking to some girl a week and a half after that incident. It lasted like two days but it hurt so bad seeing that. He tells me it was a moment of weakness and he literally was convinced I was doing something and it made him want to distance himself from me and self sabotage us. 

You can see how from my perspective this looks, like you are scared I am doing something, I know I am not, so you do the same thing you don’t want me doing. But I’m trying to understand. 

It just seems like whenever he is convinced I am doing something he acts out and self sabotages and I love him but it is taxing on me. 

He talks about all these traits like they are unique to him but I see them as BPD symptoms. I think it would be hard for him to even realize it as he grew up in one of those “mental health lt isn’t real” type households. He also has diagnosed ADHD but his mom never let him get treatment for it. So I’m also curious if anyone here has BPD and ADHD and how they effect each other.

My bottomline is how do I bring this up to him? It does feel like I’m walking on eggshells sometimes and I don’t want him to feel like I’m attacking him. I am just concerned bc the way he acts really doesn’t feel normal. And I feel like he needs to get help if we are going to work on our relationship and be healthy.

57,BPD in Australia. Seeking help.,"I am after real responses from people diagnosed with BPD. Preferably from Australians, as rural Australian health care for MH issues is ‘challenging’.

I was diagnosed 8-9 years ago, later in life (29). I did DBT. I did therapy multiple times until each time I was discharged for being too well. I haven’t had a therapist since late 2019.

My life has crumbled slowly, I am now at personal rock bottom. I’ve destroyed all family relationships, countless friendships. 

Last night I took my last shreds of dignity and presented to the emergency department for help. I was discharged this morning due to my poor attitude. 

Please help me. Someone, please help me find an avenue to get better because I do not see any way that my life can improve or how I can get back things that I have lost.

I can never really make a decision on what I want for the long term. It fees weird that this happens with my phone numbers and sometimes devices…I really don’t think it’s about the electronics. Lol. I guess it’s more of a question of if others with BPD do weird shit with communication pathways. I deleted all my social media too. I do it for a couple years at a time and then make new accounts and sometimes back and forth for months deactivating and activated Facebook and instagram, etc…I suppose I ghost the world for as long as possible and come back when I’m ready.

78,Ex has undiagnosed BPD and I feel stuck,"I hope this is the right place to post something like this, but I felt like I needed to let out what I've been going through for the past little while. Using an alt for obvious reasons and changing the numbers around a bit.

So I (35M) has been married to my husband (31M) for 6 years now and have been together for 7 in Canada. Our relationship for the most part has had a lot of ups and downs but the biggest issues for me was that he felt really immature. I thought it would be something he would grow out of and he has improved over the years, but the growth had been slow for the most part.

Some examples of things I've had to deal with is the lack of sex because he says he's never in the mood or is too lazy to do it. We would have sex on average about twice a year. Whenever I tried explaining how important this is to me and asking for solutions or work arounds, like opening up the relationship or having him stop jerking off. I'm always met with, I can't help it, you only want sex from me, or I handle anyone else having sex with you.

Another issue is his lack of saving, and always needing to buy the newest gadget/computer/phone. He claims he's always depressed and that buying these things makes him happy. For myself, I'm fairly conservative with my spending and would only buy things when I really need it or it would greatly improve my lifestyle. I rarely spend on new stuff like clothes and the like unless they become worn out or broken. I make double what he makes and we split expenses accordingly, but he never seems to be able to save any money and complains how we never get to go on vacations and that our lives are so boring and that we never do anything.

I could go on about other issues, but bringing it back to the break up. He has broken up with me many  times throughout the years. Majority of them only for a few days but the longest was 3 months while we still lived together. Those 3 months I never felt so free and able to do anything I wanted without having to think about anyone else. During this time, he took a month long trip back to his home country and ended up spending all his money. He also tried reconnecting with his Ex but came to the same realization that he really still loved me. He came back and begged me to take him back promising to change and I gave in with conditions. Those were, marriage counselling, sex at least once every 2 months, failing that he must be willing to let me find sex elsewhere.  Being the pushover that I am, none of them were met for another 2 years up until this point.

During this past summer I ended up meeting someone new and got along with them very well. We became fast friends and my husband became very jealous of this new person. He would always complain when my friend would message me, stop me from seeing him alone, and we would often get into arguments over this person. As far as I'm concerned, even if I had feelings for this person, I never would have acted on them and my friend likewise. It was just nice having someone I could talk and relate to for once. Someone who I felt more as an equal instead of someone I had to take care of. I finally had enough of being controlled regarding who I can talk to and decided to finally end things once and for all. He did not take it well at all. The past 2 months were a flurry of his emotions going haywire. A lot of anger, depression, love bombing, changing himself and his habits 180. He pretty much overnight started wanting sex, playing the same games and being interested in the same hobbies as me, started wanting to work out and meal prep. He immediately reconnect with old friends he had cut out and apologized to them. Wanted to learn how to communicate better and listen to me instead of being defensive and accusatory. However whenever I would reject his advances, he would blow up get depressed and talk about killing himself and killing my friend because he is 100% convinced the friend is the reason we are breaking up, (which I admit he was a catalyst).

The problem is that I believe he is capable of acting out his threats. He says his friends purchase illegal drugs and he had got the dealers contact to purchase a gun. At night he would hug me but at the same time say how much he hates my friend and how he needs to get rid of him cause everything is his fault. He says how he has nothing left in life to live for and that he has already achieved everything he wanted so he's ready to kill himself too. He doesn't want to and believes he won't be able to handle living life without me. He has hurt himself out of anger and left clear bruises. He says he would never hurt me but only wants to kill my friend and himself.

So now I just feel stuck and trapped. Since our break up, I've promised and have cut all contact with my friend to give my husband time to move on from me before I leave. I was still talking with him in the beginning but we were caught when he decided to record the house while he was away. It lead to a huge blow up with him calling the friend using my phone and basically insulting him and telling him to leave us alone. I've also found an air tag in my car and he would occasionally check my phone. He has since admitted that the extra time he needed me to stay around was for him to try to prove he has changed to win me back.

Surprisingly, the ads on social media must have picked up on the things he's been looking up and it showed him an ad about Borderline Personality Disorder. We both looked up the symptoms of the illness and realized he checks off all of them. As of now, I've promised to extend my stay with him as long as he finds help through a psychologist but honestly if he doesn't believe they can help him, then probably nothing would help him move on. If I were to leave, I don't trust him to not act out and I don't trust the system to prevent anything from happening until its too late.

Sorry this was so long but thank you for reading up until this point, I really needed to let this all out and I'm at a loss of how I can live my life and be happy.",1706812431.0,False,1,4,expartnerBPD,None,1aghzdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1aghzdn/ex_has_undiagnosed_bpd_and_i_feel_stuck/
79,I think I have undiagnosed BPD and I can't afford to get any help.,"I (23f) think I am struggling with BPD and slowly getting worse. But I want to know what others might think as well. I'm completely open to being possibly wrong but I won't know for sure until I can afford a doctor. 

I could go into my whole life story, but I won't unless people actually wanna know. So I'm going to just explain why I think I have BPD and how its effecting me now. 

All 9 main symptoms, I have. I'm sad to say there's not one that I don't have. My moods are unstable, I'm constantly paranoid about people being out to get/hurt me, or leave me. I'm extremely attached to my boyfriend to the point that I don't want him to be away from me at all, I have all or nothing thinking, everything is either good or bad and no inbetween. I have had issues with impulsivity, just because I want to feel something, or to distract my brain. I feel chronically empty all the time, only to switch back to being fine not long later. That, or suddenly every emotion I've ever felt rushs into me all at once and makes me feel out of control. My sense of self is so unstable that I question my feelings and sometimes even more own likes and dislikes. I feel confused all the time, and lately my anger has been more explosive than ever.

If I do have BPD, I'm pretty sure I know the cause. This feels dramatic to say, but there isn't a single type of abuse I haven't had done to me. Most notably, I was a victim of SA for about a decade by my stepfather, and my mother was always very emotionally absent. Not to mention other counts of physical abuse from other family members and mental abuse by just about all mentioned. There are so many other things that have happened to me, and that's why I think all of it is the cause.

I want to clarify that I have tried to just 'let go' of it. And with some things I have succeeded, but with others I'm still trying to find ways to cope with different issues, and its a struggle every day.

As of lately, My attachment to my boyfriend has gotten worse. For context, we lost our apartment about two months ago, and had to move in with his parents. I've gotten so bad to the point that he hardly has time to chat with his friends anymore, and now I'm becoming upset when he wants to spend time with his family. When I don't want to be doing this at all.

I never intend to do any of this. I don't want to do it. The longer I think about it I'm come to realize that I don't feel safe without him, but don't understand why I get so jealous either, especially when I don't want to be. I feel embarrassed of how I act, because it feels like I'm not in control of it. I'm terrified of being that girlfriend that isolates her boyfriend from his loved ones. I'm scared of being controlling. I'm scared of being abusive. I'm scared of being manipulative and not knowing, I'm so scared that I'm going to destory him mentally. 

I'm trying everyday to fight this and be better. I love him more than anything, and I want him to be my husband. Its just hard when you can't afford any sort of help. And even if I had options, I genuinely don't know how to get it. But I have to figure it out on my own, and I will.

Right now, I just want an opinion. What do you think this is? Do you think this is BPD, or something else? If more information is needed I can definitely give more.

I never really post anything in public. I never really try to talk to people either, so please be easy on me. This is the first time I've reached out for help from strangers on the Internet, and I already feel like I've made a fool of myself, or sound like a narcissist. But still, any opinions are appreciated.",1714216560.0,False,3,10,Miss_Seri777,None,1cec4ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cec4ay/i_think_i_have_undiagnosed_bpd_and_i_cant_afford/
80,Break up and possible bpd of my partner ,"
I had a breakup yesterday with my partner, cause she asked for it all angry and hateful.

She’s been considered to have a bpd but not severe enough syntoms to get a diagnose, she still needs to see the psychiatrist again. 

Since I’ve met her 1.5 year ago, we went through cycles of love and almost idealization of my person to then get to an angry and deprecation state where she claims not being loved or prioritized and all gets very extreme for me to understand or validate even. I’ve seen her drink loads to avoid images of suicide or seen her hit her head against the wall after insulting me or grabbing me strongly by the wrists. 
 She offered coke many times even though she knew I didn’t want it and arrived drunk even though I asked her please don’t do that, I don’t drink that much and I’m really focusing on sports and being healthy. She’s been able to see that and say sorry and try to stop those behaviors. Actually she stopped drinking three months ago and I though ok this is huge!this will end problems and we will be able to understand each other. Nevertheless we didn’t stop having arguments all the time cause I really don’t know what to do and I try to explain that I do love her but that sets her off cause she thinks I’m defending myself . It’s like even stupid things can lead to a “you don’t love me, I’m stupid enough to give you all and you are just selfish and loveless”. I guess is because I can’t plan for the future when we are having all these tensions and cycles, but she is able to talk about moving together even minutes after a huge emotional ride.
I need more space and she needs support or being together much more than me. I tried to give her that but also give myself the space I need, but there’s always another problem arising. 

 My heart really breaks every time, I also saw myself getting super frustrated and angry and I wasn’t like that! I’m starting to not recognize myself, like I’ve been holding back a lot to not set her off. 

But here we are again, now breaking up. I’m super sad cause I love her a lot, but I’m asking myself if I can really help her or be her partner. I feel this is hurting me so much and maybe creating resentment in me that I don’t know if I’ll be able to overcome. I got lost into almost thinking I’m a bad person but then on the same day she’s sorry and regretful and wants to get back together. 

I don’t know what am I looking with this post, maybe some guidance , understanding, advice.

81,manic episode/bpd advice. really need help please,"hi I'm making this post because someone very close to me has been suffering heavily from manic episodes due to their bpd (possible bpd split?) and our relationship is very long distance so I can't help them via physical touch. 

I made this account and I'm posting on here mainly for help and advice because I'm also mentally ill (severe depression and anxiety) but I want to help as much as I can because a lot has been going on with them lately and articles online aren't much help to me since they aren't specific enough.

they haven't been eating or sleeping lately and I'm busy myself so I can't always keep track of their habits and behavior, but I wanna know about things I could/should/shouldn't say, how to encourage them to eat and rest, etc.

thank you so much in advance. I'm really worried about them.

85,I was diagnosed with BPD on the second meeting.,"This is more of a rant if anything, but it's an issue that I just can't seem to get out of my head. 

My new psychiatrist told me on our first session that I couldn't be diagnosed with anything until I had a brain scan and overall intense screening. (the context was above 18 now and could be diagnosed with a disorder instead of 'unspecified mood disorder'. However on the second or third visit when I asked for a written document so I could receive accomations at my college they put down 'borderline personality disorder'. The only thing in my head was 'Was I this mentally ill?'. The symptoms I believe I stated that caused them to come to this conclusion was my habit of going into a self-destructive mode when things got too intense. On the occasions when I tried to draw my brain would scream at me to start to doing SH. The psychiatrist would often ask me about my relationships a lot, mostly just about how I was so estranged from everybody I talked to. Or that I considered most people acquaintances and not friends. 

I was wondering if anybody else here has gone through a similar situation before. ",1710262973.0,False,1,0,boysinberry,None,1bd2dj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1bd2dj2/i_was_diagnosed_with_bpd_on_the_second_meeting/
86,Some Hope for my bpd friend,"Hi everyone, first Merry christmas to all that celebrate it, and happy New year in advance !

I got diagnosed with bpd last year as I was in a psychiatric hospital for chronic depression. It was a relief and a bad news, because I finally knew what was wrong with me, but I learn in the same time I would never heal. Borderline personality disorder is ont something that goes away, it will stay with me forever.

Some days are terrible, I wake up feeling like it is the worst day in my life, I just want to end it. A good friend of mine died recently, and my boyfriend of four years left me just before : for a few weeks I felt horrible, I cried almost everyday thinking this time I would finally end my life and my suffering. But I was stronger than I thought, and I got throught it, and now here I am.

Today it's Christmas and I'm with my family, happier than ever. I laught, I drink some apple juice and I make jokes to my cousins, and I'm feeling so well. I know that in a day or two I will feel worst, and maybe be at my lowest, because that is my disease, but now, now I feel great, and I try to just live in the moment.

To all my bpd Friends. It's hard, it's so hard. But some moments are worth it. Keep trying to get better, and you'll have some peace eventualy.

88,I hate myself for having cptsd and bpd,"Like the title says...

Hi, I'm Yuu and I'm currently 24 years old. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD at the age of 10. I was send to a therapist due to a dog attack. In June/July 2020 I was diagnosed with BPD but I didn't got treatment for it. 

I was in and out of a clinic for traumatherapy in 2021, wich I didn't finished due to the facility removing the only traumatherapist they had, so I sadly couldn't finished it. But for me it was okay, because I felt better. I didn't feel ready to work yet, but not as miserable anymore as I started the therapy. I didn't continue therapy because it was hard to find a therapist where I lived.

A little bit of backstory there ablut therapy, bcs I know it is important. 

Anyway, I really thought I did well.....well...I don't. While my CPTSD got better and I can control it most of the time, my BPD got worse. I just realized that I started splitting on a regular basis over the last year and I hate myself for that...I am scared to loose my ex (he is a very important person in my life and we kinda try to fix our relationship), even tho he can't show me any affection atm since he struggles with mental health hinself and I am no help, since I crave his attention and love and wanna feel loved by him. But his behavior triggers my BPD, but I can't just leave because, like I said, he is very important to me. I hate myself that I can't control my BPD, because when I split I ruin everything. I don't want this anymore and I have the feeling I am responsible for what happend to me that caused all that shit....I just hate myself....I can't even maintain a fucking friendship, yet a relationship bcs of that. I just want to be happy and loved...is that to much to ask for?

And yes, I am on the search for a therapist and even consider going back to the clinic even tho I don't want to go into a clinic again.",1705535316.0,False,1,2,LilaChoi,None,199bnen,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/199bnen/i_hate_myself_for_having_cptsd_and_bpd/
89,BPD Fear of Abandonment,"I've been suspecting that I might have bpd for a while now (however due to circumstances am unable to get a professional diagnosis or opinion) However I dont externalise my emotions. As a kid I was ignored or punished for externalising negative emotions so I just don't, anymore. And most posts I see about bpd experiences seem to only apply to folks who emote outwardly. Anyway back to the main reason I'm writing this post, I've been talking to someone for 2 weeks and in such a short amount of time I have become infatuated and enamored with them, I'll just refer to them as A. A lives in a time zone 8 hours behind my own, so most of our interactions happen either early morning or mid evening (my time)   Despite all this, even knowing that they're likely just sleeping but I still get all worked up and anxious if they don't answer, a fear that they don't like me- even hate me.
Like I'm terrified of not being important, loved or wanted. Like I don't know who I am, if I'm not important to someone or loved by them. Like I said it's only been 2 weeks but I don't know if it's infatuation, love or obsession. I'm not sure I know the difference.

A mentioned that they had started going to bed earlier and I mentioned that I'm glad that was the case because I convinced myself that they hated me, and they replied that if that was the case I should just ask for reassurance. And I replied that I didn't want them to have to reassure me all the time, and they said that if I'm constantly worried that they'll leave and and that they hate me that it wouldn't be healthy and has a chance to turn toxic and I panicked. It sounded like they were going to leave and it felt like suffocating, and was a heavy weight on my chest so I promised that I communicate, and do anything to make it work. Now Im worried that I seem clingy and desperate.

90,My BPD has ruined my life.,"I have officially reached rock bottom.
I'm at the point with Borderline Personality Disorder. Where I'm desperately trying to figure out if it's the world, or if it's me that's the problem? Am I just the result of poor circumstances? Should I have given up a long time ago?
Am I stupid, am I selfish? Do I have irrational fears that keep me from doing every day self care, or am I just a lazy bum? Am I just a stoner? Is keeping my sobriety worth it?
There's so many questions I ask myself.
Where am I with my relationship with God? Is He disappointed in me? Has he given up on me, like everyone else seems to have. It seems like EVERYONE and I mean everyone has given up on me. Rightfully so, it's been 5 months since I've had a job. I have it rock bottom, as rock bottom can get. I had an amazing life a year ago. I had a great job, and I had a great apartment. I blew it. I just want to know WHY, WHY did I fail every single person who believed in me... and blew my perfect life??? I feel like giving up, I feel like there is no getting out of this. I feel like I destroy everything I touch.
I don't know what to do anymore. Because I have run out of people who believe in me, or even want me around.
Everyone should drop me, I have nothing to offer anymore.
I'm just a bum I suppose. People close to me say, oh you can turn it around. There's no turning around. I'm drowning in debt, anxiety, depression. I don't even want to get out of bed, I don't want to eat, I don't want to drink. If I just lay here, everything will be ok. Even if I could turn it around, I have no idea where to start. Who would hire an idiot loser like me? Who would take a chance in me? I'm shame to my family, and I'm a shame to anyone who ever supported me.
Maybe I just need to accept I'II never amount to anything.

I'm about to lose my car, my girlfriend, and my mom is about to kick me out to the street. I'm so lost I have no idea what to do. My life is over, there's nothing left for me.
All I do is get angry, and I split on everyone all of the time.
I break things when I get angry, I yell at my girlfriend. I insult and yell at my friend who goes to visit his dying mother instead of playing online with me on the weekend.
Because he is the only thing that distracts me from my endless list of problems. The medicine isn't working, I can't use Delta 8 THC, they won't give me Xanax.

91,Do i have bpd?,"

I just want to tell you why i think i may have bpd and what got me into it, so if you can help, tell me if this could be bpd or not. i don't have access to therapy so i can't get professionals thoughts  on it , i know without professional it is practically improssible to know for sure  and there is not much you can say but i just want to know if   this could be it (i should probably  add that i am 17 and i know at this age you cant really get diagnosed with it but still...).

 I have always described myself as an ustable person and one time i was watching a movie and in that movie they described this one girl as an ustable, and as someone who changes her mind often and as someone who doesn't really know exactly what they want and something like that and they said that she had bpd, so this description felt a little too personal so i decided to get more information about bpd, when i read the symptoms, some of them made so much sense , some of them not so much. The ones that really made me think about it was the chronic feelings of emptiness and  unstable self- image or sense of self. I have always felt empty and i feel like no matter what i do, nothing will fill this void inside me, it just follows me.also i have never really understood who i was, in the past it was hard to even say what did i do in my free time and what my hobbies were, it got better, now i think i know what i enjoy doing in my free time but still i have this weird feeling like i don't know who i am and i cant even describe this feeling very well. I  have never attempted suicide, i used to self harm but i never intended to harm myself seriously, it was just the way of dealing with everything.it was the way of grounding myself and the way to fight my emptiness.I know that dissociation is one of the symptoms of bpd but my dissociation is so bad that i think i may have separate disorder like DPDR i have the feeling like i have had this my whole life and its just constant there is no time where it goes away. These are the thing that i strongly relate but there are also things that i dont relate or don't know if i relate or not. For example fear of abandonment, in my childhood i was not abandoned, i don't really understand if i have this or not. I feel like people with fear of abandonment are kinda clingy but i am totally opposite, if i have the feeling that someone doesn't want to spent time with me and they are about to abandon me ( i cant really trust my feeling about these things cause even slightest things makes me think that they want to abandon me) i get really distant, i try to totally cut them out of my life. Communication is real problem for me, especially when it comes to my feelings. I am not sure about the emotional instabiliy either, i feel like under my every feeling and emotion  is just again emptiness. I dont know about splitting either, it is really hard for me to connect with poeple and to be comfortable with them so i can't really express my emotions that clearly towards them, i have this one close friend, and sometimes i feel really amazed by them and i am glad that i am friends with them and other times i feel  idk how to say but like almost disgusted by them. I dont know if it is bpd thing or just regular. People with bpd are really expressive and explosive and things like that and i am nothing like that, that makes me think that i dont have it.I never express anger, a lot of people have said that they have never seen me angry or even upset. i wouldn't say that i have a problem with controlling my emotions.

95,Nobody takes my psychosis seriously because I’m diagnosed with BPD 😞,"I don’t have BPD- I have 2 out of the 9 diagnostic criteria hat you have to have at least 5 of to be diagnosed. I’m in a a debate with myself over wether or not I used to have BPD and am in remission? But tbh nobody has ever asked me anything to do with my diagnosis and I keep asking for a second opinion doctor, which is my right, to get a reassessment, but they aren’t playing ball and I might have to go to an advocate.

I have complex-PTSD, autism, agoraphobia and anxiety which a lot of health professionals agree with they just won’t fucking diagnose me with it.

Anyway, I have talked in great detail about vivid audial/visual/tactile hallucinations and they just ignore that part and talk about my emotions and I’m like yeah the hallucinations are causing the intense negative emotions? 

Also the part that makes it most fun is that because my primary diagnosis is BPD, I can’t go with a more intense and involved team because I don’t have a “serious mental illness” as my primary diagnosis (my country is so backwards)

I would love to type out and vent all of my hallucinations and how much they torture me, because nobody irl listens… if I was diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar etc then they would listen. But no, I have BPD- not a serious mental illness, which brings with it dismissive health professionals and it’s just so shit. Idk I just needed to vent 😬

About a month ago, she overdosed and had to stay in a psychiatric facility for a whole month. She came back four days ago, and I noticed that she was way colder than usual. She's always sleeping, and whenever we talk on the phone, she just replies with usual stuff like 'wow,' 'damn,' 'literally me.' We went on a date yesterday, and she was so impulsive (I'm impulsive myself, lol), but she was cold.

99,Marriage Help (BPD/DID),"When we met wife was apparently (atleast one of two alters) adventurous even if reserved with others. Had sexual stuff like a butt plug and mentioned wearing it on occasion during the day. Was very sexual and couldn't get enough, we'd sneak around even. I was married when we met, then separated when we started speaking after a 5 month hiatus. After we got together officially (moved in) all this stuff she wanted but wasn't comfortable expressing stopped. In hind sight she tried but I'd shut it down, invalidate it, and completely push her away. Even made comments about finding her attractive. The BPD in me kept telling me she actually didn't want me or feel the same way (turns out she felt the same way but didn't think I did). Cue 3 years of me pushing away and yelling, she fell into a years depression, I spend every second trying to get back what we had originally. It culminated in my feeling she emotionally cheated, and she saying she thought she was asexual but she's not she just didn't want it with me (which she says right after she doesn't want it with anyone else just the me I used to be). Last few months has been no yelling, with her and I having sex with more intensity like in the beginning (not frequency) this one alter of hers (out of two) is sexual and possibly has a PD like me, but I'm worried I've done too much damage to get back the way she saw me originally. What do I do. How do I fix this. When I mention she says she doesn't know what's wrong.

100,Dumped because I possibly have BPD,"I went to both my therapist and Psychiatrist today. I've been struggling crazy and took a step towards my future.

My therapist said she believes I have major depressive and tons of signs of BPD. My psyc said clinical depression and agreed about the BPD.

I felt like such a failure to myself and everyone that is around me. I told my parents, sister, and my complicated relationship. Once I went to them and shared, they immediately felt uncomfortable. They left out of the room to change the subject so I felt pretty shitty about that. When I asked what they view me as, the response was ""A person with a mental disorder now"". 

Oh my fucking God this took me by suprise. We've been dealing with this for awhile and it doesn't mean I changed as a person.

101,"I think I have BPD, how do I approach this?","I’m (18F) currently undergoing a mental health dilemma which has been a painful yet releasing realization. I’ve been going through some relationship issues that made me realize I think there’s something wrong with me. To begin, I’m someone who cannot be left alone for long periods of time because it’ll cause me to go down a thought spiral that would eventually lead to me isolating from loved ones and friends even further. Mental health background: I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). My therapist recommended me to also get tested for ADHD, however my parents did not feel the need to because it would cost a lot of money and they said more medications would ruin me. 

I have pretty much ended every relationship I’ve been in, it was never me who got broken up with and it is usually pretty sudden. My first relationship consisted of a lot of arguing and suicide threats from both parties, myself and them, which ended up with me attempting to take my life because of the stress I was in. That was around the time I got diagnosed with MDD and GAD. Recently, I’ve been having more prominent issues with my mental health which I wouldn’t necessarily say are depression-related, since I’ve had depression for years now I’ve been able to establish the thinking patterns I’ve been having. I call these short bursts “episodes” of where I get extreme delusions to where I convince myself that certain people I am very close to hate me or are trying to manipulate me. These can be serious delusions and they are sometimes very far fetched or exaggerated given the circumstances. 


For example, I have ended friendships on very sudden notes and one being that I had a friend who started coming off as a little rude, because they got a car and soon after I also got a car. She started to ask me what kind of car I got and how many miles it had, how old it was, etc. And instead of thinking that this was due to her just being curious and wanting to know more about my car, I saw this as her trying to compare our cars and telling me that hers was better (this never happened). She told me that my car would look good with a wing and I rudely responded to her saying that it’s my car and I don’t want to spend money on it so she should stop telling me what to do. She said maybe you’re right it’s probably a temporary car because of how old it is and I took huge offense to that. I went down a spiral of thinking and started to having delusions that she was going to pop my cars tires and started to avoid her around school. She took this as me hating her and we stopped being friends for many months. We then started talking together since we would both be at a mutual friends birthday together and we made up, I realized she meant no harm in saying those things to me, however I did not realize I was in the wrong. 

There has been so many instances where I had ruined relationships and friendships like that based on assumptions. I start to drive myself crazy with these sorts of thoughts and now I have realized that it’s gotten even worse. It’s the year 2024 and I’ve been in 3 relationships already. The last two is what made me realize that something isn’t right with me. My impulsivity to start relationships has also gotten insanely worse which has made me feel guilty because I have barely mourned my ex, basically moving on the next day already. 

The last relationship helped me pinpoint exactly what the problem was. I would not get messaged or talked to for a few hours and I’d start to reach a delusional state to where I’d convince myself this person does not love me anymore and is manipulating me. I would call them out on these accusations without any concrete proof besides the “tone they were texting in” or the fact that they “were busy”. The main issue here was the outbursts that I had to where I was okay and then the next hour I was fully convinced this person is manipulating me or trying to hurt me based off little illogical things and I would snap at them very aggressively and I would genuinely believe that these things were reality and I would hurt that relationship every time. Eventually I would snap out of it and realize that I don’t know what I was really mad about and that I’m actually going insane over nothing and I would feel extreme embarrassment and guilt. The next time I’d have an episode, I’d use the previous episode as evidence I was being manipulated into thinking I was crazy for thinking that and would use it as another reason to be angry at the person. I would basically believe that someone loved me and the next hour that they hated me. 

I’ve been having insane mood swings where I would not feel guilty anymore and act like nothing has happened towards my partner while they were confused and still concerned and upset with me over what I had said. I don’t even recognize myself during these episodes and realize that those are irrational behaviors and thoughts that I’m having, but once I go into an episode the line between reality and delusions is distorted. I’m sick of hurting the people I love over these thoughts and they’ve just gotten so out of hand that I live in fear not knowing when the next episode is going to happen. It’s been making me suicidal because I feel like the only thing I know how to do is hurt the people I love. My friends have also started to call me crazy because I went outside during a tornado just for fun and I didn’t even feel scared of it and my family is worried about me. 

Today, my friend was standing with someone I don’t like, and they asked me to come over. I whispered to them that I don’t feel comfortable around them since I knew them for a very long time and I’ve had a lot of bad memories and experiences with them. My friend said they couldn’t hear me so I messaged them privately and from far away, it looked like they were showing our messages to the girl I don’t like. I completely freaked out and it did not make it any better that she made eye contact with me after looking at my friend’s phone. I believed this for the entire day, being very paranoid that they are talking about me or plotting to fight with me. Once I got home I thought about what my other friend said about me being possibly dramatic. I even asked my friend if they showed her the messages and they said no but I’m still doubting it. I genuinely can’t tell what’s reality anymore and it’s ruining me.

My emotions are just so out of hand it’s making me so distressed. Sometimes I like having intense feelings of happiness because it feels good but that also means my feelings of anger or sadness are also amplified and I’ve been having serious aggressive outbursts that consist of having violent thoughts about others which is making me start to become scared of myself.

While I know my sister loves me deeply and I the same, I’m finding it increasingly hard to keep a relationship with her because of it. Ever since I can remember I’ve been the target of anger, delusions, judgment and snarky comments about my life that just were not needed and really actually affected me. I know I said I know she loves me but sometimes it genuinely doesn’t feel like. She’ll hear insulting things that I never actually said or think I took something.

I have tried so hard to forgive him or just cutting ties and let him go but I couldn't because I also have issues on my own. Problem is I couldn't do these because I also show so many bpd traits. I forced him to go to a psychiatrist and this bothers me because I had to make him go there (and he finally got diagnosed). I blocked him but he used his family's, friends', random peoples numbers to call me and finally I had to get a restraining order.

107,I Think I Have BPD,"About five years ago I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Before I was able to get diagnosed, I knew that I had it. I took a ton of online tests and I scored really high on everything. The diagnosis was just confirmation. Now I’m starting to wonder if I have something more than just depression and anxiety. I’ve been taking lots of online quizzes and all of them say it’s very likely that I have borderline personality disorder. I know it’s not a formal diagnosis but when I did the online depression and anxiety tests, the questions were pretty much the same for the formal screening. I just don’t want to be that person that self diagnoses but just depression and anxiety doesn’t sit right with me.

These are the symptoms I have that make me think I might have BPD:
- I really struggle with my anger. I’ve never acted out on it physically but I say tons of things I regret and I’m worried that one day I might actually hurt someone.
- I have a very poor self image and I feel like I don’t know myself at all. I’m always pretending to be someone else, mimicking their emotions, mannerisms and phrases they say. Then I look in the mirror and see someone else who is a complete stranger.
- I get very self destructive when things go wrong or I feel down. I take it to the extreme and have been hospitalized twice for self inflicted injuries and suicidal ideation. 
- I feel like everyone low key hates me and they pretend to be there for me so that I don’t do anything to myself. I know I drive people away and I’m not sure who to trust (even questioning one of my best friends)
- I impulsively spend lots of money on things I don’t need, but I think will make me happier. I’m at the point we’re I’ve spent almost all of my savings (couple thousands) and now I can’t move out of my mom’s place.
- My emotions are always extreme unless I’m feeling completely empty. I’m either angry, incredibly depressed (this is when I become self destructive) or empty. Sometimes (but rarely) I get really talkative and energetic but I still feel dead on the inside. People always think I’m in a good mood because I laugh at literally everything. I’m just really good at hiding it.

There’s probably more but these are the main things. Anyone have any idea what this is?

108,I feel like I have mild BPD or am I just overthinking ,"My emotions have always been like a rollercoaster but I always assumed that it's either because of pms or stress. Lately, I've been feeling really empty, hopeless, and alone. I read a lot of articles and reddit posts about BPD and I think I can relate to most. I have no budget yet for professional help that's why I am looking for any thoughts on this. Here are the things that I feel:

1.) I have intense separation anxiety (not diagnosed). It got to a point where it feels hard to breathe when people that I love leaves me, especially my partner.

2.) I am scared of changes in my life. I want things to stay exactly the way they are. I always need to know specific details about new places that we will go to (or my partner) so that I can have a clear image and not feel overwhelmed or trigger my sepanx

3.) My mood swings are quite intense. I love my partner but when we have arguments, even small, I feel like he's going to leave me. I often think of ways I can unlove my partner and move on while still in the relationship. Sometimes, I can't feel the love that I have for him. I feel so empty that it scares me.

4.) I'm stuck in the cycle of self sabotage. I have zero self confidence especially now that I've gained a lot of weight due to stress eating and bcp. I feel worthless all of the time and feel like everyone's judging me. My life has no direction. I am left behind by my friends and peers who have flourishing careers while I drown in self pity.

5.) I used to self harm when I get too overwhelmed (angry, sad).
I often get to a point where I want to die but not really because I'm stuck with the thought of my responsibilities.

6.) I have episodes when I'm really, really sad that I feel it in my chest, stomach, and palms. I feel like it's the end of the world during this episode. I nitpick every single wrong thing in my life and become so lifeless and sad.

7.) I overthink a lot of things even if they're out of my control. I care too much about what other people would say and can't decide at all because of it.

I don't know if I'm just being too sensitive or if what I'm experiencing is normal for everyone. I am also scared that a psychiatrist will laugh at me and tell me that I'm just not mature enough to feel this way. Or they might get mad at me. Any opinion is welcome. Is this normal or is there a possibility that I have any mental health problem? Thank you.

110,I am indeed the queen of BPD and I hate it so much.,"So back in March, I (27F) met a guy (25M) on Tinder and we hit it off. I was looking for something long term and he was too. A week later, I lost my virginity to him. It was all so special to me. Having my first date, first time, everything. I felt like I hit the jackpot with this guys because of how well we hit it off. Anyways fast forward, I started to ask for too much reassurance on whether we were on the same page and if he was looking for something serious with me. It got to a point where it got really annoying to him and he started to resent me a bit. A month ago, he went through my phone without permission and found that I still had dating apps on there (I was inactively using them, but still had them). He kept accusing me of talking to other guys and kept calling me a liar, so he broke things off with me over text and blocked me. I should also mention, he does have some delusional thoughts and emotional baggage. For example, he says he has a hard time trusting women because of his past relationships. He also says some pretty misogynistic comments. I did find out he takes Paxil and Vynase, and those medications can cause some delirious thoughts.

As a person with BPD, I wasn't rationally thinking but emotionally thinking of how I want to fix things and how I didn't want him to abandon me. I got his mom's number off of Facebook (she never knew about me) and I called her, told her who I was, and told her what happened. I dug myself in a deeper hole doing that, but he then texts me and tells me to come over and talk about it. I apologized for everything and apologized for calling his mom. Funny thing, he never apologized to me for invading my privacy and not trusting me when I told him I was not talking to anyone else... After that, he still broke things off with me because of me calling his mom, but in addition to me be ""annoying"" and ""clingy"". Not even a week later, he texts me ""hey.""

Again, with the fear of abandonment, I responded to him. A few days later he told me that he doesn't want a relationship with me but wants to be FWB. I accepted that because I still wanted that connection with him. Things were going well for a little while. Fast forward to this past Saturday to yesterday, I kept texting him non-stop. I was worrying if there was someone else or if I said or did something because he wasn't responding to my messages to hang out, but he wasn't communicating or responding to me. I also want to note, I do have a history with texting people non-stop if they don't reply, which has cost me relationships with others. Yesterday, he told me ""we should go our separate ways"" and that ""I find what I'm looking for"" and he blocked me again.

Again, my emotional thinking overtook my rational thinking and I bolted to his place. Obviously, he was shocked that I showed up. We talked for a long while, I was trying to convince him that things would be different, I was telling him to unblock me, to no avail. We hooked up as well. Fast forward to the end of the night, he was going to bed and yelling at me to leave and I was refusing to until he unblocked me and promises me to see me again. He was so adamant on not doing that, but gave up and unblocked me and promised me so I can leave.

I kinda figured in my gut he would block me again and not want to see me again. This morning he texted me ""Do not ever contact me again. If you continue to harass me or show up at my place, I will call the cops and file a restraining order against you"" and then blocked me again. That was that. Obviously, I'm not going to contact him anymore because I don't want any legal trouble, but I am scared if he calls the cops or files a restraining order against me still. So very scared. I'm also devastated that this relationship is damaged beyond repair and that we can't be in each others lives anymore. It hurts me more than anything. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I am absolutely and utterly destroyed by this. I am absolutely heartbroken more than anything.

I went out my way to be nice to him during our time dating and I genuinely cared about him. I indeed was very generous and supportive towards him. I know it was a very short while we dated, but I honestly thought he was ""the one"" because of all the similar values and interests we had. I was even falling in love with him. Again with BPD, I tend to fall pretty hard for someone. I am hurt about the loss of potential and what could've been between us if none of this happened... BPD has entirely ruined my life. It has cost me jobs, relationships, and now this relationship that I truly wanted. I sometimes wish and pray that I would die or if I could just go back in time and change everything. I wish none of this had to happen. I miss him so much and I will miss him more than anything. I feel like I mess everything up, no matter how hard I try not to. I am in therapy and take medication, which has helped a bit, but obviously as you see, I'm still stuck in this negative cycle. I just wish I had better confidence and self-esteem, so I wouldn't have to suffer like this. My anxiety and BPD gets the best of me each time and I overreact and cause strains in my relationships. I just wish I could have him back and fix everything.

112,Bpd fear of abandonment and self sabotage,"To sum this up: I lied about stupid things scared the truth would cause a fight, I cheated on him because I was splitting after a fight and convinced we were over (I knew we weren’t rationally) lied about cheating over and over until I finally realized he’s still here and I need to fix my shit or he will actually leave. 


How do I show him I do love him but I was so scared he’d leave I tried to push him away? 


Basically I lied from the beginning of our relationship, I did things negatively to make him stay even when it wasn’t working. He doesn’t think I love him because you don’t hurt people you love. When I told him about my bpd I didn’t tell him about the self sabotage or fear because we took things slow until I thought the fear was gone. He’s bipolar and when we fought he would block me to take space. I didn’t want to tell him how much it effected me or share my emotions since I thought I’d be “too much” I love him whole heartedly and have actually been fixing my stuff because I don’t want to lose him. I haven’t had these reactions with anyone since I first got diagnosed at 16 (I’m 21). And besides with my dad. I love him so much it scares the shit out of me. 

When he found out I cheated i denied it. I lied for 2 weeks and even said “do you want me to lie and say I cheated” and then I slowly told the truth little bits here and there but only when I felt more comfortable sharing and like it wasn’t some trick. 

Basically he blocked me and so I went on a sex app and this guy used a cock ring and I pressed the Buttons. I got off the app after a minute of pressing buttons And had a melt down. I knew I fucked up and he’d be back but he wouldn’t stay now. I did it thinking I’d feel better, wanted. I didn’t tell him before the fight that he messaged me because I thought maybe I could have him as a backup (I didn’t want that deep down). 

I never ever ever thought I would cheat or stoop that low. I love him so much and never loved anyone the way I love him nor ever been loved like he loves me. I was always the “ugly friend” and guys I liked went for my friends. I thought he was too good to be true and I didn’t deserve him. I’ve been fixing my stuff to be good for him and show him the evil person I made myself out to be isn’t completely me. I want to show him I love him and I’m fixing my shit because I love him.

113,My BPD is ruining everything,"I (F19) have borderline personality disorder. I have been medicated for a little over a year and cannot exist if I forget a dose because my mood absolutely plummets and I turn into a spiralling mess.

I think I'm scaring my fiancé away (M21). For good reason too. I am always picking fights, always blaming him for stuff, always asking him 10 times a day if he still loves me or whatever stupid shit. I threaten to break up with him or tell him we're done over absolutely nothing. It's gotten to the point now that he notices my mood and has to hand me my pill box to make me take them and stop my nonsense.

The worst part is, I love him to death. I literally thank God for him every night and day because he is such an amazing human in every way. But I am driving him away with my stupid mental health problems. He SAYS he is never leaving, he still loves me, but I would leave if I were him.

I don't see my friends anymore. Like, any of them. My anxiety is too bad to talk to new people. I want to see my friends more, but every time I end up feeling left out which doesn't even make sense because I'm not. Which I know when I'm not caught up in a spell.

Point is, I know my fiancé and my friends love me to death and aren't leaving me. I also love them to death. But I don't know how to convince my brain of that in the moment. I'm so tired of having to pop anxiety pills all day just to be normal. My spells drag every everyone's mood down and I would not blame anyone for leaving. But I don't want them to!

114,I think I have BPD,"

I (F16) have heavy symptoms of BPD.

For context: I live in the Philippines, a very conservative country, with conservative parents who’re not so open with the idea of mental health. Thus, I can’t approach an adult for a diagnosis.

It started when I was around 10. 

-Severe mood swings
-Suicidal thoughts
-Self isolation
-Possessiveness over friends
-Impulsive behavior 

At first I thought I was depressed, I didn’t mind because depression was frequent in our family.

But around 14-15, I started hearing voices in my head. Since I’m from the Philippines, I thought I was getting possessed.

The voices would tell me to “off” myself and convince me how my friends don’t love me.

But one of the things I hate a lot is when they tell me I have no friends. I’m well known at my school, I’m aware that I have a lot of friends and I take great pride in that. So I hate it when they attack that feat of mine. I hate how they know it’s one of my weaknesses.

I would have manic episodes for hours and be better by the next hour.

I’m tired of this, I don’t know what to do. I don’t usually ask for help online but I have no where to go.

I left a lot of stuff out, so feel free to ask questions :D",1689406259.0,False,5,6,Prudent-Option4135,None,1505b5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1505b5x/i_think_i_have_bpd/
115,Does this sound like bpd,"Hi. 
I can’t figure out if I have BPD or just need more therapy, lol. At what point did you think, I should check with a doctor? 
My therapist mainly has identified that by feeling like the second fave child and not getting on well with my mum through teen years onwards, I struggle not feeling like the favourite and go into self preservation mode. I have ended a fair few relationships abruptly in this state of fear. Like they are losing interest in me or it’s not ‘perfect’. But it’s always quite irrational, in hindsight.  Breakups are often very cold and I feel disconnected from my feelings as a way to cope. 
I’m fed up of not understanding why all my relationships follow this pattern - hence why I have gone into therapy. 
I’m in a current relationship that’s a very important to me and I don’t want to loose it. 
But I quite often get thrown into this low state, usually triggered by something, and just end up in a really negative thought cycle. Thoughts include 
- me and my bf won’t work 
- why is he with me
- thoughts of him leaving me and how painful it would be
- I play out entire arguments and scenarios where we break up, and often cry about it 
- ask him if he loves me, which he always laughs at which makes me feel better but I dunno 

This is all usually triggered by feeling as though I’m not the priority. 
It is extra complicated by my bf having adhd and potentially a bit of autism, which naturally makes him more forgetful and not very good at many things haha, like starting conversation 

I also:
- have a push pull nature in friendships where I pull away when I feel they don’t ‘care’ about me, aka haven’t checked in on me. Will be distant with them until I have a surge of missing them
- sometimes think it’s easier to ‘end it all’. This isn’t frequent over the years but deffo recently. 
- very often a sense of wanting to ‘run away’ and start a new life, despite having a very strong support network, because I’m fed up of those around me and them not caring about me enough 

I don’t know, it just doesn’t seem ‘severe’ enough, but it really impacts my relationships mostly and since working extra hard to stay in this one, rather than give up like usual, it’s taking a toll :(",1695064134.0,False,1,1,SweetCheeksO6,None,16m4ab7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16m4ab7/does_this_sound_like_bpd/
116,ASPD comorbid with BPD?,"Hello. I have a degree in psychology, so I’d appreciate the same level of understanding of psychology in any replies. I’ve never understood how someone can have both antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. They are opposites. One is a lack of emotion, and the other is overly emotional. One feels nothing (other than pain, anger, excitement), and the other feels too much. How can you have both?! I understand that if you simply look at the diagnostic criteria that you can “have” both, but with an understanding of the core of both disorders, they should be mutually exclusive. I have borderline, so I understand that quite well. Im trying to figure out if my last ex (who murdered someone and is a constant liar) has ASPD or the male form of bpd. He could technically be diagnosed with both, but I don’t get it. How can he have an intense fear of abandonment (bpd) if he can’t form meaningful attachments (ASPD). 

I feel like the distinction should be made based on the Motive for the behavior. Men with BPD and ASPD can both be manipulative, violent, impulsive, etc. and diagnosing based simply on that seems haphazard. The motivation behind those behaviors should differentiate between the diagnoses. Manipulation: for power, to further an agenda/goal (ASPD) vs. Manipulation due to an extreme fear of abandonment (BPD); impulsivity: due to the need for an adrenaline rush to “feel” something (ASPD) vs. Due to trying to fill the bpd emptiness/black hole and low self-worth (BPD); aggression/violence: due to wanting to feel power or control (ASPD) vs. extreme emotional turmoil leading to a feeling of helplessness (BPD); love-bombing: a manipulation tactic to lure you in (ASPD) vs actually feeling that intense of emotions early on (BPD), etc. Look up Borderline in Males if you aren’t aware of the differences in it in males vs females. A lot of the behaviors fit ASPD. 

Again, I understand the DSM’s diagnostic criteria, but at their core, you shouldn’t be able to have both disorders.

117,BPD funk got me spiralling (this is a long one),"**TRIGGER WARNING: mention of temptation to do the self harmies but no follow through**

Hi all, I (38 AFAB) have had BPD literally for as far back as I can remember. It's been a very long journey to understanding it, myself and the interactions between the two. However, just because I now understand what it is, how it affects me and how I can moderate it doesn't mean it doesn't fuck me up sometimes.

One of my most hated symptoms hit earlier - I was sorting spare diamond picture diamonds into coded bags, everything was completely fine, I was in a good mood and quite enjoying it. Then, for no reason, completely out of nowhere, my heart just dropped into the pit of my stomach and I was overwhelmed by...frustration? Anger? It's like a switch suddenly flips and all the colour drains out of the world.

I tried changing activities, tried watching a few different things but the only emotion I could feel was intense irritability - the pointlessness of having hobbies that achieve nothing, people in the things I was watching saying and doing the most stupid things, stuff that usually I'd enjoy just infuriated me.

The last straw was when I was trying to Dutch braid my hair after oiling it but it's still a bit too short and wouldn't co-operate, and I just lost it. I burst into tears, threw my mirror against the wall then spent altogether too much time examining the edges of the shards of glass as I was clearing up. I haven't done the self harmies for many years so on the VERY rare occasions it tickles the edges of my mind it really scares me. I cleared my room of anything I could use and since then have just been crying and feeling completely miserable and self loathing. My self esteem is fine these days, but when the BPD hits like this it disappears totally. I get very uncomfortable in my skin and get spikes of gender dysphoria; I'm female non binary and I'm fine with that, but when I get into these states I really wish I were not. Maybe if I were just a normal cis woman and presented in a more traditionally feminine way I'd have a chance of finding a man. 

I keep forgetting that with BPD not only do emotions hit faster, last longer and are more intense but they can change for ABSOLUTELY no reason whatsoever, in the blink of an eye. I can be having the best time ever with no worries and suddenly, BAM! All the good things in the world that exist, did exist or ever will exist disappear and you're left reeling.

I hope someone can relate. I feel so incredibly sad, pointless and lost at this point in time. I know it's only temporary but that knowledge does nothing to lessen the pain and impact it's having right now.",1708531551.0,False,2,0,Cookie_Kuchisabishii,None,1awfqwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1awfqwf/bpd_funk_got_me_spiralling_this_is_a_long_one/

119,"I really need advice/help on BPD, things are getting out of hand…","Hi everyone. I’m really looking for some help here. 

My husband has possible Bi polar disorder/borderline personality disorder.  He’s been actually diagnosed with depression, adhd, anxiety, and the worst one, PTSD. His doctor said possible bi polar/personality disorder is likely but we don’t know yet, he started him on some meds.  

The way he’s been acting is he starts yelling at me for *no* reason, attacking me, stating my flaws and just ripping me apart, “character assassination”. I just sit there and take it because this happens so often now, if I yell back then he gets even angrier. 
Is this the actions of someone with bi polar?
His words are like daggers and the way he calls me useless and belittles me hurts so bad. He belittles me horribly when he gets into these “moods”. 
Just says vile things, almost demonic as crazy as that sounds…like I feel like his eyes get dark. 

He almost never had a happy day. Our lives are hard but…to never have a happy day is just not right. He brings his sadness to me all of the time. We’ve had some difficult things happen with our house, and he just can’t accept these things. I tell him, IM experiencing these things too! But I don’t act out. I’m obviously upset but, hey, life is life. 
He definitely does not have this view. 

I’m normally a happy bubbly person. I can’t take this verbal abuse anymore. 

He also says I don’t care about him, no one does. 
He told me that the meals I cook are not enough for him, that I don’t do it with love.he says “ANYONE could cook like that, it’s nothing special” Last week I cooked salmon, asparagus and mashed potatoes, and sausage and peppers and rice. 
He said that when HE cooks, he does it with love and it’s an actual meal. 
Is this like…what delusion is?
He was actually yelling at me for this. I balled my eyes out saying wtf do you mean? If you asked anyone if their spouse cooked them meals like that they would surely say they were good enough? 
I make sure he has lunches for work, cook him breakfast, clean the floors and dishes…still not enough. 
The house is a mess. The house is unlivable. 

This is an example of what I’m dealing with. 

I’m not looking for condolences. 
For background We’ve been together for 12 years since high school. I love this man. He was never like this. NEVER. That is why I’m so shocked by his behavior lately. 

Recently he had a blow out with his family, he is normally sober but went on a drinking spree and called up his family members and bitched them out for 2-4 hours. (Each one) 
He’s pushed everyone away. 
He says he has no friends but then criticizes everyone. 
He will get in these moods where he corners me and basically yells at me and says negative things for sometimes hours. 

I’m not sure what to do anymore. I’ve been writing journal entries on his behavior, for my own self. I want to hold myself accountableif this keeps continuing. This has been going on for 4 months, most days end in him yelling at me. 
Then he gets super depressed and sleeps all day. 

So my question is, is this bi polar behavior?

I know you can’t diagnose him.  But, it took 4 months to see a psychiatrist (we just did) and we’ve been in therapy. I don’t know how much my heart can take this. You can only tell yourself you’re strong so many times. 
I’m such a loving, fun and kind person. And he makes me out to be a horrible wife who never cleans or cares about him…
I’ve made so many appointments for him and have gone to every doctor appointment, I took him to a crisis center.how does he think I don’t love him?

122,How BPD can become a superpower once you’ve treated it successfully,"

Hi all. 

I’m a former BPD. Diagnosed with BPD traits at 15, and then the full diagnosis the second I was legally an adult at 18. 

Now I’m a therapist that works with BPD. 

So let’s start with the downsides, okay?
This is the most deadly psychiatric disorder you can be diagnosed with. 70% of BPDs try to kill themselves at least once. 10% end up finding success in completing suicide eventually. In male and female prison populations, prevalence for this disease are up to 48%. 

Basically, without treatment (DBT specifically), the paths for people with this disease are either suicide or doing some fucked shit to land you incarcerated for life. 

Now let’s move to the positives.. 

Once you are able to emotionally regulate and act appropriately in situations (acting vs. reacting to things constantly), this condition is actually a gift. You’re wired differently, and there are advantages that come with that. 

Let’s talk about Cluster B. Within Cluster B, you have your sociopaths, your borderlines, and your narcissists. Essentially, when you have one Cluster B diagnosis, you bleed over into the other diagnoses in the clusters. That’s why they’re all clustered together; there are so many similarities. 

Regardless of being diagnostic or not, you’ll always be wired a little different, right? 

So let’s talk about the crossovers in Cluster B. Sociopaths understand emotions on a cognitive level. They’re able to size people up and see their weak spots, what makes them vulnerable. They’re quite intoxicating people, with lots of charisma and charm. That’s often how they’re able to abuse people and make others do what they want. 

Borderlines, on the other hand, not only understand emotions cognitively, but they understand them personally and emotionally. Because of this, you also naturally have more empathy than the average person. You truly are able to put yourself in someone else’s shoes emotionally.  If you are BPD, you naturally have what is referred to in therapy as a “higher emotional range”. What that means is, you’ve experienced more emotions and more depth of emotions than the average person. 

You’ve felt sad? We’ve felt despair. 
You’ve felt happy? We’ve felt euphoria. 
And it goes on and on. 

BPD is driven by trauma and the fear of real or perceived abandonment. In the ways that sociopaths can size someone up for their weak points, BPDs actually have incredible gifts for seeing where someone has not had their emotional needs met. Why? Because the entire BPD experience is never having your emotional needs met. So many *untreated* BPDs that are still driven by this insatiable need to avoid abandonment borrow that sociopathic intoxicating charm and charisma, quickly size up where your emotional gaps are, and in order to avoid abandonment, they become the person to fill those emotional needs for someone so they don’t get left behind by them. 

Just how skilled are borderlines at seeing the emotional needs of others? It’s kinda scary, but fascinating. There was a study done where all these different mentally ill groups and neurotypicals were shown just pictures of people’s eyes, and asked to then guess the emotion that’s being experienced by that person. OVERWHELMINGLY, the borderlines were most accurately able to correctly guess the individuals emotions just solely by seeing a picture of their eyes. Here is that study, by the way: 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427787/

My point in writing all of this is that I know this disease is hard. Like I said, deadliest one you can be diagnosed with. 

I want to write this to encourage you to find healing, to do the DBT skills training in combination with individual therapy, because you will find that once you are no longer constantly on the edge of suicidal cliffs, you inherently have a LOT of gifts in being wired this way. 

Trust me, I know how stigmatized this disease is…

But once you’ve treated it, gotten it under control, learned how to emotionally regulate, learned how to stop being self destructive, you’ll find that you are actually somewhat super human. It’s not fair that we have had to suffer with this. But I’m here telling you, from the other side of healing, work like hell to get there, and you will discover that this is actually a blessing.

124,I think I have quiet BPD and I wanted to share my thoughts,"To clarify this is not self diagnosing. I am writing this only as a way of venting and in hopes of people being able to relate or give advice. I am 18 and have been researching the quiet subtype of BPD, on and off for over a year. I think I fit the criteria for a diagnosis but obviously I was 17 when I started looking into this and even now at 18 I am quite young for a diagnosis. As well as this I am still on the NHS neurodevelopmental pathway for ASD and ADHD and have been waiting to see someone for over two years on this. 

I want to start this by telling you some of the things I was told after a brief psychiatric assessment that was given in February - may 2023. She wrote a discharge letter and briefly explained some of the issues I am dealing with as I told her in person and had written her an email explaining more. I am doing this because honestly, it's easier than explaining every facet myself and afterwards I'll fill in any of the gaps. 
 
I cnped the letter and then removed bits and pieces not relevant: 
“Josh is aged 17 and he is moving on to college to complete BTEC qualifications with a view perhaps to studying Architecture at university. Josh has struggled for some years in fully engaging with education. It is likely that his plans and aspirations may change over the coming years. He finds it difficult to focus on academic studies because of his long-standing psychological difficulties. Josh has been referred by his previous school, where he completed his GCSEs at the end of Year 11 in May/June 2022, to the NHS Neurodevelopmental Pathway. Josh and his mother perceive that Josh presents with symptoms of both a social communication disorder (ASD – ICD10 F84.0) and ADHD (ICD10 F90). 
 
Secondary to Josh’s underlying neurodevelopmental difficulties, Josh also presents with marked symptoms of anxiety and low mood. Josh presents with initial insomnia, struggling to get to sleep and therefore finding it difficult to get up the next day to participate in education and any relevant activities. Josh experiences symptoms of depersonalisation/derealisation. Josh experiences visual hallucinations, e.g. seeing what he describes as “shadow men” out of the corner of his eye which I think are related to symptoms of anxiety as Josh denies any experimentation or use of substances or alcohol. 
 
Josh presents with Gender Identity Disorder. He uses the Progestogen-only pill and wears binders. He is keen to be referred to a Gender Disorder Clinic that can prescribe hormone treatment as a first step before gender reassignment surgery.
 
In addition to Josh’s symptoms of anxiety and low mood, he also has symptoms of OCD (ICD10 F42). He has concerns about germs, and can worry that what he has been given to eat, even food cooked by his mother, may make him ill. Josh only eats a limited diet, focused primarily on pasta and cheese at his mother’s house and potato-based foods when he visits his father. 
 
Josh finds it difficult to make and maintain friends. He can be quite black and white in his approach, perfectionistic and rigid. Josh does not easily cope well with transitions or unexpected alterations to his routine. He struggles with eye contact and empathy and experiences a range of sensory sensitivities. Josh is also aware that he struggles to attend and concentrate, finds it hard to focus, can be disorganised and struggles to stay on task.
 
FAMILY HISTORY 
*mum* and *dad* during their relationship had two children:
 
• Josh, the subject of this letter, aged 17 and repeating Year 12 at Sixth Form College in September 2023. Josh has identified as being of male gender for some time and is hoping when he turns 18 for greater support from the Gender Identity Disorder Clinic. 
 
• *brother*, aged 15 and just completing Year 10 at Christleton High School. He has also been referred to the NHS Neurodevelopmental Pathway for ADHD/ASD assessments. 
 
FAMILY HISTORY OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER
 
*dad* presents with some symptoms of anxiety and depression and may present with symptoms of complex PTSD according to mother’s account as a result of his adverse early life experiences. 
 
*mum* suffered symptoms of PTSD and depression following a termination when she was aged 18. At 40 she experienced an acute psychotic episode and benefitted from intensive CBT, Sertraline SSRI antidepressant medication and support from her parents. 
 
Josh is already prescribed Promethazine 50mg at night by his GP to help him sleep.
 
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT
  
Josh experiences marked emotional lability, at times being quiet, withdrawn and depressed, spending most of his time in his bedroom and at other times being restless, fidgety and unable to calm down and concentrate on studies or hobbies. Josh is aware from his own account that he struggles to make and maintain friends. The only person with whom he has a close relationship where he can be open about his experience of intrusive thoughts, visual hallucinations and thoughts of suicidal intent, is his boyfriend to whom he speaks on a daily basis. 
 
 
Josh’s mother wrote to me after my last session, describing Josh as being sad and depressed long-term Indeed, she said, “Always looked like he had the world on his shoulders, hated himself, felt he did not quite fit in. He was not like others. Withdraws in situations he finds difficult, even at family events either will not go or soon takes himself off into another room to be alone as it becomes too much. He is visibly anxious in social situations, does not like to be touched. He finds it hard to understand what others are thinking and feeling and hard to read other people’s emotions”. She also commented that Josh often found it so difficult to talk about his feelings and emotions that he would text her to express concerns, e.g. in relation to thoughts of suicidal intent rather than talking to her.
 
FORMULATION
 
It is, unfortunately, not possible to organise these assessments privately. A formal diagnosis of neurodevelopmental difficulties has not been reached following this initial assessment but it is evident that Josh has complex difficulties.
 
In the meantime, Josh would benefit from re-referral to Tier 3 CAMHS and the introduction of SSRI antidepressant medication such as Sertraline to help manage his anxiety. “

 Sorry I know that was long, I didn't know what to keep.  Instead of going to tier 3 camhs I was put on the list for adult NHS mental health care and they referred me to a workshop called “beating psychological distress using DBT skills” which is a 6 week course I am currently on week 4 of. 

I have a fear of abandonment that I think comes from multiple angles. As a kid I was bullied for 6-7 years and after that I was still always treated differently, of course also growing up undiagnosed was also inherently traumatic as well as growing up trans I never really felt seen. As well as this, me and my mum have never had a good relationship and I don't remember much about my life but I will never forget that my mum would always threaten to leave me at my dads and never return, nearly every weekend before I would visit him. 

Normally my relationship with my friends and most of my family is quite stable. It isn't with my mum or my brother we fight continuously. I also have a boyfriend and to be honest if her wasn't a passive person and was more willing to fight we wouldn't have stable relationship, but he kind of balances me out which at times i can find very annoying because i feel so guilty and think that he should be shouting at me that's what his reaction should be, he should be mad. He has autism though and says that he cannot feel anger like a neurotypical can. 

My sense of self is horrendous, I have no idea who I am, I can use adjectives to describe me like trans, bi, etc but i can never convey myself further than that. I kind of just feel empty. Sometimes it feels like live isnt real and i just sometimes dont remember how i even got to the place i am or what happened in my life up to recent points. I do experience dissociation HARD and depersonalisation. I mean I think I have done that to my self though because I have always escaped from my feelings and thoughts by turning my brain off and watching tv or listening to music or something just so I didnt have to think. 

My mood changes so much and it can change within seconds or withing hours, its never consistent throughout the day, I could be deeply depressed and want to not be alive one minute then the next be hyper and mimic emotions of happiness. 

I mean i am impulsive in some ways like for example I jumped of a 7-8 foot wall for no good reason and fucked up my ankle last week, and I have been impulsive with substances once or twice but nothing two extreme. I wouldn't necessarily say I fit this criteria. I think the impulsiveness is just my probable adhd.  I am a nicotine addict tho… eek

I sh alot and i cut now but even before that I would itch my arm to the point it bleed or it came up with spots just to ease and distract me from my inner pain. 

Persistent feelings of emptiness i kind of already said about when i talked about my self-image. My self image can also change with my mood swings. When im hyper i can gass myself up but then when im not im like omg ew yk. 

I do have anger issues. Most of it is internalised and I just feel like screaming. At my mum i can take my anger out when we are arguing but thats because its just been that my whole life. I can also just explode and say things that I regret or just get so mad but that has to build up and that isnt very often. 

I also have temporary paranoid thoughts. Poaranoial ideation, thinking everyone hates me, everyones against me, even thinking that everyone else in the world is fake and they all are just programmed to make my life hell and they all know what they are doing and find it funny… ik ridiculous haha. 

I have never been one to speak out when I am suffering. My mum found out I was being bullied 5 years in because someone wrote something that made her suspicious on a birthday card I was given. Not because I was upset and I told her, no because someone else did.  I have always suppressed my feelings and find it so hard to physically talk about what is wrong (hence why I message people if I can). I have become very good at research and for example, i have always had issues with reading and in primary school we got me tested for dyslexia. I didn't have it so nobody thought anything more about it, except me. High school got me struggling so I did some research and knew I had accommodative insufficiency and irlens syndrome, convinced my mum to get me tested and not only did I have both I also had convergence insufficiency. When I told my teacher that had taught me throughout the whole 5 previous years of high school she didn't believe me and said that because she taught me she knew I didn't struggle;I liked that and I had to show her the proof. I don't want people to know when I am struggling, I hide it, I distract myself, I direct it inwards, I withdraw and it has always been like that. 

I don't know what exact I am doing writing this I just feel really shit right now because I know that even if i have this it will take years to get diagnosed and get that reassurance and until then I will always be questioning it, gaslighting myself that I am faking it and that I am not that bad. 

Anyways that's it, if u read all of this than k you and please if you have the time share your thoughts with me in the comments.

130,New to BPD,"So I guess this is sort of my introduction, as im new and just exploringmy support options. I'm a 28F and married with 3 kids. I know the all the hate I'll get for this, but I haven't been clinically diagnosed yet, atm I'm still learning about bpd and collecting all the evidence to bring to my doctor so I can start the process of being diagnosed. 


Now that that's outta the way, let's start from the beginning. My mental issues, as it pertains to bpd, started manifesting when I was 9 after my parents split up. My parents were both abusive in different ways, mom is a narcissist and dad liked to beat us, but my siblings and I didn't know that our lives were all that bad because we didn't know any better. That was until the divorce... it was still pretty taboo to have divorced parents back then, so the schools put us in group counciling and that's when we started realizing everything. 


The divorce didn't make anything better tho, and as the years went on, everything compounded until I finally had a melt down. At 14 I was caught with razor blades on school campus, but the felt I was more of a threat to others than myself and I was sent to an alternative school for 3mos. When I got bk I basically told the school therapist I was going to keep mutilating myself bc no one cared enough to stop me. That's when I was finally hospitalized and diagnosed with ""severe depression with anxiety"". 3yrs later, that diagnosis changed to ""manic depression with severe anxiety"". I was on every medication you could think of, but nothing helped or lasted very long... my emotions have always been a daily rollercoaster for me and it was difficult to control.


At 19 I got pregnant with my first kid, I took preemptive steps on ppd. But all that did was delay the inevitable, and that was the last time I took any medication for my issues and started self medicating. I was doing pretty good until at 23, I lost what would have been my second kid. I spiraled for months after that, but even after it stopped I was still never as good as I was b4. Then at 25 I got pregnant again, and that's where things started getting really bad again. I didn't try to take meds during that time and the ppd hit me harder than the first time, even still as bad as I was, I still felt like I was handling it all very well... but 9mos later I was pregnant again and tht just turbo charged the spiral.


I knew my issues weren't normal and that I was worse than I had ever been b4 in my life, so I started doing research. Instead of focusing on past diagnosis, I researched all of my symptoms which I'll list off now.

☆ constant daily rollercoaster of emotions
☆various manifestations of paranoia
☆having different ""personalities"" for different people I interact with
☆hopelessness
☆self hate 
☆unstable relationships
☆inability to hold a job for more than 9mos
☆feeling like I'm not in control of my self or actions
☆impulsive habits
☆blackout rages
☆hyper fixation with new relationships 
☆saying things I don't mean
☆feeling lost
☆terrified of abandonment
☆feeling out of place or time
☆disassociating 
☆hearing/seeing things that aren't there
☆seething jealousy 
☆acute distrust, even with people close to me


Really I could go on and on, the point is that I came across bpd and everything just clicked. So I along with all of my research, I started listening to other people's stories and their struggles and it just solidified it all for me. I meet 7 out of 9 criteria points, and so I'm 99% sure that this is what my problems all stem from. Really, the only thing that's really stopping me from going to my doctors with all of this, is my distrust of the medical industry. I don't know how to approach the subject without sounding like I'm crazy or overreacting. I've had past professionals claim nothing is wrong and tht I'm just attention seeking, it's not often I'm ever taken seriously.

133,I need help understanding pwBPD," I (20m) just got discarded by pwBPD (21f) after almost a year of dating, i did my absolute best to treat her like gold. Flowers and chocolates at work, breakfast in bed you name it. I did it all. I’m not perfect but i did my absolute best to treat her right. 

Overtime the love of my life became distant and our intimacy took a hit, i just didn’t understand as our connection and bond felt so out of this world. I tried everything to make it workout and fix all our issues through communication and compromising. Even then we still had an insane connection but then she became even more distant and cold. Started having angry outbursts about little things but it all seemed like just stress getting to her or so i thought.

long story short recently i called her out on her distant behaviour and constantly wanting more and more time away from me and it turned into an argument. I hate arguing over text so i decided to meet with her in person and she was crying saying she resents me for this and that, all small issues that we could easily talk about but she claimed that due to these issues she needed space to consider if she wants to be with me or not. We cried about it but right before i was about to leave she asked me for a kiss and to go to the back seat of the car, she then got on top of me and said she missed me and wants to feel me. After we had sex i asked her if we are okay and she said she needed time still. I felt used and hurt

fast forward days later she breaks up with me and she’s crying her eyes out saying she hates herself and that she can’t forgive herself. She claims she just wants to work on herself. 2 days later i find evidence of her entertaining a guy she slept with before we dated, and the dates of the messages were during our relationship and matched up with certain days she wanted to be alone. I decided to confront her at her work after she got off and she physically attacked me and also claimed i’m the reason she cuts herself and wants to kill herself everyday… 

I haven’t talked to her since except when it came to the car we bought together. She blocked me and refused to be pick up some money for the car and she seems to be showing lots of regret and guilt according to people around her. But i found out she’s sleeping with all the guys she told me not to worry about… i feel sick and hurt, i’m wondering if this is some self sabotage episode of splitting or if she’s really done with me. Please help me I’m so crushed.

This is my first ever written post so i apologize if it was a hard read.

Edit: I also have mental health issues of my own but i’ve never abused her or treated her bad. Worst case was me having a mental breakdown but i never called her out of name or anything was just struggling. Shes also admitted to me in the past that she tries pushing people who care away so she can self harm etc",1687482025.0,False,1,9,LostMindBrokenHeart,None,14gkis3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/14gkis3/i_need_help_understanding_pwbpd/
134,Struggling with bpd and adhd,"I was diagnosed with adhd when I was around 6 and recently have been diagnosed with bpd about two years ago, I’m 22f. I struggle tremendously with adhd symptoms to the point where I feel like I can’t get anything done without stimulant medication. It’s like my head is foggy all the time and I don’t even know what I’m doing or what I should be doing until I take them. I’m not misdiagnosed or anything I 100% have adhd mine presents kind of like the typical boy adhd. Im hyperactive, hyper verbal, impulsive can’t focus ect, I have dyslexia, dyspraxia, all the typical related problems. I was medicated for this as a kid for years and then was off medication from around age 10 until about 2 years ago. Now, with my bpd, I’ve had pretty bad symptoms of this since I was a young preteen. It used to be more suicidal/self harm type stuff and I wasn’t able to control my anger outbursts. Once I learned I had bpd I’ve gotten a lot better about controlling that sort of thing because I know my reactions are are not always rational and the feelings I’m facing are temporary. Now the thing I really struggle with is the psychosis type symptoms and I just realized my adhd medication is triggering them. I get psychotic episodes where I am absolutely terrified. I believe that horrible things are going to happen to me like people are plotting to do things to me and I hear things like mumbled voices and sounds like someone is breaking into/inside my house and in the moment I have no idea if they are real or not. I can’t tell if the thoughts I have are real. I rationalize all the delusions in a way that makes them seem like they would 100% be reality. Even when I’m out of the mental state when I look back on why I believed the things I believe the rational makes pretty good sense. I used to have a lot of visual hallucinations like shadow people/creatures but I don’t really have any of those anymore. I also have phases of extreme depersonalization where everything feels like a dream or a video game. I don’t really remember if I had these things before taking the adhd medication. I’ve definitely always had dissociative episodes but that’s because I had a traumatic childhood. But I know I didn’t have these types of psychosis type episodes until recently. Prior to me just now realizing my adhd medication was triggering this I believed it was from smoking weed. I was a huge stoner starting when I was 17 up until last year and i stopped smoking weed because I thought it was cause these delusions and they went away for awhile but that time where they went away for I also was not taking adhd medication because I was in between drs and I just didn’t connect the dots. The main reason why I’m posting this here is because I don’t know how I should go forward with medication management. I’m supposed to go see a new psychiatrist next week and I don’t even know what I should tell them. Do I ask for adhd medication since I really do need it to function when it also does this to me? I wonder if I was on stimulants with an antipsychotic if I would be ok then? I don’t know if I should even tell them I have bpd because I feel like I need my adhd to be medicated so bad that I don’t know what I’d do if she wouldn’t give me stimulants after finding out I have it but at the same time I don’t want to take this shit if it’s gonna make me so fucking scared. I know I should really just be honest and tell them everything I’m saying here but I don’t feel like I can I have a really hard time opening up about the bpd stuff to people I’m not close with. Has anyone else struggled with this? Does anyone know if antipsychotics in combination with stimulants would help? Let me know what you guys think. I also wonder a lot if this could be something else like early symptoms of schizophrenia.

A ball of negative energy, he said. 

That’s me, a ball of negative energy. 

Full of trauma, despair, daddy issues, mommy issues. That’s me. 

Never content, always wanting more. That’s me. 

A minimal appreciation of the good things, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. That’s me. 

Dragging everyone down around me because misery loves company. That’s me. 

Burdening everyone around me with my baggage, that’s me. 

Pushing away the people who claim to care about me. But do they actually? Am I some sort of charity case? Do people just feel bad for me, because I’m like a helpless child? Is my trauma that obvious? 

I’m past it all, right? I convince myself I’m healed. I convince everyone around me I’m okay… until I bust at the seams once more. But then I pull it together quickly. Wow. That was scary. A moment of weakness. I don’t want to be weak. I’m strong, right? Trauma is supposed to make you stronger, “resilient” some may say. 

Putting what’s going on aside in my fucked up brain to be there. That’s me.

I(26M) recently, about 2 months ago started, dating a woman (22 F) who has BPD, and I really need help.
For the first 2 months everything has been great and yes she’s split a few times but it hasn’t been too major, and I can take the insults and the yelling. But all of a sudden she’s pushing me away after asking me to move in.
The biggest problem is that 2 weeks ago we had a very long and large conversation about how because I’m the person she loves the most that I’m the target for everything and that under no circumstances to let her push me away because when she splits she pushes everyone away and she doesn’t want that to happen with me.

152,I think my girlfriend (22) might have BPD or Bipolar Disorder,"I think my girlfriend of almost 2 years might have a mood or personality disorder. I’ve been doing some research into specifically BPD and Bipolar. 

We have been going through a particularly bad and long rough patch. There’s always good moments every day, but there just tension whenever it isn’t good. She is very tight lipped with her emotions and often won’t say what she’s thinking even when I can tell something is going on in her head. 

The only reason I think it might be Bipolar is because her mom is bipolar and it seems to run back further than that in her family. 

She always seems like she’s hiding something or is ashamed to tell me/doesn’t want to. I’ve suspected some infidelity for a while but at this point I would just want to know if it was happening and if it was, we could work through it. 

I’ve offered that to her before, making sure to be clear that I’m never going to be nasty or horrible to her no matter what, which I’ve very much kept to. She still refuses to admit, despite there being some evidence of at least SOMETHING going on whether it’s full on cheating or not. 

The main reason I think she has Borderline Personality Disorder is because of how quick to anger and defensiveness she gets, along with frequent mood changes. Her bar for annoyance and then that annoyance turning to blinding anger is unusually low. 

Her walls are always up, yet she is constantly emotional. So it makes it really difficult for a conversation not to turn into an argument when it’s anything involving something she may have done wrong or offended or hurt me in some way. 

I always, and I mean always, seem to be the one to apologize first, despite me being the one on the receiving end of the issue. I have no issue being the bigger person if I can trace something back to something I may have said or done. But she struggles with it. 

When I annoy her, it’s always because I feel offended or hurt by what she says. It may be a joke, but she can’t seem to respect my boundaries when it comes to teasing certain days. 

This is getting ranty, but at this point I’m convinced she has some sort of personality or mood disorder. She definitely has chronic severe anxiety and depression, and I’m not sure if that’s part of or the cause of this behavior. 

It’s really hurting us, and I’m trying to be the most understanding I possibly can, to the point where I’m willing to sacrifice our monogamy if that’s what she needs right now, which I’ve said to her. 

Not quite sure since I’m no expert, please leave me some advice in the comments if you have the time

153,I need to find out whether I have BPD or not.,"Context - I've self harmed consistently for about 6 months, and was suicidal for about 3 months, I have divorced parents and get extremely stressed when two adults are fighting because of the memories of my parents fighting, and I fell out with my best friend recently and we haven't spoken since.

1. They don't like me and therefore I shouldn't like them 
Or
2. They are mad at me and therefore I need to do everything in my power to stop them from cutting me off

Also I've had extreme mood swings for a while now, and when I'm sad I become suicidal and when I'm happy it's euphoric and other than that I just feel nothing at all - almost like I'm spectating my life like it's some shitty TV show. 
Also I randomly feel like I hate everyone, so I hide away somewhere on my own or avoid making plans with friends and just go out into the woods for a while.

155,i have bpd and my fp is finally leaving me,"my ex, and I have been in a Situationship for almost 3 years. he's my favorite person and honestly the only person in my life at all. every time he's tried to end things I will talk him out of it. tell him how much I need him and how hard I'm trying. I tell him how worried about him I am because he only does this when he's in some type of self-destructive mood. I can tell because of the negative self talk that he uses to justify leaving me. he'll say things like I'm a bad person you deserve someone better im holding you back etc. he's undiagnosed, but I do think he has borderline too or some thing similar. Maybe he just falls victim to seasonal depression very easily because It seems every time he's pushed me away it's when it starts to get cold outside. these self-destructive episodes scare me so much because I used to go through it and not even know what was going on at least now whenever I have a manic episode, I can tell. from what he's told me, I know people have abandoned him because of his depression. this is the reason every time he tries to push me away I have to talk him down. i can't abandon him he deserves so much more than that and I know that I can't just magically cure whatever it is that plagues his mental health but when someone you love tells you that they are awful and they deserve to be alone how can you just give them what they want and let them think that they are right? last night he ended things for real this time. he didn't say any of the usual things that I can refute like the negative self talk. he just simply told me that he loves me, but he's not in love with me and that I deserve someone who could love me to the full degree. How are you supposed to argue with that? we stayed on the phone all night, talking crying apologizing to each other for all the mistakes we ever made. I told him I was sorry that I couldn't let go and that I dragged out the pain so much and he said it wasn't my fault because he let me and he really wanted things to work too. he promised me he was going to get help because he knows he has a pattern. He told me maybe if he has ""a clear mind one day..."" and then didn't finish the sentence. I don't wanna get my hopes up, but I can't think about anything else. he also said that I am his best friend and he never wanted me to not be in his life. I just don't know how logistically that will work. he is and has always been my best friend but we've never been just that. The majority of our relationship consisted of cuddling in his bed watching Netflix and sex obviously. it was already so rare for us to go on dates and do normal little activities.

First of all, sorry for bad english. 

So how all started was when I saw video that says ""when you realise your mood depends on how much attention you get from them"" and i was like shit thats relatable af, them I looked at comments and 40% of them said thats bpd symptom.

So i got interested and decided to explore more abt it, litteraly almost all the symptomes are relatable: fear of abadonment (I thinking very often what if all my friends decided to leave me), unclear self-image (i always had this problem like if someone asked my to describe myself in few words i would not say anything), panic thoughs (i often think about me dying and my parents crying about me, getting cancer or falling from building, it scares living shit out of me i want it to stop) hate for myself for minor things, extreme emotional swings, drug addiction (weed) and chronic feelings of emptiness.

Thats all, just for context, im male turning 17 next week, diagnosing ADHD at 6, and depression & anxiety at 15.

164,Questioning if I may have BPD- Would like input,"This isn't a new thought for me, I have been on and off about this for over a year but haven't really gotten any input form anyone else. I have been in therapy multiple times throughout my life but have not been within the past year and a half or so.

For context, I am an 18 year old person, I am afab but transmasc (he/they), I had a mental health evaluation in March of 2022 and was diagnosed with mild OCD symptoms, moderate autisn symptoms, ADHD, and major depressive disorder (I don't really believe this last one), and I've been diagnosed with anxiety since I was about 11/12.

Mental illness somewhat runs in my family, addiction on both sides and my aunt has pretty severe OCD, and my mother is thought to have bipolar and she is on medication (unsure of what exactly) to help her with her mental issues.

I will not take anything anyone says as a final diagnosis as I really don't think this is a thing that can be so simply self diagnosed, but would really appreciate some honest insight from others. 

I'm going to go ahead and list some symptoms that I resonate with, and may or may not go into more detail for each other one. 

- An intense fear of abandonment, even going to extreme measures to avoid real or imagined separation or rejection

- Rapid changes in self-identity and self-image that include shifting goals and values - I feel like I don't really truly know who I am nearly all of the time and I feel like I could think one way one day and the opposite another. I'm not very passionate about many things, at least nothing I could make my life about.

- Wide mood swings lasting from a few hours to a few days, which can include intense happiness, irritability, shame or anxiety - I have somewhat extreme mood swings that can be triggered by nearly anything, no matter how miniscule. A change in plans, someone annoying me or upsetting me ever so slightly, etc, and they usually lead me to get very upset and kinda angry, and to get extremely angry with whoever upset me, even if I love them I will think things like how I hate them and they don't even care about me, etc. They usually last anywhere from 20 mins-a few hours, and I'm usually fine once they're done and I'm back to normal.

- Ongoing feelings of emptiness

- I have a pretty hard time making friends and being social, but this may be moreso due to my autism and social anxiety. I have always felt othered from people.

- My romantic relationships. I have been in 2 serious long term relationships in my life, and both of them are similar to how someone with BPD would act with their ""favorite person"". As silly as it sounds, I was 11 when I was in the first ""serious"" relationship, and I was with someone who I genuinely loved. Even then, I was very possessive and unstable, I was extremely jealous and very temperamental with how they responded to me and how they treated me would make or break my day. Looking back on it, it was definitely not a healthy relationship. We were both very young and going through trauma and bad things at home. This relationship lasted about 1½ years, breaking up right before I started 8th grade. We are now on good terms and are somewhat friends.
I was not in a long term relationship for years after that, untill about two years ago when I finally got with my partner (I will call them Angel) who I am in a long distance relationship with. Me and Angel met pnline through a mutual about 6 years ago, and were very close and best friends for years, and we finally got together October of 2021. Angel is my life and I really do love them more than anything, and they love me so very much as well. We have a very good relationship for the most part, but as all couples do, we have our troubles. Mostly on my end. Even when we were just friends (albeit very close ones), I've been very jealous and needy. I used to be genuinely codependent with them, but we've worked through it. Much like how it was with my previous partner, I'm extremely clingy to them and am easily upset if they do something wrong, such as not replying quick enough, not reacting how I would ideally want, even interacting with others without me, which is also partially due to my insecurity. Angel does their best to soothe me when I am upset, and I'm eternally grateful for them. We are always working through my problems together, but that doesn't stop them from happening. I am still dependant on how they treat me somewhat heavily, if I am upset with something relating to them then I will have a shitty day no matter what.
I am very aware that my thoughts/feelings about allot of things are not healthy. Overall we have a healthy relationship. 

-I already somewhat mentioned it, but ""splitting"" on people, even the people I love the most and devaluing them when they make me upset.

There is most definitely more, but this is a good chunk of it. Once again, I am not trying to self diagnose, I just want others opinions. I would like to get therapy in the future but I wouldn't want to bring this up and the therapist disagrees with me and then I feel stupid. I enjoy the anonymity of the internet.

167,Should I work things out with my friend who has BPD and lashed out at me?,"Okay so here’s the thing- 
I recently had a traumatic event happen with 3 other friends from our friend group and shared with the 4th person in the group who has BPD that I was diagnosed with PTSD due to it. She has been constantly minimizing it because she thinks my experience wasn’t as bad as the others and has said some extremely downright MEAN, HORRIBLE things to me, like that I’m a pathological liar and that I single-handedly broke apart the friend group (which is not true.) I have practically begged her to tell me what specifically is making her upset and how I can fix it, but eventually had to set my boundaries because I realized I am the only one apologizing when I don’t even know what I did wrong. 
I have noticed the jealousy being an issue for a while, as we have had problems with this in the past. She’s protective of our mutual friend, and through research, I’ve found out that many people with BPD have a “favorite person”. Any time I hang out with said favorite person, she gets upset. 

Now, I know she has been through A LOT. She has been in and out of mental hospitals recently and in general has had an extremely hard life. I never thought I would get to the point of being so hurt by someone that I didn’t think I could work things out, but she really broke me with the things she has said. 

Today, her favorite person talked to her and said she was being hurtful towards me. Then I get a text saying “ik i’m not good at talking but i want to try and fix things. i’ve said stuff that i don’t mean and im sorry it’s taken me so long to realize how horrible i’ve been, but i love you and i can’t lose you.”

I just can’t tell if this is real or not. I can’t tell if she’ll really be sorry, or if she’ll stop holding some mean ass jealous grudge on me, or whatever. I don’t know if I can ever fully forgive her for treating me the way she has. 

This all leads me to my question- Should I try to work things out with her? I don’t want to leave her because she had an episode and lashed out at me, but I’m so hurt by the things she’s said that I can’t tell if she was being genuine to me.

168,Psychiatrist gives weird reason why I don’t have BPD,"So for background, I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, adhd, and ptsd. Before one of my appointments, I did extensive research about the possibility of having a mood disorder. When I read about Borderline Personality Disorder, I checked almost all the symptoms of it. I brought this up to my psychiatrist, but she said, “Someone with BPD wouldn’t think they have it.” I thought this was a weird response. Is she right?

Edit: Thank you all for the responses. I just wanted to give an update. I saw a different psychiatrist before this one. I recently was going through my medical records of the one before, and I found out that he actually did diagnose me with BPD. He just never said anything. Soooo I'll bring this up to my current psychiatrist again to see what she says.",1687542211.0,False,9,12,coolzzzzzz,None,14h4tvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/14h4tvt/psychiatrist_gives_weird_reason_why_i_dont_have/
169,Which therapy for BPD with conscious self sabotage?,"Hi, I'm really sorry this is so insanely long, I've been unironically re-editing it for 2 hours 💀 even with chatgpt and stuff, I'm finding it hard to express myself, the original text was twice as long :/ I'm self aware of how childish and kind of narcissistic I sound as a person.

So I have BPD and probably ADHD, and I was thrown out of DBT (and another time I left myself, even though I had sacrificed a lot to get that spot) because they said I need more intensive (individual) therapy due to my lack of motivation. Basically only 40% of me wants to get better, and at least 60% actively and consciously wants to get worse, because of many reasons. It's been like this genuinely my entire life. It's a love-hate relationship, but tbh my disorder is all I have, I love it, and I don't really regret any of the things it's caused. Even though I'm miserable. I go in circles: I pretend to myself I want to go forward, but subconsciously I know I always go one step forward, two steps back, because I really just want the freedom of never having to commit to either hell or heaven, but always allowed to oscillate between the extremes, enjoy both of them, never truly change anything. Few days ago I read the term ""approach-avoidance repetition compulsion"", and it struck a cord with me. With everything.

Ofc I don't JUST struggle with conscious self-sabotage and emotional masochism, I have the full range of BPD symptoms, but it's a barrier to even working on them. I'm not sure how DBT can truly help me if I'm not even sure if I like happiness, or health, or responsibility, or in fact lean towards a no.

Recently I've want to know about psychodynamic therapy. I used to dismiss this as ""fake Freud mumbo jumbo,"" but recently I'm not sure. I feel like I need something that's less surface level than DBT... There are aspects of my psyche and childhood that genuinely puzzle me, and maybe understanding and processing them is essential before I can move on. I don't think so, but people often suggest there's repressed childhood trauma; obviously DBT couldn't care less. Subjectively I feel like a not crazy severe, but complex case, with a weirdly convoluted inner life. Maybe it's my annoying personality, but I always feel subtly broken in intricate ways that me and others barely understand, which must be impossible to untangle... :/

So, my question is, can psychodynamic therapy help me with this? Or is motivation a strict prerequisite there too? People say ""I can't help you if you don't want to get better"", but I don't know what they want from me. I can't change what I want and believe and feel on a deep level. And some part of me does want change. Would any sort of TFP, MBT,  or idk, ST or whatever, be able to help me WANT to change in the first place when I'm deeply resistent to change and very comfortable being sick? Or am I just doomed, or need to go down a darker path before I can get better? I'm not really sure who the therapies are for, or which presentations they help most

TL;DR: got kicked out of dbt and need to know which kind of psychodynamic therapy can help me with my lack of motivation + desire to get worse + fascination with misery and darkness.

170,Having a friend with bipolar or bpd..,"Hello. I don't really have experience for mental health issues. But I have one friend from highschool that has either bipolar or bpd. I'm not sure since she didn't tell me. But she is definitely diagnosed by doctor. The thing is, whenever she's having a manic episodes, she will contact me just to tell me how bad I am as a friend, provoking me on my past mistakes, and keep on repeating the same points every episode. Her manic episodes is very long. It's almost a month for every episode. It has been 4 times she's manic since she's been diagnosed from my knowledge.

At first I would just reply sorry and admitting to my mistakes. I knew she's having episode so I shouldn't trigger her much. But she keeps on poking on me, provoking, so I started to ignore her. Then she act like she's a victim from my doings to her family and our friends. 

When I ignore her, she will contact my mum to ask her to ask me to reply to her. So I did. I don't want her to disturb my mum. When the provoking kept on going, I got irritated. I asked her to stop, I'd fight her back. And that's when she became worst too.

But once she came to her sense, she said she can't remember anything she said during that time. So I felt sorry that I treated her badly. 

However now, it's happening again. She kept on provoking me until I replied to her. And then she lashed out all of her issues with me. It's the same issue for every episode. This time I couldn't take it anymore so I asked her to stop and immediately block her from everything, messages, social media etc. Her sister said her condition is getting worst, she's being violent towards her family.

I am at loss on what to do when she's having the episode. Like it's never enough for her. She's going to provoke me nevertheless. I need to have a calm moment for myself too. I have feelings too. 

If anyone know, what is the best way to treat my friend when she's having these episodes. I'm sorry if I hurt anyone by posting this.

172,BPD infant and struggling,"Well, I'm not really sure where to start but I'm hoping this is a sounding board for me to release whatever emotions I have to deal with. I labeled myself a BPD infant because I just found out that I have borderline personality disorder and caused the downfall and ultimate infidelity (from my ex-wife) after 8 years and now is causing the destruction of my current marriage after 5 years. I've found a woman who has done nothing but give me chance after chance to change and fix my mistakes but I have continued pattern of disrespect and distrust. We have couples therapy tomorrow at 10:30am and I not really sure what to expect. I have posted in a marriage advise subreddit and have been told that I'm there to listen and also there to accept responsibility. I don't have a therapy session until Friday this week, I have a message sent to my therapist as of late last night. After delaying and telling myself I could fix my issues without it due to family stigmas around therapy, which is a whole other topic. I'm really beating myself up because I feel I've waited entirely too long. I keep throwing the idea around in my head that she wants couples counseling to hurry along the end which I know sounds ridiculous because I feel like I'm a good guy, I care, I help around the house, have a stable job, I have never laid a finger to her in a harmful way, and she has told me through all this that I've been her stability for the longest time. She told me about a week ago that something has to change because she's built walls up that were previously down for 3ish years. I made some mistakes about distrust throughout the beginning of our relationship and which has morphed into a complete disrespect for her feelings and emotions without even realizing that's what I was doing. Again, I'm just really struggling because I truly care and love her. We are currently in-home separated because of our two year old daughter. This was my idea and when we talked about it, I call it the spiral, but it was the rollercoaster of emotions that people with BPD deal with. I went from being confident when asking if we could be ""roommates"" for a while so I could work on myself to saying we aren't going to make it because I just threw a grenade on our relationship. I'm just tired of the way I'm treating her. She deserves my best and what I'm offering her currently isn't it. She has been extremely supportive and patient until recently and again she's given me more chances than I deserve. She started therapy because of post partum depression and I'm so incredibly proud of the progress she's made. She's been able to deal with that and get past some past trauma that she's endured through her life as well. Anyway, I just need a place to get all this out because in the past 5 days I've bombarded my wife with all this and it's just driven a wedge. We have has some really deep conversations, like we used to have at the beginning of our relationship and the first couple years of our marriage. Was I mistake free? Absolutely not, but we were able to talk through the fights and arguments. So this is my way of talking to someone else other than my therapist or treating my wife as my therapist. Please feel free to offer any advise or if you don't mind me unloading some of my heavier thoughts. This seems a bit rambly but I just have to get some of this out to someone.

I have tried to talk to them about how worried/upset I am when it comes to their sexual risk taking behaviors, but they just get very defensive and then stop talking to me for a few days.

185,Dealing with violent thoughts after living with a BPD person for 2 years,"Well, I never saw myself posting on Reddit, but here we go:

I (m, 25), have been living with another person (m, 23) and other 5 people in an HMO between 2021 and 2023. The person suffering from BPD left a mark on us all, to the point where I have thoughts of commiting violence against him. Now I will try to explain the story so that I could get some advice on how to deal with the matter in a better way:

I met the person in question in 2020. He seemed like a decent lad, although a bit fond of alcohol and drugs. At the time, I was in student accommodation and we got friendly to the point of moving in the same house the following year.

Biggest mistake of my life. The person in question started to behave more and more erraticly. What I mean by that is random screaming/smashing up his room (next to mine) on a consistent basis, usually at night, for the most benign things, such as his laptop crashing or his phone not working as intended. When confronted, the person always evaded responsability with replies such as: ""It is just a bit of shouting, noone gets hurt by that"". His room was full of bin bags that he had his stuff in. We recommended him to take his stuff out to make his room nicer, never listened. September 2021-January 2022 was bearable, but February came with a failed relationship on his side. This is when shit hit the fan. I should mention that I was a 3rd year student with a dissertation that I was working on. Shouting and thrashing intensified, he started being obsessed with the sinking titanic and one night he tried to commit suicide by using smashed plate shads to stick in his neck.

Me and another guy from the house had to keep him wrestled down until police came in. Police took him to a mental health facility, but he stayed there just for the night. This repeated two more times, with the last time being finally kept in the mental hospital for a month. We were sick of police and fire brigades coming to our house, and I had my dissertatuon due in a week.

Despite all this shit, I kept contact with him, brought him his stuff to the hospital, and overall tried being supportive. He never even thanked me.

Fast forward to the new hmo in June 2022, I graduated and found a job, while he failed his year for obvious reasons and had to find some more permanent work (he was working as an uber driver with his bike). The bin bags were back in his new room, making it almost as bad as the previous. Me and one of his childhood friends that moved in with us covered his side of the council tax until about December, and he started being more spiteful towards me, because I was asking when can he pay us back. One night we decided to make him a surpirse, cleaned his room for himself, and made it livable. He appreciated it greatly initially, but after a few rage thrashings, it was back how it used to be. Things got worse and worse, more smashing, more excuses. He drank about 8 cans of beer minimum per day at this point, smoking my weed when allowed (i know, bad choice, but I wanted to show him that I do not hate him as he thought). During this time I became a bit sick of his BS, and I started calling out his bad behaviour in a more aggressive tone. Also I poked fun at the fact that he never ate a vedgetable or real food in his life, operating on frozen foods (chips and chicken) and sausage rolls to live. Found out that his diet was like that due to his mum, so I poked fun at that as well. Bear in mind, I always tried to sway him off alcohol and bad food, I was not just trying to banter.

He started resenting me more and more, he started drinking more and more, he got a job as a bar hand, he started drinking at work etc. He started blaming my callouts for his bad mental health. Then one night, he came home piss drunk, shitted himself, entered the house and left a line of shit up to the bathroom. I do not want to describe more. Next day, imstead of admitting to that and cleaning it, he left for his hometown and left the rest of us to deal with it. He suggested he will clean when he is back (in 3 days). Obviously we could peave shift in the house for that long, so we cleaned it ourselves and threw away the carpets that we could. 

When he came back, he never apologised or made any ammends. He said he appreciated us sticking with him, and that he planned a trip to reward us. The trip never happened.

I'm also terrified of work potentially finding out about my mental health. And terrified of therapists and doctors refusing to see me because of my medical chart.

I am the child of a mother with BPD, which for a great deal of my childhood was undiagnosed and untreated. Since late childhood, I've had an absurdly high rate of recall. I can remember conversations in almost perfect detail over long periods of time. I also can remember movies, books, and other media with a high level of detail. I'm a monster at trivia and I rarely have to taken notes in classes.   


As an adult, I've started to wonder if this is a trauma response. My mother was often triggered when/if I did not do things exactly as she said for them to be done. She would also rarely follow through on things like promises unless I could specifically remind her that she had made the commitment to me.   


Obviously, I've correlated these things. But I'm curious if anyone else has experienced or heard of anything like this. If this is the wrong forum, please let me know a better place to post as I'm new to reddit.

190,GF has severe BPD and is on the edge of ending it,"I(20M) have been dating my girlfriend(20F) for a little over two and a half years. Throughout our relationship we’ve been through A LOT of good and bad. From flying across the country to meet family, to sleeping in the car together because we had nowhere else to go. In short, i’m deeply in love with her and i’m willing to jump hurdles to help her with this mental disorder. Over the last 2 years she’s had a lot of mood swings and she’s even said some really hurtful things to me because of it and it’s really taken a toll on me and my view on our relationship. She’s told me before that there are many times where she’ll have a freak out and completely black out and forget what happened. She’s never been to a doctor about this but we’ve both came to the conclusion that it is definitely BPD. I want to get her to a therapist but I just don’t have that kind of money to spare right now.

I always thought these outbursts were her being emotional due to a stressful situation. We recently moved into an apartment which was very stressful but she was very optimistic and happy throughout the whole process and was a tremendous help. I’m fortunate enough to have a job where i’m able to pay all the bills and even have time to take care of a lot of things as well. I thought now that she’s in a less stressful position it would be at least less severe. As of yesterday and today, the outbursts came back and they’re just as severe. She talks about her life being miserable and how she should just end it. Now that she’s aware of it being bpd it’s even worse because she has a reason to believe it will never get better for her. I’m not very good at being an emotional support, I do what I can and try to push myself to be as emotionally supportive as I can but usually it ends up in her resenting me because i’m not as helpful as she’d like me to be. I try explaining to her how good her life really is and how i’ll always be here to take care of her. She only takes it as me rubbing it in her face and takes it as she’s a burden to me. I don’t truthfully think that, all I wanna do is help.

Basically I just need advice on what I can do to help her. I 100% will be getting her therapy but that’s not an option right now. In the meantime what can I do?

Also, i’m not great at explaining things so sorry if this is a little confusing.

191,losing everyone to my BPD; vent,"recently ive unfortunately had to cut almost everyone out of my life due to them overstepping my boundaries. i have Borderline and im hyper aware of it. i know almost all of my triggers. and ive made it a point to tell everyone close to me about these triggers and boundaries and how to deal with me when im splitting.

well it turns out not a single one of them listened to me. at all. 

my biggest and most important boundary is: when i am upset/angry, leave me completely alone until ive cooled off and I come to YOU to talk about it.

in the past two months, ive lost both of my “best friends” and now my girlfriend because none of them took this specific instruction seriously. when im splitting, i am completely irrational and i cannot control what i say/do. ill say ANYTHING purely to hurt others feelings when im angry and i literally cannot stop it, its just word vomit. of course i dont mean any of it and i regret it as soon as ive said it but i wont realize it until ive calmed down. but i know its still not okay to do and i always feel like shit when it happens so i set up that instruction of: “go away, ill come to you later” so i wouldn’t hurt anybody with my words/actions. i dont know what more i can do to save them from me when they blatantly disregard my boundaries, its like poking a lion and expecting it to not bite you.

im unmedicated, not by choice, but until i can get medicated again im at a loss here. if they wont listen, there’s nothing i can do, is there? im just tired of feeling like such a fucking jackass even though i tried to avoid it. i tried to warn them, i tried to keep it from happening but they just keep trying to force me into talking about everything right then and there. and when i say i cant/dont want to talk about it, everyone tells me im childish and cant have an adult conversation. im tired of nobody listening to me and not taking me seriously, especially the three people i held closest to my heart.. them disregarding me like this has sent me into a very deep depression and i feel horrible but i also know that im not the only one at fault. 

its just hurts a lot.. ive never been this alone in my life. and honestly, this situation makes me extremely resistant to making any new relationships. i dont want anyone else telling me they can handle it and then backing out or fighting with me because they don’t actually know/understand how to deal with it or how to listen.. no one listens to people with mental illnesses. no one takes us seriously. and i hate that im this way, i just wish i was normal.. then i wouldnt blame myself everytime someone leaves me again…",1682414015.0,False,1,2,literallyexploding,None,12ydrug,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12ydrug/losing_everyone_to_my_bpd_vent/

I want to clarify that I am not asking for medical advice or to be diagnosed by anyone here. I am asking for advice on how to go about asking a medical professional for a diagnosis. Essentially I have suspected I may have bpd for quite some time now for reasons I don't really want to get into here. 

However I was majorly discouraged by some friends of mine (for context I'm a freshman in college so I've only known these friends since the beginning of the semester in September of this year). Their reasonings for why there's no possibility of me having bpd were hugely based in stigma and misinformation around bpd but it was still highly discouraging. 

I am in therapy and on medication (ironically the type of therapy and medication most commonly used to treat bpd) but i still feel that a formal diagnosis would aid in progress in therapy giving both myself and my therapist a deeper understanding of my psyche. I also feel that it would give me the validation that my experiences are true and shared by other people as well as the relief of explaining thoughts and behavior that I've struggled with for years now. 

I am posting because I would like to hear some advice on whether getting diagnosed is worth it and I would like to know how to go about getting a diagnosis. should I ask my therapist outright? I am nervous about being immediately shot down like I was with my friends.

The narrative switched from how can I fix the world which is damaged to how can I fix myself whom is damaged. Here is what it feels like to be in my shoes:

It feels like I always need to be on top of myself managing myself (eating well, sleeping well, doing some physical activity, waking early, taking care of my self-image like haircut and clothing, surrounding myself with positivity, praying ..) and the moment I think life is good and I feel normal, confident and in peace and I let go of one of the self management techniques just wanting to live life normally without working too hard to feel normal .. hell gets loose and it bites suddenly. 

Self sabotage steps in and I eat stuff that make me gain weight if I was in a diet or I disconnect from people if the relationship was going well or I start to hate my job/boss .. life seems like a prison all of a sudden and that this prison is my equilibrium and happiness is something I need to work so hard towards but is temporary..

I buy cars and motorcycles on the spot impulsively and invest in new hobbies .. just to realize later that they might not have been the best decision but to me at the moment it seemed like change was necessary and if I don’t act and follow my gut I will back off and remain in my helpless unhappy loop. I remain in my loop either ways .. these impulsive decisions and commitments are momentary pain killers that eventually will go away and reality will hit harder the next time. I feel deep down that something is broken in my system; its not negative internal conversation or lack of self love. My system is broken and I am not a normal human being. 

I have reoccurring themes in amazing deep relationships that have very similar endings. I also find that being emotionally open, yet trying to manage my emotions by being spiritual and kind to myself makes me much happier than being logical and dismissive of my own emotions. I have learned to love and accept who I am, but my main struggles are that I have limitations when it comes to expanding my life. I have a ceiling to position I can take at work because I am unwilling to damage my health due to additional stress. I also have no intention in having a family anytime soon because I do not know stability and it would be unfair for my children

In my childhood I remember some bad experiences. My mom would lock me in the bathroom for hours to discipline me .. she would break a pencil tip on my palm because my handwriting wasn’t good .. she would break a wooden stick and smash my head to my brother’s when we miss behaved .. and she would shout at me and I wasn’t even a bad child, just a not so perfect anxious one who needed a bit of patience

Edit: oh, and I did engage in many risky and impulsive sexual activities as well and if I am not happy I often feel too overwhelmed to manage simple day to day activities such as cleaning the house and the bed and at work such as following up with someone. I also feel like I can flip on people from thinking they are great leaders to I hate their leadership style .. not sure if its loosing trust, which I have an issue with, or if its being an man of two extremes, which I am guilty of too. I also isolate myself and live alone so that I don’t hurt people and so that I can also protect my energy as I am a pleaser and eventually being around toxic people ruins me; I easily absorb the energy of those around me.",1670527887.0,False,3,2,Careless_Gur9994,None,zg8v83,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/zg8v83/i_think_i_have_bpd/

We have become quite comfortable around each other and I have started to notice a lot of things about her. I’d already noticed she had a lot of scars which I understand cause I have friends with similar things, but around a week ago, we had our first big argument which resulted in her becoming quite hostile to the point where I began to just ignore her for a couple of days. I have spoken to her today and she has spent a couple of hours on the phone in tears while she explains that she has BPD and the cycle of things being really great sometimes and turning to be really shit to the point she just doesn’t want to be around anymore.

224,"Help. Is that BPD? Can’t cope, don’t know what to do, feel trapped and terrified","Hi, that will be my first-ever Reddit post, and it’s probably going to be a long one, so I’m sorry for that. Before I elaborate, I’d like to acknowledge, that I am fully aware that only trained mental health professional can diagnose whatever underlying problems I might have, but unfortunately I won’t be able to seek any help in the near future and I really need to get this off my chest. 

I’m a M26, with a history of mental health issues. I've been diagnosed with GAD and depression when I was 19. Over over the past seven years, I've been on and off various SSRIs. About two months ago, I stopped taking Zoloft.

I've experienced hospitalization once, when I voluntarily sought help due to overwhelming emotions and fears of self-harm. The diagnosis pointed to a severe depressive episode, and although the doctors noted emotional immaturity, they didn't specify BPD. I was prescribed another SSRI and discharged after a two-week stay

I gotta say, medication work, but they do only because I experience severe emotional blunting while taking them. That’s it. I don’t feel happier nor more motivated. I just care less about anything, really, so they help with anxiety, obsessive thoughts and overwhelming emotions, but not depression. 

As mentioned earlier, I stopped taking my meds about two months ago because I met a girl with whom I'm currently in a relationship. She's my first romantic and sexual partner, and while on meds, I experienced a total lack of libido and ED. Although things are still far from perfect in this area, there's a improvement now.

Yet, my lack of sexual experience and poor performance (turns out I also suffer from PE) are things I am very insecure about. She's obviously more experienced, having been with multiple partners before, and I feel like I can't measure up. I hate myself for that. Constant self-doubt, feeling inferior, worthless, and less of a man have led me to start avoiding intimacy altogether, making everything worse.

I acknowledge how irrational and foolish these thoughts are. She loves me, and I love her. She supports me, cares, and worries, but all I can think of is how worthless I am and that she'll eventually reach the same conclusion – that I'm not worth her time and energy. In short, I fear rejection and abandonment. I've even contemplated leaving her first, just to spare myself from more hurt. I feel so worthless and pathetic that I firmly believe if I left, she wouldn't be hurt; she'd be happier, no longer dealing with all this.

I don't feel strong enough to fight all my demons; it's draining. I don't want to strain her anymore. I can't see how I can ever be happy and live a fulfilling life. I want to be the best version of myself for her, to be the best thing that has ever happened to her. However, I find myself trapped in insecurity, feeling like an insecure, mentally ill loser – a bitter incel in a relationship, with self-esteem crawling on the floor, unable to cope with my miserable past…

Talking to her about my feelings seems daunting. I fear it would only make things worse, as insecurity isn’t attractive. Despite feeling less than worthless, the potential for rejection terrifies me. I fear drowning in shame, despair, and self-pity, leading to isolation and a figurative self-destruction.

All that leads me to believe, that I suffer from BPD. Does it sound like BPD person talking? I certainly know that it’s not normal feeling this way.

227,bpd & chronic boredom (ptw),"okay, so im 18, will be 19 in november, and i was recently officially diagnosed with borderline personality disorder after being “diagnosed” with borderline personality TRAITS since 14 years old (i wasn’t an adult, so obviously they couldn’t necessarily dx me with bpd.) *i saw MULTIPLE doctors and therapists throughout these years and all said i showed bpd traits/it would likely form into adulthood* -

anyways, something that comes with my bpd (and some of my other disorders) is chronic boredom as well as emptiness. when people think of boredom they think changing to a different interest or going out and doing something you enjoy could help, but nope. no matter what i do, and no matter how much i used to (or COULD-) enjoy doing something, i cannot, for the life of me shake this boredom. nothing excites me or brings me joy, and its been like this for a very long time. even people, getting bored of someone is extremely and deeply upsetting, and sometimes, if im lucky, that feeling will go away just enough to enjoy talking to them again, but most of the time, it stays. 

for so long, (ages 12-16) i was constantly trying to commit suicide and was severely selfharming regularly (i am currently 1 month away from being 3 years clean though!), that i never had the time to feel that boredom and emptiness because i was so fixated on hurting myself and constantly in crisis, or drugged to keep myself safe. but now that im recovering from those behaviours, i am now realizing and discovering all these symptoms and feelings i didnt have time to realize i had for so long.

i used to think it was my persistent depression, but even outside of an episode, or if im not necessarily feeling depressed one day, the boredom is still there. it is so incredibly debilitating and i feel shame for it. as well as guilt.

i cant exactly seem to explain it in a way that most people understand, but i was wondering if others with bpd (or even non-borderline ppl who experience chronic boredom and emptiness) have advice, or just feel comfortable sharing their experiences?
*i also have cptsd which also greatly affects the emptiness*

228,how can i help myself and the relationship? i really want it to work ( i have suspected bpd),"Initially, I'd like to clarify that my English isn't my first language, so if there're any mistakes do not mind me. I also know that I am wrong, and I am expecting some guidance.  
  
\- I am a 23 year old female, and 2 months ago I got into a long distance relationship with a 25 year old man whom I love a lot. We met on Discord. We both are Egyptian but we live in different cities. I know he loves me, but I recently displayed a few behaviours and I believe they quite affected our relationship. The most significant was when I split but failed to recognize I was splitting until after shit already went down. I know I am very flawed because I tend to be over obsessive as a response to my fear of him leaving me. 1 week ago I thought I wasn't very important, he doesn't love me, and that he won't care if he \*lost\* me. I understand that no one should identify my self-worth except for me, but what I did left me regretful until this very moment. I had told him ''we're over'' then quickly took it back, but little did I know how much this affected him. I was fully honest and told him I said this out of fear that you'll leave me or that you do not find me interesting/ won't fear losing me. He emphasized that what I said hurt him, and that he doesn't love me any less after what I said but our relationship will be kind of rocky and it will need time to mend and heal. I also do something that annoys him , and I can't blame him which is "" excessive reassurance seeking"". I understand seeking assurance from time to time is healthy but asking every day or multiple times a day can be draining for him, so I also need to know how can I reassure myself so I stop asking him every 2 business seconds. I want to know how do I stop freaking out over a slight change in the way he texts, because we ALL have our ups and downs and poor man needs some rest. Also, he tells me to not excessively bring up an issue we have already closed/stopped talking about because this does nothing but ruins our mood and slows the relationship's progress. ( Please forgive me my thoughts are all over the place so I am trying to type all of what I can remember). Nowadays he is acting distant and I know its because he is afraid of another argument (because basically every time I excessively ask for reassurance it turns into an argument) , so I also want to know how do I not make him afraid of conducting a conversation with me because I genuinely do not wish to argue or do anything that upsets him again. Also another point, me and him haven't voice called yet, because of two things: 1- he is insecure about his voice, 2- his family is always around so they're strict about him being on phone with girls ( its a culture thing so dont mind it), and his friend told me that whenever his family aren't in the house he be wanting to ask me to VC but then some argument happens from my side that makes him want to go offline for 2 days, so how do I fix that as well?
