0,I haven’t heard anyone describe bpd as a form of psychopathy. I have heard people compare BPD to CPTSD and I think some psychologists theorize they’re the same but currently they’re generally considered to be separate conditions,GoggleBobble420,1cezjif

2,It's not psychopathy. Psychopathy isn't a diagnosis.,smavinagain,1cezjif
3,"The answer is no. BPD is a disorder of instability of emotion. It's not a disorder about having maladaptive thoughts and behaviors like psychopathy, it's about not being able to manage how you react and process your emotions. Just because personality disorders are grouped together in the DSM 5 really means there's some criteria for those disorders that overlap, but it does not equate to having them all. Also, mental disorders are not gendered. If you're a true psychopath,  you'll be a true psychopath no matter how you identify.",IntrovertGal1102,1cezjif

Example: everyone at some point in their life experiences narcissism and may end up behaving in a narcissistic manner. It doesn't mean that they now have Narcassistic Personality Disorder,  it just means they were narcissistic. We can have traits of disorders but not meet the full criteria to have that official diagnosis. Being human is a variable experience. Not everything we do or experience will have nor needs to have a diagnosis or label. Sometimes the ""diagnosis"" is.....simply being human.",IntrovertGal1102,1cezjif

1,"Not all partners are a match, some can absolutely deal with your issues and some simply can't. Some partners even can help you heal. It's about how well you match really. It likely gets a little easier once you get over the dating phase and just get used to being an actual couple. We honestly have very little influence on if it's gonna work or not with someone, you won't ruin anything by being honest about your feelings at this point. If they're into you, it'll work either way and vice versa. Communication works best, obsessing alone doesn't help, in my experience. Also he is old enough to pick up on mind games and likely respects a partner who is reliable and honest.


You could do little things for your partner, as a way to show them that you see them as a person and make an effort and prioritize them. Like bring them coffee sometimes or something, they might appreciate you a lot. And do similar things for yourself too and take care of yourself. Don't be so hard on yourself because these issues get better with age and there are a lot of good things you can bring to the table.",gummybearhunt,1cckgqq

2,"I agree with you. They should ban malignancy in action and nothing more. 

When I was 14 my mother was diagnosed with NPD. I asked the counselor what was the matter with me and he said that since my mother had NPD that I probably had BPD. 

I was only 14. BPD and CPTSD can look similar as well. but it seemed common knowledge to him back then in the 80s that these things run together. and I haven't been tested any further despite years of therapy.

Now that 40 years have passed since then I can say it def runs in families, and this may explain why skipping generations.

Also yes, very ironic considering childhood trauma can contribute to the development of BPD.",Peter_Lobster,upg9aq
7,"While there's a lot of stigma against people with mental illnesses and personality disorders, and we should fight against it, we have to understand that mental health problems usually have a toll not only on ourselves who have it, but also (specially in personality disorders from the cluster B, denying it helps nobody) in the people that surrounds us, like loved ones, family and friends. Not everything is black and white.

The subreddit raised by narcissists is a safe place for victims of abuse. Most of them were children when the abuse started. It is not a personal attack, and we have to understand that people are allowed to have spaces to process their trauma without the fear that people are going to victim blame or derail the conversation. That's a boundary, and people that are victims of abuse caused by a person with a personality disorder are not obligated to cater nor help them. It's unfair.

Does it suck to not be able to comment there? Of course. But it's worse to be a victim of abuse and not feeling safe nowhere. You can always read the sub to learn, but you also don't have to. You can have your own boundaries and not subjecting yourself to read that kind of subs. There's also subs for people with BPD, where they don't allow comments from people who hate them. 

I know that BPD sucks, not personally, but my sister was diagnosed, and I know that it is very hard. I've seen her suffering because of it all of her life, but I've been abused by her all my life too. I still love her and want her to feel better, but it is very hard on us, her family, too . 

But I am happy to read that you are making progress, it gives me hope that maybe my sister will feel better too. For decades doctors believed that BPD didn't have treatment, but that is changing. It's still hard, not gonna lie, It's an uphill battle, but isn't it better to actively try to be a good/better person than to just be neutral by default? You are allowed to be proud of your progress, what you are doing it's hard but rewarding! You will feel better too. I hope you'll be.

word narcissist when they actually just mean abuser. 

I understand that a lot of us were hurt by others with cluster b disorders (i was abused by a mother who has bpd and a father who very likely has npd) but we will get nowhere by stigmatizing narcissism and using it as a placeholder word. it’s hard but we need to stand in solidarity with them because, as you’ve seen, they’ll just start attacking us next.",,upg9aq

11,"I totally agree with you. I think that, while we have come a long way in society, there is still a prevailing notion that mental health problems make you “bad” or “evil.” Certain behaviors are harmful to others, but this does not make the mental health disorders that caused those behaviors “evil.” In fact, stigmatizing them makes it less likely for people to seek help, and increases the likelihood that they will lash out and hurt others. 

I saw one post on this very sub where somebody was asking if they are “crazy,” and using words like “idiot” and “wrong,” to describe themself. It makes me sad to think of how demeaning some people are to themselves because of totally pointless and ignorant hatred against the people we should be helping.",Big_brown_house,upg9aq

14,"I'm not surprised. That sub is toxic. I was in it for a while and convinced myself I had to go ""NC"" with my mom for several years. Those ended up being some of the worst years of my life because I just couldn't let things go. I was letting the bitterness take over.

Eventually I started talking to my mom again because I realized I was ignoring the aspects of my personality that I picked up from her and needed to address. And how was I any better than my mother by doing what she did the majority of my childhood and neglecting her? Now my relationship with her is more like a ""study"", I guess you could say. It's *very* common to have narcissistic tendencies when you were raised by narcissists. What better way to overcome those tendencies than to look to your parent and understand the triggers?

If any person takes the absolute worst day of their life and saw a doctor that same day, I guarantee you that they would walk out of the hospital with some kind of stigmatized diagnosis too. Do not believe anyone who says your personality is defected in any sort of way. Instead, work to overcome the abuse and trauma that you went through, help others and do something that challenges you. These are ways that you can naturally modify your behaviour under unfair and stressful situations. Do not identify with someone else’s opinion of you.

19,"Pretty sure the JD/AH defamation trial is making this come back up as a problematic diagnosis because of how Depp’s psychologist/therapist (?) witness described BPD with regard to Heard.

21,"It’s completely ironic that a community meant for those who have suffered narcissistic parents exclude a population of people who (in many cases but not all) have suffered narcissistic parents. Suffered in such a profound way they have developed a long lasting, difficult, and isolating illness. Anyone with BPD seeking out that sub would obviously indicate that they have endured a narcissistic parent and they are just as deserving as anyone else in that community. 

Just because someone has cluster b diagnosis does not make their experience invalid. Your input and opinions aren’t dangerous to others. You are just as much a survivor as they are. Most people with BPD are in therapy or have sought out therapy. I would suggest those who are so anxious and fearful that they generalise and discriminate against people within their OWN community that happen to have BPD should seek out for themselves.

28,"What about those who have BPD that suffered abuse from parents with narcissism? That is the entire point of this post, the discrimination and exclusion of other survivors who happen to have BPD. I can’t imagine their experience derailing the conversation.

Not at all saying every narcissist is an abuser, just abusers that happen to be narcissistic are different from other types of abusers.

For example: I totally understand me not being able to participate in a BPD abuse sub.

However, I do think it’s important for these communities to stress that, again, not everyone with narcissism is an abuser. I understand the frustration firsthand but I feel like communities don’t moderate that thinking enough which leads to people ACTUALLY using the word narcissist as a replacement word for abuser.

Actually I'm leaving a lot of subs that make me sad... While some people find them helpful, I get emotionally drained by reading that kind of stuff. It's hard to explain that this stuff doesn't necessarily make us abusive, but it can make us lash out and hurt people.

1,"Destigmatisation takes time. BPD seems to be the currently most debated one, although most/all PDs get the ""bad person disease"" stigma. Arguably as BPD is a heavily gender diagnosis often given to traumatised and/or autistic AFAB people, it's a little quicker to be dismantled than others so far (narcissist/narcissistic/NPD is still overused and conflated). Generalisation about a groups moral worth/value is unhelpful and muddying, and fails to recognise the reality that these groups are often traumagenic disorders, and more likely to be abused themselves than be abusers. That doesn't mean they can't have dysfunctional learnt patterns - but it is not a 1:1 guarantee of abusive behaviours.

You can still find articles and forums for ""survivors of autistic abuse"" or ""survivors of bipolar abuse"" within the last decade, which characterise people with those diagnosises as inherently cruel, manipulative or uncaring. That's not the reality for all with the diagnosis, but it has been the individual relationship experiences of the posters, and they feel the need for validation and community. Abusers can have mental illnesses, but not all abusers are mentally ill, and not all mentally ill people are abusers (again, they are statistically more likely to be victims of abuse than to perpetrate it).

Emotional abuse is broadly not considered 'real' abuse, in the same way that harm with a physical component is. That's of course ridiculous, all abuse does harm (and all abuse is at its absolute root emotional abuse, as it relies on subsuming one person's boundaries/needs/safety to soothe/regulate the other) but it is disheartening to feel constantly gaslit and minimised by society that what you experienced doesn't 'really' matter in the same way. Adding a scary modifier - that it was 'BPD abuse' or 'narcissistic abuse' or 'autistic abuse' - helps make the pain feel more to scale, more meaningful and serious. It's a bid for empathy and to be recognised that unfortunately relies on leveraging ableism to receive the care and validation that should have been available regardless of who the perpetrator was. And while I can empathise with that, it doesn't excuse continuing stigmatisation against vulnerable groups, and that's something folks need to work through.",shellontheseashore,18bp2iz

4,"if you make any generalized statements about the worth or inherent value or goodness/badness of anyone based on an illness they have it is wrong no matter the illness. for example: saying ""I've had horrible experiences with people who have cancer, they always are sad and annoying and so needy and they are not friendly at all"" is always a wrong statement to say, because you are saying that all people with cancer are that way. if you say ""people with schizophrenia are insane, annoying and i would stay away from them if i were you"" is also a generalization and therefore unjust towards people woth schizophrenia as a whole. if you say ""people woth bpd are always so clingy and annoying and they will never get better because they are just crazy and always in the wrong"" you also are basically discriminating them on the basis of their illness, just as in the previous examples. it works just the same as it would with any other trait someone might have, be it being skinny or having freckles. the difference is not in the treatment towards the people with bpd, but on the fact that you see this behavior more frequently because the stigma toward bpd from society is a lot more prevalent and harsh than maybe it would be for having diabete or suffering from depression, or in this case from other personality disorders, although this is not at all to mean that no other 'categories' of people/traits face stigma/discrimination. also there is a component of prevalence of the disorder in the population, that makes bpd to be the main target between the ones mentioned, and also the fact that things like psychopathy is largely seen as the 'evil people' disease and therefore has less defenders, because many don't even think of it as a thing that exist much. so in a way other illnesses in the same category face more stigma, however I'd say that the addition of bpd being kind of a scapegoat for mental illnesses, especially toward women, for the general population and its prelevance both in number of sufferers and in the amount of awareness the general popular has of it compared to other illnesses of the same cluster make it so that bpd is kind of mainstream in the way it's targeted and therefore it is kind of mainstream the defense against that stigma. i believe that if there was more general knowledge of the others, those would be targeted in a similar way and get defended in a similar way, because these are mental illnesses and, like most things in this field, they are surrounded by stigma and an aura and practice of discrimination",gsupernova,18bp2iz

Antisocial personality disorder, as the name suggests aren't that busy with the social aspect, or what other people think, so don't try to refute it or just don't care about your wrong/different opinion.    
I myself am bipolar, and both from literature and experience with support groups this is backed up, I haven't encountered a single person with BPD that doesn't to some degree compromise themselves for others or want to commit unalive.      
The disorder used to be called manic depressive disorder with a statistical split of 25% of the time manic (AKA good mood, some times a bit too good) and 75% depressed (quite often accompanied by suicidal) .   
From the support groups I've partaken in, a large part have been admitted, or started going to the meeting because of severe, serious thoughts of suicide.   
So personally I'd defend it by saying there's an uneven split as to which of those disorders most regularly want to kill themselves, and the ones more at risk should maybe warrant more consideration.   
I'm definitely not saying it's all good, and that you can't have bad experiences with it, but medication helps a lot, depending on getting the right fit, and otherwise, usually most of those troubles come from a lack of clear communication.",Zzimon,18bp2iz

I'm not a licensed professional but from what I know, Personality disorders are not purely genetic. They develop from a mix of your genetic predisposition and environmental factors (for example but not limited to abuse and neglect during childhood).

I know having these symptoms is really scary. The feelings are really intense, and they hurt really bad. But living a good life while being BPD is entirely possible and achievable. If you can, you should see a psychologist. But I understand that it's not always an option, so;

I recommend you look into DBT therapy techniques and I'm pretty sure you can find DBT workbooks as PDFs online for you to work with them.

If you want to, you could check out [Dr. Daniel Fox](https://youtube.com/@DrDanielFox?si=Y5hrq3aVUn7KBxf8) on YouTube. He's helped a lot of patients with BPD. Most of his videos are targeted towards adults with BPD but you might find them helpful as well.

There is hope. There is help out there for you. It's also entirely possible that you don't have the disorder and are only exhibiting certain traits. Getting a diagnosis would be helpful, but the most important thing is that you keep yourself healthy and happy.

With BPD I get angry at people easily and feel like our relationship is over with and that they don’t like me and I’m a bit stubborn so I can’t tell if it’s my BPD or if I just don’t wanna let that person back into my life but I get a bit stingy and say they’re done and I will just never talk to them again I’ve done this with multiple people I’m not saying she’s like this at all. 

I’m just being honest but at the same time sometimes when I have an episode and I’m really mean to someone I immediately feel really bad but it’s just really hard with the anxiety to admit to being wrong and and hurting my ego with BPD and admitting to it I don’t know if that makes sense maybe she’ll come around and understand she was feeling that way

Manic episodes can last different amounts of time for people. If she’s going through one of these and is feeling this way, maybe it’ll change if she’s levelheaded this might just be how she feels and she might genuinely think that you just hate her or something I don’t know 

I think that you should really try and sit down and talk to her even if in public give her some time obviously maybe say once she’s ready and you’ll wait however, long you need to that you’d like to talk and make sure you listen to everything she says even if she is a little upset, hear her out and just talk calmly",Fantastic-Regular-31,1awfzza

1,"This response is going to be long. But I do have advice from the perspective of someone who has been in your shoes, if you'd like to read it.

# On the matter of diagnosis and care:

As I understand it, a formal diagnosis of BPD requires at least 6 months of observable behavior from a therapist or psychiatrist. I learned this because I'm currently being assessed--though we have several comorbid diagnoses on the record at this point. That said, your symptoms are a match. BPD often develops from long-term exposure to trauma, which it sounds like you've had. Trauma therapy would be the way to go with it. DBT is the gold standard for BPD, but it's also great for general trauma therapy. EMDR is supposed to help as well, but I haven't tried it.

If you're in the states, the availability and quality of care is very locational. Any which way, it's probably more accessible than you think. I've been on Medicare in two states, and the experience has been vastly different. If your region has shitty therapy availabilities, reaching out online like this is actually a really good start, because there are a lot of us who have experienced similar things. In your shoes, I would look into trauma therapy, because it's the first step in getting a diagnosis.

As for affordability and hospitalization, please look into your local social care structures. State Medicare is almost universally income-based with minimal (if any) copay, so if you don't currently have a great source of income, that will be your start. If you have insurance from a parent or job and the copay is too high, you can \*still\* apply for Medicare on top of your primary insurance.

# On the matter of support:

You spent a significant portion of your post being concerned about your partner, and I think that's fair. It's hard to care for someone with BPD, because their struggle can overflow.

First: You need more external support. There's nothing wrong with that--everyone needs support--but you need to broaden yours. You *must take action* to seek more support A supportive partner, ***which you have***, is an amazing beginning, but you need friends, too. A therapist. A community. All of these things are so so hard for someone suffering with trauma because of the risk you take in putting yourself out there, but they're also very necessary to avoid the toxic dependency you fear. You also have to gravitate to what's comfortable for you. (For me, I got involved with the online D&D gaming community and then with intensive therapy.)

Second: You need to learn how to be kind to yourself, which will help you learn how to support yourself in your hardest times. Hold yourself to the same standard of kindness you hold your partner to, even though it's hard to love yourself as much as you love him. Loving yourself is an important key for healing trauma, even if it seems an impossible task if you have to stop hating yourself first. So start with being kind to yourself. (For me, I pause to question my negative emotions. Why do I feel this? Is this emotion reasonable? If yes, let's explore it. If no, quietly ride it out, because it's an emotion that will pass, just as the tide does.)

# Post Script:

For what it's worth, you've done an amazing thing by writing all this out and posting it for feedback--it's is so brave of you to do so, and it really shows your desire to heal. I've read all your prior comments as well, and I want to take a moment to reassure you that your emotions and experiences are valid. If, after hearing all of what you've written here, your prospective therapist is dismissive, don't hesitate to dismiss them in return. You deserve good care. Advocate for yourself.

Nobody has rights to give up on you just because you dont have a job. That literally says nothing about your worth or deservedness. If you are not having the right support at the moment shows that you never really had  enough support or understanding growing up.

2,"There are ways to heal and ways to come back up from where you are. You are more than capable. And you deserve a good life. You will need to tackle your difficulties one by one. 
You are a deep and spiritual person even if you dont realize it, and the reason why you feel so isolated is because you have separated yourself from your higher/energetic/spiritual self. Life will always feel hard as long as you don't find or accept that you are not only your physical body.
But spirituality(not religion)is something you need to find it yourself.  No one can ever make you see what you are not ready for. So I will not dwell on this.

Then you have to learn to accept where you are. Be compassionate and understanding to yourself.  Stop comparing yourself to others, because you have a different life and different things to learn. You are where you are because there is something you need to learn, so you can achieve that life you truly want. 
You are deeper person and you don't want to live the same way or have the same kind of life that other people, (people who never stop to question themselves,  who live like robots and just do what others want them to do) have. You dont want to create or live by  the same old beaten path. You want to create your own authentic path. That's speaks truly to who you are. 
So don't compare where you are, to others.  Or to where you think you should be.
Accept and Let it go.
Then, learninh to live yourself. Being hard on yourself,  hating yourself didn't take you too far. It's time to learn to love and accept yourself where you are, without all the exterior motives. Loving yourself because you have all the things you want, looks, status, friends, etc it is not true love. Loving and being compassionate to where you are without any exterior motives is true unconditional love. This type of unconditional love is rare. But this is one of your lessons to learn atm. Can you do that? 
Figure what true unconditional love really means,research on it. One of the reasons we are here in this life is to learn to unconditionally love ourselves. 

Then you need to work on your belief system. If your own childhood was not difficult, if you were not emotionally or physically neglected by your caregivers,  theb most likely you developed thinking patterns and beliefs systems from your parents. One or both or them have had a difficult childhood or neglecting parents.

It is important to identify your beliefs. Your negative beliefs of yourself and life. You can't heal what  you don't know you have. So our lives and relationships will show to us like mirrors, the beliefs we have of ourselves.  Although it seems hard, that's actually a great thing, because we can at least have the choice to change and build new beliefs that are  in alignment with what we truly want.  Instead of living being less than what we want and  carrying the bags of our past/parents. 

To change these beliefs you will need to research a lot on it. Specially if you are not able to afford a really good     professional help.  You won't get your whole answer from one place only. You will need to explore, be open minded. To try different areas, different healing methods etc. Follow your curiosity to learn about yourself.  Focus on self-development. 

Please read some important stuff like book 📖 ""the body keeps the score"" by the psychiatrist and trauma resarcher MD Bessel van der Kolk. If you can't pay for it ,there is pdf file and there are a lot of videos(also his own) on youtube about this. 
This will help understand yourself a little better.
Read the book📖 ""Letting go: The path of surrender "" 

You will need to learn to rewire/re-program your brain. Learn how to do it,  find what works for you, what resonates with you.  
To reprogram you will need repetition. 

I will tell you the way I did. The best way is to do it in a calm state of mind. Through relaxation, meditation, mindfulness  or right before going to sleep.
Right before going to sleep when you are relaxed, create a mental image of you doing or being exactly that what you want to be. If you are scared of something or if you have a negative believe you want to change,  imagine yourself being or acting like you wouldn't be scared at all. Or like you would have already the belief of yourself/life you would want to have.
How would that feel? How would you talk/walk? How people would talk to you? 
I healed my fear of abandonment, low self-esteem, not loving myself, I changed how I see myself,  I changed my physical body, and many negative beliefs just by doing that.

People who go through traumas need to teach something different to their brain. By repetition and visualization you can teach your brain a new belief, a new way of seeing yourself.

Neville Goddard teachs visualization. Check on youtube his audiobooks.

Our negative beliefs, of life and of self will dictate how we act, how we think, how we feel. We will allow or sabotage ourselves because of what we believe we are and because of our fears. Visualization of what we want and what we want to be is a way to change and teach our brains a new belief.

0,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time, but I'm here to give it to you straight. You've been through some hellish experiences, and it's understandable that it's taking a toll on your life and relationships. But let's not kid ourselves – having BPD, trauma, and stress doesn't make you a bad person.

You're trying, and that's commendable. Medication and therapy are steps in the right direction, but remember, progress can be painfully slow. It's crucial to continue seeking professional help and support from those who understand BPD.

You're not a failure. Life has thrown some monstrous challenges your way, but surviving domestic violence and sexual assault speaks volumes about your strength. It's okay to lean on others when you're stretched thin. You don't have to carry the world on your shoulders alone.

As for deserving happiness and peace – you're as deserving as anyone else. Your past doesn't define your future. You're a work in progress, and it's okay not to be perfect. Relationships are tough for anyone, and BPD adds an extra layer of complexity, but with time and effort, they can improve.

Keep working on yourself, keep talking, keep healing. Life can be brutal, but it's also filled with moments of beauty and happiness. Don't give up on yourself just yet",Ejoseph5,167hewf

As someone who also has bpd I totally can understand you. It’s hard and difficult to find people that understand what we go through. It’s a constant battle of trying to get better and thinking „well f it“.

I got my self into a ward but while in the ward my family and ex decided that I was unstable due to smoking weed and organised to remove my kids from my care, same kids that I have been primary carer of for their whole lives, same kids Ihave never yelled at, smacked or anything. They didn't tell me so I came out of hospital to find out I had lost my kids but also my family had kicked me out so I was homeless. I have since quit weed, took up intensive therapy, gotten full time job and am fighting for custody of kids back.

I’m on an antipsychotic as it is- olanzapine, it literally does nothing in terms of not hallucinating,it does help me *rationalise* and be like ok this isn’t real kinda thing? But it’s still scary and sometimes so scary that I feel paralysed, but that doesn’t happen to happen often.

I was seen 3 times a week by 2 psychotherapists and a psychiatrist. 

I ended up going to amhs where they just diagnosed me straight away as soon as my referral went through. So maybe they have it noted down on your files but don't want to tell you until they work with you a bit more (sometimes psychs don't tell you in camhs so that you don't mimick symptoms or overwhelm yourself)

I'm neither psychiatrist or psycholog or psychology student so consider my reply as a random guy from the web It's up to you to take my comment serious or not. First of all the answer of your first question is: Yes. You're being abused by this dude. But as I understand from the story your mentality let this guy to abuse you. The thing is that I belive you are concious about his behavior after you start dating with him, but you have chosen the path which is ""I'll Fix Him"" that is very common among teen girls. I feel like you still feel guilty from your ex boyfriend that's because you lied to him and cheated and your new relationship went way worse (at least as i understand.) So let's come to solution. My mentaly always were kind of a toxic masculinity mentality for many western people so, I believe that you don't need to help someone if their mentality is f'ed up. I think you know more than me but these abusings becomes violence after time passes. And Since I'm also from Turkey, we both know that many ""women murderers"" starts from this kind of situations. They basically put their women in center of their world and when she left you know the rest. So what I can say is, try to make him go psychiatrist regularly and let him stop drinking. Forget about the money that you gave him and if he does something phsycially to you which includes holding your arms very tight get rid of him immediately and if he continue to disturb you tell your parents or someone you trust.

0,"Hi, well I have bipolar disorder and while it's not the same as bpd, I understand where you're coming from. I feel sometimes people don't know how to react with people with mental illnesses,ones where psychiatry is needed. I am too an overthinker and analyze everything in text messages from the tone to how much they say, so it can be tough. But if they are truly your friends, they will accept you for who you are, but seek down they are sad that you are suffering. That's how at least I see it. If they really dislike you for being who you are, then they are not worth your time and concern. But if you have deep talks about it with them, then it should be fine. Sometimes they can't handle what you are going through, so they distance themselves a bit. You may always be the one that reaches out first, but that's ok, it let's them now that they mean a lot to you too.",Some_Resolution_4907,18n00bh

A neuropsychologist test runs about 5 hours and will give you an accurate description of everything that ails you. You really need to treat your depression too. It doesn’t just go away. I had to try quite a few meds before I found what worked for me, an antidepressant along with a mood stabilizer to get me thinking straight again. If you do have bod you’ll still need to treat your depression. It will bring back a quality of life for you that you deserve but you have to take the meds as prescribed, not sporadically. I learned that the hard way. I was also diagnosed with bod but since my diagnosis I’ve worked at my behavior and my therapist isn’t seeing those qualities in me as much anymore which I’m happy about.

Edit: I read your reply to another comment and yes, having BPD causes extreme mood swings where it feels like there is a monster living inside you that sometimes comes out.. my now husband said at the time that i didn't seem like the same person at all, I was happy go lucky and funny when I was ok and then turn violent, crying, irrational, self-harming... its scary.

2,"Considering you've mentioned splitting I assume you're not unfamiliar with at least some things BPD. The thing is, even if you understood it extremely well and acted accordingly, being in a relationship with a pwBPD is sadly far from easy. Whether her saying she just wanted to work on herself was genuine or not, she definitely should and whether you want to stick around for that you have to decide for yourself. 

Either way, it'll be useful to learn more about how the constellation of behaviors and traits that is BPD affects relationships. You can look up doctor ramani on youtube. Here's how I see it (just keep it mind I'm no expert so take it with a grain of salt). The reason for becoming distant (apart from splitting) could be something called engulfment. At one point when you get very close the person can start fearing that they will lose themselves in a way, the line between self and the other person is blurred. The sad part is that her saying she self harms and is suicidal because of you (indirectly) is likely true. But it's not your fault, that's what BPD is. The extreme pain and fear of potentially being abandoned does that to you. Then she does something hurtful impulsively and the prospect of losing you is all the more real, thus the cycle continues. It isn't you as a person that's the reason she reacts this way but rather the position you are in, in relation to her. It's true that she's feeling lots of guilt and remorse. While actions generally speak louder than words, there's sort of a disconnect between the two here. And I'm not talking about splitting, that's different, what I mean is that both her regret & guilt and hurtful actions are real and it can create an excruciating dissonance in a partner, understandably so. 

Those are just my thoughts, you can decide whether you think they're accurate or not. You may feel like I've been mostly defending her but that's not the point, or the case for that matter. As I said, those hurtful actions are very much real and I'm really sorry you've had to go through that. I know the ""I'm sorry you've had to go through that"" script sounds meaningless on the internet but I am, really. All the emotional turmoil from possibly losing her would've been more than enough but to feel used and hurt like that is just awful. You are absolutely valid to be feeling this way. 

I can't tell you whether she's done with you or not but you should probably be done with her sadly. Not out of spite or revenge but for your own good, and possibly her's too. I know it's very difficult, it will be for her too but it's not like these issues are gonna magically disappear in a month, even if she goes to treatment. You could try to make this work but it's going to be hard and you need to consider how it affects your own mental health. But regardless of that, she needs help and if you want you can gently push her in that direction but don't be surprised if you are met with lots of pushback. And lastly, try not to get too resentful. You have all the right to be angry at the things she did, they were awful no matter how you look at it. But try your best to understand which I know you are because I've read the title 😉

They said “i thought she was with you?” i haven’t been in the city for a day and a half… The mom calls her and all of a sudden she picks up her phone, then she finally starts replying to my texts saying she’s hanging out with a male coworker at his place. I get pissed naturally but i stay calm, she was saying they were watching hockey in his room.. she doesn’t like hockey. She finally gets home and i confronted her about how odd everything was and then i asked her flat out if she slept with him and then she spins the narrative saying that i’m controlling and she feels like she can’t have friends and doesn’t know if she can handle being with me etc.  It was fucked up and it turned into a nasty fight where she said some hurtful shit towards me.

0,"Also consider CPTSD - if you were not diagnosed by a professional, I wouldn't stake too much in that label. CPTSD mimics BPD quite a lot however - I've known people who were professionally diagnosed BPD, have been in programs with them, and I am not nearly so over the top, have insight into myself, something a lot of BPD sufferers don't have. CPTSD (not in the DSM) is a better fit for me. A lot of the same things you say could have been said about me in the past, however, finding good therapists to help with trauma and reading about CPTSD plus watching youtube channels specific to it have helped me implement a lot of changes in my life. The same things could potentially help someone with BPD who's willing to change.

I think a label is less important than doing things to help with self improvement, so I recommend listening to the Crappy Childhood Fairy and Patrick Teahan on youtube, reading Pete Walker's book on CPTSD, getting a workbook on Dialectical Behavior Therapy (created for BPD treatment but generally useful for anyone with mood regulation issues and relationship challenges), and finding a therapist with EMDR and Internal Family Systems training to sort out the chaotic internal landscape and make sense of things.

Anyone without BPD who learns about the condition in a loved one is swiftly told to leave is behind before we destroy them with our sick minds. We just aren’t worth saving to the majority of the tell regular population. 

We are often compared with Narcissists and some of our baked in behaviors will mirror them. The biggest difference is that Narc’s do what they do for fun and power and control. Narc’s do not care about the pain they cause. In BPD we do care and look for every way to not inflict pain but generally do anyway. We only do it by tying not to do it because we generally can’t help ourselves. Self fulldilling prophecy type stuff and we feel really bad about ourselves abd everything we do or cause to the point of kicking ourselves and making ourselves feel worthless thus repeating the cycle. 

We have a major fear of abandonment and we stress about it and act out on it trying to not be abandoned until we quite literally make it happen.

5," One thing I can suggest is that you shouldn't let that diagnosis define who you are. Borderline is a tricky disorder with many different aspects and not all of them have to be part of what you are dealing with.

You said communication and relationships are difficult for you to maintain. 
It might be helpful for you to start learning to recognize and handle feelings. What they are, where they come from, how they affect you both mentally and physically and how you can react to them. 
Since borderline has a lot to do with the disability to regulate emotions this might be the way to go for you.
You should find lots and lots of material on this manner on the internet. If you can't find anything feel free to contact me. I'll have to search but I think I could find some helpful documents.

1,"A lot of disorders can be kickstarted by trauma, personality disorders included. While the most common cause of Borderline is trauma, especially extended childhood trauma, that is not the only cause (and isn't required for diagnosis). People who have had perfectly normal lives can still develop Borderline Personality Disorder. (Also, most personality disorders have a genetic aspect. Trauma is not genetic.)

You can have BPD without trauma. You can't have C-P**T**SD without trauma.",,z4hayu
2,"My training, geez that was a long time ago, characterized borderline personality disorder in a fairly narrow manner.  My favorite way of conceptualizing borderline personality disorder draws upon developmental and psychodynamic constructs.   The benefit of thinking along these lines is that this theory is not only descriptive--it's also explanatory and suggests a way to intervene.

According to a well accepted psychodynamic/developmental model, borderline personality disorder is actually a developmental delay.  It's not the catch-all condition people use to describe volatile, difficult, reckless, erratic, depressed persons. People can be ill-mannered, impulsive, argumentative, reactive, touchy, inconsiderate, flighty, moody, self-destructive and dramatic for many other reasons other than BPD.  Nor is BPD necessarily the product of traumatic exposure.  Yes, there seems to be a correlation but it's not straightforward.  I think of BPD as developmental disorder.  To best understand these ideas, you need to read Margaret Mahler, who built upon the work of Piaget.  Mahler doesn't actually talk about borderline personality disorder much but once you are well-versed in her descriptions of child development and concepts such as object constancy you'll easily apply these ideas to borderline personality disorder.

The theory is that borderline personality disorder results from the delayed/stalled development of object constancy. Object constancy is a developmental milestone without a fixed chronological point--typically we think it comes online during one's toddler years.   There are hypothesized parental contributions to failed object constancy--well, the whole theory is hypothesized, of course.  Due to the incomplete, inchoate development of object constancy, there are characteristic trends: impaired capacity to self-soothe and associated use of pretty bad methods to cope; sensitivity to abandonment; emotional lability/reactivity due to the inability to self soothe; failure to develop the capacity for ambivalence and a tendency to display splitting (seeing objects as all-good or all-bad); difficulties achieving a stable sense of identity and continuity of self; chronic sense of emptiness due to insufficiently developed, immature capacity for object constancy; difficulties with separation/individuation as a young adult.

I certainly do not view BPD as a variant or subtype of PTSD.  BPD is a developmental problem with pervasive effects upon overall functioning, as described above; PTSD is an anxiety disorder.  You asked for the distinction--well, as a humble guy in practice for many years, I would suggest to you that this is the distinction.  I'll obviously never know the friends you reference in your post but I would point out that the prevalence of BPD is estimated to be less than 2% in the general population.

Yes, the trauma-BPD connection is well established.  That said, I've seen plenty of folks with a history of quite severe early trauma who don't seem to show BPD features and, conversely, I've seen folks with BPD-ish features who seem to lack prior traumatic exposure.  Yes, there is overlap but to conflate BPD as a form of PTSD just doesn't capture it, for me.  The presentation and complaints are altogether different.  I tend to think that the trauma-BPD connection is not so straightforward and, perhaps, it's the pre-trauma ability to self-soothe that influences the relative contribution/impact of trauma, along with a whole host of other variables.  In any event, the two conditions--BPD and PTSD--are Venn diagrams in my mind with some overlap, but they are altogether different conditions with different theorized etiolgies, different presentations, different consequences for the individual and different natural courses.

I'm always surprised when discussions of borderline personality disorder fail to reference or include concepts such as object constancy.  Margaret Mahler was a rock star.",chicagobluesman,z4hayu

5,Many mental illnesses stem from trauma but this is not the case for everyone. There are also key differences in the two conditions.

6,"**Is there a distinction I'm missing somewhere?**

Sonic, yes, there is an important distinction. When a strong trauma occurs before age 5, it blocks the child's emotional development at age 3 or 4. The child therefore has no opportunity to develop a strong, stable, sense of self identity -- and no opportunity to learn the many emotional skills needed to control her own emotions.

This is why a person with BPD (pwBPD) cannot learn those missing emotional skills by swallowing a pill or talking about her childhood. Like a person learning to play a piano, the pwBPD must work hard for many years in a weekly training program (e.g., DBT) to acquire those missing skills. In contrast, a person suffering from PTSD has already learned those important skills during childhood. At least, this is my understanding, Sonic.",Up-Town,z4hayu

In this video, author Anna Runkle talks about her study of CPTSD and summarizes treatments shown to help. She says that as a CPTSD survivor, the thing she has found most helpful to her is dealing with the symptom known as dysregulation, which is getting very upset. I would definitely see her videos on dysregulation.

That said, it's also unfortunately common for a person living with a mental illness to wrack up diagnosis. They might seek a therapist, get a diagnosis, not find that clinician effective, then seek another clinician...


Clinicians have to use their best judgement when a client walks in. The problem comes in the client walking into several intakes over a lifetime or two, and hearing a sleep of diagnoses. The clinician is required to make a diagnosis by the powers that be, but if they aren't consistent (psych and diagnosis are NOT exact sciences due to the plentiful variabilities in people and the wildly interpretable testimonies from those clients) then clients tend to stack up diagnosis. This is not to mention clients self-diagnosing.

I can't tell you how many times a client has sat down and said, ""I have bipolar, ocd, I'm borderline, have Major Depression. I have multiple personalities, anxiety, schizophrenia, and everything else!""

The truth is they have 1-3 actual diagnosis, and ""3"" is pushing it. They just saw too many clients, or self-diagnosed too many times, and have an agenda.

It's really interesting actually how trauma can kickstart a lot of disorders. OCD is one that's pretty well known for having an ""inciting incident"" for example.

It's thought that in many people with genetic predispositions to personality disorders, they are a bit more sensitive than others to ""splitting"" along the lines of the particular ones they have.

Yes, Enby, a substantial share of people with PTSD experienced a trauma in early childhood that was strong enough to halt their emotional development. This is why a 2008 study found that 24% of pwPTSD also suffer from BPD. And it found that 39% of pwBPD also have co-occurring PTSD. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J of Clinc Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/). This is how it is viewed in the American DSM-5, which has no category called ""CPTSD."" The APA decided that no new category was warranted.

In Europe, however, the World Health Organ. decided to add the ""CPTSD"" category to their diagnostic manual (ICD-11). It is defined as overlapping BPD in some respects -- but as not causing all of the emotional regulation problems seen in BPD. This is why the ICD-11 still retains the BPD category (which it calls ""emotionally unstable personality disorder""). At least, this is my understanding, Enby.",Up-Town,z4hayu

1,"“… I can take the insults and the yelling…”

Okay, this is the first point where you’ve gone off the rails. This is verbal abuse from her, plain and simple. And no, you should never accept that sort of behavior simply because your partner has BPD. We all get upset from time to time, maybe say things poorly or inadvertently hurt the other person, but if you’re normalizing routine verbal abuse as acceptable because you can “take it”, the relationship itself has become abusive.

Second, she’s put you in an impossible situation where *you* are somehow responsible for *her* behavior. On the one hand, she admits that she pushes people away who get close. Okay, awareness is important. But then her response is to ask you to be responsible for making sure that she doesn’t do that to you..? This dynamic is incompatible with a healthy relationship. At the end of the day, she is responsible for acknowledging the urge to push you away, and then *not giving into that urge* by staying in the relationship if that’s what she values. She can ask for your support in coping with her emotions as long as she is proactively doing so herself, but she cannot expect you to assume responsibility for her behavior. What she’s effectively asking you to do is “whenever I reject you and undermine our relationship, I need you to do everything you can to regain my acceptance and hold the relationship together, regardless of the circumstances.” That is straight up emotional abuse and manipulation. She has all the power in a dynamic like that, and if for any reason you don’t bend over backward to appease her and salvage the relationship, it’s *your* fault for not doing enough. It’s a trap, my dude, and neither of you knows it.

My recommendation is this: Set very clear boundaries about how you expect to be treated, and be prepared to walk if she is incapable of respecting those boundaries. Unfortunately, from what you’ve described so far, she isn’t showing signs of being capable of that, which indicates that she needs to seek treatment before she’s ready for a healthy intimate relationship. The best thing you can do to support her as a person is to set clear boundaries, enforce them reliably, model that for her, and encourage her to get treatment. If you allow her to violate your boundaries, even if you love her, you are enabling her disorder and prolonging her symptoms, which is the opposite of what you want for her. She has to want to get better and take action to do so. And if she doesn’t do that, then you can’t help her. Sometimes if you love a person, you have to let them go. You will not be doing her any favors by staying with her regardless of how she treats you.

I’m sorry much love.",Huge_penguin09,ucu47u
2,"**She says that she loves me.**

Tony, an untreated pwBPD (person with borderline personality disorder) usually is capable of loving you very intensely -- but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means she will occasionally flip -- in only seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or hating you). And a few hours or days later, she can flip back again just as quickly. These rapid flips arise from a primitive defense called ""black-white thinking.""  
  
Like a young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to handle two strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate) at the same time. This means she has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. She thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of her conscious mind.  
  
With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Daddy while he's bringing out the toys but, in only a few seconds, will flip to hating Daddy when he takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Daddy. Rather, it means that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.  
  
Similarly, a pwBPD will categorize everyone close to her as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me""). And she will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action. This B-W thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""

**She broke up with me, citing that she’s very unhappy and thinks our relationship is the reason.**

Tony, in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, whatever you do will be hurtful to her much of the time. A comment or action that pleases her on one day may greatly offend her when repeated a week later. She often will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T do it.  
  
This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.  
  
Your predicament is that the solution to calming her *abandonment* fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her *engulfment* fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.  
  
Consequently, as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. Because she has a weak sense of self-identity, she easily becomes very enmeshed in your strong personality during sustained periods of closeness and intimacy. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear.  
  
In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.  
  
Indeed, Tony, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto you. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body.  
  
Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from you. This is why an untreated pwBPD usually BELIEVES the false accusations coming out of her mouth (at the moment she is saying them).  
  
Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you will often find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing. This, at least, has been my experience, Tony.",Up-Town,ucu47u

17,"Hi, I know this is two weeks late. I just had to respond as someone who's just getting out of a toxic relationship with a partner who I suspect may have undiagnosed BPD. 

A lot of people are raking you over the coals, and they're justified, but I know that's only going to push you deeper into May's grip. What you need to realize is that you're a victim of emotional abuse. May is abusing you. It took me way too long to recognize that, and I didn't get there on my own. 

Everything you're doing to defend or excuse May's behavior is a product of the abuse, of what she's twisted you into. You need professional help to work through this, to learn how to set boundaries and maintain them. You may have known how to do that at one point, but she's eroded your ability to do that. You may have a lot of other things to relearn as well. Or to unlearn - one way abuse trauma can manifest is for you to copy your abuser's behavior. Realizing you've picked up some of the same manipulative habits that were used on you can be devastating, but it's the first step to unlearning them.

As for May, the best thing you can do for her is to push her to get therapy. BPD is one of the more treatable personality disorders. But don't stand by waiting for her to get therapy. That's the mistake I made, telling myself that if I just toughed it out until my partner found a therapist, everything would be fine. And all the while I was enabling them as they procrastinated in their search.

For as much as you care about May, please put your own mental health first. Otherwise you will have nobody left but her, and you'll be completely miserable while telling yourself you're happy.",Skellengar,u8pske

19,"I have BPD and I came across this whole story on YouTube, both sides of the coin. Best advice I can give you is you can’t make someone with BPD change, we have to want to do it and she unfortunately knows crying and throwing a fit works with you. I used to be like that… when I was 15 and SEVERELY unmedicated and not in the intense therapy I needed. She will continue to ruin your relationships out of a possessive need to make sure you can’t abandon her like everyone else has. It’s a need of control over feeling like she can’t control anything because she’s splitting all the time. The minute you are gone she’s wondering if you really care and unfortunately she may also believe she is in love with you because of how intense her feelings are. I’m sorry but unless she wants to change all you can do is put up boundaries and when she breaks them follow through with the NC. Nothing else you can do. BPD is a evil disorder that’s hard to break habits, but it also makes us manipulative even if we hate that we do it, and to be honest we usually know we are doing it it’s just very hard to pull ourselves out of that mind space but we usually always know what we are doing and how manipulative it is. Either accept the NC with her, because she will break your boundaries, or prepare to not have anyone in your life but May for the rest of your living breathing life, she will drive anyone away in her possessive need to make sure you never leave and no one ever takes you from her.",FoxxyGaymerWitch,u8pske

OP, five to 10 percent of highly reactive BPD women commit suicide before they reach the age of 30.  You would be doing her a favor by holding boundaries and encouraging therapy.

0,"Yes, I have a tip for you, Human. My experience is that whatever you do will be hurtful to a person with BPD (""pwBPD"") much of the time. A comment or action that pleases him on one day may greatly offend him when repeated a week later. Moreover, he often will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T do it.  
  
This conundrum is due to the position of his two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.  
  
Your predicament is that the solution to calming his abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers his engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming his engulfment fear (moving back away to give him breathing space) is the very action that triggers his abandonment fear. Consequently, as you move close to comfort him and assure him of your love, you eventually will start triggering his engulfment fear, making him feel like he's being suffocated and controlled by you.  
  
Granted, he likely craves intimacy like other adults do but -- due to his weak self-identity and lack of personal boundaries, he cannot tolerate intimacy for very long. He thus will start feeling like he is becoming enmeshed in your strong personality. Yet, as you back away to give him breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering his abandonment fear.  
  
In my 15 years with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution -- between ""too close"" and ""too far away""-- where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate his own emotions and tame his two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away (by creating fights over nothing) and pull-you-back (by love bombing you).  
  
Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, an untreated pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. His subconscious does this to protect his fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside his body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, he consciously will be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU.  
  
Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you will often find yourself hurting him -- i.e., triggering his engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering his abandonment fear as you draw back, and sometimes triggering his fears even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing. At least, this has been my experience, Human.",Up-Town,15dpnp5
1,"I have a TON to say, but I will try to keep it short as not to exhaust either of us.

 You will be fighting 3 battles: 

&#x200B;

One, the battle of maintaining & nourishing your relationship with your sibling interpersonally as they are both going to be going through something difficult.

* Remember to take care of yourself. This is a big change, a big deal and a lot to deal with
   * if you have a culture in your family where conflict, anger & expressing your feelings or reaching out for help is frowned upon or could be improved, work on that ASAP. Maybe get a family therapist if need be.
   * Feedback between you, your sibling, your family & your sibling's health care providers will become very important to get a full picture for everyone.
* Don't forget to give your sibling agency, trust and dignity in this situation!
* Look into Schema therapy for yourself and for your sibling. Schema therapy is a therapy specifically designed to help people with PDs, I believe, and helps shine light on the disorder. I have free self-help resources if you'd like to contact me for them.
   * There are many different kinds of therapies! All therapists are taught to integrate a little bit of all kinds of therapy into treatment, but it's good to know your options as CBT or ""Talk therapy"" is not the only kind and can leave some feeling gaslit, invalidated and feeling worse.

&#x200B;

Two, will be beginning a relationship with the medical professionals that will likely be taking care of them and trying to help them heal and adjust. I can't emphasize how important having a *relationship* with these professionals are. Some advice:

* seek specialists, because **everyone** specializes in something specific. and because of that, most practitioners will have blindspots. OR they will be general practitioners. (meaning, they probably just know what the specialties categories *are* and will set you up with specialists if they think your situation ""qualifies"". they can sometimes be middlemen.)
* when getting in touch with any place you are seeking resources from, do not trust the first people that pick up to give you all of your options, direct you to the right place, or be able to tell you everything/anything. usually they are glorified customer service representatives & appointment setters. ask for the supervisor 
   * remember to *ask* ""I just want to know what all my options are,"" because usually, the ppl in charge have so much information that they fear overwhelming you & will spoon-feed you. This could potentially rob you of options
* remember your relationship with your sibling's healthcare providers are just as important with as your relationship with your sibling
   * additionally, if you dislike the people who run things: your sibling's therapist, the supervisor of said therapists... get the fuck out of there. go somewhere else. these are the people who will be your sibling's advocates, friends, caregivers, confidants & will be building your sibling's medical history. Get to know all of them, their names & your sibling's experiences with them wether  if they are there for the long-term, and even if they aren't. 

I'm talking nurses, in-takers, doctors, therapists, psychiatrists. They are ALL working as a team, and as your sibling's family, it's important that you also help your sibling  keep them accountable, especially if your sibling is ill. It is also difficult for one person to do alone, even if they were not ill.

&#x200B;

* prep you and your sibling ask for documentation, proof, recorders & copies of everything. you will probably not be able to ask for your sibling's records, but it's important that *someone* has them. you *will* run into doctors/medical professionals that will do more harm than good, so it's good that you can defend yourself against them worst case scenario
   * remember that your sibling can ask for their therapist's & doctor's notes, but usually, they are not helpful & can disrupt the patient-doctor relationship. But remember that is your legal right.
   * Also, you can tell a doctor to document when they've refused treatment of some kind to a patient, including medicine. I'm not sure if this is still true, but usually most doctors will cave because this documentation holds the doctor liable if anything happens to the patient. I think this is in cases where the treatment could have helped them, but don't quote me on that.
* If your sibling is young, AVOID THE TROUBLED-TEEN INDUSTRY. I do not know much about these places, but there have been many camps/get-aways/schools that are privately owned where horrible things have happened. This goes for anyone of any age, but particularly children. I take that losing contact or becoming entirely isolated with your sibling as a yellow flag
   * Do not let your health providers ever become the *sole* communicator on behalf of your child in the case that your sibling is unable to advocate for themselves, communicate to you or their judgement is impaired. You will want to be present for what you can be present for and be highly vigilant.

&#x200B;

* Finally, your best resource to learn more about how to navigate the medical system & your sibling's care will be a health provider that knows a lot, wants to help you, and who you trust. The second best is from the disabled community, who needs to know these sort of things to survive--especially if they are marginalized/a minority in some other way. That's where I've learned a majority of these tips from.

&#x200B;

Your third battle with be finances & insurance, at least from the U.S where I am from:

* I barely know shit about insurance, but it's important for you to be familiar with the terminology, how it works and so on. wish i could help more in this front.
* I do know that most hospitals in the US are non-profits, so if you look up their (often hidden) pages ""\[name of hospital\] financial assistance"", under ""financial assistance & policy"" there will often be a program that waives or completely takes care of medical bills based on your income
   * you may want to make this search with the TOR browser, because Google is now pretty unreliable and pulling up a lot of misinformation now-a-days. its more focused on pushing you products to buy
   * also, ask for an itemized list of expenses. sometimes hospitals will over-charge for shit, and asking for an itemized list will cause them to deduct unnecessary prices

I hope this all helps! I wish you and your family the best, and again, if you'd like any resources to the aforementioned self-help books abt BPD & schemas, a place to start looking for resources near you, or if you have any questions: please reach out & I will help as best as I am able.

 And more importantly, please avoid the stigma about your sister's disorder. You two are close and love each other very much. That is what matters most.",void_trees,15dpnp5
0,"Hi - clinical psychologist. I won't diagnose ya - but I'll give you some things to think about!

1) When we think of Personality Disorders (PDs), they are ultimately a collection of personality traits/behaviors. In my training, it was common for people to look at these lists of traits/symptoms and say ""I've done that at some point."" However, what makes the difference is that these traits are enduring, consistent across multiple contexts, and very disruptive. So even though you mention that these things are ""relatable,"" it's important to consider the frequency, duration, and disturbance. 

2) You mention an ADHD diagnosis. [Oftentimes ADHD can feel or look like BPD.] (https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/bpd-symptoms-vs-adhd-differential-diagnosis/) In addition, some of those BPD symptoms could be better explained by your other diagnoses, such as the panic-y thoughts (which aren't necessarily a BPD symptoms) are better explained by your anxiety. Lastly, we don't diagnose personality disorder for people under 18. That's because it's normal for your personality to be shifting a bit at your age.

I think it's a good idea to talk to your therapist about this, they know you best.  It could be helpful to explore how potentially ADHD symptoms may lead to some of those traits.

One more point, the over stimulus associated with adhd and ptsd can actually be treated with medication while there is really no medication for a personality disorder.

Tldr diagnoses are mostly for insurance and there is lots of overlap. Eliminating symptoms of ptsd and adhd will also eliminate what you are experiencing with borderline personality disorder, or at least make it way easier to cope with.",Dysthymiccrusader91,14h4tvt
8,"She does admit that I have the symptoms, but that was her only reason for saying I don’t have it.",coolzzzzzz,14h4tvt
9,"She’s referring to how personality disorders typically present. They are usually “egosyntonic”, which is just a fancy way of saying that the disordered behavior is perceived by the individual as being part of who they are rather than a problem to be solved. As a result, people with egosyntonic disorders often attribute the symptoms they experience as being caused by other people or conditions outside of themselves.

That said, not all people with personality disorders experience them in the same way. So I wouldn’t rule out a BPD diagnosis *solely* on this information.

Here’s the bottom line — your specific diagnosis really only matters for two things: Indicated treatment, and billing for insurance. So the question becomes whether insurance will cover your treatment based on whatever diagnosis code you’re given, and then whether the indicated treatment will actually work.

Regardless of the diagnosis, if you’re experiencing significant mood dysregulation, impulsivity, and suicidality, then Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is  probably your best bet for treatment. It was originally designed to treat BPD, but it turns out that it works really well for other diagnoses that also involve mood dysregulation and suicidality (e.g., eating disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder).

So rather than getting hung up on the label, ask your psychiatrist what their recommended treatment is. That’s ultimately what matters most. Any treatment assigned should be targeting specific presenting problems, which are symptoms and impairment — not a label.

My foster son has episodes that last longer than that because, after just 5 days or a week of mania, he slips into a psychotic state that is so bad I would always have to have him hospitalized for at least 2 months.

i’m not sure if self diagnosing is doing any good, because it seems like they’re usually very wrong lmao- i think looking into it privately is a good thing, but announcing in front of millions of people that you have a disorder you don’t have is gonna hurt the people who actually have it. let those people educate the public. we don’t get sent to psych hospitals for feeling a little down anymore, but the overall perception of mental illness hasn’t really changed. i do think most of it is caused by people who have no idea what they’re talking about.

>It’s frustrating because people who have diagnoses like depression, anxiety, or ADHD feel like these diagnoses are “serious enough”

When you have these problems they definitely seem serious enough, but if you actually have something else, these may not seem serious enough. My issues started at age 4. By age 8 I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and medicated. At age 22 I got diagnosed with BPD. At age 32 I finally got diagnosed with autism and ADHD. I've spent my life in psychiatrist offices, so it's not like they didn't have an opportunity to catch it.

Depression and anxiety never fully fit. It was a constant, there was no ebb and flow like Depression and anxiety generally have. Also can a 4 year old even be depressed? BPD kind of fit for one of the atypical profiles, but it still didn't seem right. BPD almost always start in the teenage years, and I didn't have issues with anger. When going through DBT for it, nobody could answer my questions and it wasn't helping like it should.

In my experience, psychiatrists aren't very thorough with their diagnosing either. I've been slapped with a new disorder in less than 15 minutes, and without asking probing questions. There are plenty of people who can self diagnose a least that accurately.

Mammoth, yes, the vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning"" -- i.e., they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, classmates, casual friends, and total strangers. None of those people are able to trigger his fears of abandonment and engulfment.  
  
There is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment. Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually appear only when someone draws very close to the pwBPD.  
  
This is why it is common for a high-functioning pwBPD to do well in socially difficult jobs such as being a social worker, nurse, professor, salesclerk, or doctor. And this is why most pwBPD can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers -- but often will go home at night to yell at the very people who love them. Only the loved ones are able to trigger his fears.

**Are there any happy, stable, successful people with BPD traits?**

Mammoth, BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either ""has"" or ""doesn't have."" Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means everyone on the planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).

2,"Kai, your BF's abusive behaviors and anger issues cannot be excused -- but perhaps can be explained, especially if you would speak to a psychologist in your city. They may be due to his having very weak control over his own emotions (i.e., a lack of emotional skills he had no opportunity to learn in childhood). My exW has that problem. If that is an issue for your BF, you likely have been seeing the following 4 red flags.

***The first*** is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, he started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- or started attempting to isolate you away from close friends and family? He would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing THEM over HIM. Moreover, he usually would hate to be alone by himself.

***Second***, you would be seeing him rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein he tends to categorize some people as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize them -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction.

Because he also uses B-W thinking when judging HIMSELF, he hates to acknowledge making a mistake. To him, it would mean he is ""all bad."" He thus would blame nearly all mistakes on you and view himself as ""The Victim."" Always ""The Victim.""

Further, to ""validate"" his victim status, he would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend himself in the most insignificant disagreement with you. Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in his frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER....""

***Third***, you generally would not see him expressing his rages to casual friends, coworkers, or total strangers. He usually gets along fine with them. Rather, the outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (e.g., against you or his parents).

***Fourth***, you are convinced he truly loves you. But you often have seen him flipping, on a dime, between Jekyll (loving you) and Hyde (devaluing or hating you) -- often making you feel like you're walking on eggshells. These flips would occur in a few seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. And a few hours or days later, he could flip back just as quickly.

Kai, have you been seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of these red flags?",Up-Town,zc5ep5

I caution that BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either ""has"" or ""doesn't have."" Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means everyone occasionally exhibits all BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy). These traits are primitive defenses that, when used appropriately and with restraint, increase our chances of survival.

At issue, then, is not whether your BF exhibits BPD traits. Of course he does. We all do. Rather, at issue is whether he exhibits those traits at a strong and persistent level (i.e., is on the upper end of the BPD spectrum).

Importantly, I'm not suggesting your BF has full-blown BPD. Only a professional can determine that. Instead, I'm suggesting you consider whether he may be a person with moderate-to-strong BPD symptoms (i.e., may be a ""pwBPD"").

**He often has mood swings that come suddenly or are triggered.**

Kai, if your BF is a pwBPD, he carries much anger inside from early childhood. You therefore don't have to do a thing to CREATE the anger. Rather, you only have to do or say some minor thing that triggers a release of anger that is already there. This is why a pwBPD can burst into a tantrum in only a few seconds.

Moreover, the key defining characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate one's own emotions, resulting in unstable behavior. This is why, outside the USA, most countries call this disorder ""emotionally unstable personality disorder"" (EUPD).

And this is why ""Intense, inappropriate anger"" is one of the 9 defining traits for BPD. Indeed, the terms ""anger,"" ""dangerous behavior,"" and ""unstable"" appear in 4 of the [9 BPD Symptoms](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/). The ""dangerous behavior"" refers to impulsive actions like risky driving, rash decisions, spending sprees, drug abuse, or binge eating.

**He sends an overwhelming amount of texts expressing his love for me.**

If your BF is an untreated pwBPD, Kai, he is capable of loving you very intensely -- but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means he will occasionally flip -- in only seconds -- from Jekyll (loving you) to Hyde (devaluing you). And a few hours or days later, he can flip back again just as quickly. These rapid flips arise from a primitive behavior called ""black-white thinking.""

Like a young child, a pwBPD frequently experiences feelings so intense that he is unable to handle two strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate) at the same time. This means he has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. He thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of his conscious mind.

With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Mommy while she's bringing out the toys but, in only seconds, will flip to hating Mommy when she takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Mommy. Rather, it means that his conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.

Similarly, a pwBPD will categorize everyone close to him as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me""). And he will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just a few seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action. This B-W thinking also will be evident in his frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""

**I just want to know If my thinking is correct.**

Again, I suggest you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two by yourself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you're dealing with. Whenever strong BPD warning signs are appearing, it is important to see your own psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated or seen your BF.

In that way, you're ensured that the psychologist is ethically bound to protect YOUR best interests, not his. I mention this because therapists generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwBPD the name of his disorder. They often decide that it is not in his best interests to be told.

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to diagnose your BF's issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for breast cancer or a heart attack, learning those for BPD may help you avoid a very painful situation -- and can help you decide when professional guidance is needed. I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/904mky/i_24m_am_currently_married_to_my_emotional_abuser/e2nploz/) to see if most sound very familiar. If so and you have questions, Kai, I would be glad to discuss them with you.",Up-Town,zc5ep5

6,"**I’ll see about talking to a psychologist about it.**

Smart decision, Kai.

**He can't help it after all.**

Actually he can, Kai -- if he exhibits strong and persistent BPD traits. Granted, a pwBPD has very weak control over his own emotions -- i.e., he lacks important emotional skills that most people acquire in childhood. Although he is not responsible for having acquired BPD in early childhood, he is now an adult who is responsible for learning those missing emotional skills so he can treat loved ones appropriately.

It therefore is important that an untreated pwBPD be allowed to suffer the logical consequences of his own bad behavior and bad choices. Otherwise, you are destroying the incentives he has to confront his own issues and seek therapy.",Up-Town,zc5ep5

8,"Kai, that's a good question to ask the psychologist you speak to. My personal experience is that, if a pwBPD is unwilling to seek therapy to work on his issues, it is not helpful to mention you are suspecting he has BPD. In that case, the likely result of telling him is that he will project the accusation right back onto you. Because that projection occurs entirely in his subconscious, he likely will believe that YOU are the pwBPD.",Up-Town,zc5ep5

1,"Sorbet, your GF's abusive behaviors cannot be excused -- but perhaps can be explained, especially if you would speak to a psychologist in your city. Those behaviors may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of emotional skills she had no chance to learn in childhood). My exW has that problem. If it is an issue for your GF, you likely would be seeing 4 other red flags.  
  
*The first* is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events involving other women -- or tried to isolate you away from your close friends and family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing them over her. Moreover, she usually would hate being alone by herself.  
  
*Second*, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she tends to categorize some people as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize them -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction.  
  
Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw. Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim.""  
  
Further, to ""validate"" her victim status, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you. Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER....""  
  
*Third*, you generally would not see her directing her anger at casual friends, coworkers, or total strangers. She usually gets along fine with them. Rather, her outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be directed against a close loved one (e.g., against you, a sibling, or her parents).  
  
*Fourth*, you are convinced that she truly loves you. But you frequently see her flipping, on a dime, between Jekyll (loving you) and Hyde (devaluing or hating you) -- often making you feel like you're walking on eggshells around her. Such flips would occur in a few seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. A few hours or days later, she can flip back just as quickly. 

Sorbet, have you been seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of these red flags?",Up-Town,17awz8n
2,"Wow. Yeah you described it perfectly. Seems like if I make one mistake i’ve never did anything right. I definitely have been talking to family a lot less often since meeting her. What should I do? She IS a really sweet girl, and I strongly think could make a good wife, but these outbursts are tough to deal with.",Sorbet_pOKE,17awz8n
3,"**I’m deeply in love with her.** 

Sorbet, if your GF is a pwBPD (person with BPD), she likely loves you too. A pwBPD usually is capable of loving you very intensely -- but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means she will occasionally flip -- in only seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or hating you). And a few hours or days later, she can flip back again just as quickly. These rapid flips arise from a primitive defense called ""black-white thinking.""  
  
Like a young child, a pwBPD never had an opportunity to learn the emotional skills needed to handle two strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate) at the same time. This means she has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. She thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of her conscious mind.  
  
With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Daddy while he's bringing out the toys but, in only a few seconds, will flip to hating Daddy when he takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Daddy. Rather, it means that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.

And she will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action. This B-W thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""

**I’m willing to jump hurdles to help her with this mental disorder... What can I do to help her?**

Sorbet, you cannot help her with her disorder. That is something she must do for herself, under the guidance of a professional. BPD is believed to be caused by an inherited gene and/or by a childhood trauma (e.g., abuse or abandonment) occurring before age 5. 

Because the trauma occurs so early, it blocks the child's emotional development at age 3 or 4. The child therefore has no opportunity to develop a strong stable sense of self identity -- and no opportunity to learn the many emotional skills needed to control her own emotions.

This is why a pwBPD cannot learn those missing emotional skills by swallowing a pill or talking about her childhood. Like a person learning to play a piano, she must work hard for many years in a weekly training program (e.g., DBT) to acquire those missing skills.

**I’m not very good at being an emotional support.**

If you are in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, Sorbet, whatever you do will be hurtful to her much of the time. A comment or action that pleases her on one day may greatly offend her when repeated a week later. Moreover, she often will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T do it. In this way, you often are damned if you do and damned if you don't.  
  
This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.  
  
Your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.  
  
Consequently, as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. A pwBPD usually craves intimacy like nearly all other adults -- but she cannot tolerate it for very long.  
  
Because she has a weak sense of self-identity, she easily becomes very enmeshed in your strong personality during sustained periods of closeness and intimacy. This is why her sense of personal boundaries is so weak that she has difficulty seeing where HER feelings and problems stop and YOURS begin. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you often will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear.  
  
In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.  
  
Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto you. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body.  
  
Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from you. This is why an untreated pwBPD usually BELIEVES the false accusations coming out of her mouth (at the moment she is saying them).  
  
Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you often will find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing.

**What should I do?**

I suggest that you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by yourself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you're dealing with. Whenever strong BPD warning signs are appearing, it is important to see your own psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated or seen your GF.

Like a young child, a pwBPD never had an opportunity to learn the emotional skills needed to handle two strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate) at the same time. This means she has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. She thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of her conscious mind.  
  
With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Daddy while he's bringing out the toys but, in only a few seconds, will flip to hating Daddy when he takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Daddy. Rather, it means that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.  
  
Similarly, a pwBPD will categorize everyone close to her as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me""). And she will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action.  
  
This B-W thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS...."" Because her close friends eventually will be ""split black"" and pushed away, it is unusual for a pwBPD to have any really close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends. At least, this has been my experience, Soggy.",Up-Town,13409xj

1,There's some advice in this article on helping someone with BPD: https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/borderline-personality-disorder-bpd/for-friends-and-family/,Sbeast,y5bqp0
2,"**How have any of you dealt with this?**

Purple, if your mom has been diagnosed as a person with BPD (pwBPD), the conventional advice is to establish strong personal boundaries and to avoid actions and comments that you know to be her triggers. My experience, however, is that it is impossible to avoid the triggers. The result is that whatever you do will be hurtful to her much of the time.

For example, a comment or action that pleases your mom on one day may greatly offend her if repeated a week later. Moreover, she often will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T do it.

This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Your predicament is that the solution to calming her *abandonment* fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her *engulfment* fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.

Consequently, as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. A pwBPD usually craves intimacy like nearly all other adults -- but she cannot tolerate it for very long.

Because she has a weak sense of self-identity, she easily becomes very enmeshed in your strong personality during sustained periods of closeness and intimacy. This is why her sense of personal boundaries is so weak that she has difficulty seeing where HER feelings and problems stop and YOURS begin. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you often will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear.

In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.

Indeed, Purple, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto you. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body.

Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from you. This is why an untreated pwBPD usually BELIEVES the false accusations coming out of her mouth (at the moment she is saying them).

Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you often will find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing. This, at least, has been my experience, Purple.",Up-Town,y5bqp0

1,"Hi there. You're my second person I am replying to in regards to this today after my whole rant on BPD lol. 

So short info on me. I'm 27f, sought therapy for 8 years starting in college. I had MDD, PTSD, alcohol abuse which I'm now in full remission for 5 months. BUT.. I was diagnosed with BPD by two male practictioners and now I'm fighting to remove this diagnosis. 

I don't know why your post was removed in another community but hopefully you see my response lol. 

One thing to note. BPD symptoms are very similar to MDD, PTSD, CPTSD, and Bipolar. Also alcohol abuse effects can mimic it as well. I've done too much research on all of these disorders and read too much research articles. If you do the same as me, you will notice it's hard to diagnose BPD especially if you have any one of those other disorders. It's a commonly misdiagnosed and overdiagnosed disorder. 

I can't say as much compared to the last person I replied to since you're not giving much information on your mental health history or symptoms.. so I'm going to wing it. 

There is no medication specifically used to treat BPD. Only medications to treat symptoms such as irritability, feeling sad, etc. 

You're young. A little scare for you before you decide to bring this up. I've been rejected by jobs for having BPD on my record. Clear rejection even though I clearly don't have the disorder. It's also very difficult to remove from your record. 

Now that that's out of the way.. are you certain it's not other disorders first of all? Properly trained mental health providers would err on the side of caution before diagnosing BPD especially with other disorders you may have. It's notoriously difficult to diagnose properly and even if you follow the diagnostic criteria, that isn't enough. Take for example, someone who is LGBT. It's common for them to feel identity issues with stigma and whatnot. Does that mean all LGBT are borderline? No. They have to take into account various factors in your environment, your race, your gender, sexuality, religion, etc. to truly be certain. Bad professionals will just follow criteria without a thought and say this is what you have. 

I understand you want to feel validated. Talk with your provider about your concerns if so. Don't let your friends put you down. Yes it is a highly stigmatized disorder (hence my warning earlier) however, if you truly feel this is you, then go for it. Bring it up with them and see what they think. It's important to feel listened to by your provider.",sehwakim45,107ule0
2,"c-ptsd could be a possibility, emphasis on could as I still believe the criteria for bpd is much closer in my case. I definitely don't have bipolar, thats a conversation that I've had with both my psychiatrist and my therapist so I'm confident that's not the case here. I've never heard of MDD so I will definitely look further into it however I meet the criteria for BPD in every sense of the word which is why I feel so strongly about getting a diagnosis. I appreciate your warning and that is definitely a concern I will be sure to bring up to my therapist. My biggest question was how I should  go about getting such a diagnosis.",rancidseahag,107ule0
3,"What you could do is just simply ask your therapist: I've been researching BPD and feel it may describe what I've been experiencing. Then give them the symptoms based on the criteria described for diagnosing BPD. Ask them what they think. They may agree or disagree but it's a start. Depending on how long you have seen this therapist, they may or may not have enough information to go on to truly determine if you have or do not have BPD. Although you say BPD seems to fit you more BUT there is a possibility for CPTSD to fit you as well... you have to also note: what's written as the criteria for BPD as well as the criteria for other disorders isn't always cut in stone. Take for example, someone with depression. Just flat out depression nothing else. Although it may not describe self harm as a specific symptom in its criteria as BPD does... it doesn't mean non-BPD people with depression do not self harm at all. There is just a higher prevalence of people who self harm with BPD hence why self harm is a part of the criteria for BPD. This doesn't mean that every person who self harms is borderline and every person who doesn't self harm is not suffering from depression. 

MDD is major depressive disorder. It's a more chronic form of depression. 

Please note, not every therapist or psychiatrist is trained in specific disorders. Especially when it comes to something as complex as BPD. They may have learned about it but they are not necessarily experts in the disorder. This is why some are wary when it comes to diagnosing these disorders and some simply follow the criteria without taking into account other factors leading to them giving a diagnosis of BPD to someone who isn't borderline. The best thing to do is ask your therapist if they are trained in BPD. If not, ask if you can discuss it with someone who is trained since you feel it might be you. 

Also, take a look at other posts by people who have BPD and agree with their diagnosis. You will see a pattern among them. Note that this is a personality disorder. It's not curable. It's pretty much a part of your personality which usually has to do with how you grew up and what part of your environment played a role in forming who you are today. Medications can help lessen the severity of symptoms. But you would need to do DBT to get the full results of treatment. This doesn't mean it disappears from your life however.",sehwakim45,107ule0

It usually stems from a form of abandonment in childhood. This can mean your parents emotionally neglected you, left you places alone, threatened to leave you, didn't parent you (didn't care what you did or where you went, didn't keep you out of danger),  you didn't feel that they loved you, etc.

I experienced each of these things, alongside my mom being an alcoholic, domestic violence, abuse, neglect, and my mom also has bipolar and BPD. All of these things contributed to my development of BPD.

See a/your therapist and/or psychiatrist and make sure to explain the things you put in this post, thoroughly. Don't be afraid to talk about your deepest feelings, they will help the doctor understand the core of the problem, and pinpoint your diagnosis correctly. Trust me, being honest is important.

Also, if you ever get a psychiatrist/therapist who wont let you fully explain, and keeps interrupting, or doesnt care to hear about the full picture or what you have to say, look for other doctors.

1,"Kamarovsky, there is no medication that has been proven effective in the long-term treatment of BPD (borderline personality disorder). BPD is believed to be caused by an inherited gene and/or by a childhood trauma (e.g., abuse or abandonment) occurring before age 5.

Because the trauma occurs so early, it blocks the child's emotional development at age 3 or 4. The child therefore has no opportunity to develop a strong stable sense of self identity -- and has no opportunity to learn the many emotional skills needed to be able to control his own emotions.

This is why a pwBPD (person with BPD) cannot learn those missing emotional skills by swallowing a pill or talking about his childhood. Like a person learning to play a piano, a pwBPD must work hard for many years in a weekly training program (e.g., DBT) to acquire those missing skills.

Although medication won't make a lasting dent in the BPD itself (or your piano playing skills), nearly all pwBPD are prescribed meds. The reason is that the vast majority of pwBPD also suffer from 2 or 3 co-occurring clinical disorders -- e.g., bipolar, depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, or ADHD. For example, 74% of pwBPD have a co-occurring anxiety disorder and 75% have a mood disorder such as depression. The medications are targeted to treating those co-occurring disorders. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

As to the prescription for Valproate, it is not a treatment for BPD. My guess is that your psychiatrist prescribed it because he wants to treat the depression that he diagnosed you with. Significantly, when prescribing an antidepressant to a patient he has seen only one time, there is considerable risk that what appears to be simple major depression is actually bipolar-2.

This means that, if your psychiatrist is mistaken in calling it ""major depression,"" a prescription for a simple anti-depressant may result in pushing you toward the mania end of the mania/depression spectrum.  That is, the antidepressant may cause your depression to be replaced by a full-blown manic episode (which may then slip into psychosis).

To prevent that occurring in new patients that have not been observed for very long, some doctors prescribe a mood stabilizer (e.g., Valproate) together with the antidepressant for a short while to protect the patients who might also suffer from bipolar disorder.

Although you were not diagnosed as having bipolar disorder (BD), your psychiatrist knows that you are at considerable risk of also having bipolar because you have BPD. About 40% of BPD sufferers also have co-occurring bipolar disorder. See Table 3 at link provided above.",Up-Town,uyshnz
2,"That's a really comprehensive and extensive comment, I really thank you for that! Though I really doubt my depression would be the depressive episode of bipolar disorder, as I have never had an episode of mania, and it's just constantly been depression for at least 5 years now.",Kamarovsky,uyshnz
3,"Granted, you've never exhibited any apparent mania. Yet, if your depression is due to bipolar-2 disorder, you would not be showing any strong mania at all. Rather, over the past 5 years you would have experienced depression alternating with occasional periods of mania that is so mild that it simply feels like a good day.  Such mild mania is called ""hypomania."" The mania thus typically is so mild that it is unrecognizable by the patient because it just feels like an elevated mood. Most people can get an elevated mood by simply taking 100 mg of caffein. Hence, the popularity of coffee.

The psychiatrist thus knows that a new patient who is a pwBPD has a considerable risk of also having bipolar-2 even when the patient himself has seen no mania at all.  This is why psychiatrists sometimes will prescribe a mood stabilizer together with the antidepressant for a short period as a precaution.",Up-Town,uyshnz
4,"I don't mean to sound like I undermine what you're saying, as you clearly have a lot of expertise in the subject and I really appreciate your help here, but I don't really think it's that either, as I very very seldom experience any days I would categorize as ""good"". And if I do feel happy, it's just situational, when I'm drinking with friends for example, while underneath and around that still feeling unwell.

But I do understand now that Valproate can also be a more general mood stabilizer, as the pamphlet inside the med packet didnt quite specify that, and focused on the anti-epileptic ant anti-BP aspect of it. So I suppose I shouldnt be worried that I was accidentally prescribed the wrong thing, or that it will have unforeseen negative interactions. So thank you once again!",Kamarovsky,uyshnz
5,"**I don't really think it's that either, as I very very seldom experience any days I would categorize as ""good.""**

You very likely are correct, Kamarovsky. You know what you've been experiencing. I was simply speculating based on my experience with a BPD sufferer (my exW) and a bipolar-1 sufferer (my foster son). I suggest that, if you experience unpleasant side effects from the Valproate, you call your psychiatrist's office and discuss it with him to find out why he prescribed it. 

I also suggest that you start seeing a psychologist to get a second opinion on the BPD diagnosis. Of course, the cutting you've been doing is known to be strongly associated with BPD. Indeed, of the 157 mental disorders listed in the American DSM-5, the only disorder having *""self-harm like cutting or self-hitting""* listed as a diagnostic symptom is BPD. 

If he/she agrees with your psychiatrist, you almost certainly will be referred to a training program (e.g., DBT) that will teach you the emotional skills you had no opportunity to learn in childhood. I wish you the very best in your recovery endeavors!",Up-Town,uyshnz

1,"I am so glad to stumble upon your post.

I am also having some realizations with my own self that have me, honestly, questioning so many things....but in a good way! Self reflection has been hard for me and I recently, for the sake of my children and their upbrings...(sadly, not for myself...which, I am sure is toxic in ways)- I need to really change the paradigms in my life.

I am so knowledged in all other personality disorders...so much so that I want to go to school for psychology. Always has been so intriguing to me...what's crazy though, i never really wanted to or had the urge to really dive into BPD. Til now. I am starting to feel like I instinctually knew it would hit too close to home and couldn't face that reality. 

Honestly though, as I am changing thought patterns and learning more about it...I am starting to not so negatively towards that being something I will be diagnosed with....I, in a weird way am HOPING that this is the issue with alot of my life struggles. At least then I will have some answers and direction...and different tools to help me. Because before, I was lost in the wind...I also am learning that this stigma that i had on ppl with BPD is not actually as it is. These are GOOD people, with internal traumas that CAN be helped if acknowledged. I never have ill intentions...but chaos and pain seem to always find there way to the front line. Relationships, goals, health, intentions...damn near any and every aspect is sprinkled with things that BPD people deal with. I love the people in my circle...my  kids, husband, family and few circle of friends SOOOO intensely and because of that I need to reevaluate and make some adjustments so that they too can see and FEEL like I do as well. 

I'm glad you are searching for answers. That is the big. And although I don't know you personally...I am proud. Accountability is tough...trust me, I KNOW...but feels soooo soo good! You are going to one day feel relief from this with the mindset you seem to have..and feel blessed to have the insight to search..because there are soo many ppl with this disorder and every other disorder that live their whole lives stuck in the web of the mental pain...and if more people were to have the resources and knowledge to do so, the world would be a much different place. 

Good luck to you.",Top-Promotion-5134,zg8v83

2,"**I don't know how to help or approach issues without it becoming an argument.**

My experience, Uncle, is that it is impossible to avoid triggering arguments until a person with BPD (pwBPD) has successfully completed many years of intensive training. Whatever you do will be hurtful to her much of the time. 

For example, a comment or action that pleases her on one day may greatly offend her when repeated a week later. Moreover, a pwBPD often will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T do it.  
  
This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.  
  
Your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.  
  
As you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. A pwBPD usually craves intimacy like nearly all other adults -- but she cannot tolerate it for very long.  
  
Because she has a weak sense of self-identity, she easily becomes very enmeshed in your strong personality during sustained periods of closeness and intimacy. This is why her sense of personal boundaries is so weak that she has difficulty seeing where HER feelings and problems stop and YOURS begin. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you often will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear.  
  
In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.  
  
Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto you. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body.  
  
Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from you. This is why an untreated pwBPD usually BELIEVES the false accusations coming out of her mouth (at the moment she is saying them).  
  
Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you often will find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing. This, at least, has been my experience, Uncle.",Up-Town,ww82t9
3,Thank you,BigSweatyUncle,ww82t9
4,That's actually really helpful thank you!,BigSweatyUncle,ww82t9
5,"Another thing I've found useful, Uncle, is to realize that -- during arguments -- her inability to discuss the issue reasonably is not due to a lack of communication skills. Rather, it is due to her very distorted perception of your true intentions. Because she is unable to control her own emotions, she frequently experiences feelings so intense that they severely distort her perceptions of you.

To a lesser extent, Uncle, we all experience those same distorted perceptions of our loved ones. The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations.

Whenever we are very angry or scared, our corpus collosum shuts down, blocking communication with our frontal cortex. This forces us to fully rely on our amygdala, which performs a primary role in the processing of emotional responses, memory, and decision making.

Simply stated, we have instantly switched from relying on the logical ""adult"" part of our minds to relying on the emotional ""child"" part of our minds. In this way, our brains are hardwired to instantly switch to black-white thinking whenever we are suddenly startled or experience intense feelings. This instant switch to B-W thinking is also called ""splitting"" and ""the amygdala hijack.”

The beauty of B-W thinking is that it is incredibly fast and thus likely has saved your life many times. For example, when you are in a crosswalk and suddenly look up to see a truck bearing down on you, your mind is capable of thinking only ""jump left"" or ""jump right."" B-W thinking nonetheless produces disastrous results when used to understand the intentions and motivations of other people, particularly when you're in a close relationship.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and keep our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. And this is why, when we are very infatuated or in love, we try to wait at least two years before buying the ring. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently and intensely because she lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate her own emotions.

Moreover, getting her to understand your true intentions today does not mean she will understand them tomorrow. An untreated pwBPD is so emotionally immature that -- like a young child -- she cannot perceive ""object constancy"" -- i.e., she cannot see that your love for her is essentially unchanged from day to day.

This is why it is impossible for you -- through sacrifices and gifts -- to build up a store of appreciation and good will on which you can later draw during the hard times. Like a young child, her perception of you is fully dictated by whatever intense feeling she is experiencing AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

Hence, trying to build up a lasting store of appreciation is as futile as trying to build a lasting sandcastle on the shore beside the sea. It will be washed aside by the next tide of intense feelings flooding her mind.

Likewise, it is futile to keep trying to convince her that you truly love her. Although she may believe you for short periods, she will start doubting your love as soon as her feelings change. The result is that a pwBPD typically will administer shit tests every few days to test whether you seem to love her TODAY.

For more useful information, Uncle, I suggest you take a look at the r/BPDlovedones sub, where you will find hundreds of members sharing their experiences of living with -- or walking away from -- their BPD partners. In the right-hand column of that sub, you also will find a list of good books and links pointing to online resources. Moreover, Reddit's biggest BPD resource targeted to the abused partners is the r/BPDWiki.",Up-Town,ww82t9

1,"Borderline personality disorder is a pathology rooted in early childhood trauma, combined with a genetic predisposition. 

Of course she's worthy of love and understanding, no one chooses to have a personality disorder, it sadly just happens to some people through no fault of their own. 

Toxic behaviour is a symptom of the disorder, those with BPD who haven't received the proper therapy and treatment are basically going through life in a constant state of heightened emotion, unstable identity, and also more often than not, untreated CPTSD. 

Such a mindset can be torturous, and at times will lead to toxic responses/actions. 

But the key is to view your self as ""Unwell"" instead of ""bad"" because you aren't very well at your core, due to circumstances out of your control that have made you that way. 

With the right therapy you will lessen your toxic responses and you'll see that you were never the bad person your disorder has made you believe.",,12bx1yw

People with BPD do often have to set boundaries in their relationships. Be sure to tell partners that you have BPD, and probably set out plans of action for what you and the people around you should do when you are being toxic, and apologise afterwards if you have done wrong, and try to find ways to prevent it from happening again if you can. Also going to therapy will likely do good for you too, and make sure the people around you look after themselves too, not just you, if they need it, they may want to go into therapy too!

This is something that a lot of people have to do in their relationships, not just people with BPD. It’s just quite natural for people to do things that are toxic sometimes. What separates the good from the bad is whether you are actively trying to work on that toxic behaviour or not, having bpd by no means make you unable to do that, it just means you probably have to work harder on it then others",mess-of-a-human,12bx1yw

1,"Bucky, I suggest you speak with your psychiatrist about getting a referral to a BPD training program. BPD is believed to be caused by an inherited gene and/or by a childhood trauma (e.g., abuse or abandonment) occurring before age 5. Because the trauma occurs so early, it blocks the child's emotional development at age 3 or 4. The child therefore has no opportunity to develop a strong stable sense of self identity -- and no opportunity to learn the many emotional skills needed to control her own emotions.

This is why a pwBPD cannot learn those missing emotional skills by swallowing a pill or talking about her childhood. Like a person learning to play a piano very well, a pwBPD must work hard for many years in a weekly training program to acquire those missing skills.

While you're waiting to speak to your psychiatrist about a referral, I suggest you take a look at [What Works in the Treatment of BPD](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40473-017-0103-z.pdf). This 2017 review summarizes advances in treatments for people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) in the period 2012 to 2017. It explains that over 13 treatments for BPD have been empirically tested.  
  
However, only 5 major treatments — Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), mentalization-based treatment (MBT), schema-focused therapy (SFT), transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP), and systems training for emotional predictability and problem solving (STEPPS) — have been established as treatments for which there is empirical evidence of them being effective.  
  
This 2017 review concludes that DBT is shown to be the most effective generally but that, for certain pwBPD, one of the other 4 major treatments may be a better fit.  
  
If your psychologist recommends DBT but you are having to wait for admission to a DBT program, you can make some progress on your own -- if you're strongly self motivated -- by acquiring a DBT workbook to start training at home. Of course, you will learn far more (and do so much faster) under professional guidance, but you can make some progress on your own.

A wealth of DBT information is available at [DBT Self Help](https://www.dbtselfhelp.com/), which contains many DBT videos and links to resources. This site was primarily constructed by pwBPD who have taken the DBT training and are describing in videos what they experienced and learned. Some professionals also contribute to that site. Regardless of which training program you undertake, Bucky, I wish you the very best in your endeavors!",Up-Town,yw04yb

Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.

0,"So firstly. BPD is a cluster b disorder that comes with extreme highs and extreme lows. Similar but not same to bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder mood swings last several days to several months and aren't dependent on the outside world. BPD mood swings  are rapid and very dependent on the outside world. The first thing you can do to help is read up on the disorder, because there is a lot to consider and in manifests in several different ways. The second thing you need to do is be 100% positive that you can set firm and just boundaries for yourself without being swayed. My best friend has BPD. And there is a difference between someone who is on top of it and someone who isn't. And based on the limited information in this post, I'm assuming your person isn't. It's a really difficult thing. People with BPD experience emotions very very deeply and BPD is a disorder that stems from childhood trauma. It's a very difficult thing to go through and a very difficult thing to support someone through if you don't have the tools in your tool belt. Keeping an even tone, understanding the root of healthy communication in relationships, and being able to set firm boundaries are a big three, but it isn't always enough.

Editing to add: The best thing you can do for anyone who is unstable is to be stable and consistent. It will help them ground back to reality, but only if you are able to do so in a respectful and loving way including self loving and that isn't a small or simple task. Sometimes the best thing you can do for someone is walk away, even if they feel like their world is ending. And you're the only person who can determine where the line is. --- my best friend is one of the most stable people I know, but she has been very fortunate in her mental health journey, she started therapy at 8 years old, and still has days where she needs to hide in a closet to calm down. Most people who have BPD aren't so fortunate to have that kind of experience with mental health providers, esp not in the u.s. and will be a lot more up and down than just ""having a bad day"" and a lot of my best friend's stability comes with rigid structure and red tape so she can predict the outcome of everything before it happens",PreviousCase2237,15t7d6v

P.S. You're not alone and that there are people who experience the same or similar.",Mischa0711,18fqssv
2,"You know her better than I or any other random innernet stranger could, but what i can say is (1.) you don’t sound like an incel, which believe it or not is a good thing; and (2.) if she’s a worthwhile person, you know what’s less attractive than insecurity? Refusing to respect how differently she might see you and how she is thus able to continue to care about you. 

As someone who’s dealt with insecurities all their life—in themself, in toxic family relationships, and in others—I for one don’t see insecurities, per se, as unattractive. How one deals with one’s insecurities is the real test of character. One passes that test by being honest and humble but without obsessing about the insecurities so much that one shuts down all the surprising possibilities of the universe—including the possibility of hope and healing and of other people’s genuine concern and support. Pass that test and, to a good person, suddenly you’re hotness personified and a lifelong commitment worth making. 

Best wishes to both of you.",NopNopABop,18fqssv
3,"Thanks for replying. Well, I certainly feel emotionally dysregulated; perhaps I wasn’t able to convey it well enough. Sometimes, I feel numb but sometimes very irritated and uncomfortable, and at other times, I’m super anxious. I can’t stop my racing thoughts; it feels as if something is tearing me apart from the inside. I struggle to calm myself down and focus on anything else but my thoughts and on how I feel. The worst possible thoughts are often present too, unfortunately, but I try to fight them as much as I can",Necessary-Bee-9063,18fqssv
4,"Oh and (3.) i quit my masters degree in psych before i got to the thesis part lol, but imho it would be more fruitful for you to try less to settle on a particular diagnosis or label and try more to deal with particular behaviors and/or thought/belief patterns. Whether that’s through medication or some other form of therapy or some combination can be, as you know, lifelong trial and error. But good people are always worth being around, and also worth the effort of being the type of person they want to keep hanging around.",NopNopABop,18fqssv
5,"That sounds more like BPD. A tip I learned is if the emotions are out of control and I am tempted to do a damaging behaviour, hold an ice cube. The cold hurts which helps relieve the emotion and the worst damage is a wet hand.",HuckyBuddy,18fqssv
0,"Look into DBT therapy, it can be beneficial for people with BPD. They also have workbooks online  that you can get to do some at home.",Unsuccessful-fly,14rgl63
1,They can get nervous telling people they have borderline because of how they are so sensitive and can react. But just saying that means you also have an ability others don't have. Being sensitive. Often empathetic.big emotions buy again that's not bad if you realise it's a strength,nonamenouse2020,14rgl63
2,"How are your mood swings? I was diagnosed 30 years ago and didn't have manic depression/BPD. Traits of it? Maybe, or was it that sometimes I was less depressed and wanted to do stuff. It still seems to be the go to diagnosis when they really don't know. Having said that, DBT and CBT can help with what's going on. Also group therapy to share experiences in a community of your peers helps tremendously.",RickJames_Ghost,14rgl63
3,A lot of women with “bpd traits” are just autistic,nola-dragon,14rgl63
4,My mood swings are very bad when I’m not on my medication it’s like I’m a 15 year old without my medication I can get triggered very easily when I’m not on my meds,Galacticaa,14rgl63

I'd encourage you to commit to activities that help your mental health healing, your academic and career aspirations, and any personal goals.

0,I agrée this is an unhealthy dynamic. There needs to be space because you giving him attention is being interpreted as romance,swild89,149dmqn
1,"As someone with the illness, you need to just be straightforward. Say that because he knows what he’s doing, you don’t want to be in his life. Because the hurt is too much.

Do not let him guilt you by using “Everyone leaves me” or “I’m gonna — myself”

I hope you can get away and heal.",,149dmqn

And don’t worry, there is no rush in getting over it now, you can take as much time as you need. 

I don’t know you and I don’t intend to make you think like I understand you, but hey, maybe I can help.

You can talk to me if you want to, doesn’t even have to be about that, maybe just to take your mind of for a bit chat for a bit. For real :)",Little_Dark_Soul,14nnotb
