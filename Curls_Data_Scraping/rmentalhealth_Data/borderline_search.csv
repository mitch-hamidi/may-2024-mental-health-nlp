0,Borderline Personality Disorder,"
I‚Äôm writing this today to spread awareness to mental illness but specifically Borderline Personality Disorder also known as BPD. I‚Äôm hoping to share some insight on this disorder so that people don‚Äôt have to go through what I have gone through and just to bring you some basic knowledge about the subject. 

I‚Äôm not a professional writer by any means so this might get a little messy.

I‚Äôll start off by saying bpd is not a joke and it is not a fake illness or something that ‚Äúeverybody has‚Äù. It is not an excuse to be an asshole. People who are diagnosed with bpd did not choose to live this way and they would probably rather not. Most of the time bpd stems from childhood trauma so people who are diagnosed with this literally have 0 choice in having it. 

Here are some symptoms of borderline personality including my own that i will describe:
‚Ä¢Mood swings (inappropriate bursts of anger), one minute you can be happy and then the next minute you could be suicidal, flying into a rage, depressed, etc. This could lasts for minutes to days and happen at any moment, you don‚Äôt have any control over this. 
‚Ä¢Intense fear of abandonment/scared to be alone or the thought of it gives you severe anxiety. It may be so bad you have to move back home or stay with a friend while your s/o is away.
‚Ä¢impulsive control, severe controlling traits, wanting to do everything yourself/everything has to be done a certain way.
‚Ä¢severe self-imagine issues.
‚Ä¢Depression/extreme feeing of emptiness and loneliness. You know that people around you love you but this problem grows MUCH deeper then that.
‚Ä¢Problems maintaining a healthy relationship or having a relationship at all.
‚Ä¢Problems with money.
‚Ä¢Self-harm.
‚Ä¢Difficulty making and keeping friends due to anxiety and/or the amount of effort it takes to be friends with someone who has bpd. The constant need of reassurance can be difficult for some people to keep up with, along with the other symptoms that follow along with this person.

Bpd can be triggered by experiencing emotional, physical or sexual abuse. Going through traumatic experiences as a child including, losing a parent(s), being neglected, long-term distress or growing up with a family member who suffered from a mental health condition(s) or substance abuse. 

Things you might not have known about bpd:
‚Ä¢75% of people diagnosed with bpd are women.  Men may also be affected by bpd but get misdiagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, also known as PTSD. 
‚Ä¢1 in 10 people who are diagnosed with bpd die from suicide.
‚Ä¢Trust issues including extreme fear of what other people think of you.
‚Ä¢People diagnosed with bpd share extremely relevant symptoms with people who are diagnosed with psychopathy.

I am glad to post this and show recognition for people who have bpd and to educate people who are unaware or don‚Äôt know much about this illness because it is serious and there are so many people struggling everyday. Stop telling people they are lying or making things up for attention and using a mental illness as an excuse to be an asshole because trust me, we do not want to feel this way everyday and go through this. Before you try judging someone else for their mental illness just try for a second to take a walk in our shoes and I guarantee you will fall.

3,Where to get autism/borderline diagnosis?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  
  
I live in Germany. I have been diagnosed with a moderate major depressive disorder for 3 years now and likely additionally have some of the following: ADHD, social anxiety, OCD, insomnia...  
  
But mainly,¬† I almost definitely struggle with autism, BPD, or both. I have read some studies and a literature review. Unfortunately, there is little research on the differences and potentially comorbidity, if it even exists.  
  
I have had different licensed professionals express, with relatively strong confidence, that I have one and not the other - both ways.  
  
I am now searching for an institution or professional that, while diagnoses are obviously separate, considers the alternative option and, tho likely not officially, can provide more details on whether my diagnosis is mainly based on shared, or separate symptoms.  
  
I haven't found any institution nor professional that both considers the two illnesses and is officially recognized. Does anyone know where or how I could find that?

5,Boundaries and borderline,"I work with this woman (20-ish), and she told me she has BPD. 

Now I know a little about this, and to my knowledge, this can cause one to either idolize someone, or view someone as the absolute worst person ever.

Currently, I am the latter to her. She‚Äôs being nasty, she‚Äôs telling people I did things that I certainly did not do, I can not breathe around her without getting attacked for doing something wrong, even if I literally am agreeing with what she just said.

I want to be understanding, and don‚Äôt want to hold anything against her that she can‚Äôt help. I feel someone is in her ear, feeding her stories, fueling the disdain for me. When she‚Äôs suddenly feeling really stressed, or low, I do my best to forget what she just said and go help her.

However, it is taking a toll on me, as I am now dealing with constantly having to explain/prove to people I never did anything remotely like what she said, and the attacks get rather personal, which is hurtful.

Does anyone have any advice on how to be a supportive presence in her life, without sacrificing my own mental health? I‚Äôm concerned I will snap one of these days and either spiral back into depression over the constant attacks, people being distant for reasons unclear to me (which often turn out to be her complaining about non existing incidents), or say something very harsh in response.

I tried talking to her, but she doesn‚Äôt want that. I tried having a mutual friend talk to her, which didn‚Äôt have a great deal of effect, apart from her suddenly like bombing my socials, which is not what I need from her. I tried keeping my distance (we volunteer together, so I can‚Äôt 100% step back, without either damaging the organization, or leaving a place I spend a good decade helping build), but she seeks me out anyway.

Any suggestions on how to juggle her needs and mine in the best way possible?

I used to experience excruciating emotional pain that was very somatic, I would have intense ruminating thoughts, fear of abandonment and was addicted to self harm, impulsive, dissociation, idealizing people and opening up right away to only feel like they do not reciprocate the same level of care, splitting behaviors, dramatic obsessive ways to keep people from abandoning me. Suddenly at 25 that all just kind of went away. I have dissociation some times (I have a significant trauma history), but thats really it. Has this happened to anyone else?

If i got the diagnosis, it would explain why i feel irritated about small things and why i feel like i want to do violent things.

It would explain why i feel after every rush of anger so horrible, like a string that's ready to snap but it doesn't.

It would explain why after every good dissapointment i feel suicidal and broken, and after everytime i would get into this huge rush of fixing my whole life and myself.

20,I have borderline and i feel depressed,"I feel like a waste of space all the time. Cuz everyone in my country is either leaving by luck or job , getting high paying jobs , starting business , having interest money , gambling and getting lucky , using nonusual ways like youtube twitch and more to get paid 

Meanwhile im stsying with my family as a 19 years old , i will soon finish my uni in 2 years and be expected to do military service for 6 months. Idk if i can even live through military let alone finishing uni and graduating , my family is in debt and having many problems. Im having hard time finding money to buy food , i cant get anything i want to enjoy my life while others got to do it cuz their families had money. Or they were born younger. 

In my family i dont have a father , i have a mother that will shame me , work me , make me depressed all the time , wont support me if im lgbt or trying to be ""cute"" , she wont even allow me to grow my hair even tho im 19 , im trying to do house chores and getting money to the house. My middle brother is retarded so he works in a factory and brings money other than that he is free to do whatever he wants cuz of his condition , they got him a new pc while im too ashamed to ask for a few money for my bus card to travel to uni each day , my older brother has gotten everything in his life all the time. My mom will shame me if i say differently cuz he has been working since he was 12 , but in reality HE NEVER seen hard life. He got what he wanted cuz mom supportef him all the time even if he treated her in bad ways , and i never got anything i want. In my birthday at 18 , i just asked my family to be in the house for a day and have fun with me , i was lonely and i didnt had any quality time with my family 

And all of this is just happening cuz my brother looks like my father while i look like my mother , she hates herself and she wants to make my brother like my father , that even my brother just said ""get a husband and leave me alone""

Im near ending my life on my own cuz of my critically bad depression and stress. I have cptsd as well cuz when i cried or tried to act cute i got slapped yelled shamed and punched in face. I was having a panic attack which my mother yelled and slapped me to ""stop being a bitch"" and she forcefully stops me from being depressed or crying. To in her defence ""man me up"" 

I cant cry easily and if i do i feel too much ashamed that i punch or slap myself in the face , that my mother said wtf when she saw it. Though she created this she will deny every possible way she was faulty. Its never about me or how im its always my brother or my mother

And then i got into friendships which my friends would drain me and use me as a tool , i had a friend especially i was close with. He tried to forcefully make me into his date doll and after i denied him he gone rogue and i had to block him. 

I had many severe medical problems before , my doctor said i could had cancer if i continue having 2 jobs and studying while dealing with all of this. So i had to quit one of them. Im just trying to enjoy my life and everyone , both online , both in real life just forcefully hates , disgraces and threatens me with. Even in online places like discord all i get is hate and disrespect. I get shamed by my own friends or by randoms who i dont have connections with. 

I hate living in turkey. I hate living in this country. Nobody in here is good willed. And nobody is willing to save me or help me. They see me as tool. And im really close to ending my life

Even rho i listed this pile of things. There are still many more things that happened in my life which my doctors my real friends that i found (3) and my pscyh said its a miracle im still alive. And they say i have a unbrekable light in my soul, and i have so much talent in anything i touch. Which...i feel like i lack

Since quarentine we've been living together, she used to live on her own since she was about 27 so not that long ago. Before that she used to live with us (me and my mother).


My mom asked her to move out because the last time we lived together she got so agressive towards me that she trew a vase at my head and I had to go to the emergency room and get stitches.


Now it seems that this nightmare is back, her. There is always someone screaming at my house (either her or my mom screaming at her). She tries to get into huge arguments with me all the time about the most stupid things. She has hit my mom several times, I feel that since I am older now she is a bit more scared to get into phisical fights with me. I feel that my mom enables her behavior because she always complains that I don't do the stuff the way she likes thats why she gets angry. ""She is not crasy, you are the one that stress her out""


My house rules:

I can't open or close the door that leads to my room past 8 pm because my door is too loud that will wake her. So if I am at my room I have to stay in if I am out of my room I should have gotten in sooner.

I can't turn on the microwave when she is around because she hates the sound of it, I can't ask her to leave the kitchen, I have to wait for her to leave on her own.

My room and hers share a suite so If I want to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night I can't turn on the lights (because the lights enters her room from the bottom of the door) and also can not fully close my door (because the sound of the doornob is too loud and that will wake her)

I can't turn on my Tv past 8pm because thats too loud for her

I can't exercise anywhere in the house anytime because the sound of me doing burpees annoys her.

These are just a few ones. There are plenty more...
I also would like to state that she is half-deaf. No. I am not kidding.

I feel this pressure within myself from the time that I wake till I go to bed again.

I am so stressed that sometimes I can't feel my arms (I talked to my pschologist and she said that this was from stress).

26,How do you interact with a family member who has borderline personality disorder?,"My sister is 40 years old and just moved back home to my parents, which is where I live. Our relationship has deteriorated over the years. Mostly because any chance she gets, she‚Äôll paint my mom as the villain, and try to stir up drama whenever she can. 

My mom is the ONLY person who has stuck by her side. She‚Äôs tried to make sure my sister is always included in family trips, would tell us to stop talking bad about my sister, has dropped everything whenever a crisis arose and has given her well over $90K to help her get out of debt/evictions/car repossessions/etc. 

I guess it‚Äôs part of the illness but I just don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd try to take down the one person who has given everything to you.

The reason why this is such a big thing for me is because any chance my sister gets, she‚Äôll throw jabs at my mom- from conspiracies to passive aggressive and rude comments. It makes talking with her super difficult.

6 years ago she blamed me for a suicide attempt and it was then that I knew I needed to be distant/work on building a new relationship from the ground up. I‚Äôve tried to remain neutral and be a sounding board that offers advice and questions but not much more. Well just the other day, she wanted to blame my mom for something when in reality it was my brother and it wasn‚Äôt even a big deal. I tried to provide clarity and I turned into the punching bag, essentially undoing any progress I thought we made. 

*What advice would you give on how to navigate living/interacting with someone who has borderline personality disorder?

29,Borderline Personality Disorder,"So, I (23M) have gone undiagnosed my whole life. I've had trouble with self-harm, suicidal tendencies, and being overreactive to my surroundings. The constant mood swings from minute to minute always kept my previous psychologist from labeling me as bipolar. The past few months, my mood swings and dissociation had gotten so scary I end up 6 hours from my house before I snapped and became ""sane"" again.  I have a phobia around going to the doctors office. But that break scared me so bad. I felt like I wasn't in control of myself. I forced myself to go to a psychologist, to almost beg them for help. I had never heard of bpd before I went. All I knew is that I felt like I was going insane and afraid I was going to hurt myself or the ones around me. Till finally, my doctor suggested I might have borderline personality disorder. And since then I've done research on my own. And it's comforting. Like putting a name and a face it, makes me less afraid than fighting an invisible force. I'm newly on medication for it and I haven't noticed a difference yet. And still forcing down violent intrusive thoughts of hurting myself. But I feel like I have more courage than before ig.

Any one who has this diagnosis knows that it‚Äôs such a wild journey.

Your view of self is so distorted because one moment you really LOVE and accept who you are, and the next moment you HATE every thing about yourself and wish you could just decay into the ground.

I constantly cringe and regret EVERYTHING I‚Äôve ever said or done, I loathe being the person that I am basically.. and it‚Äôs difficult because I‚Äôm constantly paranoid about what people think about me and how they view me.
It‚Äôs a terrible feeling and it causes waves of depression.

It‚Äôs a VERY humane thing to feel (so please don‚Äôt come at me with the whole ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt care what others think!‚Äù Because it‚Äôs a very big part of what we, people with the diagnosis, suffer from) for everyone I suppose.

I am diagnosed type 2 bipolar, but I feel I really relate to people with borderline personality disorder as well. I also really relate to people with Bipolar 2 disorder. I know it's possible to have both, but I just feel so confused and I feel like a fraud, because I don't know where I belong, I just know I have a lot of problems and can't do school, can't have a healthy relationship, waste my time being depressed, make really impulsive decisions, never have money, because I always end up suddenly spending whatever I spent time saving up. Sometimes, I feel so good about myself and literally feel like I'm the hottest girl alive, and like I should be allowed to do whatever I want because I'm literally the best and smarter than anyone else. Other times, I can't get out of bed because I can't stand looking at myself and can't go to school or work because I can't stand others looking at me because I'm so ugly. I can't watch movies with my boyfriend, because I'm so insecure and am worried he will think the girls on the screen are hotter than me. I get so angry at him if a girl does come on the screen. The thing, is I don't always have depressed mood, and I guess the distinction between the two, is bipolar people tend to normally also have stable periods. I have stable periods, but definitely spend a lot of time depressed. That's why I have type 2 not 2 and cause I've never had full blown mania, just hypomania.

36,Borderline can‚Äôt hold down a job; need help!,"So I recently had my diagnoses for ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety reconfirmed. I just started therapy back up due to having an episode after a light talking-to at work. I‚Äôm not out of a job yet‚Äîbut I can barely manage 4-5 hours a day and they want me to do 10 with a 90 minute drive‚Ä¶. So 12 hour days.

I will not be able to do this. And combined with my tardiness, inevitable loss of interest, and generally poor planning and focus‚Ä¶ well, any job is not looking good.

This is the best, and one of the few, jobs I‚Äôve ever had. But like most major‚Ä¶ idk, occupations? In my life I get the sense this is going to come to an end sooner rather than later. Now, I have support from friends and family, so I won‚Äôt be homeless. But I am increasingly coming to the conclusion that I may not be able to have a career‚Ä¶ of any kind.

Obviously, this is upsetting. While any kind of work makes me feel like shit, I also A.) don‚Äôt want to be a financial drain on my family for the rest of my life, and B.) want to have some kind of independence.

Of course I will be talking to my therapist about my options, but I was curious to see what people here have to say. I‚Äôve asked for help a lot, but‚Ä¶ this is may be the proverbial big one. I‚Äôm trying to get out in front of it before it hits me in the face like a hammer.

40,Does this sound a bit like borderline personality?,"I know we aren't doctors but anyone here have borderline or know what it looks like? 

Context :

Official diagnosises are severe anxiety and OCD

In relationships I can exhibit controlling behavior due to high levels of anxiety and a fear of being cheated on. I've gotten better in some ways but am still really restrictive in certain situations that I believe 'aren't okay' - for context, hanging one on one with the opposite gender if they're single.  I have a tone of childhood trauma, infidelity happened in my family and I've been cheated on in the past plus my current relationship didn't start on the best note. 

I can be really full on early in relationships and come across as clingy /needy and definitely codependent. 

If I feel like there's even a slight risk of me getting hurt or they put themselves in situations which throw my trust issues out of whack, I will quickly sabotage the entire relationship /end things due to a fear of getting hurt. At times it feels like I'm a bomb waiting to go off, and if someone crosses my boundaries, you can bet there will be a huge scene. 

Sometimes in the past I've broken up with people and then tried pulling them back shortly after. 

My relationships are generally intense and I can be toxic at the worst of times.

I took the test and got an idea of what could be wrong, and after further research, I'm a little more confident I'm on the right path of looking at BPD and AVPD. but I'm again not entirely sure, but at the same time I am? I suspect I might have both since I have a mix of the symptoms, but I can't be entirely sure either

my main issue now is that Ideally I would look at getting a therapist to check on it, but I don't feel like I want to go to a therapist with my parents involved at all \[which would be the only option right now because I'm 17,\] I'd much rather it be me and me alone with a professional, because I would never be honest with either of them involved. the other thing is I don't know, I'm so on the fence but I feel so right about my hypothesis at the same time

the main things pushing me to believe I might have these is the fact that I've got symptoms for both, but especially for Border Personality Disorder. putting it as simply as I can with as few words as possible, I've got extreme mood swings that makes it feel like there's no proper personality to me, and because of that I've got an unstable image of myself and who I am. I've got a few things I'm impulsive to do, but none of them are harmful, simply just things I think can distract me, or otherwise I'm left with really random and really bad thoughts about the future that disappear and come like a snap, and it usually ends with me and this empty feeling I kinda just sit with a lot. I've got bad anger management issues, choose isolation over any sort of social interaction, random lacks of motivation, god awful at speaking with my extended family and sometimes even my main family because I feel like they're all just strangers, and it's like I'm everywhere but nowhere at once

I tried to talk to a friend about this last night, but I got pissed the hell off there too because they told me that ""well it could be just puberty, nothings wrong with you because me personally"" and I had to just go ""uh-huh"" to the conversation before I got pissed enough to say something I didn't mean. and then, again, after that- a hour or so later I was just laughing my ass off on god knows what.

I do not know the specifics but despite appearing very confident, being gifted and being successful both in the workplace and at love he says he is veeerrryyy insecure about himself to the point where he quit his job and gave up basically. Now he is not the most fit or handsome individual and yet he has succeded in life, I wish I had half the stuff he had but it does not seem to matter to him, not being able to accept himself seems to be a roadblock in his life.

I have never struggled to accept myself, for me accepting myself is like breathing, it's just automatic so I don't understand his struggle and have a hard time helping him...

Please give me some pointers, he goes to a special hospital meeting group and has been seeing a therapist for over 3 years now and nothing seems to help,...

59,"Borderline, ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, Gender Dysphoria and probably Autism... Finally feeling okay for the first time in forever","I am a 21 year old trans woman in the most transphobic part of the most transphobic city of the most transphobic country in the world (hello my neighbours from Salvador, Brazil!)

I was engaged to two women in a polyamorous relationship, and one of them broke off with us to be with someone else (which we never stopped her from doing). My other fianc√©e, the one who stayed, broke off our engagement because of issues I was having at the time, and it made difficult for her to feel comfortable around me. That was around September 2023.

I have no job, and my income relies entirely on my father, who has mental issues of his own. He never wanted me to transition, and was the source of many sleepless nights and suicidal thoughts I had as a teenger. He also isn't very supportive of my passion projects, and even though he has money enough for all of my family and more, he complains to me whenever I ask something of him, and manipulates me into giving up my dreams because of his own dreams which he gave up on.

I had three suicide attempts from August 2023 to December 2023, and I was not only hospitalized because of one of them, I was sent to a pysch ward too, and that only made my pain grow.

My mother lives in another city with my oldest and youngest siblings, and they all have got problems so great that the last time I went to visit them (last weekend), my mother cried hard while talking to me about not feeling good in that city.

Last week, the 8th of January, was my birthday, and honestly all I can remember from it was an argument I had with my partner, the context of which I don't recall at the moment.

One of the many meds I take everyday has been an empty box for weeks now, because I just don't have the medical request necessary for me to buy it, and my psychiatrist is too busy with other patients and events.

My hormones have worn off. I was supposed to take them the 9th but today, the 14th, I still haven't.

However...

The 25th of December, after a very uncomfortable holiday party at my partner's family's house, she looked me into my eyes and said that she wanted to be my fianc√©e again. Which was surprising, but I was in fact going to propose to her soon. I had bought a ring with her favorite gemstone and that'd be her holiday gift. I kneeled down and almost fell out of excitement. We are engaged again.

Our ex has reached out to me. Apparently she needs help with moving into a new house with her girlfriend, and swallowed her ego and asked me for help. I still have feelings for her, and I do have a moral code simillar to that of Spider-Man which talls me that if I am able to, I should always help people in need, and she asked me for help. I won't get my hopes up, nor will I abandon my engagement to be with her, but I do hope a friendship will grow out of this.

My little sibling, whom I call Thingy as a cute nickname since he doesn't like his legal name, came out as non-binary in his own child-like way. My mother and oldest sibling (who has DID) say they support him, but make no effort on making him more comfortable. He told me he feels like I'm his safe-harbor.

After months of planing on moving out of my father's house with my fianc√©e with the monthly money he is legally obligated to give to me (since my parents are divorced), my father tells me to wait until March, because he will help me not rent, but actually buy my very own house, and it will be mine forever. Until then, he told me I should buy furniture.

My father has used my correct pronouns and chosen name while talking to other people about me, but is struggling to use it in front of me. My sibling is living far away from me but feels closer than ever. My ex is talking to me again, and her girlfriend and I actually get along really well with no rivalry whatsoever. My fianc√©e is the love of my life, and every day I get to wake up next to her, and go to sleep cuddling with her.

I still get sad, I am not cured of my depression or anxiety... My psychiatrist told me I have like 95% chance of being BPD, my previous psychiatrist told me I have ADHD, and almost everyone I know IRL tells me I show signs of Autism.

but, for the first time since I can remeber... I feel free, I feel happy, I feel okay.

Things aren't perfect, and they will never be, but that is just how life works. There's ups and downs, but we have to keep moving forward.

I am so grateful that my life is feeling just a lot brighter. I have never lost hope things would be better, but I feel so much more alive than ever.

I'm 40 years and I've never taken medication because I thought it was BS, but after the events of the last week I have started the process of getting better. I met this woman 2 years ago and told her straight away that I had BPD, and that I was diagnosed in my early 30s after five years in a pit of depression. We had an online relationship for a year before I went to live in Spain with her. My mood swings increased during our relationship and it resulted in me striking her on more than one occasion. I'm not proud of it at all, and my late father would be ashamed of me because he taught me better. I left her in Spain and came back to England for mental health assistance. I don't want to hurt anyone again. She still loves me but we can't be together because she thinks I'm hiding behind a mental health issue. I've told her that information about my condition is available online for anyone to see, but she's convinced that I will always be this way with or without mental health assistance. I know we're never getting back together because I took it too far, but I really just want her to understand that I need help, and that I wont always have symptoms if I get the right care. I am taking medication at the moment and she says there's nothing wrong with me so I shouldn't be taking them.

89,Borderline Personality Disorder vs. ADHD,"I (23F) write this having already messaged my doctor asking to me tested for ADHD but idk, i guess just some late night musings and questions to someone who may know better.

Since i moved out of state for college i have been having a really difficult time concentrating, reading. Ive joked (kind of seriously) that i may be dyslexic for a number of years. I know live with someone who has diagnosed ADHD and has encouraged me to get tested. I've been trying to get tested through my university but everything is kind of fucked because of COVID. 

Anyway, in my own research on ADHD I've read that people with ADHD have a difficult time controlling their emotions and have unreasonable responsives to situations or triggers. I've always done this. Something or someone will set me off and I'll be angry/depressed about it for days. 

I guess my question is is that this is also a main symptom of BPD. And besides having these rapid changes in mood i also tend me be very paranoid of my friends and relationships; feelings really good about them one week and then feeling isolated and that everyone is upset with me.

92,Does my ex sound borderline?,"Please don‚Äôt say ‚Äúwho cares, she‚Äôs your ex‚Äù. I‚Äôm trying to understand if there‚Äôs something I need to watch for next time to understand a partner better, since I seem to attract - and be attracted to - types like her. We saw each other about half a year. 

She was adopted and is wildly different from the rest of the fam. Her adoptive mother physically abused her. She married at 22 after just 6 months, then after 15 years, uncovered a year-long affair. She took two years off dating, then, including myself, she‚Äôs been with/seen like 6-7 people in two years. 

She has serious fear of abandonment and would ask if I‚Äôm upset with her if I‚Äôd be short with her or not kiss goodbye or go a little without responding to texts/calls - if I ever changed my behavior from the norm, she would need validation that we are OK. She‚Äôd have some push/pull games going on. If I‚Äôd want to stay at her house late, she‚Äôd want to get sleep, but if I‚Äôd leave earlier than expected, she‚Äôd beg me to stay and snuggle her in bed a bit. Then if I got up quickly, she‚Äôd ask me to stay longer. She wanted comfort and security. She told me that she has fear of abandonment and that she gets scared when it feels like someone is distancing. 

Since we broke up a month ago, she‚Äôs already been going on like 3 dates a week, as if she CANNOT be alone and must be with someone always. It‚Äôs almost like it doesn‚Äôt even matter who, she just needs someone. She pushed me away as a friend a couple weeks ago then chased hard the second I was short with her when she was home alone on a Saturday night. She wanted attention or sensed me distancing. I cared about and loved her just as much after we broke up, because love for me stays around. But to her it seemed like the second we changed the linguistic terminology of our relationship, I became almost irrelevant. 

She has very few friends but seems OK with that, and in two weeks may have lost her supposed two best friends (myself and her best girl friend). She also admitted being attracted to what‚Äôs bad for her, said I‚Äôm the most straight edged guy she‚Äôs dated, and said she used to think she didn‚Äôt deserve someone who treated her well. Her ex husband would sell coke, did heroin, would hide his cigs from her, treated her poorly and then cheated. Then she finds me and I treat her like a queen (she said I treat her kinder than anyone ever has and that I‚Äôm the first person ever to make her birthday special). 

She also was tapering off her antidepressant when I met her and stopped therapy a year ago. She‚Äôs very sensitive to certain things - if you lightly grab her arm even to get her attention innocently, she gets mad because I guess ex did that. She has serious jump startle reflex, during horror movies or dog barks, etc. She has some resentment toward men and said she learned from two exes that she will never place a man above herself again.

99,"Frustrated, tired and borderline depressed!","I am a 25M from a middle class background, living in a developing country and I'm very frustrated, tired and borderline depressed. I just want to share my thoughts, my struggles and make my mind a tad bit lighter.

Family background: My grandfather and father were bankers while my grandmother and mother are homemakers. I have an elder sister who is mental challenged and has only completed Matriculation (High school for the Americans).

As a child, everything was going good until I completed my Primary School. During my last year at primary school, my sister was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia along with delayed learning capabilities. My father rarely helped my mom with chores or parental responsibilities, and as a person living in a patriarchal society, all the load was brunt by my mom. My grandfather and grandmother in-spite of living with us never showed much interest in helping out my mom. So she had to choose between my sister and me and ultimately decided to send me to live (at the age of 9) with my aunt in a different city. I somehow managed to live by in those two years I was there. My aunt had to leave the country since her husband had emigrated to a different country and I was again shifted back with my parents. 

For a year, life was again good and it was like the calm before the storm. As I entered high school, my sisters mental illness again came to the fore and this time the severity was such that she had to be put through Electro-convulsive Therapy (Shock treatment in laymen's terms). There were days when I and my mom used to sleep on alternate days to stay up with my sister at night since she was diagnosed with insomnia and sleep meds weren't working. This went on for two years. I somehow still managed to score decently in my school tests while helping my mom with chores and sister's therapy. But in the background, I was losing my social skills and was essentially becoming that quite kid in the class.

Jump to end of high school, I scored good (84%) and was planning to take admission into Commerce stream, but both my parents were adamant that I take up Science. I had no choice but suck up to them since in my country, my parents are supposed to be my legal guardians till I'm 18 and pay for my education. I barely was able to comprehend and grasp anything that was taught and just managed to clear my class 11 and 12 exams (59 and 55%). The only positives were that I regained my social skills, made friends and started going on dates. 

For my bachelors and masters, I opted for Information Technology as my main subject. I worked hard in those 6 years and went from being the worst kid in my batch to the University Topper. In the background, although my sisters health was improving, my parents relationship was deteriorating. My social life again took a freefall and by the end of Masters I was left with only 3 friends. My dating life was virtually 0. 

I was still trying to kickstart my career in the middle of all of this and did my first internship as sales/office assistant (USD 40/month). Thereafter I got another internship at one of the largest Fin-tech firms in my country (USD 500/month) and moved out of my parents house to a different city. Here, I again started working on myself, made friends and entered my first real relationship. I converted that internship into a Job offer and immediately became one of the Top 0.5% earners in my country (USD \~40000/PA).

From here again everything nose dived. My sister was emotionally closer to me than my parents since I was her only real friend and partner in crime to the fun we had. Her mental disorders started resurfacing ever since I moved out. In order to sooth her, I moved out my sister and mom to my place and immediately after 15 days, lockdown was announced due to C0V1D. We were stuck in our homes for nearly 1 year. In that 1 year, my girlfriend dumped me for her ex-. My friends started drifting away since they went back to their hometown because of WFH. Lastly my dad retired from Work last year and since then my life has become hell. He's grown more stingy with money and doesn't want to share pension or his earnings with my mom, got addicted to social media and refuses to take up responsibilities as a husband and father. So I have to share my earnings with my mom which I really don't mind. The frequency of fights between my parents over shared responsibilities and finances is growing day by day meanwhile my day goes into sorting their fights. 

As a consequence my work life and social life has started to suffer, my quality of work has declined. Frequent mistakes are being pointed out by my bosses. I can't learn new things and certified borderline ADHD. My social life is 0, my friend circle is 0 and I have given up on my dating scene. I used to call up/text my friends every time. This time I decided to wait for them to initiate. The result: 0 texts, calls from anyone for the past 7 days. I don't remember the last time someone wished me on my birthday.  I went from being a super fit athletic guy with a chiseled jawline to a middle aged, paunched guy with Salt and Pepper hair and zero jawline. I lost my 4 teeth in an accident (implants are being put) and lost all my confidence and securities in a single blow. 

The only good thing I have is a stable job and a 6 figure salary at the end of the month.

104,Question About Potential Borderline Personality,"Hello, I am not really typically from this sub hence my name however I have some questions regarding my sister and difficulties our family has had in regard to her. For her entire life she‚Äôs had galactosemia which is a condition in which leads to her having issues with learning due to developmental issues caused by the condition. This alone can certainly be stressful at times but there are more issues she has mentally sometimes that we originally thought was bipolar disorder but more recently we‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs likely to be borderline personality disorder instead. This makes more sense since from what I can tell borderline personality is more about negative feeling states and triggers of which is what my family struggles most with. She also had a daughter which can be traced back to bad decision making even though I love my niece wholeheartedly. This can cause even more issues as due to her developmental issues she can take on childlike tendencies herself as well as get jealous and overall have the behaviors of a teenager when she is well into her 20s. She also is a compulsive buyer of things as well as very selfish about the things she gets as well. There are so many other instances of happenings that it‚Äôs getting too many to count and or recall at this moment. As she gets older we become more and more worried about her and her daughters future as she is remaining as negligent as a teenager while always seeming like she‚Äôs ready to lash out for seemingly nothing.

When i was a kid my dad was pretty absent in my life and he was a drug addict and an alcoholic so i wasnt treated very good. He was also not very loving like i never got a hug from him and he never said things like ""i love you"" and ""im proud of you"". He choose drugs and alcohol over me  so many times i had to go without food or other necessitys for longer than you should. But i cant let go and i love him and always will and i hate it

She could be kind in front of people but in private she was stone cold towards me. My stepdad  was voilent and abusive both mentally like he would insult my race a lot growing up (i am black and he is white) ehoch would make me hate myself so much i couldnt and still struggle with going inte the soon and he would just insult my overall appearance and worrh and call me thing like worthless ugly etc and i still get watery eyes when looking myself in the mirror. He would kick me,hit me and throw things like tools car supllys like batterys food, drinks etc while doing it. My mom didnt seem to care and looked slightly happy and relieved when she saw it happen to me.he also raped my when i was 8 in a camping shower and i get flashbacks from it often. I always felt so small and helpless all my childhood because i coulndt do anything about it. and i was so close to killing myself.

It still stciks to me and i always tried to get rhem to love me and be proud of my i always tried to come upp with impresive ideeas and i got the best grades in my class. Triee to  become the best att sports etc. And i crave the love they never gave me. The bad freling has always stuck with me becouse it happend when i was so young and impressionable and it happend for so long

It started to become manageable maybe a year ago when i started to so drugs i dound a bottle of cough suppressant with morfine in it and drank a third of the bottle and i felt loved and safe for the first time in my life i also started to so benzos not so long after that becuse it was so easy to get and i later started smoking weed and doing oxys wich became my favorite drug and subutex and i drank copious anounts of alcohol. I cant do drugs anymore but pretty much cant stop dri king and i am very funtional so i can drink whe  i want.

Since it became managble it became easier to tone down the drinking and i have felt better than before for maybe 3 or 4 months but those feelings of emptyness and feelinf small and unlovable came back and i feel so angry and sad all the time and its just so scary and i dont know what to do i am to afraid to tell anyone in my life because then they have so much power over me and can expose me when they want so tvia is why i am asking strangera on reddit.",1669072276.0,False,2,2,adamrasanen00000000,None,z1dhel,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/z1dhel/i_am_a_lostand_borderline_suicidal_14_year_old/

122,Learning how to live with Borderline Personality Disorder,"So just recently, I went to an appointment with a psychiatrist. I always knew that I had anxiety, depression and PTSD due to childhood trauma but was never actually diagnosed with any of these. When I went to the psychiatrist for what I thought was bipolar disorder, turned out to be something else. She did indeed confirm that I had an anxiety disorder, depression and PTSD. But the one that I never thought about, was that she also diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder. After doing my research on this disorder, I sit here and think how the description as well as the signs and symptoms fit me to a Tee. It is entirely me all over. Explains my poor self-image, my wanting wanting to live at times, my track record of bad relationships and fear of being left, abandonment issues, substance abuse issues and just all of it. I experienced abused in more ways than one as a child up until I was fourteen years old. Come to find out that this disorder can develop due to trauma experienced early on in life. It also comes with other disorders much like the ones that I got confirmed that I had. Learning how to live with this disorder is hard. I am only hoping that in time with DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) I will be able to live a more happier life.

123,Curious about my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder),"It‚Äôs not a big contributor to my life in terms of causing issues day to day, but ever since my Psych. said I fit the bill at least 80%, it‚Äôs been itching my brain.

Every once and a while I‚Äôll get this feeling that I‚Äôm not me, but then a day or so later, I‚Äôll feel like that was me, so is today‚Äôs me, despite them being so polarized. I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve developed very unique ‚Äòpersonalities‚Äô that awaken based on the type of people I‚Äôm with. I‚Äôm not saying like MPD type stuff, but certain character traits that I possess are severely amplified based on my environment. In some groups, I‚Äôll passively suppress traits that are otherwise at the forefront with other groups. *Ex. I‚Äôll demonstrate toxic masculinity with my brutish friends, then switch to a cozy, sweet spoken cuddle bug with my softer friends.*

TL;DR, I don‚Äôt quite understand what‚Äôs happening, but sometimes it gives me a minor identity crisis (similar to an anxiety attack) that only goes away when I do something that I deemed ‚Äònormal‚Äô like going to the gym or singing in the car.

129,Borderline personality disorder.,"I'm looking for advice and information about BPD from anyone who has professional, or experiential knowledge of it. I have a very close friend, whom I have referred to on here before, who has had a lifetime diagnosis set of depression, anxiety, ocd, (defiant disorder as a child), and several other disorders, but not BPD. I've known her for years and she has opened up more and more to me over time. I'm the only person she trusts, and is afraid of pushing me away. She has no other friends and is determined that people stare at her, judge her, and don't like her simply for no reason. She hated herself and physically/mentally cannot say/think anything positive about herself. Recently, I started noticing some symptoms that I thought were more characteristic of anxiety and depression. But, in a moment of concern I googled disorders where severe low self-esteem and paranoia of others opinions of oneself would be present. I found BPD, which as a psych student, ive heard of, but never researched. For her self-esteem issues, she says she can't even bring herself to talk to her trusted therapist about it. And she believes she doesn't deserve help. I found that many people are misdiagnosed with anxiety and depression respectively when they may very well have BPD, due to similarities in symptoms. I'm worried this may be the case for her. Especially since it doesn't seem like she shares certain details that may help her psychologist to provide proper treatment. It's really just a strong hunch, but I have no idea how to introduce the idea to her. She's also very stubborn and refuses to talk about her emotions when things are ""seemingly"" okay.

134,Would treatment for borderline personality disorder include hospital isolation?,"Someone I know has been hospitalised for six months. During that time, she has not been allowed to talk to her family (ie mother and sister) or friends. 

Her husband suddenly had her hospitalised six months ago for what he said would be a two week treatment. He said that she had a bad temper, hurt herself, and acted differently in front of family and friends. He also said that he and their kids are scared of her. However, her mom and sister believe she is being held against her will and not for mental health reasons. Instead, they think she is being kept in the hospital so that she can‚Äôt leave him after finding out about his infidelity. It sounds a bit extreme but I live in a country where corruption is rampant and money is key. Her husband comes from a very rich and influential family. 

It‚Äôs impossible for me to know what‚Äôs happening with the family, but would what he has described be diagnosed as borderline personality disorder? And if so, would isolation be a common treatment? Mental health is still somewhat taboo in my country so whether or not it is the best approach is a whole other thing. And for what it‚Äôs worth, domestic abuse is also a taboo subject.

I am asking because there‚Äôs some efforts to have her released even if her husband is against it. And I would like to understand the mental health angle a bit more.

137,Borderline Personality Weigh In,"I saw a post on here in which people asked questions about Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and the possibility of having it. 

I was diagnosed with BPD at the age of 25 after a long history of severe mood swings when growing up as a kid. Bouts of depression and anxiety plagued my days with nights providing comfort and insomnia.

My family recognised a trait in my behaviour and speculated BPD, further investigation with my GP confirmed it.

The days that followed were peaceful as the abnormal behaviour traits inhaled displayed finally made sense. I could finally understand the moments in which I became frustrated and, instead of lashing out; I had the ability to keep calm and process the information in a more efficient way.

Borderline Personality Disorder isn't a condition to which one would talk to ones self but that of mood swings, fear of abandonment and self harm/suicide to name a few.

What I have found is that there are two sides to every story and although the negatives are prevalent, the sensation of happiness does exist but can be hard to achieve with a negative mindset.

I have experienced unstable relationships and formulated trust issues over the years but, at 25 I reached a point of understanding towards the negative behaviour in my life and knew a change had to come from within.

People fortunate to not suffer with mental health are able to process information in a way that seems foreign so understanding your own traits and learning how this can appear to someone that does not suffer, can help with decision making and real world perceptions.

BPD isnt something to fear and, like my post, BPD is an opinion and a true diagnosis is one that can only make sense to the individual experiencing it.

Concerns are justified to which I suggest a consultation with your local GP may prove useful in your pursuits of happiness.

138,My story on Borderline Personality disorder,"It‚Äôs half way from mental health awareness day, and here I want to share my story on suffering from Borderline personality disorder BPD and mild anxiety. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to share any of my story on my social media because I‚Äôve been scared of revealing my mental health status. So here I am on reddit to share it now to summon strength to open up (and hopefully help others to overcome theirs). 

I have always been struck by BPD, but I never had an official diagnosis until I was 21. 

Background: 

I got bullied a lot when I was in primary 6 (11yr) and secondary 1 (12yr) whilst studying aboard. No one was rooting for me and I was too scared to open up about being bullied. I believe this is how BPD first started develop. 

When I restarted secondary 1 (13 yr) in my home country after refusing to go back to where I got bullied for secondary 2, I made a really good friend in the new school but that friend suddenly stopped talking to me without letting me know why. This may have precipitated BPD development more. 

I started becoming addicted to online games for 2 years until secondary 3 (15yr) when I pointed a knife on my dad because he cut off the power supply. He took me to a psychiatrist and I got told I‚Äôve got social anxiety (I thought so at that point as I barely left the house in that 2 yrs I was afraid of even ordering food myself) 

Recent (my symptoms and diagnosis):

Fast forward to 18-20yr old, I always get bouts of depression and extreme happiness, but each phase usually lasts for 1- few hours. I liked to think I‚Äôve got depression but I was never depressed for 2 weeks or more (depression definition). 

I had extreme difficulty maintaining friendships. All of the friends I made were short-lasting, or either they lasted long and all of a sudden we lost touch. 

I always felt lonely and angry about being left out. But then when I am part of something (e.g. party), I felt too much and that people are too annoying and I just wanted to be alone (I was never satisfied). In a-level and 1st year university (18-20yr) I had many times I don‚Äôt want to see people and therefore didn‚Äôt go to lectures. I was scared of exploring my interests as I always thought of myself as interior and I prioritised others over myself. 

Due to an event in my 2nd year university (21yr), I started to gain insight on my feeling and my past. From then I started writing to pick myself up and stabilise myself, it has helped a lot. At the same time I went to see a psychiatrist and finally got told I‚Äôve got BPD, which matches mostly with how I felt in the past. 

Now: 

I feel very grateful now that I‚Äôve got a diagnosis. And after starting writing and gaining insight, I became a lot more aware of how BPD affects me. 

Due to the event that had given me insight, my tolerance on stress (exam) has gone down a lot. Exam has prevented me from establishing a life for myself. I have my last exam coming in June and I‚Äôm struggling to cope with stabilising myself whilst studying for it. 

Thanks for letting me vent it out here. This has been something I want to share for a long time.

147,I just found out I was manipulated by my borderline mom,"I used to ignore everything she said and thru the help of my friends, what my mom said will get past me pretty easily, even the harsh ones like when she cursed me with bad words. 

But since 2019 I got into an elite dormitory senior high school and was very stressed to be there. Long story short my mom is so perfectionist. She cooperates with my teachers and dormkeepers but she got mad for everything and made everybody question why and how can they handle my mom. So they asked me, to which I was still immature and I'll start saying bad things about my mom. To note I have never learn how to filter things to say to people and I overshared A LOT. My mom told me it's good to be transparent and tell people everything because it's ""innocent"" and I put that on my mind...

I had to resign from the school though the money we paid won't be back (it was around $14,000). For sure my mom was blaming me for taking all of her money. I sort of predicted it, and luckily I endured it. I asked for a homeschool and I have to do cambridge curicculum and my national curicculum at the same time. Which is tiring, and I'm not good at handling my schedules nor cooperating with the teachers. I would mostly ran away and not answer my chats.

The pandemic began when I also began my individual homeschooling study, to which it was 1v1, just me and the teachers. I was a very smart student, and has always been very polite to the teachers so I'm literally scared to talk about any incovenience. I struggled overthinking everytime I messed up, they would question they expectations about me being smart. 

Okay, let's get back to the main idea. Basically I had to live a pandemic with my mom, I didnt go out. I dont have friends cus I'm also apparently getting bullied for 4 years. 

I started to believe what my mom says are all true when she told me ""it was harsh right in the dormitory? I told u! I am trying to safe you but your teachers are so ughh they're still soo young they wont even understand how moms are very worried about you, and how to educate children in dorms"" (my mom was in late 40s) 

Apparently because of the pandemic, I only talked to my mom and dad. Mostly my mom because my dad was more of in the silent side. And you guess it. I believe everything she said. The good ones like praise, etc, and the bad ones like telling I should die, I should go to the cemetery and sleep there. And all bad things I probably have forgotten. But the fear is there and is always there. 

I get diagnosed with severe depression. And it was rough because the psychiatrists also have a hard time dealing with my mom. She has been treated badly since she was a kid and she is passing 50s now... I know for sure how hard it can be to deal with mom, but I myself cant even help myself.

Doctors and friends I met in hospitals always told me not to believe my mom and keep distance. Also not listening to any fear my mind told me to think about. It is definetely hard. I cried so hard whenever I think about bad things. It made my father angry too sometimes cus he's frustrated as to when will I stop crying. 

I just wanted to be praised and loved like my mom did to me, without getting blamed for things they endured afterwards... How to stop being in fear of my mom and believing all her words?

Side fact, I'm very sympathic and I cannot unhear my mom's words when she told painful things she endured for me.. I will feel blame and guilt all over me.",1652066048.0,False,1,0,happy3oranges,None,ulhyx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ulhyx4/i_just_found_out_i_was_manipulated_by_my/

151,I think I may have Borderline Personality Disorder,"**DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT ATTEMPTING TO SELF-DIAGNOSE. I AM ONLY LOOKING FOR THIRD-PARTY OPINIONS (HOPEFULLY EDUCATED ONES) TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS AND HELP ME MOVE FORWARD WITH POSSIBLE TREATMENT.**

**Why I think I may have Borderline Personality Disorder**

**I have engaged in frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, and I have a pattern of unstable relationships.**

During my time in elementary school and all the way through high school, I have consistently felt as if my friends and family were going to abandon me. I would always ask them, ‚Äúyou love me, right? Are you going to leave me? How can I make you stay?‚Äù. When I began to feel as if my friends would rather not have me around, I would become consumed by the fear of being left behind. My mind would race with thoughts of being left out, even if it was something as simple as one friend staying over at another‚Äôs house for a sleepover, or one friend being invited to a stranger‚Äôs birthday and me not being able to tag along because I don‚Äôt know the other friend.

Currently, my closest friend and roommate, Britanie, is slowly being pushed away by my behavior. I completely understand why a person would want to distance themselves from someone who has explosive outbursts of anger, but I also become extremely distressed when she brings up the possibility of moving out on her own. My outbursts coincide with my own perception of her not caring enough or doing enough for me. One example is food. When we buy groceries, we always purchase enough food for the both of us, and it is a rule that one is not allowed to touch the other‚Äôs without permission. I normally eat up all of my food much faster than her, and when I do, I demand that she give me some of hers. She will calmly explain that this food belongs to her and that I shouldn‚Äôt have eaten up all of mine. I become extremely angry and question her as to why she would do this to me, and why she doesn‚Äôt care enough about me.

Arguments like this have happened an innumerable amount of times, and after each and every argument, I break down and cry and beg for forgiveness. I then go on to portray the ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù attitude and begin to despise myself.

**I have an unstable identity and a constantly-shifting sense of self.**

I have changed my interests and vocational goals a multitude of times. I remember dedicating myself to musical theory and composition in high school when I joined orchestra. My entire life became music, and I wanted to be a music teacher. However, after months of this, almost instantly, every single piece of love I had for this hobby vanished, and I felt hollow, like nothing could make me happy. The same thing happened with visual art. I joined many art classes in school like sculpture, drawing, and cartooning. I worked my fingers to the bone painting and drawing many things, and I even had applied to Ringling for illustration and game design. Now, I can‚Äôt even bring myself to pick up a brush or a pencil and create something. It just bores me now.

The same thing has happened with wanting to be a lawyer, then doctor, then language teacher, then chemist, then medical researcher. I have an outstanding passion for something, and then, almost instantly, I have absolutely no interest in it.

This kind of behavior isn‚Äôt limited to vocational aspirations, as I have also experienced a need to constantly change the way I look, talk, and act to fit my own ever-fleeting desires of self image. I have no idea what my actual voice sounds like anymore because I have been trapped in a never-ending cycle of change

Those two are the main ones from the DSM-5 that I experience. Other minor, but  still bad ones, are suicidal gestures, feelings of hollowness, dissociation,  splitting, and impulsivity.",1604412459.0,False,3,8,Codeesha,None,jnaumg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jnaumg/i_think_i_may_have_borderline_personality_disorder/
152,"Borderline personality disorder trait? (obsessing over having a ""soulmate"")","Hi all, I was wondering if anyone else experiences/feels this way, and if this is a typical trait of borderline personality disorder?

Just as bg info, I'm diagnosed with BPD, depresion, anxiety and am extremely introverted, withdrawn, bad at talking/socialising etc, and have ""uncommon"" interests. I'm not too fond of interacting with people and ultimately feel like I'm better off by myself, for my own good as well as others. However at times I really really yearn for a deep emotional connection with someone, I get really obsessed with the idea of having a ""soulmate"" or just a bestfriend where I can be myself without being nervous/hiding myself and just play videogames and do stuff together with. I do have some friends, but I tend to not initiate conversation and cut them off myself because I always get this thought that they have better friends anyway, and that I'm just a nobody to them.

So I've been out of college for a few years but started a new course recently. My class is pretty small with 16 people with half of them mature students. I may be mistaken and misinterpreting and reading too much into it, but this person seems somewhat interested in me. I'm not sure if it's because I look ""interesting"" (I have dyed hair, piercings, dress kind of alternative) but the person keeps trying to initiate conversation with me. When class is over for the day and I walk out, they would catch up and compliment something and then walk together to the bus, or sometimes in a group of people they'd ask me a question and try to strike up a conversation. 

We have similar interests (music, tattoos, dark humour) and seem to have kind of similar personalities (introvertness), and after 2 weeks of this, I'm in a really unhealthy state of mind. I may have a crush on the person (as disgusting as it is to admit to myself) because I'm always trying to think of how to interact/reply/say etc, especially since I'm so bad at talking and am not too eloquent in my speech (when I think of something to say in my brain, my words come out of my mouth jumbled) and am obsessing over the idea that we could be bestfriends and hangout and just have fun. One of the days we had a photography trip, and after the lecturer gave us our assignment, everyone went off either on their own or in groups. I stood around and seen that person go off with another person, so I went with another group. The entire day I kept thinking how I wish I'd went over and talked to them so we can go around together to do the assignment, and kept wishing I'd bump into them.

I'm really conflicted in how I'm feeling, I know I'm overthinking and reading too much into it, but it's kind of driving me crazy.

But I bore the weight  
Of what should've been shunned.  
Don't tell me it shaped me,  
I know that too well,  
I could've been carefree,  
Instead, I was compelled.  
The protectors, they faltered,  
Left me to fend,

That was just the point I though 'shit, I need help'.

Anyway, out of the few bits and bobs I have read I'm finding some similarities between Adjustment Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Such as the reckless behviour/impulsivity, chronic feelings of emptiness, and self destructiveness. I also know it has been said that a diagnosis of an Adjustment Disorder is often given as a placeholder when doctors/psychiatrists don't want to diagnose anything specific.

I wondered if anyone with a bit more experience around mental health disorders knows of any actual connections between the 2 disorders (such as in the DSMV-5) or whether I am just imagining and drawing lines between 2 unrelated things.

165,Suicide Threats from Breakup w Borderline,"I was dating someone a little younger than myself (33) in whom I recognized signs of BPD. I asked him to get therapy, and he started, but then in a meltdown said the therapists are too easy to lie to.

We only dated about five weeks but he got very intense, very fast, and I felt really uncomfortable (I've been in relationships like that before and they never end well). I just can't be the sole support system for someone, when my own mental illness takes so much out of me.

I told him today that I couldn't continue the relationship and the ensuing messages were everything from You broke my heart, to You are a user and a monster, to I'm going to end my life.

I am concerned about the threats. I did have someone I cared for follow through after years of threats. He knows this. I told him I would call for outside help if he said anything else like that and he doubled down.

I want to ask the community, those who suffer with BPD especially (which I relate to and used to feel shades of myself)--should I call someone? He lives with his family, but I don't know how to contact them. I don't want him put on a hold if it's going to be detrimental to his mental health.

I basically diagnosed myself just by how I was feeling and stuff, and Psych confirmed. But she never helped me try to cope or explained how my cycling may go or anything. Problem is, I don't really go through ""cycles"". Little things set me off and suddenly I'm depressed/anger/hate myself/feel like harming myself (I don't). At the same time, good things happen and it's like euphoria, everything is amazing, etc. And it's so quickly shifting throughout the day that even the most rapidly cycling bipolar disorder doesn't fit. Looked into other disorders that may cause this rapid mood shifting and such, and it seems like Borderline Personality Disorder fits me on almost every ""symptom"". I can't really afford to see a psych again, plus closest ones that would be better than previous one is an hour and 15min away. Plus I also know not much can be done about it and the Bipolar meds made me worse/had major side effects to and don't want to go through that and have to keep going back to psych for med changes and crap.

172,I think I might have borderline personality disorder,"I think I might have borderline personality disorder, I was diagnosed with bi polar disorder 2 years ago but I didn‚Äôt know anything about bpd at the time my partner brought it to my attention he believes it‚Äôs why I am the way I am. Lately I‚Äôve been so paranoid I‚Äôve been hearing things?  It‚Äôs gotten so bad I hear this scratching in the walls of my room(no rodents)I‚Äôve been hearing more voices then usual like I‚Äôve heard voices my whole life but I knew they were me and now it‚Äôs like theres someone else talking to me. I flipped out one night and brought my dad in to hear it and he said he couldn‚Äôt hear anything and it‚Äôs like my brain got so loud with this scratching noise it felt unreal and I spent the next 2 hours screaming in the mirror and crying in the bathroom, I locked myself In convinced there were demons in the walls that were gonna come kill me. I had a lot of trauma as a kid, my mom was a pain killer addict and my dad was abusive I was adopted and convinced my whole childhood I was kidnapped from my real parents and then Got  over that then I was contacted by my birth mom at age 12 and I asked about my birth dad and she told me who he was I contacted him only to be met with ‚Äúshe shouldn‚Äôt have had you‚Äù ‚ÄúI want nothing to do with you‚Äù and all that horrible stuff. My adopted dad got cancer when I was 13 and beat it then got lung cancer and is still dealing with that today. So then when I was 16 after many years of depression suicidal thoughts and attempts spending most my time in hospitals, I got a call from my birth mom to find out my birth dad who had a lot of addictions (drug addictions, also had bi polar disorder ) had killed himself. In the time I was in school I was bullied and pushed down and kicked for being so weird. I dropped out when I was like 14. (Currently trying to get my ged but everything seems to be failing) it‚Äôs like my brain is out to get me. I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this and it‚Äôs weird pouring out my problems to a reddit but hey when there‚Äôs nothing left. I‚Äôve been trying to get into a therapist but insurance has been hard so. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôd say, hey my name is blah blah blah and I‚Äôm hearing people and I think it‚Äôs either a shit ton of demons or my own mind, what‚Äôs your name? Like no. I sound insane. I am insane and I get this anger that just makes me blackout and I say horrible stuff and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I feel others emotions so much so I feel so horrible about everything and I can feel everyone else‚Äôs anger or sadness. it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm taken over and I can‚Äôt control what I say when I‚Äôm mad all there is is what‚Äôs the worst I can say to hurt someone like they‚Äôve hurt me when in reality they just like said a small comment or criticized me or something not worth how angry I get. I‚Äôve destroyed things and broken glass, punched walls, hurt myself, I‚Äôm constantly afraid of being alone because I think I will die. Like I honest to god believe if I‚Äôm alone in a room I will get killed. I‚Äôm almost 20 and I still can‚Äôt sleep with lights off because I see things in the dark that aren‚Äôt actually there.

I‚Äôm to the point of no sleep I feel like I‚Äôm turning into the people of nightmare on elm street.. I feel sick all the time cause I sleep like 3 hours and then random nights I‚Äôll crash after a week or 2 of that and sleep for  15 hours straight. I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me. I have to say certain things multiple times because it has to be in 2‚Äôs so it‚Äôs not alone. I have to check the door is closed  a even amount of times.

181,Depression but also borderline ?,"Hi everyone. Since September I have been diagnosed depressive. Basically I was unhappy, sad, had no energy to do anything. This was triggered by me moving to a new city with no family and friends there, a new job, and by being now 3 hours away from my GF.

I had everything to be happy (I should spend 3 years there, not too far from my GF, not too far from my family). But I couldn't help being unhappy. It has been a few months of pain, panic attacks, etc. I really thought I would become crazy, and I really thought about getting into psychiatry hospital to find a safe place.

I am seeing a therapist, and as the therapy goes on, I feel like I have been developping concerning behaviours since 3-4 years (I am 22). During some weeks/months I developp stron maniac trends (basically I must enter a room with the right foot first, I must walk a certain way, etc. otherwise I am panicking). This sometimes led me to strange situations. This happens when I am alone (not hanging out with people).

I have also a HUGE fear for people leaving me or getting bored of me. It applies to my family, my GF, my friends.

I learnt about the DSM-5 test for personnalities, and I tried to make the test (online, so I know this is not 100% reliable). And the only criteria I do not fill is the impulsive and dangerous behaviour and the suicidal tendancies (I still think about suicide sometimes though, but do not want to commit).

So I wonder if I might be ""developping"" my borderline personnality. I know that my behaviour has been evolving for the last few years, and I feel like there is something more than depression going on. I meet still many criteria for borderline, but do not want to talk about it to my therapist because I fear I could have it, and because I fear I could also be misdiagnosed.

182,Living with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)/ Self-harm,"I was just 11 years old when I attempted suicide for the first time, but the first self-harm cut was when I was 10 years old.

I want to say I am a survivor but I am not actually. I would be a survivor if I overcame my fears and wanted to live after my life was saved. But I still can‚Äôt get that thought out of my head that thought every once in a while, I get when I am holding a knife. That thought of hurting myself again and again. Those scars are just a tiny bit of all of the others. There are other visible scars all over my body and those are only what‚Äôs visible. Other scars are still within me but it doesn‚Äôt show itself. I was in grade six which means I was just 11 years old when I attempted suicide for the first time, but the first self-harm cut was when I was 10 years old. Since then cutting myself isn‚Äôt the only way I coped up. When I was 12 years old, I drank some poison, I vomited blood but that was it, I survived. Then again at 12, I filled my thighs and hands with deep cuts. Luckily those early years of self-harm didn‚Äôt leave any scars. I went through a phase where I would wake up in the middle of the night and start slapping myself, pulling my hair out, crying without a break, hitting my head on the wall. Then when I was 14, I tried overdosing myself to death. I don‚Äôt what those pills were but I took 5 different kinds of pills, each contains at least ten tablets and I swallowed them all without crushing. I survived. I mean I was constantly nauseous and dizzy for three days straight and nobody noticed still I survived. Then a few months later something triggered, (oh and I don‚Äôt hurt myself on impulse. I actually think months before actually hurting myself in any way.) So, a few months later I drank half a bottle of dark phenyl. Burned my taste buds for months and also burned every time I swallowed because my neck felt like it was glued together. I cut myself several times through the years but at 16 I jumped, from the top of my house. I jumped from a 3 and a half story building and didn‚Äôt even have a scratch on my body oh and I had actually cut my hand a day before that which required 12 stitches on my left arm. That was the last my I actually hurt myself to that extent. I have had thoughts even recently but I am holding on and I am lucky that I have someone who accepts and loves this side of me too.

And it made me feel incredibly empty inside which is often and I feel like it's getting worse everyday...

I have a favourite person, if you are familiar with some BPD symptoms this means my happiness depends on that person right now. This person isn't even aware of my feelings, I want attention, something I haven't received much in my childhood. It's this open wound that I fail to treat. I know if this person were to acknowledge my feelings I'd block them. I want that person to see me. To love me, to give me everything I want and I can't stop stalking them online. But I know deep inside if it were to become real I'd stop everything. I feel like I'm doomed to relive my childhood again and again with people I hardly know. People who don't seem to be interested in me seem to attract my interest. I want what my mother couldn't give me. The only time I can free myself from thinking about this person is when I find a new favourite person. I've been repeating this my whole life and it's draining me.

I need advice.

192,Borderline Personality Disorder,"For years I feel I have suffered from a mental health illness, I have always wondered why my mood changes so much, why I am constantly depressed etc but I have always brushed it under the carpet until recently. I am nearly 22 so am very close to finishing my degree and am struggling a lot to deal with the workload mentally, all my friends around me have gotten into long term relationships and I have never had anything more than a one night stand, for some reason that is affecting me hugely as I feel I am too ugly for anyone to ever find me attractive. Long story short my friends encourage me to go out to bars etc to release my uni stress as well as to meet someone at the same time, however they are unaware that when I drink I have the  most awful suicidal thoughts  which is why I choose not to drink. I am SO SICK of being mentally ill, I have decided to do something about it, I just live in this state of angriness at the world, hatred for myself and struggle to control my anger and emotions, I have lost so my friends along the way. Anyway, I have booked a doctors appointment to deal with and after research, a lot of the way I feel and act leads me to believe it may be BPD, I know it is not easy to self diagnose and it shouldnt be done however, I was reading the symptoms and it made me feel relieved others actually feel the same. When going to the doctors what is the best way to approach this? Obvisously I do not want to self diagnose but I cant stress how much the symptoms add up to the way Im feeling!! Any Advice? Or any advice in general in how to reduce anger, suicidal thoughts, self esteem and depression? sounds like a very long list hahaha but I really am struggling!!",1546804422.0,False,1,2,heart110133,None,ad945x,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ad945x/borderline_personality_disorder/
193,Looking for advice after breakup with my girlfriend who (maybe) suffers from borderline personality disorder,"Hi, I (35/male) am looking for some advice after i broke up with my ex-GF, so i can internalize and start making sense of the mess i feel like right now, and decide what should i do at this point.

We have know each other for like 20 years, and always had a thing for each other, we started our relationship about 3 years ago and besides a break we took due to a possible covid infection, it has been the most amazing and wholesome relationship, she is caring, loving and really puts an effort in keeping me happy, but she also suffers from explosive anger outbursts and huge mood swings, ranging from yelling/fighting with her sister, to actually throwing temper tantrums and punching her desk or keyboard, most of this happens because she has her own company and it makes her horribly stressed.

Last week we were getting ready to go to an event and the dress she bought didn't fit her, (she has some body image issues since she has been gaining some weight because she over eats when she is stressed) and after i was unable to zip her, she stared crying and left the house yelling to me that she did not wanted to go to the event with me after ""what i did to her"", she later sent me a few texts asking me to leave the house since she could not keep on with the relationship, and she wanted me gone saying i did not showed her any empathy and i ""treated her like a maid"", which does not makes sense as i did most of the house chores because i knew she was overworked,  and i tried to help as much as i can taking care of the house, while she sometimes cooked and washed our clothes.

After talking with a friend of mine who is a psychologist, he told me it sounds like she has a case of untreated BPD with a little narcissistic personality on top of that, as her behavior matches most of the symptoms for that, he also told me she will most likely try to re-kindle the relationship once she calms down, but if that happens i have to decide how to handle that situation.

I love her very much, like i have never loved any other person, but most people are telling me to just move on from her and never talk to her ever again, so i need some advice in case anyone that has been trapped in this type of ""toxic cycle"" with a person with this kind of mental issues.

195,Borderline Personality Disorder,"I work full time for a large corporation. Currently, there is a lot of turmoil in the workplace (my specific office). 

This is a long story as it requires a lot of history. Due to this I'm going to use alias names to condense this story and make it easier to follow.

For the past few months two of my coworkers have been bumping heads. Let's call these two Paul and Tracey. Paul is pretty arragont but he is a good worker. Tracey is new to the job but her husband (who got her the job) is a manager of a neighbor location. These two bicker all the time. Most of the bickering comes from Tracey and is directed towards Paul. She will double check his numbers (this isn't her job) and if anything is off she will report it to management. She wil come over when he is working with a client and put in her two cents. She only does this with Paul mainly because he doesn't talk to her all. 

She had borderline personality disorder and being avoided is triggering to her. 

Well, she recently announced she was pregnant and wrote a letter to HR saying she doesn't feel safe around him as the added stress and her fear of him has her afraid she will jeopardize her pregnancy.

Now, Paul is out pending investigation. On top of that, our hiring manager (let's call him William) is out pending investigation as well. Apparently, he didn't report the countless times Tracey made a complaint on Paul. He did, however, talk to Paul each time.

Here's the thing; I don't think it's fair that these 2 people may lose their job over what everyone working here feels is nothing. But, I understand that Tracey feels as though everything she is doing is valid. I only know she has borderline personality disorder because I worked with her husband about a year ago before she worked with the company and he told me (assuming I'd never know her or need to use this information). For some reason this fact stuck with me. I am pretty sure that she never listed this information during the hiring process but I feel that, given the circumstances, it needs to be brought to the light for sake of the pending investigations.

I'm friends with all 3 people. I also think Tracey means well. But I believe that since her medication switched due to pregnancy that she can't think clearly. Currently she had no idea I know what her condition is. She also thinks the manager being out as well is completely unrelated. 

Should I mention this to HR? Can you ""out"" a person with a mental health problem?

198,Is this borderline disorder? What is your opinion?,"(29, fem) Im not sure if Im really on the right thread here and Im sorry if not. Im righting here to search for answers, for some help, because maybe someone here can validate or explain me my doubts. So, i fell in love with a person that was really amazing, that helped me so much after a long trip to √çndia that i made and i got really sick. I was not planning to love someone and getting in a serious relationship, but that happened. This person was absolutly everything i didnt know about love: caring, dreaming with me about trips, a life together, getting a dog. He helped my family so much, went to chemo with my grandpa. He was the best listener, bubbly, always making everyone happy and laughing. He was charismatic, patient. There was not a single person that didnt like him. He met everyone on my life and i started to believe that love did really exist. After a while, we decided to live together, that was magic the first months. I was happy to have a soulmate, always there for me in the most lovely way. But with this pandemic crisis and an amazing new job he got before it all started, everything changed. He was always tired, he had to travel to do more things to keep his job, my mental health (dunno why) went bad when i was with him. He was flunctuating between long bad moods, being distant, everything was not ok for him, he want to go way all the time, he cried, the he stayed, he was always making a huge fight out of nothing, everytime there was a tiny thing not right, always with a low self esteem. I didnt recognize him!!. I was a mess inside, i was lonely, he was travelling, travelling, saying he needed to work to mantain our life and to keep our dreams possible since inwas I was in home Office recieving less. But something was not ok, i felt it. Months of this and one day i said i was going to sleep at a friends house while he was at work (idk why i did this). And i was waiting for him at home, he arrived really late with a lot of boxes in his hands. I got scared, i locked myself at home and call my father to come quickly because i did not wanted him home. Since this weird and terrifyng moment, i didnt know who the hell he was. He left with his clothes on his body only. He called me so many times and i did not answer. I felt on my heart pure horror, like living a nightmare. I started to look on our home, and i found letters with a lot of debts, proofs that he didnt study where he said he studied, nor worked on a lot of famous places in uk, i found cloned cards from a lot of places, documents of things really scary that i did not understand at all. On that week i searched for his ex on social media and messaged her. She called me later that day. Saying he was a pathological lier, that he stole from many places he worked (Hotels, restaurants, etc), that he loved girls imensely and after a while he enters on a cicle of stilling, cheating, with a double life, highly inteligent to manipulate everyone and everything. And to close the cicle, with no reason, he just enter the house of the girlfriend he is with, and stole everything and disappear. After that call i was in completly chock. I talked to an insane number of girls in the uk (Im from Portugal) that were with him, and all of them repetead me horrivel story: that were stolen, they were with nothing, abandoned, with debts of him on her names, everything awful you can imagine. I went to a psychiatrist to get help, to organize my head and life and to calm down. The doctor said he had a psycopathy called borderline, clearly. The cicles, the mood swings, the dangerous behaviours, etc. My house was full of stolen things, that night he was going to stole me... i could not function. The guy i loved was never travelling, he was seeking for other girls, while going to chemo with my grandparents, while was always with my family, while he made a surprise party for my nephew because she turned 5, while dreaming to get married and sleeping with me every night and planning on stealing me and the the new place he worked. I got justice for him, i phoned people from where he worked, i showed them the things he stole, i got help from the other victims and he got fired and now has to face his life karma. Ikd why i was feeling so mentally ill when i was with him, why i did not let him enter.. but i was the ONLY girl not affect by him, i stoped him. The doctor explained me that it was borderline, but do you guys think that it is that? A highly inteligent person, mood swings from love to hate, patterns of really dangerous behaviour, manipulative, a pathological lier... Do you guys think it is borderline? Or something else? Although Im ok and happy right now, and recovering for this living hell, i really want to know if the doctor was right, or if it is something else.

202,"Are there moodswing disorders besides BPD, borderline, pms??","Hi everyone,

Ive been struggling with mood swings and self hate since I was fourteen. It came out of nowhere and It made me feel like I wanted to die and just lots of self hate (no self-harm). I had times I cried uncontrollably and the smallest things would hurt my feelings badly. Also I sometimes had anger issues and stuff.

I went to therapy a few times, but I quittes everytime when I thought I didnt need it anymore. I would just be like: nah im perfectly fine, why am i overreacting. In between times I would go to therapy I would search the internet like mad to find what was wrong with me. I know everything about every disorder, but still I dont know wtf is wrong with me.

So I am twenty one now and ive grown so much. The symptoms are less worse and most of the time I can control myself.
I still have troubles having mood swings and crying often. Sometimes I feel really empty or I get really insecure feelings like I am not good enough. Overall I like to think I am a happy person, but when I sometimes compare myself to others I feel like my mood is just always so down. I wonder if something is wrong?

I am never suicidal and I enjoy living if I think realisticly, But my mind sometimes makes me feel like im not and I dont understand, because I do feel happy. Or am I just so used to having a low mood I dont really know what being happy actually is. I‚Äôve had timesin my life where I would just wake up and feel excited for the day and those are the best. I sing, I dance, I laugh quite often. I enjoy things, but still I feel weird and not completely right.

Also the worst thing about having mood swings is not understanding who I am, what I want and what feelings are relevant and which are not. I am just really confused all the time. Like even know I can be writing this feeling sad. And tomorrow morning I can wake up and feel super confident and be like: why did you exaggerate??

Not wealthy enough for expensive cars, or a huge house, but financially stable enough to be able to, say, buy my brother a video games console for Christmas. The point being: never at any point in my life have I gone without food, or overheard my family mentioning debt, or money struggles or whatever. I recently started uni, and am fortunate enough that my parents supply me with a monthly allowance of sorts as opposed to a maintenance loan that I'd have to pay off. I'm also eligible for a merit scholarship that I plan to put away for emergencies - again, my point being that I am in *no financial danger and never have been*.

I've always managed to stay within budget for food and transportation, so it's not like I've spent too much on a video game and now I can't eat for 2 weeks. I'm good at handling my money, but some tiny part of my brain is yelling at me that I need to save as much as possible or I will simply die. That I should only be allowed the necessities and nothing more and I should just hoard the rest. The level of guilt feels extremely unecessary to me but I just can't shake it. I have no idea where this fear came from, as we've never struggled financially yet I just feel incredibly anxious every time I feel my phone buzz because I've made a transaction.

211,"19, divorced, PTSD, separated from the navy and Borderline Personality Disorder","I was raised in such a way I am considered most at risk for depression and other mental health issues and this entire situation that's accumulated for the last two years of my life has sent me to my worst.

My issues began when my brother sexually assaulted me when I was maybe 10 or 11. I didn't understand it and he probably didn't either, he's only three years older than me. I don't remember much about it as I've blocked out those memories to cope with them. Later in life I was dealing with depression and had a girl I was regularly talking to. My brother was also dealing with depression and drug and alcohol issues, it started when he was arrested with his friends one night and our entire family just got worse. One night my brother was having issues and my dad was fighting him and I went to intervene because it's my two closest friends fighting, my brother ran to his room and I ran to stop him from hurting himself and he fought me, breaking one of my ribs, giving me a concussion and giving me a laceration across my back. I laid on my bed in pain until I heard my brother try to run out of the house and I ran to help him, my dad then threw me and told me to let him go and he's not worth it. not even 20 minutes later I heard the ambulance that was treating my brother for almost killing himself. I cried while I heard the sirens fade away because I felt like I failed him and my family for not saving him from what he had did. My parents bought me a gift to make me feel better about the entire situation saying I was in the most right and deserve better. The girl I was talking to knew the entire situation while it was happening and after hearing about my new gift she said ""I wish my parents beat me and gave me gifts"" and this killed any interest but I still saw good in her despite being such an awful person to me.

I moved on alright with the occasional depressive episodes lasting months and I could never shake the underlying feeling that everyone is good and it's my job to help them see that and to support them. This only caused more issues for me and it brings me to my soon to be exwife. Having PTSD and depression often brought anger issues in me and I hated myself when they came out. I had joined the navy to get a good job to support my wife's interest in going to college and it was amazing until working nearly 16 hours a day five days a week with another 4-8 hours a day on the weekend got to me. I could tell she wasn't happy in our new home across the country, she needed her family, especially that her only father (or even parental) figure was dying due to cancer. And with Covid, she wasn't allowed to see her family due to my orders. I worked countless hours to give her the life she wanted and I was failing, my health was decaying and I got even more work due to it. I remember the last time we watched a show on the couch and I felt at ease with her, and no matter what I did I could not revive those feelings in either of us. One day, the day before a huge day for me, my supervisor calls me into his office and tells me my wife left today and he'd give me a ride home and to take things easy. I brushed it off as a misunderstanding until my closest friend asked what the conversation was about and I couldn't say it, I had to write it and we didn't speak like we used to after that. He walked me out of our building hugged me and said to call him if I need anything. I didn't need anything until I had to wake up in two hours and I had taken muscle relaxers to sleep as I really needed it. I got through the next time with only one break down and everyone supported me, I felt like I could get through today beyond what I had gone through, I was miserably high for most of the day but I got through it. I had to walk over two miles to and from work but I got to listen to music and videos on philosophy. I finally got to the point where we would walk our dog and turn around and I was crying. I called a suicide hotline as I knew that I couldn't take more muscle relaxers and guarantee I would be okay. I asked for my resources but all I got was an ambulance and several phone calls saying I wouldn't be at work and I'm okay.

Going to the hospital I got more depressed, my wife left me two cats for me at home and all I wanted was to lay in bed and see them to get through the day. But I was in the hospital for two weeks with a doctor who convinced me I was trying to kill myself, alone and truly terrified of what would come of my navy career, I accepted what she said. I was vulnerable and alone, she took advantage of that to carry our therapy sessions to what she wanted so she was correct or had found some profound discovery in my already screwed mental status. I got out and everything was actually better, I was in an out patient program and it went very well, I did tons of CBT and it made me happier. I even got to the point of meeting someone new. We both have troubled pasts and both saw some goodness in persevering for each other. I was still on track to completing my two years of training but I was just on a hiatus. She had a daughter and had been taken advantage of by several guys and she would often get so depressed she would tell me she'd kill herself regardless of what I could do. I didn't want to call for professional help for her (as I lived several hours away from her) and she would custody of her daughter so I would do my best to cheer her up and it was working, she was happier until her ex came back into her life. I don't want my words to be taken as what truly happened but his comeback drove her into guilt about seeing me while things weren't clear between them. Our relationship was miserable for her, I, regrettably, pushed our relationship as I would tell her ""no matter what I'll be here to love you for you and everything wonderful you bring to this world"" and when she finally realized that I wouldn't let her suffer she said ""I'm being awful to you... you don't deserve that... I love you... I feel like I'm going crazy.""

She felt better but I went into a recession about everything as my wife finally responded to me and I realized what I had done to her, I felt as I was would never be a good person, I had traumatized her and even pushed our relationship when she was uncomfortable as well. I told my new interest that I saw no future if I can't get better and I feel like I couldn't. She guaranteed to me that she would see that I get better for myself to be able to be truly happy again. In one of those off days we both were not doing okay and I always felt reassured by her texts although simple or cold, I knew she was alive. I told her that I would be more comfortable if she would reply at least twice a day as I didn't know what was going on, she could be in the hospital or off with some guy. That last piece drove her away, I only meant it as my mind wonders to extremes and I doubt anything bad would actually happen my mind would still drive to these extents. She took as me suggesting she was unfaithful and that she should feel awful for not responding.

I'm now here, 5 months since the last time we've spoken, I'm out of the navy, having worsening anger issues due to my entire situation and my family not showing any understanding of what I want. My family says their scared of me and want the old me back but I don't see myself ever being seen as good or happy again. All I want is to have someone understand mental health and pardon it to see that I'm trying to be better, I want to be better, I don't want to live like this anymore.

212,I fell for an alcoholic girl with Borderline Personality Disorder,"Just as the title states. I'm pretty sure i fell in love with a girl who has Borderline Personality Disorder, on top of that she is documented Alcoholic which makes it even more problematic for both of us.

It's gonna be quite a long story and probably just as chaotic but I've finally decided i need at least second opinion how i can help her best.

She is 21 and I'm 26. She caught my eye long time ago but i was too shy to confront her about it. We're working together (or were in the case of global pandemic - we're all working from home now) and somehow we started talking to each other around start of November and connecting closer over Facebook messenger and such, it was lovely, she was quite the talker i was quite the listener and after sometime we decided to meet outside of work for a simple walk, i remember her being nervous about it - we talked about this and she claims she's always nervous when meeting new people, especially men - understandable, due to her illness i respect and understand that, all the more joyous I've been when we finally starting seeing each other on semi-regular basis outside of work. We've both been open to each other from the get go, really, really open. The stories of her abuse she told me, half of them are enough to be too much for a single person. She's been raped when not being able to lift a finger, she has been abused sexually by her past partners and i think the darkest story she told me is about coming back to her rapist house simply because he had a wine. She claims she never wants to be in the place she's been before and i do believe her. I believe her dark past is behind her but she cannot forget, how could she? I personally think it's better she remembers how scary and dark place that is, she will never want to go back to previous behaviors. She's never done drugs from what she told me and i haven't seen her doing any. Obviously she has her mood swing as people with Borderline Personality disorder tend to have, this i have accepted as well, i understand that she sometimes does snap and say things she doesn't truly mean, i could handle it. Back to the topic of us hanging outside of work and on weekends - when we started hanging out she told me about a promise she made to her friend that she will stay away from alcohol until at least Christmas, she snapped around start of December if i remember correctly, starting with just a single beer (i say just but i know whether it's alcohol for alcoholic the amount does not matter). I've been reading about Borderline Personality Disorder just so i can understand and be better at supporting her along the way and i know i shouldn't be judgmental about her behavior and decisions (whether it's bad or good, i know it's not a solution to anything and i told her just that). I told her that i'm there for her, whenever she wants to talk about literally anything, i'll listen, i told her that i might not have all the answers she needs but i will try me best to be supportive in the best way i know how and i mean that. She had and probably still has difficult time believing me and again, i can't blame her given her past stories, she's been abused, used against her will, probably lots and lots of broken promises by the people around her. She often says ""Whatever, people come and go all the time, you're no different do whatever you want"" and I've told her countless times that supporting her is what i **want** to do and what i will try to do. She hates promises which again, is understandable - probably so many broken promises made her aware not to let herself get hurt by another broken promise. After her first alcoholic drink we've been meeting each other as regular, she invited me over to her house where she lives with her (male) friend that supposedly cares for her (makes her food, reminds her about drinking water etc. simple things really). I invited her to mine, just for such a ""stupid"" activities as decorating the Christmas tree (she was so excited about it). We've got more intimate with our relationship - kissing, touching each other, snuggling, hugging etc. And i feel like she trust me a little bit more and actually wants me to be there for her, but the very next day when i invite her over she text me while supposedly being just by my house (for the 2nd time): ""I'm lost"" ""I think i'll go home"" to which i replied ""Wait, i'm coming outside for you"" to which i got ""Do whatever you wanna do"" and i was so confused not knowing what happened - i did walk outside but haven't seen her anywhere. I talked to her about it and she explained me she had extreme anxiety attack, that she felt like a trash. So i explained to her another time that she doesn't have to feel bad about it, i understand, i'm not there to hurt her in anyway, sometime passes and she claim she calmed down a bit and that she ""even had her makeup and hair done"" and i didn't know what to think about it. I asked her whether she wants me to go or stay with her because getting an answer would actually help us both, right? All i got was ""I don't know, i don't want you to go, i don't want to stay - i'm tried when keeping close contact with anyone"". I just don't know how to interpret this, what's the best course of action i should take right now so i can help us both?

&#x200B;

That's for couple of odd situation with her, but i can see her fighting inside, not giving up, i can see the sparkle of light. She's very lovable person, she's passionate about multiple things - comic books for once, she's extremely passionate about Batman, she's great painter I've seen her works, they really are breathtaking, she's beautiful (i tell her that very often, but she tells me she feels ugly and doesn't believe my honest complements)

&#x200B;

She attended therapy for a long time (4 years if i remember correctly) but now due to Covid pandemic she tells me face-to-face meetings with her trusted therapist aren't a thing and she cannot open herself through phone line like that.

&#x200B;

I just don't know what do i do with all this... I really, really fell for her and want to be as supportive as i can get but i simply need some advice how to proceed. What can i do to help her? Ask me anything if it will make more sense, i'm just really helpless right now with the whole situation. I feel like i did everything i could but it's still not enough.

217,Recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.,"I've never been diagnosed with any mental health issues prior to this incident.  


I'm a 26 years old male, teacher. Growing up, I've had few episodes of depression where I've self-harmed, I've had few other self-destructive behaviours. However, recently, I've realised that it had gotten worst. I started having dreams of jumping off from my window (I live on level 12 in an apartment complex, alone). Moreover, on last Saturday, when I was walking through my corridor, I felt so drawn towards the ledge. And I keep contemplating about suicide.  


I know what the trigger is -- it was Facebook and all the nasty comments against LGBTQ. Being raised in Malaysia and raised in a Muslim household, it has been extremely hard for me, especially since I'm in a committed relationship. I have been feeling strongly isolated and detached from everyone and everything. I've been feeling worthless and guilty and ashamed of myself. I couldn't focus on anything work or leisure. I tried to distract myself from the thoughts by going hiking with my colleagues but as soon as I got back, the thoughts of killing myself came back stronger and I felt worst. So I decided to go to the hospital. After being admitted for 1 night, I was discharged as the doctor believed that I pose no risk of self-harm at the moment.   


I was given additional day off from work. However, despite all these, I still feel extremely down. In my lessons today, I keep feeling panicky and my chest started to hurt. I tried the breathing exercise but it felt like it didnt help.

218,‚ÄúBreak Ups‚Äù: a story told by Borderline Personality Disorder,"
29yr old F - bipolar 2 with BPD. there‚Äôs posts out there about people dealing with the borderlines in their lives. there are very few posts out there from the borderline‚Äôs perspective.

here‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like: my boyfriend broke up with me after a year of your typical bpd lying, manipulation, and extreme emotions. i struggle badly with dissociation and half the time couldn‚Äôt own up to doing these things because i genuinely don‚Äôt remember it. anyways, he gets tired of it and bails. everything shatters. and i mean everything. i am completely broken. i am drowning.

switch now i‚Äôm full blown manic. two days later i download tinder. try to find his one friend who i know is on it, this is the best idea i‚Äôve ever had. this makes so much sense. i should fuck his friend, i just want to hurt him because he hurt me. match with his friend. get a text from the ex about it. now he‚Äôs just mad and i look crazy. he proceeds to take the day shouting at me for downloading tinder so soon and for trying to fuck his friend. i am malicious. i am manipulative. 

my cousin‚Äôs girlfriend, sets herself on fire in a hotel parking lot. i get scared because not much separates me from her except one extreme emotion. i‚Äôm full of extreme emotions. i begin an IOP, start lamictal. 4 days of therapy 7 days of meds. i can‚Äôt tell if i‚Äôm starting to get depressed or if this is just how normal people feel. i have no mood fluctuations, i just exist. i text my ex this. ‚ÄúIM CHANGING‚Äù i internally scream. he just wants his stuff back.

i go to drop off his stuff. purposely wait until after 11pm so i can try and plug in a ‚Äúcan i stay over, it‚Äôs too late to find street parking by my house now.‚Äù we have sex, i stay the weekend. he makes me breakfast and i go to rite aid to get us drinks. i know his favorite morning drink, i don‚Äôt even have to ask. i am truly the only person capable of loving him this good. i am elated. i am back baby! i am the king of new york! literally no one in human history has ever been this good! he tells me i have to go home because he has a show to go to. i cry. i cry several times. i physically can‚Äôt let go of him. i am clinging to him. if i step foot outside this apartment i know i will never be let back in. i am malicious, manipulative.

i ask him to go ice skating the following day. no response. ok that‚Äôs fine, i‚Äôve been practicing mindfulness. i got this. people get busy. i text him again the day after that. no response. i go up a dose on lamictal, i stay up later each night. sending a single text. checking instagram every 3-5 minutes to see if he‚Äôs been online. if he‚Äôs been online, then why can‚Äôt he answer my text? whose this girl he started following on instagram? she‚Äôs cute. i‚Äôll check her profile every 3-5 minutes. oh she posted a story? it‚Äôs her and my ex playing games at dave and busters. what the fuck. what the fuck. 

i start to not eat much, i don‚Äôt need it. i‚Äôm psychically not hungry. i order mozzie sticks at work during my 11 hour shift, i have one. i‚Äôm full. i start to panic. so begins lamictal induces mania. i text my ex ‚Äúif i get off this couch right now i‚Äôm going to kill myself‚Äù. it‚Äôs true, i will do it. he doesn‚Äôt respond. i stay on the couch for 3 full days before taking myself back down to my original lamictal dose. i keep checking her instagram for more stories of him. i am malicious and manipulative. 

a day or so later, coworker texts me a screenshot of a tinder profile. ‚Äúisn‚Äôt this your ex?‚Äù. sure is. after he gave me shit for having a tinder so many moons ago, i am enraged. i search instagram far and wide for the girl of his dreams. i download tinder. armed with another beautiful girl‚Äôs photos i swipe furiously until i find him. ‚Äúsuper like‚Äù. we match. or should i say ‚Äúellen‚Äù and him match. we talk. we chat. i ask him all the things i‚Äôve been dying to ask him since seeing him last. we set up a date. a dive bar by my house. after a few days of talking he has softened me. i‚Äôm no longer angry, i want to be his savior. i‚Äôll show up to the dive bar. after he gets stood up, i‚Äôll be there. to take care of him. i am the only person in the world capable of loving him. he ends up bailing on my catfish date. i am broken. i am shattered. i am malicious, manipulative. 

my IOP wraps up. i‚Äôm left alone. from 4 days of intensive therapy to being completely alone. over this 2 month journey i‚Äôve isolated enough to convince myself that my ex is the only one i can depend on. no one not a single soul will ever love me like he did. despite the texts i receive throughout the week of people checking in on me. i tell him i say ‚Äúi can‚Äôt set this boundary, i need you to set me free. i‚Äôm not strong enough to do it‚Äù. he tells me ‚Äúi have no intention of getting back together with you‚Äù. i am broken and incomplete. i am drowning and i am scared. my chest hurts. i am physically shattered. but taking my therapy seriously. i need to respect him. 

it‚Äôs been 2.5 months since the breakup and i still have to repeat out loud to myself every single night to leave him alone. to not check his instagram. to not text him. to stop manipulating him, whether for good or bad. i do my DBT workbook. i bought an indoor exercise bike. i‚Äôve been trying to find the good in it. to focus on me. 

but fuck, finding myself will never feel as good as finding someone else.
