0,Recently Diagnosed BPD,"I am a 34 M recently diagnosed with BPD. I’ve known that I’ve had PTSD, but the BPD diagnosis was new... and hard to accept. Reading about Quiet BPD seemed to describe me almost perfectly. I’ve changed meds several times in the past 6 months and I am starting DBT. Any advice with meds or therapy would be appreciated.",1576256010.0,False,33,13,GreedyHomeless,None,ea6i4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietBPD/comments/ea6i4a/recently_diagnosed_bpd/
