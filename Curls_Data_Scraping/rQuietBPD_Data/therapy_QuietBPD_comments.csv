0,"I was just diagnosed as well.  I am a 44 F.  Also Adhd.  Lexapro, focalin and then tamazapm has helped tremendously.  I never understood why I was so weird around other people I just felt odd out of place and never understood myself around others. Why I would react a certain way? I don’t think I’ll ever figure it out. All I can do is educate myself about qbpd and continue on my journey.  Appreciate this sub ✌️",,ea6i4a
1,"I felt the same when reading the symptoms of it. I’m not diagnosed, currently being treated as complex ptsd, but so many of the important symptoms seem overlapped. 
Have you struggled being able to recognize what you’re feeling and never seem to be able to communicate it leading to constantly feeling misunderstood?

My only worry about this being another wrong turn for me is that I don’t seem to experience anger, haven’t for years, but I think I may have just masked and muted it for years. I was an angry teen, but as I grew (I’m 6’3” athletic build, though far from athletic anymore lol) I feared scaring people and I do feel I have a kind heart that I began directing it inward then shutting it out almost entirely (or possibly burned out by a serious relationship with my ex who had typical bpd) but I noticed my anger does seep through when journaling/writing. 

Sorry just started to see the possibility of quiet bpd being behind my struggles so head is all over the place. 

I hope the diagnosis has brought you some relief just in itself from finally having an answer to why you’ve felt so out of place/broken and are able to get the right treatment to help you reclaim your life 😊",Standard-Holiday-486,ea6i4a

I hope you check back here- would be curious what worked well for you.",Arlyeon,ea6i4a
4,My dad has bpd and is on meds and has had therapy and is doing pretty well. It’s nothing to be ashamed of and if you ever need an online friend I’d be happy to chat :),IndividualChart6016,ea6i4a
5,You've got to be careful about the anger you're experiencing. The anger in stuff is quite hard to manage,,ea6i4a
6,Zoloft works great for me. Grounds me and keeps me calm. Heaven sent but it shrinks my dick no joke. Turns it into a cocaine penis…,crossoverinto,ea6i4a
7,"I’m 44 as well. 
First, I’m glad that you finally have some answers and still exhibit such an admirable mindset after what I’m sure hasn’t been an easy journey. 

I was wondering if you had spent most of your life being diagnosed seemingly everything in the dsm and wondering why none of the treatments seem to ever really fix anything?

And also wanted to ask how your treatment has been going, and have you noticed much of a positive impact in your life? (Also I guess what the approach they’ve taken has been for therapy)

I worry that even if I find the answers I’ve spent half my life looking for, guess I’m afraid of how much of a difference it can make in terms of quality of life going forward. I was engaged but that fell apart a couple years ago, I’m still recovering from that, so I’d basically be restarting my life if I ever figure out why I’m broken, but guess I’m afraid that so much of my life has passed me by and don’t have to show for it, and nothing much from to build upon?

I realize your situation may be entirely different, but that 44 and just diagnosed jumped out at me so was wondering how it’s made a difference for you.",Standard-Holiday-486,ea6i4a
8,Also just started RODBT group therapy. I don’t really like it. Would rather one on one,crossoverinto,ea6i4a
9,I took Zoloft for a week and was not cool with that bs. They wouldn’t prescribe klonopin long term so I’m unmediated,Weird_Entrepreneur_6,ea6i4a
