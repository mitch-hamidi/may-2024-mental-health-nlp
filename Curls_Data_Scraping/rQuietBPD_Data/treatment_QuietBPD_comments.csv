3,"I don't have a suggestion, but following in case there is one. Everything is so focused on acute-crisis, recently diagnosed, classic (rage) borderline. I'm 8yrs into recovery. That type of literature is not helpful and doesn't even come close to representing where I'm at and how I present.

And as a side not ""I Hate You, Don't Leave Me"" is one of the worst. It's so nasty about us. Painting us as intentionally manipulative and just plain awful. My parents bought it when I was diagnosed around 13, I didn't read it until about 25. That's when I realized that's why they accused me of just trying to constantly manipulate them. I love my parents, we have a good relationship now, but at the end of the day THEY ARE THE REASON I HAVE BPD. They have absolutely no awareness of this (that's okay, they don't need to for me to heal). I would guess that at least one of the authors of this book has a BPD child and was (hopefully unintentionally) deflecting blame about their part in causing it.",myholelove,huocc3
4,"It's quite difficult to find books, but I've found a Youtube resource in Dr. Ramani's work as well as the collaborations she works with on MedCircle. Both are Youtube channels that I have found very informative :)",Original_Average_882,huocc3

6,"“The metaphor of play. Disruption and Restoration of the Borderline Experience” and  “Intimacy and Alienation: Memory, Trauma and Personal Being” both by Russell Meares.

Edit: I’ve only read the first one so far. Written by a psychiatrist but the language is accessible and in my opinion a must read for anyone interested in understanding BPD.",Wide-Lavishness-6591,huocc3

9,"Okay thank you so much for this. I was headed in thinking that my husband has quiet BPD but reading this, I see they’re often misdiagnosed as that. I will read through this site. Very helpful.",mishael53,huocc3

11,Oh dear I didn’t realize that book was so accusatory I just hear it recommended.  Does the author even have bpd?,JellyfishinaSkirt,huocc3
12,That's a terrible experience and like you say adds a lot of shame. Where are you based? I think in the UK they won't diagnose BPD until 18 although I'm not sure why if it means early access to treatment,Entrance-Public,huocc3
