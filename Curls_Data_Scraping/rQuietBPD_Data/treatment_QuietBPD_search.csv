0,Quiet BPD books for spouse,"I know this is SUPER far fetched, but I had seen the BPD From the Husband's POV book for spouses, but in reading about it, it's more focused on the person with Rage BPD. I don't throw things, punch walls, spend extravagantly, etc. Maybe I'm just that far into treatment, but I never raged. I want to find a book or resource for my spouse about Quiet BPD, the insecurity, the black/white thinking, etc that is more typical of people with Quiet BPD. Anyone have any resources for this?

TIA

Edit 1: so many people saying “I Hate You, Don’t Leave Me” however, this is still directed for those with Rage BPD, not Quiet BPD. It’s also a very demoralizing book that I don’t recommend. No one needs that kind of shame in their life.",1595262540.0,False,78,17,miss80five,None,huocc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietBPD/comments/huocc3/quiet_bpd_books_for_spouse/
