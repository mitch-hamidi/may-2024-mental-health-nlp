1,"Don’t give up. Working in bettering yourself is always worth it. As you heal, you’ll find more friends that will meet you where you’re at while you’re on your journey. Sometimes we find fair-weather friends, and they only serve a purpose in our life to make us see what we don’t want in a friendship. I know it’s hurtful, I’ve been where you’re at, but I promise you’ll find even better friends in the future.

1,"What you have isn't always connected to your happiness. That's not how emotions work often times.

I will say that all of those people think you're deserving of recovery and so do I, and so will a lot of people here.

As someone getting closer and closer to remission every day, I've been where you are, and even to just where I am now, it was worth everything.

Treat yourself with kindness and try to let go of the shoulds and woulds. You just are where you are now, and you can take the steps to work towards recovery. It's not quick or easy, so it's okay to take some time to breathe before. And it's okay to pace yourself.

(If inpatient is too daunting, you might feel more comfortable with a Partial Hospital Program or an Intensive Outpatient Program if there's one available. Both have much of the same service and therapies as inpatient, but you can go home at the end of the day to be with your loved ones.)

0," I’m a former BPD. Specifically, I fell into the subtype of a Petulant BPD. It was so bad it landed me in mental health hospitalizations repeatedly and jail at one point. 

Since then, I have become a therapist. I got a Master’s degree in Social Work and now I’m a licensed clinical psychotherapist that works and treats people with BPD. 

As someone who has recovered and no longer meets criteria, I try to give my patients the exact roadmap they need to follow to see the same results. When working with BPDs, they see me twice a week (if not in a DBT skills training group); one session for CBT-focused psychotherapy, and one session for strictly DBT skills training, which is more like tutoring than therapy. 

I’m currently designing an online course of the DBT skills training. I’m almost done recording the first module. If you’re interested in accessing it once I’ve got everything set up, let me know.",tpavy,1cg336z
1,"dbt was great but mostly i had to go past my edge and discover a mix of rhings that works for me, rather than curing myself of bpd. fibdibg space from the pathology helped a LOT. it’s challenging but self love, which took me many years to develop, is the best shit. i just dont care about shit hitting the fan when it does or getting pooped on or getting angry, because i know i’ll get through it, and i love that about myself.",crazysexypsychic___,1cg336z

0,"recovery is a process of improving a condition.

remission is a temporary or permanent status where someone does not meet the criteria for a disorder or condition. 

For most people, some symptoms improve and others are harder to change.

3,"🤔While I was able to abstract the possibilities from twelve steps I struggled with the hard judgement that many of the people who practiced them had, especially towards people from different backgrounds and those who were on medication, for anything mental, which was strange to me. Or anything related to painkillers regardless of how much pain they were in. I hated that, actually. But the problem with people wasn't anything to do with the steps themselves, which is why I started to write the guides which I would wind up publishing, and then I started publishing other work, and it was therapeutic in its own way.🎙️

However, i have recovered from severe relationship trauma and gotten a good enough handle on my bpd symptoms that i can now be an emotionally mature and mostly stable partner for someone. The change in me has been tremendous, from 4 years of work, several DBT programs, hours and hours of 1-on-1 therapy, psychedelic therapy. When i talk to my female friends about their male suitors or partners it's easy for me to see that I actually do bring a lot to the table in spite of the bpd (and other mental issues i have).

I spent a few years working on myself, going to therapy and was generally a recluse. I didn't trust myself around people and I didn't trust them not to hurt me. 

After years of intense DBT therapy with the best therapist I have ever met, where I had to be brutally honest and confront a lot of the distress and pain of my past (both caused by me and some that just happened to me) I am finally in a stable loving relationship of 5 years, I haven't had a meltdown in months and when I do I am able to pick myself up and my therapist suspects I may not even qualify under the criteria for the diagnosis all the time anymore. I am the happiest I have ever been and finally look forward to the future and living my life.

3,"True, there is evidence that genetically, our predisposition to develop a disorder is higher if a parent or family member suffered from a similar disorder.

Interestingly, When we look at heredity, we look for it as a likelihood for those traits to develop. A propensity for the behaviors to arise and for markers to effectively flip certain genes in order to create presentation of symptoms. Imagine it as a propensity for a specific type of response to trauma, when severe trauma arises, we can expect behavioral and cognitive responses similar to that which has been displayed as functional within our environment. 

In the case where our environment and subsequently our methods of coping are outlined by another individual which has maladapted methods of coping, we are constantly being reinforced with their line of thinking and their sense of appropriate reaction to stressful environments. We have a misguided set of rules to represent how to properly behave. Our physiological and psychological needs still need to be met, however.

Being guided by our parents preconceptions as a child limits our effective methods of coping. If we need the emotional release of crying, but we are taught not too, we need another form of emotional outlet that allows for relief in a similar way. We won't always get that opportunity, especially when our parents are having difficulties of their own. This scenario is were we can expect to see the onset of novel behaviors as the caretakers are limiting and redirecting emotional responses.

That's not to say it's their fault or anything, just that sometimes the methods parents or adults use really really don't click with us and it causes a lot of damage. They're doing their best, but it happens. 

I believe genetics play a role as markers or propensity for illness of a specific type, but more so that they are strong indicators that our stress and trauma responses will be comparable with others that shared that genetic makeup. Subsequently, the reinforcement of genetic predisposition leads to a much higher propensity for genetic illness, but that has to be retrospectively identified.

I definitely agree, so thanks for your comment!",Perma_SSBM,10mof2e

7,"I completely feel this!!!!!

Ive recently been diagnosed with BPD myself. I also was diagnosed with cPTSD at the age of 16 due to traumatic events I never got help with nor closure with. I’m 28 now, so the majority of my life prior to this year being diagnosed, my emotional displacements and irregularities have been the most challenging aspect of my life. My unstable development and unsupportive environment was also a huge catalyst to my mental health condition worsening. 

I’ve been doing therapy for almost a year now. Mind you, I haven’t been in therapy since I was 17 (10+ years ago). I have been dealing with the near same exact feelings you yourself have.

1. Wanting a calm and stress-free environment to ensure my “stability” moreso.
2. Going two steps up, just to be knocked back ten steps down when depression, stress, and or triggers occur through events that are difficult for myself.
3. Being fearful of moving forward with myself in life, all while knowing I have the competency and capacity to do so. It’s just the fears of the “what ifs” or dwelling on past things that can “pause” me into a state of feeling like “I can’t”. 

I’ve mentioned these issues with my therapist about four months ago, because my life felt as if it was going down-down. I had less emotional resilience to my triggers, developed more bad habits that contributed to my depression/anger/anxiety, and just had this massive dissociation overall with myself. I saw that psychotherapy would be recommended in my situation. I mentioned it to my therapist and she completely agreed and was happy to see that I’m taking initiative to myself.

She recommended Dialectal Behavior Therapy to start with. Gave me a book for it too. I read it from time to time, take notes, apply the practice and reflect on it with her. I’ve been seeing a huge difference in how I regulate my feelings. Before DBT, I would always fester into my feelings and argue about things such as unjustly and irrational treatment I received from people and family, people contradicting themselves while having high expectations from me, dwelling on trauma in an unhealthy way, etc. This process so far with DBT has been teaching me how to understand my triggers and how to mitigate my reactions from them, building better resiliences mentally for it all. As well as truly understanding these feelings and why I process these feeling so intensely, it all can stem from something. It also has been teaching me how to let go of the “control factor” for life, even if I am being completely rational with these expectations; learning that I only have control in MY life.

Examples of things that are IN control of my life:
1. The amount of effort I put in
2. My words
3. My actions
4. How I treat others
5. Whether or not I follow rules
6. How I handle my feelings
7. My decisions
8. How I take care of myself

Examples of things that are OUT of my control:
1. What other people do
2. What other people say
3. Things from the past
4. How other people feel
5. Other people’s choices
6. The weather (lol)

My overall opinion about DBT, I would say I’ve made massive steps and strides with myself. I’m reprogramming myself in positive ways. I’m able to stay in the “now” without worrying about the future nor dwelling in the past as much. I’m able to process my feelings better and catch myself when I’m starting to “rev up” into my emotions when something triggers me. I’m being more active and forcing routine into my life to have better and healthier coping strategies, as well as learning new coping and soothing strategies to avoid emotional displacements and irrational choice making. It’s been unreal to be honest. My family sees a difference in me too, which they are happy about. Sure my days aren’t always perfect, there will be slip ups. But it’s about the bounce back and refocus. Acknowledge the error, move on and make a valiant effort into doing better the next time! This is where I feel the quote, “You’re only human” comes into play healthily. 

I would recommend a therapist and psychiatrist to see what you would personally need to help with your issues. And I wish you and everyone else who struggles with BPD nothing but the best!",HemloStimky,1cqz7t3

The abuser steals potential lives.  Everything such children might have been capable of doing becomes dislodged and evaporates.  It is rare that such children receive the kind of decent help that might give them a shot at reclaiming any of that potential.

Basically really understanding how I was shaped through relationships and where my current struggles stem from.

Its written by someone who fully recovered. I've read a few of the books he mentions on this blogs, and they also contain several case studies from other people who also recovered.

Beyond that, therapy can certainly help with moderating your impulses and learning better coping skills.

Yes, things are hard for you and the people in your life, but you have to keep working on yourself. You owe that to yourself and to the people who love you. We have BPD, and it is ok to feel sorry for ourselves from time to time, and can be difficult to accept. However, at the end of the day everybody faces challenges, some bigger some smaller, and everyone has something about themselves they need to work on. Your life can and will be so much more than livable!

As horrible as our self-awareness can feel, it also serves a purpose to break cycles. Regret and guilt reminds us how we could have done better, but it also  shows where we went wrong and how to do better moving forward.

Also there is absolutely no shame in learning to help yourself while wanting to help others. It’s like the saying you can’t fill others cups if yours is empty.

I’ve notice how much more extreme my emotions are.. the amount of energy I have put into relationships ending , the embarrassing ways I’ve reacted.. 

This has opened up new emotions and feelings which I don’t like.. I hate thinking about the way I act and react.. as I feel ashamed..  but I suppose identifying this is the first step to changing.. or at least I hope so!

Time has been a big one.  Time opens up possibility.  I try to be honest in my self awareness.  I don’t always like what I see, but if I can’t accept there is a problem, I will never try to fix it.  I have a pretty good support network.  I’ve gotten pretty effective at abiding by the boundaries that I set.  I’ve sworn off romantic relationships.  I’ve made spirituality an important part of my life.  I’ve also had some help from medication.  One of the biggest problems that I’ve faced is my anger.  I have no doubt that most of my problems are a direct result of Borderline, but I also have some Antisocial traits.  I’ve never really had to pull strings from the shadows because I’ve always just kinda brute forced any problems.  I guess doling out that kind of fear is a type of manipulation.  Consequences feel kind of abstract to me.  I’ve never really been able rationalize them.  I mean, I don’t want to end up in prison or dead one day, but it’s really about as insignificant to me as eating a food that I don’t really like.  It won’t derail me and it doesn’t scare me.  It’s made it hell to look past that and find reason to my existence.  I do find reason in my children, though.  I sometimes remind myself that phone calls from jail are expensive.  It helps.  I appreciate compassion and forgiveness.  I try to associate with people that exhibit those qualities because it helps me exhibit them.  I don’t feel as angry as I did when I was younger.

1,"Definitely.

While I just overthink a lot of the times,my constant self reflecting has definitely brought me into a better spot.I still get overwhelmed by my feelings,since we just cant change the intensity, I still cant manage my immediate reactions,but I calm down much quicker now and Im able to have a much more logical approach when trying to figure things out.  
Biggest Improvement for me was now actually being able to tell that Im not in love, I still feel the obsession,still feel the craving,but atleast im able to question it and that was a big fking step for me. Im less toxic with my feelings,not lashing out at my fp,which was important to me. Even tho Im probably not talking enough about my problems now,but thats a different construction side.

overall it doesnt always help,I still struggle with breakdowns,moodswings,attachment,selfimage n shit,selfharm,suicial thoughts,but I bounce back a bit easier, im a bit more stable overall and Im sure my knowledge will help me bit by bit over time. I feel like self reflecting is most crucial for people with bpd to healthily deal with the different situations over time, it just kinda building that logical voice in the back of your mind and when shit gets wild,maybe you will be able to hear it and talk yourself out of that emotional state easier if that makes sense?

I still have so many problems and all of this often feels pointless at times, but objectively I know I made a lot of progress,even tho theres still still so much to tackle.

The stable, good feeling is not in and of itself going to lead to any sort of downfall. But... realistically of course we all have ups and downs in life, even the most historically stable people do. So this probably won't last forever, and THAT'S OK.

When you let go of control of it having to last forever, or fear that it won't, perhaps you can relax into it a bit more and enjoy it while it's here. It's a nice sunny day. Maybe a sunny week, maybe a sunny month or even several months. (metaphorically!)

So, don't waste that sunshine worrying about the next bad weather. Take it in while it's here.

0,"Honestly, this may sound harsh but you need to put yourself first. Tell her to her face, that if she continues to talk about this stuff in front of you you won't be able to continue the friendship. Because ultimately, there is nothing you can do that is going to stop her, just like no one could have stopped you. You are not a therapist, and you can not put that responsibility on your shoulders. I've had two best friends with anna, I've struggled myself and at the end of the day, she's going to do what she wants but those are her mistakes to make, and that sucks, I know. All you can do, is tell her how concerned you are, that you love her and that you want her to be healthy, even offer if you feel like it, to help her work out a healer way of losing weight. But, also tell her that she's triggering you, that you can't listen to this or you'll fall back into your eating disorder. If she loves you and cares about you and has the maturity to do those things, she will respect the boundary. If not, then you're going to have to make some pretty tough choices, including walking away.

Because really, if you can't put yourself at the center of your universe, you'll never be able to help her. Stay healthy and stay strong, and if she eventually approaches you for help, you'll be in a space to give it. Rather than just ending up with two girls with active eating disorders triggering and enabling each other.",,shawx1
1,"Thank you so much for your input. She hasn't really dealt with the ana part much I don't think, her history moreso involved binge eating disorder when she was younger. This all conspired because she was talking about what she's been doing and with her autoimmune issues, it's terrible for her. It's already hell on a healthy persons body. But she is so deadset that she is overweight enough that it doesn't matter, I don't think she's been exposed to that part of the community. I've seen so many people tell others that their illness is invalid because of the weight they're at, and she's doing it to herself. It just is really hard. I made the mistake of not asking if she wanted my advice and was just trying to inform her of the things I've come to know after years of exposure to others with it and their experiences, was on ED tumblr for a very long time, and was shut down so much it really started to get to me. I told her later when she continued that it was triggering me, but it was turned around on me that it shouldn't be, she's just talking about what's going on in her life and that what she's doing is completely normal because she needs to lose weight. And like I said, she's my husbands sister but my absolute best friend in the world now, and we live together. So it's just very hard.

So yes, it is absolutely possible to be in a healthy relationship while recovering, especially if you have a partner that's so willing to work on it with you! If he's supportive and willing to work with you, it doesn't sound like you're a burden at all, it sounds like he loves you.

PS: I am still recovering and I'm in a happy, healthy, safe and supportive relationship. I feel the same way you do sometimes, but learn to believe your partner when they tell you they love you, that you are NOT a burden, and they want to be there for you.",,ogymvp

The best advice I can say is keep getting help, find a passion to focus on that can pull you through your episodes and always tell your SO that you love them no matter what. Reassure them how much you love them. That will keep the fire in their heart burning stronger each day. Even when we are near burnout just hearing you say how much we mean to you is a big fuel for our love. Times get tough and it gets dark but there is always a light somewhere.

Diagnosed with BPD in sobriety. I knew I struggled immensely with my emotions. I want to ask... have you hopped from home group to home group b/c you start suspecting they don’t really want you among their fellowship? Have you ever been asked to leave a group (I have). I get insecure, jealous of the friendships I see going on all around me, and resentful because my numerous efforts to be a part of it are met with indifference. I find myself hating the group to the point of lashing out with snide comments or angry, accusatory texts (sometimes group texts). I quit and drift to another group until I feel like I’ve about worn out my welcome. Lately it’s been suggested I’m a “dry” drunk and maybe wouldn’t be so miserable if I just drank. I replied that I’ve been sober far longer than the person who suggested it, so they’ve never seen me drunk, and if they did see what a danger to myself and society I present while on a binge they’d know that’s the stupidest goddam thing I’ve heard in a while. 

This pattern has repeated itself in church, at work, and in my social circles all my adult life. I’m 54 years old and have no close, lifelong friends. Seeing others celebrate with one another makes my stomach flutter with insecurity. The Steps have done some good, and for a while I was sponsoring 8 or 10 guys and felt connected, almost happy. Then poor judgment and an impulsive decision caused me to commit sexual indiscretions that made me feel like a hypocrite. I did a 5th Step and have regretted it ever since. I am sure that efforts are made to keep me from participating in retreats, which cause no end of resentment and self-pity, and the cycle continues. I feel hopeless. I am a lost cause.",,ncl5er

Edit: Found more key information.

> To reiterate, mentalizing is not only something we do; it is also something we can fail to do. Interacting in the mentalizing mode, we aspire to understand each other as autonomous persons and to influence each other on the basis of our understanding. In the nonmentalizing mode, we can dehumanize and treat each other as objects, becoming coercive and controlling. Mentalizing, we can persuade another person to step aside; failing to mentalize, we can nudge him or her aside.

But yes, i used to get really drawn to unavailable people, slightly erratic, i would try to fight for their love, validation, need for them to come around to like me, to want something with me. Most likely mimicking my childhood in a way, my parents were disinterested in me and i used to try and earn their love with drawing ect. I'd push, for something that wouldn't be possible, losing my cool and feeling like i was going to practically die whenever it wasn't available. But being addicted to it and not able to stop myself from almost getting ""high"" of the sensations, convincing myself that it was proof i was alive as otherwise i was numb and bored. Getting stressed out to points of dissociation, watching things from a third perspective or losing time, lashing out, not being able to drop arguments that have been apologized for

Then being with another person with bpd, at first it was incredible, the mutual extreme affection, the way we understood the emotion pain of everything, despite at the time both being undiagnosed. Until we started to feel abandoned, left out, nervous. Then i'd lash out, he'd lash out back, and we'd be in this cycle of triggering ourselves often.

A person with BPD can be a murderer, or can be a non-murderer.

What we have doesn't determine what we do. Perhaps people with BPD who aren't healed really can accidentally abuse another person, and now that I am aware of my BPD, I realize that I have literally ""accidentally"" use another person. Those people with BPD who are hurting others don't realize they are doing it, but if people feel hurt by them then they deserve to be heard as well. Most people with BPD were abused seriously and that is why they do it to others. 

I know people have a tendency to lump all people with BPD together, and I just kind of ignore people who say that people with BPD ruin their lives. Maybe it does happen but it's not my concern because all it's going to do is drag me down.

4,"I find struggles to relate to the term ""remission"" being used for BPD. It's not cancer or some other terminal disease. It's being treated and maintained, and you've developed coping mechanisms to handle it. We are not cured when we are stable. It only takes a small amount of extended stress and trauma to bring all that back up to the surface, where we then go through our tools, health professionals, and medications to return to a stable place. I understand that this may just be my opinion, and of course, you're welcome to use whatever terminology you feel like using. However, I feel like we should become more accepting of the idea of replacing the word ""remission"" with ""stabilized"" when it comes to mental health conditions as it's simply more accurate.

I don’t know if you have a professional background or schooling in psychology and/or psychiatry. But I would caution you against putting out information on diagnostic criteria and any kind of perceived sample of DBT. It takes a long time for a mental

24,"Do you think a trigger warning is necessary any time I mention the idea of suicidal thoughts or self harm, even with no description or detail? For example, just saying ""I used to not want to exist,"" or, in my video specifically breaking down the DSM-5 criteria, saying that suicidal gestures and self harm is one of the 9 diagnostic symptoms - I don't talk about methods or anything graphic. Or in my intro to DBT video, I talked about Marsha Linehan developing DBT because she was working with highly suicidal patients and found that CBT didn't work with them - and that she has come out about her own background as once being highly suicidal herself. But I went into no detail about what that entailed or looked liked for her or her patients.

I'm curious to hear what others think on this subject, but we may differ in opinions. I do think if I talk in any depth or detail on these subjects, even something like me mentioning my relapse although I didn't get into much detail (which is why I didn't think of it at the time), then yes a trigger warning is appropriate and I will definitely consider that more carefully going forward. But I don't think saying something like ""I used to not want to exist"" or ""self harm is a reality for many pwBPD"" or ""I had an eating disorder"" without more depth or detail warrants a trigger warning - at that point, where is the line?

Notes: Buspar needs to be taken constantly and you can't miss it, you will know if you miss it. It also needs you to have some food otherwise you can become nauseous, I throw up personally if I don't eat and I take Buspar.

The 10 mg didn't help me much, being honest I was on fluxotine or however you spell it. I was irritated all the time and had all it's bad side effects. Once I stopped fluxotine i was a bit better, but then sophomore year came in 2020 (covid)
I was always stressed and even the 10mg wasn't enough
It took a month to two months after being on 20 mg to tell psychiatrist needed a bit more support and so I went to 30 mg
On 30 mg I felt what someone would say is normal. I still have panic attacks and anxiety, but they are mich more controlled with how long they occur for.
Now they last 10-15 min instead of 40 min to three hours.
Overall it took a while to have the right dosage for me, but I felt after a few weeks on 30 mg much better

I don’t pay for medication. Reconsider the fact that only Americans and only those without insurance do, and the 45 year old white woman living in my town of 3k people isn’t making money from prescribing me Effexor. 

We found out like a week ago that the covid tests used in Canada didn’t work lol, it took less than 2 years for that to come out. As a scientist I simply don’t believe the fear-mongering about meds not working. 

Good for you truly for having something that works. Clearly you don’t have substance abuse disorder like around half of people with BPD do have (or at least not with weed). Weed absolutely was the thing holding me back lol it gave me psychosis and panic attacks and I _still used it daily_ until I had no life, no friends, failed out of university, and went broke. That is exactly the definition of addiction btw. 

It _should_ be prescribed for certain things, but also there’s very little replicable research on the topic. For reference, my dad takes it (prescribed) for physical pain. Mental pain isn’t studied quite as well. 

You can smoke weed. Nobody cares. The problem is denying that some people feel negative effects. It’s shitty and simply wrong.",gospelofrage,18ovji2

Benzos are like drunkenness in a pill, it doesn't matter what the reason for taking them is, the effect is the same. Instant euphoria. Kids were popping them like candy when I was in high school 25 years ago. It wasn't hit-or-miss as to who could get high off of them, it had a 100% success rate.

The woman in your town probably makes money however she can, and if that means prescribing enough Pristiq to get a ""paid lecture"" at a Pfizer event, maybe she does that. You wouldn't know. My point is that all psychiatrists are as good as compromised, you can't just blindly take their advice on meds without skepticism if you want to find the right treatment.

0,"In my opinion, BPD is something that we will continually have to work on and doesn’t just go away, but when the symptoms are bearable/manageable, and we can identify bad habits/cognitive distortions and learn how to cope effectively, I think that’s a great achievement and can possibly be viewed as some kind of “recovery “.

Of course, we can all backslide, and coping skills still have to be practiced, but I think the idea of recovery is feasible and something to proactively work towards.

It’s been my experience that meds help with some of the depression and anxiety. I still feel empty at times but try to shift my focus away from that. I don’t think I can ever reconcile my ambivalence and expect to flip-flop and over analyze everything  but that’s just something I’ve had to accept. I still split but my awareness of it has made me consciously take a step back, don’t fixate on those relationships, and come back to them later.

12,"There's a number of ways of being recovered, I guess:

1. No longer meeting the ""trait"" criteria for BPD
2. No longer having disturbances in the self (self-image and self-direction) or in relationships (empathy and intimacy)
3. No longer having functional disruptions (e.g. in romantic relationships, social life, work, self-care...)

Each of them would have their merits and pitfalls depending on what you're trying to measure.

Personality disorders in general are particularly nightmarish for this because someone could be perfectly functional and have a coherent sense of self and be capable of empathy and of establishing intimate relationships and still have a personality disorder - the need to diagnose them as such coming from their effect on other people (presumably destructive, as, in the case to the contrary, there really is no reason to label them with any disorder) - however, BPD is somewhat saved from this confusing mess by (usually) being egodystonic among other things. That is, it's really hard to imagine someone who has BPD yet has a coherent sense of self AND has successful intimate relationships. 

With BPD I would go for a broad mixture of 2 and 3. For other PDs (and this is when we acknowledge that most people with BPD have another PD as well) it is probably more important (in comparison to BPD) to consider the trait criteria for that PD.",Quinlov,tw3fsz
13,"I hate that when I occasionally feel functional and “recovered”, I start to feel like something is missing. As if my whole identity revolves around BPD symptoms.",Fantastic-Evidence75,tw3fsz
14,"In my opinion, BPD is pretty much a lifelong thing, so there is nothing we can do to make it completely disappear. But we can practice coping mechanisms to help manage our feelings, thoughts, & actions. After persistent practice of those healthy coping skills, the frequency & severity of the symptoms will lessen more & more over time. The symptoms won’t be nonexistent, we’ll still have thoughts, feelings, urges, & triggers, but they will be easier to deal with & we may even come off as an emotionally healthy person to others. That’s what I would consider “recovered.”

Edit- Usually when consistently practicing recovering from BPD, the pwBPD may feel relieved or accomplished. They are learning to regain control of their thoughts, feelings, behavior, & actions, rather than the symptoms having control of them. With that control, they may feel at peace more often, & impulsive behaviors or irrational actions become less frequent, so negative consequences resulting from those behaviors become less frequent as well. It definitely takes some practice, as your brain has been accustomed to work the way it does, so you have to retrain your brain to act differently until that becomes habit. It takes a lot of work & time—recovery of any type pays off well but it is not easy.",psychmonkies,tw3fsz
15,"Dear willothewispy

I feel you so much. I am a quiet BPD and only my life partners see me struggle with my symptoms.

I have the same whirlwind for an internal landscape. For me, recovery is not the absence of these symptoms.

It is the knowledge that these moments of intense dysregulation will eventually pass, my strength and patience while I ride out these emotions and the moments of peace that come in between. It's the coping mechanisms I've developed and the love of my community which holds me.

This is what recovery looks like for me right now.",External-Owl-Puffle,tw3fsz
16,"This is why I’ve always felt BPD is a death sentence. Even when I am palatable by others and not actively harming myself, there will always be internal anguish that requires my constant attention and management. The only thing that takes it away is drugs, unfortunately. Nowadays I stick to weed (med card) and the occasional LSD to keep my general mental state more level and uplifted, but I have to expend much more energy to remain stable when sober. So at the end of the day, my quality of life and ability to function in society improves if I’m a little zooted as a baseline, so that’s my treatment and compassion for myself. We’re fighting a battle we won’t win, so why suffer more than we have to yaknow?",,tw3fsz

18,"From my understanding with therapy, treatment etc. You can get to a place where you no longer meet the criteria for being borderline. That is, the questions a therapist asks when diagnosing you would have to say yes to less than 4 or 5 I believe. Ive been actively seeking treatment for about 2 years and I have made some progress. You can get better I believe with the help of debt therapy and self care/hard work on yourself. I'm quiet borderline too. I wasn't really having a ton of consequences from the outside world but I was miserable and I was afraid I would eventually kill myself. 

Humans are amazing creatures! I won't ever give up trying to feel better and I hope you can find some more help and relief for your symptoms. You deserve to feel better. Don't give up",stellablue2142,tw3fsz
19,"IMO I see it like the real success story to recovery from BPD is when we can really hone the skills we should of been taught pre diagnosed stages, so emotion regulation and interpersonal skills at a younger age possibly (assuming the parenting or mentors given didn't teach those and trauma was involved), with the proper therapy and training to establish skills and be able to handle when the emotions are high no matter what situation. So with really taking DBT and other cognitive therapies seriously and actually working towards it with consistent practice, the biological sense of high emotions might linger, but how you handle them will be honed over time with more practice and patience and willingness. I know it's hard to swallow sometimes but half the work has to come from the individual and not just the therapist so it takes 50/50 to make it work, as I view it. That said DBT isn't easy to get into I perceive at times so using what resources to start the work is a start to somewhere positive in any direction.",,tw3fsz
20,"Someone who ""graduated"" from my TC said that progress isn't necessarily about recovery, but discovery - whilst it sounds a bit cheesy, I like the idea that we might not recover in the very literal sense, but we will discover the ""new"" us who is bettering themselves",IAmMeIGuess93,tw3fsz
21,"I'm like you, a quiet borderline, and consider myself in ""recovery"" for the last year or 2. 

I think a better word might be remission. I still have an occasional ""episode"" once or twice a year. Sometimes its a trigger I know is coming and I can use my skills and prep for it. But then the day comes or the event happens -  and its a terrible emotional roller coaster and I spend the day with all emotions at a 10, sobbing on the floor. So is that recovery? It is to me.

I don't have SI anymore (except on those days maybe) But when I do, I can recognize them as just thoughts I don't have to pay attention to.

I no longer have screaming fights with my husband about putting the groceries away. When I feel my anger rising to the point I know I'm gonna lose it - I walk away and simmer down, allow myself to get in perspective. Take a moment for mindfulness. 

I no longer worry that my coworkers will say things like ""she's super competent, but I wouldn't work with her again"" My yearly reviews no longer tell me I need to learn to play with others. 

It's still a lot of work. And I make mistakes all the time. It almost feels like all the therapy skills I've learned and all the meditation and mindfulness allows me to have an extra check on my thoughts. So I still HAVE and BEGIN all those terrible negative thoughts - like thinking I'm a waste of space that shouldn't exist - but instead of it planting and getting a chance to grow - I can throw it out or ignore it. 

I can't do that if I don't practice my skills/mindfulness on a weekly if not daily basis. I think of it like physical exercise.  We're supposed to get some physical activity in a couple times a week, or our bodies get mad. I have to do this a couple times a week too, or I go mad.",Anaille,tw3fsz

- I have not self harmed six months (approximately)

- I've put in a lot of very hard work and I'm working with the vocational job person to build a resume. I haven't worked in 12+ years.

- I've ended some friendships not in a fit of splitting but for real, logical reasons. I didn't spiral.

- I understand myself much more than I ever did

- My marriage is stronger

- my kid and me are like super fucking close and she says she wishes her bio-dad was more like me.

I thought I was doing better and stopped treatment and meds and then things flared up again and threatened my progress, leading me to take more specific steps to treat BPD specifically.

I'd been trying to figure out what it was for a long time. I knew I had GAD, but it just didn't explain everything. I had a kid, got married and didn't like how I functioned. I was the happiest I'd ever been but still wanted to die. Still hated myself. Still loved in complete fear that my husband would leave me. So I just started googling lots of mental health shit. I came across a YouTube video of a woman who was doing a video diary and she was diagnosed with BPD and some other stuff. I was blown away at how I related to her. So I started reading books and balling my eyes out when I found books on bpd because FINALLY it made sense. I ended up voluntarily going to counseling because I saw how I treated my husband and I did not want that kind of relationship. My kid also started to struggle and we signed them up for counseling and I realized I needed to get some things under control for my child. I did NOT want to repeat the same trauma for my kid. Starting counseling was really hard. I cried during the whole intake appointment. I was scared they'd take my kid away or put me in the psych ward involuntarily. None of that happened. I got diagnosed during counseling with BPD, MDD and GAD. I've done REBT, CBT and DBT. REBT and DBT helped the most. 


As far as your S.O. being receptive to the possibility of having BPD... I don't know. 😬 That can be touchy for a lot of people. Are there any articles or videos you've run across that you think your partner would be able to identify with? If so I would start with that. Just throwing mental health stuff at them or telling them you think they have ""x"" disorder would probably not be received well. Introducing it in a way that makes them feel seen, heard and able to identify would be key imo. Good luck! You're a decent human being for looking for ways to help your S.O. 💜",gullyfoyle777,t7c9c6

Yeah, I completely agree. I've spent a lot of time thinking about it, and learning more about BPD in men, and he ticks off almost every box. 
The last thing I want to do is hurt him, I've always tried to be understanding and supportive, but the behavior lately is getting super damaging. I think he's spiralling, and has been for a while, so I'll have to be delicate, but I'm also desperate to see change and know that he's getting the right help. 

Everything you said in your response are things he's said to me recently. He's never felt stronger in who he is, yet he is in such conflict within himself. Depression and anxiety are a factor, and he also has that deep feeling of ""something is wrong with me"", that he's different from others, that he has a ""dark, twisted side"", and I know he wants more than anything to just be a good man.

I'll consider everything you've said. So far, I'm thinking rather than pathologizing the sum total of his symptoms, maybe I can try to address just one thing at a time.
I'm working with my own therapist through this, and he has agreed to get his own therapist as well, and also to do some couples therapy, so maybe I don't have to say anything more about it. I'm sure once he starts therapy, his therapist will be able to guide him toward appropriate therapy styles. Sorry for the rant, it's been so hard trying to figure out how to handle this!
Thank you again for responding. Wishing you a very happy new year! :)

Ps, you are a strong person for doing all that you've done to grow as a person, and to try and get well, and I hope you take the time once in a while to acknowledge that for yourself. 🙏 Taking accountability, processing trauma, doing the work to make positive changes; many people don't realize how hard that can be. I hope it's all been so worth it for you, and I hope you are proud of yourself for going through all that :) 💕",Bananat3rricottapi3,t7c9c6

39,"Thank you so much. I'd hug you if I could. A lot of people don't talk about how straight up PAINFUL it is to change. It hurts. But it's been worth it. My relationship with my kid and my husband has never been stronger. If you're looking to help your S.O., then reading about distress tolerance in DBT am help. Fear of abandonment and being incapable of handling stress and bad situations and bad feelings is a really big deal for us BPD people. Those distressed tolerance skills are very important. And not every single one will click, maybe only one or two will click, but that's okay because that's normal. They can be very helpful.  I hope you can get him to start therapy and to go into with an attitude that is ready for change. You're obviously very kind and loving and your S.O. is lucky to have you. Just don't allow yourself to be a punching bag or doormat. We (BPD) can be brutal sometimes. Remember to keep yourself healthy. Take time for self care, even if it's just 20 mins drinking your fav coffee and reading reddit. 😁 You can message me if you have any questions or need access to a few books (rent, DBT, BPD etc). 💜",gullyfoyle777,t7c9c6

Thank you so much for the advice! I will definitely read about distress tolerance, I've never heard of that, so I'm very interested to learn about that. And yeah, I've come to realize I need to make myself more of a priority, and have better boundaries.
I'll do what I can to take care of myself through this, and be responsible for my own self and behavior. And I'm hopeful that he will do his part. He got a recommendation for a therapist that he seems interested to try, so we'll see how it goes 🤞
And thank you for the offer to reach out, I'll keep you in mind if I run into any dead ends! I really appreciate you offering that :)
Take care for now! ☺️",Bananat3rricottapi3,t7c9c6

This disorder is *painful*, there's no denying it. But we learn to ride the waves. And slowly, incredibly slowly, the waves feel smaller. We'll never be 100% ""okay,"" but who the hell is?

2,"I’ve just had this conversation with myself the other day. 

After spiraling out of control for the umpteenth time, I’ve realized that a main part of my turmoil stems from unfulfilling relationships. From me always trying to see the best in others. Or I guess having an inflated perception of the value of relationships. I am left feeling utterly disappointed. No matter how far I think I’ve come with a person, they always wind up doing something that I would have never believed they were capable of. Not saying that I am perfect person in relationships, but that I would never, and hope to never do the things they have done. 

But honestly, the value that I have in people is inflated. And when they do something to offend me, I feel it 10 times more than a normal person should. I end up spiraling and guilt tripping myself to the extreme. 

I’ve realized that I need to only maintain surface level relationships. No intimacy. I’ve accepted that humans are just disappointing. And that’s okay. But for me, I honestly cannot take it. Not anymore. I will still be kind, compassionate, etc. but I need to draw firm lines now. I need extreme boundaries because last time, it almost killed me.",,trw7pw

But I don’t think your reason is valid, you might’ve felt in the past people disappointed you but that is not a fact it will be in the future. I do think that it’s good to not have a FP because people with EUPD really need to be alone to be able to be at peace with themselves and rely on their internalised support system. When we don’t have this and cling on someone else like they’re your oxygen mask yes then they WILL leave. So I think not having an FP right now will help your inner healing and also be able to create healthier less enmeshed relationships in the future because you don’t need them like before.

19,"I understand to an extent and agree people are generally disappointing. I tend to just let people fall off the map and don't place too much importance in them for a while until they show me they contribute to my life.. It sounds selfish at first but I don't think cutting people out of your life completely is healthy. I think finding people with substance and not just an empty vessel or carbon copy of another person has worked quite well for me. Your not an asshole for putting certain expectations on people, I've gotten that from my boyfriend who thinks it's selfish that I expect emotional sustenance  from the people I choose to keep in my life, but this is just my personal opinion and how I cope with MY reactions. I know everyone has a different set of BPD traits and this may work very well for you but if you get upset who do you turn to talk to? Do you need to talk to anyone?  I think you can surround yourself with people that understand when you need to distance yourself and they're there for you when you need without pressure. It's a hard type of person to find when our actions look malicious. We disappear, and as everyone has experienced being ghosted sucks and I feel really terrible when I do it. There's just something in me that thinks ""I don't want to burden this friend of mine with my bullshit, my bullshit is mine and mine alone""  I have a few very close friends that just understand I am not social, but they know if they needed me I'd bend heaven and earth to do whatever they needed, I regularly show my appreciation for their understanding and these same people will pick back up and talk to me if i feel like I might be a danger to myself which has been a new experience for me recently. I don't know what I would of done if I didn't have my friend to help me escape my own mind for a night or a friend who experiences the same lows to make me feel like I'm not alone and you CAN keep going, you just have to be strong. It's just hits different when hearing that from someone who struggles with wanting die in the same way without judgement. The same reason we all come to this sub for comfort or validation.

22,"I have the same FP since years, before I even had a word for it and I totally get the feeling. Sometimes I really just want to end it, I hate that the opinion of this person matters so much. Also the quick changes between my  FP being the best and the worst person is really exhausting. Like at first I am so angry at them for a lot of things that just go wrong, then suddenly they say or do something nice and I am all over in love again. 
I often think about breaking up and I thing I would do well alone, but right now I am just to unsure since this feelings are all to much already. 
Since I have a really social job, where I have a very specific role for people, I don't feel too lonely, even when I don't have a lot of privat contact. I have a really structured Circle of friends, like one close friend and a few friends that I see sometimes and who I just have fun talking to. When I feel like someone is not investing as much in a relationship as I do (like 99% of people) I distance myself enough so that they can't hurt me. That is sometimes really painful and hart, but it is better then going through this bullshit everytime this person feels like it.

23,"Careful to not fall down the slippery slope of hyperindependence. Borderline’s have attachment issues, which is why we tend to be more stable w/o any attachments. However, we can’t heal the attachment issues if they’re not being triggered. It’s a push and pull. There’s a balance between not isolating, but also learning to self soothe and live interdependently. If you’ve reached your current capacity emotionally and need a break, I completely understand that. Just question the parts of you that require isolation to feel stable. I got into the habit of growing in isolation/growing away from people. I realize now that I have a plethora of new defense mechanisms that are all in place to avoid emotional pain. But I feel more isolated than ever, and can’t connect at all, I can’t get close enough to others to make a new FP. I miss connection but I physically can’t feel it anymore.

It is no different. It is all or nothing, black or white. It is denying yourself of true relationships, and having full control of every relationship (in this case: none)

I get it.

You can do life however you want. But it doesn't have to be this way. It can, for a little bit.

When I had my right knee replaced, I was a little down and missing my mom. I was wishing I could hear her voice one more time. I knew it wasn't possible. But, in the voices of all of the nurses who took care of me, I could hear her voice and feel her touch in their hands. My mom was an RN. I may have lost all of my keepsakes from her and from my grannie, but I have them in my heart.

24,"I broke up with my bf because he was agressive, self harming and can be really mean when he's angry. I thought he was NPD, anything i do that he doesnt like boom! But i can sense genuine remorse and guilt from him everytime. There were time when i said something accusative to him and he said mean things to me but not more than 5 mins in the care he apologized. He blocked me on social media and on his phone because i was berating him about something and after lowering my ego not wanting to fight, he unblocked me and said sorry not long after. Last week when everything was good on the surface (i pretented good enough not for him to notice) i broke up with him. I was devastated. I was in and out of hospital because Ive got panic attacks, GAD and PTSD from all that has happened a couple months back that I apparently havent healed from. He would come to the hospital, waiting for me and he was being himself. The kindest person I know who has been through shitty childhood and still be able to love that deep. I kept telling him none of it was his fault, he was just born into the wrong family, wrong situation, he was a good boy but no one protected him. He made stupid mistakes but i know only when he's on one of episodes. 

I havent contacted him in days though i miss him a lot at times, im starting at the phone checking if hes online making sure he's alive and well. 

We came from different race, different religion, hes divorced and ive never been married. 

I dont know whats gotten into him or maybe just maybe hes been getting good lately. He did text me asking for my help saying hes been to the police office but that hes okay now because his friend picked him up (which turned out to be a lie cause i called the friend). When i cry, saying i dont wanna turn out like his mom (victim of domestic abuse) he would cry too because he loved his mom so much and it was his breaking point. He lost his mom and the next month her ex family 'forced' him to get married, so his previous marriage was hellish i could only imagine. 

I would keep setting boundaries because hes making me nervous. He drinks regularly and it can turn 250 with him. So i said no please dont come to my place when you drink. He can be mean and violent after but at that time he said okay, i do not wanna scare you.

I dont know if hes diagnosed or not. Whether hes got BPD or not or just the traits but I do care for him. I wish all of you out there please love yourself!

When you want to feel angry, sad, frustrated take a break, cry and imagine your little self and hug that kid, say to him/her it's okay. Its gonna be okay. None of this is your fault, chin up and hold her/his hand tight. I did this because i too suffer from depression and my symptoms in my last relationship mimics those of BPDs. I was not abused as horribly as my ex but i suffered from having to grow up in chaotic house with lots of yelling, lots of crying alone and never felt belong and good enough. 

I know you guys dont understand the concept of self love, my ex would always reflect back to me when i said things about 'love yourself okay, i will be fine, you need it more) but please just do it. You dont have to LOVE yourself but stop hating yourself is the goal. Stop judging yourself is the goal. Tunning your emotional meter is the goal. Instead of just 0 and 100, put new stops at 50, then 25, then 75. Please keep doing it because all his life, he's been made the villain and while i do understand why others see it that way, i could also see what caused him to be the villain. 

I said to him i could only offer him friendship and support if he needs me but he said no, we cant be friends and that he will wait for me, he's not going anywhere because im worth it. It kills me to know i cant do anything because he refuses to get help (no need to admit he's got BPD, just attend psychotherapy would be a good start). I could only pray to God every night for him, ive been pretty lucky in life and it kills me to know i was shown the way to this mans life, knowing what happened to him and cant do anything in my power to make him better.

Please LIKE yourself. You have goodness in you, if you read my story, you too would feel how good he is as a human being. He feeds strays cats at home, he's a good boss, he's trying to keep the peace with his abusive dad whos now 'repenting' with religion and his deadly obese brother who used to fight with him a lot. I hope he can heal, he can be healthy, he can be in 'remission', he can be filled with happiness no matter how small that is. Unlike others who claim boohoo im alone, my ex actually will when his dad and brother dies, his ex and daughter wont be in his life a lot. He's all alone...i feel like shit if one day i cant support him when it happens.

Please again, hug urself a lot, cry a lot. If you wanna cut, put ice cubes on your hands making them numb, peel off strong bandages to relieve, bite your nails, twirl/pull your hair, anything that does not destroy your body and soul.

Lots if love for you all, please stop yourself when the shit is about to hit the fan.",Xyrius_Bleck,14frn83

I choose both, with openness and understanding that diagnoses exist for therapists to help you recover, not for incriminating, manipulating, and giving up on people.

As far as finding value in yourself? What has kept me afloat all this time, all these years, is a sort of detachment from other people. I find value in myself by recognizing my uniqueness from those around me. Kind of embracing the fact that I don't fit in and celebrating my unique perspective on life. IDK about you or most people, but I find many people to be clones and replicas of a certain mold that society has created. 

What do you find valuable in those around you? What traits do you feel are deserving of being valued? Which of these traits can you identify in yourself?

I guarantee, that even if you can't find value in yourself, others can and do see your value. My personal opinion is that none of us will ever stop needing some sort of validation.

I'm nowhere near that level, but I've definitely improved since doing a DBT/CBT in-patient program, being in therapy, and being on meds :)  2 years running since the program itself plus meds, 3 years since diagnosis and the therapy started.

I would really love to hear from someone in remission how you knew you were.  As I said, I'm a ways off still, and am hyper-aware of this.

5,"I truly wish I had a simple answer for that. I’ve been in remission (not meeting the diagnostic criteria, no self harming, no suicidal ideation) for almost 2 years, but my recovery journey started long before then. I was misdiagnosed for 12 years so I haven’t done a formal DBT program, and I had to figure out a lot myself. So my overall approach was more… holistic. Evaluating and working on MANY aspects of myself and my life so that I could stop hating them both. So there are a lot of different things I’ve found helpful in leading me here, and that’s part of the reason I’ve started the channel - to share them. The journey looks different for everyone. 

BUT DBT is definitely a great starting point. I wish doctors would’ve pushed that on me instead of endless medications. I had to go to one random group meeting as a condition to my inpatient discharge (I don’t know why they only made me go to one), but I had no idea it was effective therapy developed specifically for my worst symptoms.",SarruhTonin,1702xgm

7,"Thanks for subscribing! You mean how did I know I was in remission? Or how did I get there? The latter is not a simple answer, and many pieces of my recovery will be discussed over time on my channel. 

But if you mean how did I know, I definitely didn’t know right away. Like when people get sober without knowing their last drink was definitely their last this time. There were times I had breaks from the severity of my symptoms in the years before, but they were usually very conditional. And even in the year leading up to it, I had huge growth and was in recovery, but “relapsed” after someone from my past came back into my life and I felt myself losing it all again. There were SO many times I told myself it would be the last time I ever let myself get to that point, but that time it ended up being true.

The more time passed, and the more clear it became that my recovery was no longer so conditional, without relapsing even under triggering circumstances (I still struggle, and I put in a lot of care and effort into not letting myself spiral), the more I started to see how truly far from it I was getting. Certain parts of my thinking and behavior have genuinely changed. Areas of my brain have been rewired. I still have a lot of growing and improving to do, but the part of me I hated most and couldn’t control is gone. 

To be clear, when I say remission, I mean that I haven’t met the diagnostic criteria in a significant amount of time (non conditionally). I haven’t self harmed or had suicidal ideation in this time either. “Remission” isn’t clearly defined, but I have read 2 years as the number somewhere. Next month will be 2 years for me, but I’ve been confident in considering this a remission for a while now.

I’m 43 now and became self-aware about, five months ago after my spouse separated from me, and all of the traits came out in full force again for the fourth time in my life I saw a psychiatrist and they re-diagnosed me. I had two doctors confirm and my therapist I’m just upset that the answer was there Early in my life, but because it was so stigmatized and normalized to not tell the patient of what they had, especially BPD I had to go through almost my entire adult life upon countless upon countless of relationships and friendships that got destroyed because what I thought I was doing was protecting myself And was appropriate when it was not I have had periods of remission now that I think back I am in DBT and learning and doing also the whole holistic and going through therapy and re-exploring my traumas at this moment I can’t tell you if it is claimed this marriage or not But I will tell you that this is really hard to do on my own by myself without immediate family without immediate friends around that stop by Ar Dette involved daily in my life. I have tried to withdraw or pull back on confiding on my spouse lately do they understand that being with someone with this daughter disorder can be very abusive and, there can be a lot of damage that they can experience or it could even trigger traumas of their own that they’ve lived through their lives, but told me last week that he does not want to be with someone with this mental health disorder for me.

 I live with chronic mental illness (not just BPD) and all is fine as long as I'm on top of my sleep hygiene, complying with my medication regimen, getting sunlight, and using my skills...but if I stop doing those things or if I allow my sleeplessness go on too long the wheels will start to fall off very quickly, kind of like how a diabetic will end up in big trouble if they're not monitoring their blood sugar and keeping up with their insulin.

10,A lot of people don't know this and it's scary to think of how many folks just give up because they don't know that there's hope for improvement if not recovery. I wouldn't have bothered starting therapy if I didn't think there was a chance I could get better,theghostofameme,166d7fw
11,"it is not possible. that criteria is just means of a job for people in the field. i believe the disorder stems from a conscienceness issue. essentially it just doesn’t make sense. like okay you only meet 2 of the criteria you’re not borderline, but if you’re still having symptoms it just seems more managed or time sensitive. All in all, a diagnosis doesn’t change the game it just give it meaning. 

I think even with AI; maybe they could do psycho surgery like they do to Elizabeth in altered carbon… OR take away memories and then make new ones, but then you’d be a conditioned dog… and not know your own life. 

I personally wished the same thing, but my honest advice. 

Accepting who you are for what it is. Live with it. If this gives you purpose great. Be a therapist and tell everyone about it. Work in retail at the top, or maybe a jeweler. Make bank and run from the mental health world, it’s pure evil. (There are some good people, but only because they have yet to understand.) 

Having borderline clientele while having the disease?? Good luck. Seems unmanageable, near impossible. Even the best therapist would struggle managing clientele with borderline they are often the least favourite to work with because it’s essentially doubles/triples the workload so to speak.. all to get paid the same amount. 

I would have done anything to get rid of all of it. It’s just not in the cards for my lifetime, maybe yours… but i would be truly surprised.. it would be a testing situation probably for someone your age and that would be terrifying.

14,"I am in remission and I’m a psych nurse practitioner (in the US. It’s like a psychiatrist).  I have been working at an outpatient clinic, doing med mgmt, in a population with a lot of undiagnosed BPD. Which means I’ve been the person to diagnose and explain it to many people, maybe hundreds.  I have always told them it can go into remission, and always quote the large Harvard study that showed remission in i think 50% of people with BPD after 2 years, and 80% of people after 6 years. Most people have seemed happy to learn this part, when I was first diagnosed 20 years ago, I sure wasn’t told this, but it was also in the early stages of DBT and remission wasn’t so common then.  
But thought you would be happy to know that I educated all these people with BPD on this important fact from the start of their journey.  I wouldn’t dream of telling someone they have it and then walking away. That would be barbaric.",EmotionalWarrior_23,166d7fw
15,"I think that’s a really good mindset and in my unprofessional opinion is already setting yourself on a great path. Learning to live in a weird harmony with the disorder can only better us. 

I have a friend in a similar position, she was actually told by a hospital here that they can no longer take her in because they said they’ve done all they can to help her. 

My unsolicited advice that you can totally ignore is to try an outside the box method? I have a theory that the idea of “BPD MUST BE CURED BY A AND B AND NOTHING ELSE WILL WORK” is ridiculous. Here’s something that actually occasionally works in my favour: black and white thinking. I can hear therapists gasping at the thought. Quick story:

When I was in the psychiatric ward again at 20, I had this idea in my head that everyone hates me. I remember telling my psychiatrist this and he went, “everyone?!?” 
I said, “Yeah. Everyone.” He furrowed his brows and looked at me all confused and said, “even me?!” and I laughed and went, “yeah I was actually just thinking that.” I remember him trying to do the math in his brain and he said, “I just met you how can I hate you??” 
Boom. Beaten with facts and logic. Black and white facts and logic. 
“You clearly have a very poor sense of self worth,”
BOOM. Another hit.
“And you’re experiencing paranoid delusions.”
B O O M. 
That psychiatrist didn’t know it but that literally changed my life. Some things are black and white. Some provable facts are sooo simple that there’s no room for grey. No room for interpretation. Obviously this doesn’t apply to everything but the ability to recognize simple facts that literally cannot be interpreted otherwise changed the game for me. Some things, such as the idea that I had poor self worth and that had manifested into delusions cannot be argued or interpreted otherwise. I had no proof for people hating me! It was my brain thinking, “I hate myself therefor everyone hates me and I must set myself up for that.” Bluntness can be so, so BPD approved. Again, it’s important to note that it only applies to things that can be proven. 

All of this to say, look outside the box. Attend CBT therapy rather than DBT. Seek out a therapist who advertises themself as being to the point and blunt. Walking away from those interactions literally changed my life. Words cannot describe how I was at my worst. Meds didn’t help (although ADHD medication does actually help a little. Maybe because I also have ADHD lol) counselling didn’t help, taking things into my own hands and figuring it out my way did. 

If you read this far, I wish you luck and I hope you took my point the way I intended! I’m rooting for you :) ❤️",MarsSaturn09,166d7fw
16,"Everybody, regardless of mental health should strive for consistent improvements in their life. And just because a condition is not treatable today does not mean that it will be untreatable tomorrow",Bewildered90,166d7fw
17,Thank you for putting it into words! I personally get upset when people mention remission because it doesn't seem like remission if it's always in the shadows. I'd feel it be better to call it a lifelong condition that can be managed.,Lydias-ghost,166d7fw
18,"I take issue with the forever thing too. If it’s worth anything, it gets to a point where you don’t even notice that you’re managing it. And some things will just no longer need to be managed. Years ago if my partner didn’t answer their phone I would have lost my marbles. Now it’s just, “meh. He’s busy,” if the thought even gets that far. At some point I think we become better at managing our emotions than those who don’t have BPD because we’ve had so much practice. For example, my boyfriend raised his voice yesterday because he was upset about a couple of work things. He doesn’t have BPD yet struggles with containing outbursts! Me on the other hand, I haven’t yelled at someone or something (unless I’m joking, like I like to pretend to freak at games. If they actually upset me I put the controller down for a second and walk around lol) in years. It’s not even something I think about anymore. 

It’s like learning something that requires muscle memory. Eventually you have to think about it but then after a while you just don’t.",MarsSaturn09,166d7fw
19,"So the idea of being in remission AKA “no longer meeting the diagnostic criteria for BPD” means that you have managed your symptoms to a point where they no longer… control you? I think that’s the best way for me to put it. 

For me personally, I’m very close to remission. I have a psychiatrist appointment in November and will go from there. For me this means that I have enough control over my symptoms where suicidal thoughts are uncommon, and if they happen I can swipe them away as long as I take a second to think about where it’s coming from and why. I also am in a healthy relationship, and things that would have been triggering to me when I was first diagnosed (like taking a while to text back, not immediately answering the phone, healthy criticism i.e. “you forgot to put the dishes away,” or my partner not having a TOTAL understanding of BPD and how my mind works) are now things that I don’t even really think about? It would be a lie to say that I don’t struggle with emotional regulation, but I taught myself to learn how to step back and evaluate before I act out, and to recognize my triggers so I CAN evaluate before I get to the tipping point. All in all remission looks like a “normal” life on the outside. Steady job, steady relationship, steady, steady. 

However, it’s important to note that there are bumps in the road. I don’t think it’s linear. I think that once the point of a diagnosed remission is reached it simply means that you have the necessary tools to manage yourself. It’s important to make room for mistakes, and episodes are sometimes inevitable. The MOST IMPORTANT part is learning the proper steps of what to do when that happens. For me talking it out and being grounded in reality when the time comes is most helpful. I used to have bad episodes daily, but now it’s probably twice a year. 

I recommend purchasing a BPD workbook, they would walk you through it better than I could. Also research! Learning about BPD is what really helped me learn to live with it. Once you recognize your specific symptoms, you can recognize your triggers and then you can go from there. 

Lastly, I’m sorry you didn’t know about this. Take the idea with a grain of salt. Know that if and when you reach that point, that you will not be “cured.” You will just have all the tools necessary to succeed especially during an episode.

edit: words",MarsSaturn09,166d7fw
20,"That’s another issue too. It’s important to learn to live with it rather than fight it. In my experience a lot of talk about betterment is about fighting the disorder rather than learning to live in a sort of harmony with it. I’m just now, almost five years post diagnosis, understanding that. Through Reddit of all things! There are major downsides to BPD, yes, but learning to manage the extreme amounts of joy and love that come with the disorder is fantastic. I love seeing the fruits of my labour and I love being happy to the point of tears. Saw Arctic Monkeys live yesterday - favourite band of all time - and bawled my eyes out. It was awesome. 

When the professionals around us focus so much on bringing our mood down to what’s deemed “acceptable” every single thing becomes an issue. You start questioning your emotions. After a while you can become like what you said, a walking talking mannequin. I personally found that I shifted INTO quiet BPD from stifling my own feelings so much and internalizing everything for the sake of appearing stable. 

I don’t have access to therapy right now because Canada’s healthcare system is a joke (it’s not covered under OHIP, Ontario’s public health plan. Psychiatry is though!) so majority of this has been on my own and I appreciate insight from others, it only helps me more. Thanks :)",MarsSaturn09,166d7fw
21,Love this. That’s why I feel it’s important to be open with others about our condition! It spreads awareness and lets people know an important piece of who we are. BPD is such a big part of my identity and at this point I wear it proudly. No sense in feeling ashamed of something we can’t change.,MarsSaturn09,166d7fw
22,This. Think about the stereotype that we are unwilling to receive help. Why get help in the first place if you don’t believe there’s a chance things will improve?,MarsSaturn09,166d7fw
23,"I've done both CBT and DBT, both clinically and through my own research and time spent. I'm self-aware to a degree where, despite knowing what to do, how to think, how to be mindful of intrusive thoughts, etc. My depression is still unfathomable in severity. I wish these things helped me the way they helped you. But truth be told, I already knew everything those courses taught before even researching it or participating in it. The only thing keeping me alive is the idea that somehow, after all the pain and abandonment. After all the near death experiences and deaths of my closest friends. Im somehow, still here. 2 mini strokes, a near heart attack, drowning, drug use, alcohol poisoning, months of starvation, and my own immune system even tried to kill me once, surely there's something I need to see or do in the future for me to survive all of that.",BakedtoaStake,166d7fw
24,"what a common misconception. DBT is a type of CBT. CBT is the huge umbrella for a lot of type of therapies. It’s mainly talk therapy, and focuses on creating a safe space for a person. It is mostly useful for anxiety and depression (people treated with CBT were more like to have their depression go into remission). CBT focuses on how our thoughts, feelings and behaviours affect each other. 

DBT on the other hand focuses on experiencing an uncomfortable feeling while being in a safe space. It has been focused on BPD. it was created by somebody who wanted to fix their own BPD. It helps people actively change their behaviour patterns and work on the intense emotional reactions they have. Sexual trauma survivors also respond well to DBT. DBT works on regulating emotions, being mindful and distress tolerance.",mademoisellearabella,166d7fw

26,[deleted],,166d7fw
27,"Forgive me!! I think maybe I misread what you said then. I will say though for me, I’ve been in therapy briefly and when I was a teenager I often took advantage of free counselling but that was pre-diagnosis. I can’t recall anything other than an emphasis on bringing my moods down to what is deemed “stable”. The way to get there was healthy coping mechanisms but nothing regarding how to utilize them especially when in crisis or approaching it. I remember my psychiatrist in the psych ward at 20 explaining that he wants to get my high mood level down to a regular level and then giving me a printed pamphlet he made that just contained info on what BPD is. That was it, other than the daily check ins and giving me an anti depressant. From there that’s really all it’s been, a huge focus on stability and bringing my mood to what’s deemed appropriate without the steps on how to get from point A (episode) to point B (healthy coping mechanism). I think I’ve got that part mostly figured out but it had to be solo dolo.

As far as dissociating goes, I feel that too. It would most often happen at work when I’m at my tipping point. So I think I understand. When that happens I feel like a husk and like I’m running on autopilot. I’m a server so it’s detrimental when it happens. Hard to focus on not spilling a bunch of mimosas when I don’t even feel as if I’m in my own body. Also when I was stifling my feelings down. The fear of the psych ward or being seen as “crazy” became debilitating and I would just shut down. Power off, totally unplugged. At its worst it made me nonverbal and unable to even move, like trying to lift your leg when it’s asleep. Thank you for being patient and explaining, brains running at like 60% as I’ve been doing school prep this week so I apologize!

And yes I do plan on spending more time in google scholar! I love reading essays.

2,"My dear, first of all I’m so so sorry. My niece was diagnosed with borderline and reading this reminded me so much of her. She passed away March 19th this year. She had gotten into DBT therapy about 2 years ago and although she was still struggling, she was making so much improvement and having so much growth within therapy and otherwise. My Niece had just turned 23 on March 5th before she died and I told her often as I myself have been in trauma therapy for 3 years that in time things can improve especially while you are receiving help. Medication can sometimes be a bust. I have anxiety depression CPTSD and ADHD and I have been on so many different medications to the point I just stopped all together. Trauma therapy is the only thing this far that has been worth putting my effort into and as I was very close with my niece I can tell you she would express this to you as well. You might always suffer with having huge feelings and sometimes be unmotivated but the episodes aren’t as frequent and tend to not uproot your life quite as much. Also as I said before you are so young and with time you will learn and grow and learn newer and healthier coping mechanisms. If no one else says this to you, I believe in you. 


People with borderline in my experience are some of the bravest souls I have ever encountered. Dealing with waves of emotions much greater then any average person. A gift and a curse. Please know that you are worthy of a good life. As someone who loved someone with your same illness I hope someday you can see all the wonderful things about yourself that I am certain there are.

If you are on meds and in therapy then talk to your providers about how you’re struggling with those things. The job hunt is important but secondary to just getting stable. For that I’d take some time to just check out of your emotions. Sometimes I like to handle things as if I were helping a friend, a little less attached to situation emotionally and a lot more patient and kind than the instinct to be unkind to ourselves. 

So sit with the issues and what would you tell a friend struggling? What kind of plan would you come up with for them to move forward? For a job hunt I make lists, and update my resume, and look up places in my area that I might like to work at and see if they are hiring. Figure out what type of work you’re most comfortable with, like maybe if you work retail you don’t want to work directly with customers and instead stock for example. If there are training programs in your area for a field you might like, maybe look into financial aid for that. 

And with your partner, sounds like she’s a support so just try to leave room to spend time together without talking about the stressful stuff. Just being with eachother and reminding you why you chose this person to be with can do wonders for your mental health. And remind yourself of the person she fell for.

I wish you all the best with everything in your life. Take care of yourself and be nice to everyone around you, especially yourself.

I’m too attached now & would try to kill myself if we broke up however he stopped having sex with me 2 years ago so now life is just miserable nonstop. He never once read any of my books about BPD, I only asked him to read 1. He wouldn’t even read a fucking pamphlet I found about BPD. I don’t even know why he’s with me to be honest if he’s not interested in me sexually, doesn’t care about the things causing me excruciating emotional pain every day. But now I’m just waiting & hoping it gets better..",Beagles156,17sse1u
1,"Speaking from experience, and since the problems described aren't changing and it's already been years for both people commenting here, it's really best in the long run to end things (Just extremely painful in the short term)

My now ex had been sitting on being engaged to me for three years, stopped wearing his engagement ring and never talked about us getting married after two years in. I was basically living alone with him and extremely lonely. He was either at work, asleep, or doing things that gave him plenty of space away from me. 

When he was home at the same time I was going to sleep, he'd turn facing away from me to sleep for the night and never touched me unless he wanted to have sex, which was rare. It was so bizarre to sleep next to someone every night and feel like I was sleeping alone. I'd hold stuffed animals or pillows at night so I could sleep because he refused to hold me. Etc etc.. the whole thing was a shit show. 

 Recently he moved out without notice in a single afternoon and took everything  and intentionally left his ring, along with any gifts I had ever gotten him, but made sure he took literally everything else he owned with him. 

If you both stay you know what will happen. You'll just become more and more unhappy and you don't realize until they're gone how much of yourself you were losing in the process. 

I thought I couldn't live without my ex, and I felt really suicidal after he left. Especially with him also being really my main and sometimes only emotional support, but here I am living in spite of what's happened. 

We deserve love and support, to be understood, sought to be understood, as well as normal healthy sex lives with someone that's supposed to be our life partner. Don't keep losing yourself because you're afraid. I know it doesn't feel like it, but you really can live without him and you'll be better for it. I wouldn't tell you this if I didn't believe it.

In situations such as these where the relationship has been broken a long time and he doesn't even show any sign at all of wanting to fix it, I just can't stress enough how much of yourself you're losing in the process, and that's really sad. Sooner or later we have to choose ourselves.",Most-Shock-2947,17sse1u
2,"You are not ""too"" attached to him. You absolutely have a choice. This will not get better, there is no magic cure, he absolutely won't wake up and just change. I don't think you want this to be your live. If this is how things are, is this the life you want to look back on? It would be good if you could talk to a therapist. I would break up by text, if you think you aren't going to do it in person. You live together? Figure out how to seperate. And than just do it. Running after him forever, trying to prove to him that you are worth the effort and love, all of it is utter bullshit. I wasted so much life on it. the right person gives their love freely to you. The moment you have to earn it or have to prove your worth is the moment you walk away. You can do it! It's a simple statement, I deserve better. He isn't it. Ripp the bandage off, it is for the best. I was always, always happier alone than in bad company and no matter how big the pain feels, it will susbside, you will be happy again, you will love again. It passes and you are strong enough to make it. I wish you the best.",_nachtkalmar_,17sse1u

7,"It's ok, it is what it is. I definitely made my mistakes in the relationship. I do think I can have healthy relationships with people that seek to understand and are willing to keep communication open.

 My ex chose to shut down and ignore me the more unhappy he became with me. It just turned into a vicious cycle because the more he ignored me the more upset I became. I wish things had turned out differently but they didn't. 

It was a revelation for me that my life has value even if he doesn't think that it does.",Most-Shock-2947,17sse1u

9,"He didn't listen. I kept telling him I need you to talk things over with me. He also never was ambitious, he liked to take the easy way out of things and he tended to avoid conflict at all costs. That said I couldn't even get him to talk to me about important life decisions and changes.

 It's really painful to see the contrast between how he talked to me before we got engaged versus the end of the relationship. I was basically talking to myself for an entire year and pretending things we're still going to work out somehow. 

Anyways I hope these discussions are at least helpful for others. Because our disorder tends to distort things and make us feel like everything is our fault, but relationships are always two sided, it's very rare that one person in a couple is causing all the problems by  themselves",Most-Shock-2947,17sse1u
10,"i understand this a lot. i’ve been in many situations where my SO just completely switched up after we got together. it’s like they just wanted the chase and after they got me they stopped putting in all effort. it hurts sm bc i always think it’s my fault and i did smth wrong to make them pull away. and the fear of abandonment doesn’t help at all either. and yes it does hurt sm too when your SO won’t try to solve any issues in the relationship or even hear you out. makes it seem as if they couldn’t care less about you or the relationship. also makes u feel like ur crazy or ur demanding too much of them when in reality ur j asking the bare minimum and trying ur best to make the relationship work. 

idk sometimes i feel so sad bc i think that pwbpd love so freaking hard and it’s rare to find someone who’ll feel the same way about us. but at the same time we often tend to attract partners who are avoidant attachment or have other disorders like eg NPD and then (for me at least idk abt others) the attachment to the partner no matter how toxic they are makes it sm harder to leave. ik i don’t even love this person and sometimes i don’t even LIKE them all that much but im just so deeply attached that i can’t leave even when i know how bad they are for me and my mental health. i just can’t stop making effort to make the relationship work despite it being a horrible relationship w a horrible person. i wish i wouldn’t get attached to ppl so easily and i wish i didn’t have this fear of abandonment it would honestly make things sm easier and i’d save myself from sm hurt",little7bean,17sse1u
0,Are you both in therapy?,heatforcemarker,188iqcc
1,"Here's some things I do since I've got into remission to ensure a relationship stays healthy

- Healthy boundaries from the beginning
- Have a life & identify away from your partner and maintain this throughout the relationship
- Don't rush! There's nothing good that comes from rushing a relationship
- 0 tolerance for abusive behaviour 
- Limit how much you see and talk to them (you don't need to be in contact every single day - the less the better) 
- Make sure you spend time away from each other with your own friends and family
- Be patient, honest, considerate, kind and understanding with each other
- Ensure you both continue to do therapy
- Keep doing things that boost your self esteem every day (meditation, exercise, journaling, developing skills, doing your hobbies etc) 
- Respect your partners need for space",,188iqcc

0,"The ego is blamed for a lot and I think it is often a lazy argument to do so. What does it even mean to say it is the ego? 

I don't think blaming the ego is helpful advice either. 
You say we desire attention but that doesn't explain quiet BPD. I'll take myself as an example. I isolate myself and I avoid building relationships due to destructive patterns. I have attempted to rebuild my life numerous times and aim for a practical living rather than a extraordinary one. 

Even though we have dramatic episodes we also struggle deeply with boredom. Boredom because we lack enjoyment in anything that we do and we never feel fulfilled. I don't see how that has anything to do with egotism. 

Sometimes the spark simply fades and we are unable to find anything that will spark that flame to invoke the motivation we need to be productive. 

Mental health is multifaceted and I think we have to be very careful that we don't simplify it.",SapienDys4,x4unbu
1,"The rumination and dwelling in the agony does nothing productive- I agree - unless answers and modification are discovered in the process. But many have tried everything, repeatedly and still feel the… ‘disconnect’ and the constant disappointing failure to ‘connect’.

Not that it’s easy or quick but I’ve been diagnosed for at least 5 years and if anything I feel like I’ve regressed in a lot of ways. I’m trying not to let this illness or any of my mental illnesses define me but I know deep down I feel like they just kind of do. It’s a hard mindset to get out of. 

However more than that I am worried about being burdensome and just missing out on my life. I’m already mourning certain relationships and points in life that could have been better had I sought help sooner and gotten a handle on myself. I don’t want to be looking at this time period ten years later and feeling the same. 

Best of luck with everyone’s recoveries. It’s not easy and I get what you’re saying OP.",nowaynotokay,x4unbu
5,"I don’t agree with this, that’s too simple. I also at times do not want to get better, but that’s not because I don’t want to lose the attention (I’ve been diagnosed quite lately and have always been „the popular kid everybody wants to be around“ if u like), it’s rather because I’m tired of trying. I feel like shit most days, but even when I was not that depressed, life wasn’t really fun. Why would I go above and beyond do get back to a life I didn’t enjoy? Sometimes it just doesn’t feel worth it. My point is that u really can’t generalise it.
Having that said, I think it’s important to keep in mind that BPD is not our identity, it’s an illness. At the end of the day we are responsible. Actions may be explained by it, but we shouldn’t use it as a justification to hurt others or to stop trying to improve our lives, even if it’s fucking hard from time to time.
I agree with your opinion on the tests, I don’t really think they do any good tbh.",Lemorotell,x4unbu
6,"I know there is considerable amounts of nuance, this is just my general experience as a pwBPD that I find a lot of other people I know with BPD also have experienced. I mention ego because the ego is self, self cannot exist without ego they are inseparable (I only frame it this way out of my belief patterns, so take that with many grains of salt)",very_responsible,x4unbu
7,"I know it is your belief pattern that is why I'm questioning it. It doesn't really pinpoint anything useful to say it is the ego or the 'self'. I could counter that by saying it is the brain and I have very little control over the brain. 

I don't think all of our actions revolve around seeking attention. I mean some of our actions are humiliating and degrading to ourselves. It does the opposite to garner attention. It repels people from us. That self destruction has numerous causes and those causes of occur in tandem. 

The self destructive behaviour occurs way before we even have a diagnosis of BPD hence why we receive the label based on an analysis of our behaviour. So it doesn't really make sense to say that we don't want to get better nor does it make sense to say that we create a identity around it. I can't imagine anyone would want to continue living like this.

I'm not sure it is attention we crave either. I think we crave love, respect and trust. We want a sense of security. We also crave a resolution to our pain and going long periods without any of these can lead to negative behaviour because we are looking for relief not necessarily attention.",SapienDys4,x4unbu
0,"So I'm someone with BPD, not in a relationship with someone with BPD. I'm sorry that this happened to you.

While hypersexuality and self sabotage can be found in BPD, I do want to point out that cheating is never okay, and that cheating is not really a symptom of BPD. There is currently no creditable correlation in BPD and cheating. I am also a bit confused as to why you spouse decided to cheat, but I don't know if anyone here could provide that answer.

*Some* flavors of BPD come with high risk impulsive desires. However, seeing that this was an ongoing affair, to me this sounds like this wasn't impulsive but that your spouse chose to be unfaithful because he doesn't respect you more than his desires, not because he has BPD.

You know him better than we do. But unfortunately I think trying to think of this as self sabotage is an attempt to cope by saying that this was something his disorder was controlling, and not him. You can't rationalize it, because it's not rational. 

I truly hope your spouse gets his act together, but more than that, I wish you the best in healing, and one day finding someone who respects you.",princefruit,1cn4sli
1,"Not a spouse, but as someone with BPD I have also experienced self sabotage and infidelity (previous relationship). I can’t speak for him but I recognize that for me it’s due to an intense, indescribable self hatred. A loathing of oneself and just wanting to ruin everything for oneself. The pain sometimes comes as a relief when you feel okay/sane/healthy for a while. Please know that even though it might not feel like it, he does deep down regret it. At the very least, regrets the pain he caused.",colorofyoursoul,1cn4sli
2,"Thanks for your reply. You would be correct that I’m looking for a rational reason of why he has made his choices, but just like arguing with him when he is drunk, there is no rationality present. I’m a ‘why’ person, so knowing his thought processes are skewed helps me process how we got here. Perhaps that’s not a healthy outlook tho. I had doubts about the marriage lasting anyway with his drinking, but I never expected infidelity. I def think the hyper sexuality applies to him though.",Vanah_Grace,1cn4sli
3,"His self loathing is very evident so I guess I kind of get that. My therapist (who has lots of experience with addicts) also said that in an addict is the belief of being not good enough so the self sabotage almost becomes a self fulfilling prophecy if that makes sense? 

I believe he regrets it, but his regret is not my concern.",Vanah_Grace,1cn4sli
4,"You're not wrong about skewed processes. BPD is a disorder that literally changes how the brain functions. The way he processes emotions are not the same on a biological level. That said, there are limitations to that. Impusiveness and hypersexuality might give someone the urge to cheat, but it doesn't control the act of cheating, nor does it magically strip logic and reason from someone. I would say that the urge to cheat could be led by his BPD. Planning and acting on that urge in not just a one night affair (which is also not forgivable) goes well beyond a BPD urge. That is a calculated, conscious decision to be unfaithful for a prolonged period.

The drinking certainly doesn't help.

Your soon-to-be-ex is responsible for his behavior and needs to get help to curb his addictions and get to the root of his own problems. Unfortunately, the 'why' can sometimes be as simple as 'that person has no love or loyalty for themselves and others'. Unsatisfying, I know. It fucking sucks.

I'm so sorry that this happened. I'd be willing to believe that \*maybe\* BPD helped start it, but your husband himself, as a person outside of his disorder, acted on it and maintained it. His BPD can't shield him from this one.",princefruit,1cn4sli

6,"I agree with you. Thanks for talking to me. The lying is hard as well. Two days before he declared he was in love with his mistress he gave me and my daughter (not his) this big amends speech a la AA style. Admitted he does not love himself so he cannot accept that others do… all the things I’ve needed to hear for a long time. And it was all lies.

0,"Why dont you let them form their own opinion about you. Cause what you are ""warning"" them of are just your insecurities, your view of yourself, probably a skewed description as well.

But the most likely scenario is, no one says anything at all and they see you for all the other qualities you have. 

I think insecurity in general can be a turn off and if its very personal information you are sharinf it can just feel uncomfortable.

7,"Yes. Im clear from the get go and talk casually about my bpd a fair amount. They deserve to know that the jealousy isnt their fault. Along with other traits.

Its also important to balance that with strength.

8,"I think there is value in sharing these things with people, but I agree with what people are saying about allowing people to form their own opinions about you first. after a while, I find that telling people about my ADHD is much less scary, and it helps to break the ice and gauge how people respond to neurodiversities. I usually share that after knowing that they're someone I could be longer term friends with, unless it comes up before then.

BPD is so tricky because of the stigma surrounding it, and honestly a lot of people hear ""personality disorder"" and panic lol. but I think once you've established a pretty solid friendship with someone then if you feel you want to tell them then you can. I think it's important to remember that you don't *owe* them that information, just like if it was a physical medical diagnosis. but if you *want* to let them know for yourself, then I'd say go for it!

it sounds from what you've said that you're in therapy and actively working towards getting better, and if you're transparent about that process with people then it can help break down that barrier and they may want to ask questions to understand more (if you're comfortable answering those questions of course). good for you for taking your counsellor's advice and making an effort to broaden your circle!",jetebattuto,177cv10
9,"No trauma councillor, mental health traine nurse, doctor or psychologist would mention connecting with  people with stable emotional systems.



That isn't a thing or even medically ethical. It would imply you or others are not. Given how BPD is, it's the last thing someone with a PhD would say. 

It's hard to reel moment to moment between emotions but if you have have been advised in that matter please find someone without ingrained ignorance. It's not their fault, it's taught. 

BPD is by discription volatile but it's the best way, I have found atleast, is to wait. Think and run every conversation through my head and relax.

11,"something about the ""regulated nervous system"" doesn't sit well with me, it's not something that i've heard of before or would rely on working

&#x200B;

Besides, people with trauma have a natural bond of finding each other. Trying to screen people for lack of mental illness or other traumatic events would be very difficult and unethical. Wouldn't the statement that being around ""healthy"" people imply that you should drop good supportive people simply due to a lack of ""regulation control""? Please don't listen to the full advice, i think expanding a social network is wonderful and can be very beneficial but not for help regulating yourself or questionable mentality.

&#x200B;

Look up dbt recourses you can find plenty for free that include skills like TIPP, STOP and other sheets that showcase things that will make you more vulnerable to more extreme moods or trouble regulating (alcohol, sugar, caffeine, lack of food) to name a few.

&#x200B;

I'm friends with many, actually almost my whole circle is somewhere on a diagnostic spectrum  with the most common being bpd, adhd and autism. Being around them, many of them in much less treatment than i have been through so far, is not regressing or causing me trouble regulating i'm sure many others would agree. And being around healthy, undiagnosed people does not make my symptoms any better than they were before. We are in charge of ourselves and our bodies and in tune to them and there are DBT skills that have been researched and used for years that have been considered the most useful to recovery for BPD patients. Please find a better therapist to work with if you are able to",Aqacia,177cv10
12,"I can't give you a perfect answer, but I can give you my answer.

There's no need to ""warn"" people you have just met, nor is there a need to warn people that only know you casually. I personally only let people know about my mental health issues if they are very close to me, as in a best friend/romantic partner. Then again, my BPD usually only affects people who are that close to me, and this may be different for you depending on how your symptoms manifest, so the rule I would set out is ""let people who will be affected know.""

The general population knows absolutely nothing about BPD, so if you feel the need to warn people that aren't that close to you, do not give them every single detail about BPD. Instead, simplify it to small statements like ""Hey, just letting you know it really bothers me when I'm left on read"" or ""hey sometimes I feel insecure about our friendship could you just offer some reassurance?"" Do not give anyone a crash course on BPD unless they are in your most inner circle of friends/partners. 

Even if you do end up needing to give someone a crash course on BPD, It takes years for anyone to know exactly how to treat us properly when we are episodic. It took my ex the entirety of our relationship to figure out what to do when I was having an episode. It's especially difficult for people to know what to do when you are just starting out with recovery. Do not expect people, even if they are close to you, to know what to do/how to care for you. Your base expectations should be that they know how to get you professional help when you need it most. No one can provide you therapy unless they are a therapist, so only expect comradery and support. No one can ""fix"" you except for you and your team of professionals. If anyone attempts to ""fix"" you, please avoid them as they almost always end up making everything worse. 

At the end of the day, you are just a human; you are not an atomic bomb. You do not owe anyone around you an explanation for your behavior, even if you have a mental illness. The only people that you ""owe"" any explanation to is your innermost circle.",Syphlin,177cv10

15,Lol yeah that's a good point. People would be a lot more likely to have patience or understanding around PTSD than BPD. Some of the things I've read about opinion perspectives on BPD are so crazy harsh and misinformed.,Nykai9385,177cv10

I think it's fine to be open about a dx publically on a dating site if ppl want but it should be for *them* and not because of feeling like they need a warning label and understand that there are risks associated with such. You have the right to protect yourself! 

Examples of risk of being public on a dating profile: Different diagnosis but someone was open about his heroin sud history (he's been abstinent for years) on a dating profile and a guy that sees him at work as a customer saw it, showed his profile to the manager in front of his coworkers  and they started to treat him so differently that he quit his job.",ikoihiroe,177cv10

I had to have the hard convo and opened with ""my mood disorder wants to eat you alive""",_-whisper-_,177cv10
23,"I understand where you're coming from, but I dunno. I can usually see signs of a person dealing with mental health without ever having a conversation about it. Personally though, I'm very intuitive that way when it comes to observing people. Not to say that I'm always right. It's just that since I've dealt with complex and comorbid mental health shit for so long, I identify with that part of people. 

I have one who would fall under the category of ""regulated nervous system"". He has a really good upbringing, is very successful. I think when my counsellor says regulated nervous systems, it is people who are consistent. People who are healthy to a point of being able to regulate themselves 

It's hard to put into words the way to tell. One thing I will say, I find spending time with people who have regulated nervous systems boring. There isn't enough happening. Their state of being stays more or less even/consistent during the duration of spending time with them, and my nervous system doesn't like it. It's too calm, and it's used to chaos. 

Which is another large part of the challenge. 

All that being said, it is a very valid question. And one that I will get more clarification on when I see my counsellor next",Nykai9385,177cv10

I think I know what you meant about feeling that “draw” to someone and it being just your minds way of recognizing trauma and being attracted to what’s known/familiar and being bored by others. I’m going to try to tune into this more. I was “bored” by my ex and I thought it was my first healthy relationship and I was so in love and fully invested in that man and then it turned out he was “boring” because he was hiding his true self from me including the fact he was cheating on me with multiple people.

Some people really fucking suck. There are still genuine  people out there. You have the awareness, and that's huge.

One thing I'm trying really hard to work on is trusting myself. I think most people are intuitive, but for one reason or another we block the responses that tell us when something is healthy or unhealthy for us. But I think that if we can learn to fully trust ourselves, we won't need to worry about trusting other people quite as much, because we will be confident to notice the signs, and say ""No, I don't want this.""",Nykai9385,177cv10

I struggle a lot as well since my therapist or the close relationship we have triggers my symptoms a lot.. but we then try to look at the experiences/memories/trauma of my childhood or youth that might lie behind it all, why I’m feelings these strong emotions like rage, fear, etc with her when she doesn’t exactly give me a reason (even tho I often have trouble seeing this and split on her anyway). I feel like this makes more sense since once you’ve somewhat tackled the issues behind it all it could help understand yourself and your emotions/symptoms better instead of just trying to dampen them. And then one may be able to distinguish between reasonable fear (because right in this moment something bad is happening) and projection a little easier and stop the splitting.. maybe.",juliennez,zptkp8

3,"Hi, I have been in remission for two years now. For me, remission looks like being able to function sans emotional outbursts, manipulative behavior, self harm, hospitalizations, suicidal attempts, holding down a job etc
I spent most of my life at rock bottom in and out of hospitals and with one of the most severe cases of BPD one could possibly  have 

However I still have identity problems, impulsive behaviors, still notice myself splitting (but don’t act on it) or feeling afraid in my new relationship, I still struggle with impulsive shopping and with substance use, and I still feel scared of my future and of the world a lot of the time. I still regress to childhood and I still have a hard time managing life’s challenges HOWEVER
I am no where near where I used to be and not at a point where any outsider could tell that I have once been diagnosed with severe BPD.

Does bpd ever fully go away? I can’t imagine never seeing some sort of residue of this diagnosis in my life, whilst I’ve managed to get a beautiful shot at a good life through years of dbt therapy and meds, I still have aspects of my personality that will always feel neurotypical and slightly symptomatic. The difference is having the skills and language to “outsmart” and “soothe” the BPD pain",Unfair-Commercial799,17rdsy1

Still, I have BPD tendencies and still had to tell this to my partner 😭 still, even with the recovery, I wonder if I’ll ever have a successful life.",Unfair-Commercial799,17rdsy1
8,"Thanks so much for your response. I’m making a video about recovery for my 2 year remission anniversary next week, and I didn’t ONLY want to speak from personal experience, so I’ve been doing a lot of research, and what you’re experiencing is common. Initial remission of symptoms is often based around behaviors like you’re saying - acting out on splitting, emotional outbursts, self harming, etc. But remission is only one aspect of overall recovery. 

Studies also talk about good social and vocational functioning making up recovery (stable relationships, stable job or ability to succeed in school), but there’s still a deeper level of recovery that includes these other traits - unstable self image, emptiness, fear of abandonment. Impulsive behaviors and are often a result of these things too.

In addiction, there’s an important distinction between sobriety and recovery. Sobriety is the first step, but you’re more susceptible to relapse if you don’t continue to understand and improve and heal from the root causes of your addiction through recovery. It’s a similar thing with BPD - someone is more likely to have symptom regression or relapse if they don’t go deeper with their recovery journey. 

There are definitely still aspects of myself that are non-typical, especially with the strength of my emotions. But I am truly comfortable with that now, and Ive solidified my sense of self and no longer feel emptiness. I’m confident I could now be securely attached with a secure partner, but I do still get triggered (to a lesser extent at least) with avoidant partners. I assure you that you can get there too, it just takes continued work and the desire to go deeper and deeper with yourself. This past year I’ve been digging at ROOTS of my insecurities that I previously missed, and I’m amazed at how much more healing I’ve been able to do. The work can be really painful for me, but totally worth it. 

Are you still in therapy (not DBT)? Congrats endlessly on achieving and sustaining remission, by the way. You’re an absolute rockstar.",SarruhTonin,17rdsy1
0,"I am today years old.. I was officially diagnosed today. Im 38

How the hell I made it this long is beyond me. But Honestly nothing else has ever actually made more sense to me. 

After watching and helping my wife find a Bipolar medication that works. I can attest to the concept that the complexity of the brain means that not all meds will work the same in different people. Some may work better or worse in two different people, 

With that all being said, there is no BPD specific medication because of the nature of the disorder. We can manage depression and anxiety, but DBT and CBT seem to be the best vehicle for recovery. What Im really trying to say is from my understanding is that those BPD symptoms you say persist, may never fully go away. But DBT and CBT can help us manage them.

I too was on anti depressants for 8 years and it didn't really do much about my symptoms.  If my depression was resolved,  my anxiety was through the roof.  If my anxiety was resolved, I was incredibly depressed.  If I had medications to cover both anxiety and depression,  I still felt very unsettled and couldn't figure out what else I needed. 

I have been in therapy on and off for several years, but without this bpd diagnosis, the therapy wasn't helping much.

Bpd diagnosis has been a life changer for me.  Better meds, focused therapy,  trying to implement more self care/ meditation/ grounding/ mindfulness exercises as a daily practice is also helpful.  Though I've got a long way to go. 

I wish I was diagnosed at a younger age,  or at least knew about this disorder earlier.

I think there is an idea with depression that we fall into a lethargy cycle of sorts. ""This means that people with depression are running low on fuel and they aren't able to do the things that would refuel them. This means they start running on even less fuel, resulting in a vicious cycle (this is sometimes called 'The Lethargy Cycle').:

I almost see it as sinking further and further into a depression hole and the less we do we sink faster. Somedays I feel feel depressed and maybe it lasts for up to a week. I notice when I do small thinks like clean my room, take out the trash, shower, or walk outside, these really small things, the depressions starts to lift little by little. As such, I feel in order to break this cycle, doing small things, even really small ones, helps you do the big things.

It is a force that we are working against, and that’s good news because there’s something we can DO if depression is not fundamentally *us*” 

I’m ecstatic to hear you’re coming out of your depression. Especially within BPD it can be such a brutal, suffocating, and demoralizing hole to be stuck in. 
I’m glad you’ve stuck through it and are still here blessing the planet with another beautiful soul. The pain you’ve been able to endure, deepens the ability to love and see the world in more complex ways. The world can always use more sensitive people.

0,"Oh hi are you me? Mom in my thirties with BPD and two young kids. Their dad and I are divorced. And I also have ADHD! 

I can tell you something that you probably don't hear often enough-you are giving them a better quality of life. You love them you're caring for them and you're getting help for yourself. You are doing great. 

As for specifics for conflict resolution, that can be tricky, since it depends on how they interact. For me, watching my kids argue and fight is hard because I never fought like that with my sister. I've learned that apparently it's not typical to get along really well with your siblings... My sister and I were probably just trying to survive the chaos of our home life. My kids feel safe enough that their needs are met so they can engage in sibling rivalry. Yay I guess?

Beyond that, ground rules are important. I have rules for all three of us: hands to ourselves, no yelling, kind words. I follow these rules as well, otherwise they'd never listen to me. I call them on it when they break these rules and if I happen to raise my voice they can point it out as well. When that happens I acknowledge it and apologize and move forward. Lead by example and all that. 

My kids are younger than yours, but I know my kids love each other. I try to see what's driving the bickering. Sometimes one just wants to play with the other and doesn't know how to just ask, or they've asked and the other said no. So I address it. ""look I know you wanna play with your sister but harassing her after she said no means she's gonna say no the next time you ask her."" Sometimes it's boredom. Sometimes I ignore the instigator and look to the other and say, ""you don't have to respond to that (whatever jibe the instigator said) you can just ignore her,"" because I know if it was me I'd ignore it. 

Sometimes they need attention, so without rewarding the instigator I'll try to get some one on one time with them. I'm a solo mom like you so I KNOW how busy you are. Sometimes I just need to take five minutes and be like ""hey come sit with me and look at these ridiculous cat videos"" or whatever and try to snuggle or just be close. 

That's all I got. Keep kicking butt!",blue_nirvana,wjp3tq
1,"You got a great response from a mom and I'm just some guy.  But fighting with my brother was part of why I got BPD and so I figured I would weigh in.  Hell, he even tried to kill me once.

one of my best friends also has bpd. at first it came with understanding but it was also evolving into a very toxic codependent dynamic where we were constantly finding ways to be upset at each other than ourselves

1,"Yes and no. My childhood bestfriend has BPD and two other girls I became close with over the last year have BPD. Two of those friendships ended extremely badly and one had to be put on pause for a while.

I could pick up on when to support them and provide the words I knew they needed to hear. What ended up happening was what the other comment mentioned, an unhealthy codependent dynamic. For the girls who weren't in therapy/receiving treatment, the friendship was extremely toxic and involved a lot of projected fears. It felt like nothing was ever good enough. Both girls ran when they messed up in the friendship. My bestfriend had an episode where we didn't talk for years but eventually came back together.

In my exp, friendships with other BPD sadly aren't very stable if they aren't receiving help. They start out great but so far, it's the same pattern of intense love, someone becomes annoyed, passive aggressiveness, a random fight (sometimes a made up one), and then someone cuts someone off.",Healthy_Art6360,1ccsdpg

I’d talk to my therapist about my mood trends, identify triggers and we’d reread journal entries from bad days where we’d identify what happened and how’d I’d do it again now that’s I’ve calmed down. I often forgot what I was thinking by our session so it was good reflection. 

I told myself I am a baby and I am a student. I am learning from square 1 because I never got the chance to learn. Told the people around me the same so when I’m as overwhelmed, instead of comforting me, teach me with understanding instead. It was taxing on them so I really appreciated it and would thank them constantly.

0,"Looking over your other posts, I'm going to offer you some hard advice. 

You've stated repeatedly that people in your life have told you they feel you don't care about them and only care about venting your own problems. 

Yet, you complain that nobody cares and loves you in your life. 

Have you ever considered that those are directly causal? Loving and caring relationships don't just happen out of the blue, they are a product of effort and action. 

I would focus on trying to listen to other people in your life sometimes rather than focus on your own issues 100% and in your words ""trauma-dump"". Relationships are give and get, so quite simply nobody will want to have a relationship with you if all you do is take without giving anything back (listening to THEIR problems). 

I think you'll also find that the more you alienate yourself, the more impossible it becomes to understand you're far from alone in feeling the way you do - and to be honest, it's quite narcissistic to believe that nobody can understand you. There's a reason being able to relate to people gives them great comfort -- they're not alone. This only comes with trying to listen and understand other people and relating it to your own issues.",maxcresswellturner,1b82jwx

So why choose that view unless you’re just wanting to feel the nasty feelings that hating gives us and we usually choose it because we are familiar with that instability. So this has nothing to do with roommate and so recognize it as your fix for emotional instability. But remember it’s default and you can actually reframe it as a choice and not let it happen by default anymore. It’s learning a new way and building new habits, new neural pathways. 
Do you choose self destruction or joy?
All hating someone else does is rob you from feeling your own love, your own joy, your own freedom. Is this roommate really worth your joy?

When you can slow down your thinking, you might find space between an event and your emotional reaction to take a beat to make a different choice in how you react. That’s it. That’s literally the whole point of learning mindfulness in dbt. It’s not asking you to ignore the human condition of endless suffering, or to pretend that bad shit never happened to you or even to pretend that bad shit isn’t happening all over the world *right now* but to use one moment in time to just chill the fuck out for a bit.",GargantuanGreenGoats,17el9fo

I understand that thinking this way is essential to reframe my own perspective, but I automatically feel guilty because I AM grateful and know I have a better life than most, and I still wake up wanting to launch myself off the fucking planet. And I also feel immature for feeling that way, like if I’m still sad and spiraling I’m not grateful. I have a gratitude journal, I try to practice it, but it isn’t enough most days and when I am spiraling that’s the worst thing someone could say to me.",,17el9fo

4,"I mean, I think it's important to remember that it's not trying to sweep the nasty bits of reality away. More to allow you take a step back and more properly assess the situation. One of the things that BPD can do is warp your perception of stuff radically (for example make it seem like people, that in reality care for and like you, hate you and that nobody cares for you), and often give you negative interpretations, that reflect negatively on you. There's often this perception that the truth hurts, so if you've come to a conclusion that hurts it's a 'harsh reality'. DBT skills can help with taking a step back and being able to assess the situation more neutrally. Obviously the truth isn't going to be all sunshine and rainbows and sometimes stuff is going to suck, but probably less often than we are incline to think.",Good-Ad-2978,17el9fo
5,"Your feelings and thoughts are completely valid, and I can relate to an extent. However, I think that the issue you're facing is, like, how much you identify with your thoughts. As humans, we are able to choose what to identify with. For example: our name is a part of our identity, it serves as a way for people to identify who we are and how to address us by name. That being said, it is possible to choose to change your name legally if you want to. My point is: you can choose to identify yourself with a thought, or not. Our thoughts and feelings are something that we can't control, they just come to us, but what we can control is what we do with them and how we react to them. Your mental disorder is not a personality trait and it does not define your whole existence, unless you want it to and/or choose for it to define you. Of course, with BPD (and every other disorder), there are times when we break down, when we are not strong enough to control our thoughts and feelings at that moment, and that's okay. However, I think it's important to reflect back on it once your head is clearer and analyze the situation. I'd rather choose the term ""self-awareness"" instead of ""mindfulness"", because it just sounds more accurate to me when it comes to the definitions for working on how your mind works, if you get what I mean. For me, there has been a pattern of thoughts and feelings that I would subconsciously let control my reactions, because they have been engraved in my subconscious from my childhood, so you could call it a comfort zone, even though it's not comforting at all. It's just how the young brain has been programmed, unfortunately, but, with that realization, I am aware of what it is and that it's not a part of who I am anymore. It's very difficult to reprogram the subconscious mind, especially if you have childhood trauma, but the conscious mind is also very powerful, and most of its power is in your own hands. So, whenever you feel frustrated (for whatever reason, be it the subject of your post, or anything, ever), ask yourself ""Why am I frustrated over this?"" And do it as if you are your own psychologist, in a way, try to ask it in a rational way and think about your answer in a rational way, as well. Try to observe your thoughts without judgement. You are not disregarding your condition by trying to work on yourself to feel better. You are not disrespecting your endurance through whatever trauma you went through by deciding to work through it and become a better version of yourself. This is a work in progress, for me also, and it's not easy, but my advice to you is to not attach to definitions or to what people say or to what you read on the internet. Sit with yourself and listen to what comes from within you, without any judgement. I hope this helps you gain more perspective, I know very well how it is to lack perspective that is outside of my own ""bubble"", so to speak.",BelladonnaCherry,17el9fo
6,">Should I accept that mindfulness/DBT isn't for me, or should I try to overcome this resistance I have to it?

What is that if not a living example of DBT lol. You're mindfully investigating a question and looking for an answer between 2 extremes. You're literally doing dialectics right now.

\>A part of me wonders if this reaction to mindfulness is just an immature reaction

Why is that ""immature"" (answer: it's a phrase you use to invalidate yourself for some reason). We react to change, we react when we have to move away from what's familiar, whether that ""familiar"" balance point is socially accepted or not.

7,"Your post reads like an autistic person struggling with PDA, pathological demand avoidance. As an autistic person myself, I’d call PDA a pervasive drive for autonomy. I don’t think you’re content in your suffering. I think you’re having intense emotional reactions in response to a “demand” threatening your autonomy. I used to think the same way. To be blunt it sounds like you don’t want to meditate simply because everyone else is telling you to do so. Seems like you’re grasping at straws and trying to prove You Don’t Want DBT simply because you have an overwhelming need to be in control. I was only able to begin meditating after I learned I struggled with PDA. I have a pervasive drive for autonomy because I spent a majority of my life fawning. Maybe you could try to start deconstructing that, first. Also— I started taking propranolol. Lowers my blood pressure and takes away the physical symptoms of anxiety.

8,Building new routines or trying new things is difficult for anyone and something that I really struggled with especially with mindfulness. Week after week my homework assignments would be trying out different techniques and I just couldn’t get myself to do it. I just wasn’t “the kind of person” who practiced mindfulness even tho I knew all of the potential benefits. Then my therapist said “Maybe you could pretend to be the kind who practices mindfulness” - specifically yoga is what I wanted to try. And something about that phrasing and mindset changed things for me. In “pretending” I became in reality someone who practiced yoga/mindfulness. And it has changed so much for me.

I also understand feeling defensive; I felt that way when reading about DBT on my own time. ""Why should I be learning emotional regulation when hardly anyone else around me bothers to practice it?""

It’s not to sweep or avoid, but to become aware of what is truly happening in front of us. Feel the ground beneath your feet and tell yourself what you see in front of you. Speak your feelings out loud to yourself.

Why should I go on medication to stop the way I feel or change the way I think, to just shut off my feelings? It’s *my* brain and this is how it works, there has to be a reason that I feel this way, so *why aren’t my feelings valid?* 

Truthfully, I still do not understand. I do tell myself that this isn’t a productive way of thinking, but I also feel like this is some kind of conformity and it makes me uncomfortable.

You're not sweeping the bad shit under the rug. Yes the world sucks and SOME people do too. You're not saying all of that is okay in mindfulness, you're just saying you don't want to be miserable about it all the time. Because spending all of your time angry at the world actually doesn't do anything to make the world any better. You can't fix jack shit by being angry all the time.

It also doesn't mean others don't have the responsibility to change or own up to what they did. But you can't change others by being angry all the time either. 

Can't stress this enough: You're not DENYING reality, you're just choosing to be happy DESPITE the world trying to keep you down. Stewing in it is completely useless. Yes, call people out if they treat you badly. Yes, do what you can to make the world a littlest better.

19,"I think you're misunderstanding what mindfulness means. It's not about changing the way you think or suppressing thoughts, it's about being aware of your thoughts/feelings/reactions. 

Example: when my partner doesn't clean up after himself when he makes lunch, it makes me feel really mad. It makes me so mad that I want to go nonverbal and anger-clean, while making lots of noise so that he notices. I stop myself here and recognize that isn't a practical or healthy way to manage my feelings. Boom, that's mindfulness. Then I ask myself what I should do instead. I text him and politely ask him to clean up after his meeting and go do something that takes my mind off what upset me. This example of mindfullness didn't stop me from getting angry, but I recognize what (to me) is a healthy way of dealing with these emotions. 

Another example: I go out and take myself on a date. I am having fun and suddenly feel self concious. I ask myself where this shame stems from. Is it because I look lonely to others? Do I feel like this is a weird thing to do in our society? After I recognize where this bad feeling is coming from, I work against it in my own mind to build a poisitive or empowering narrative instead and go from there. I can feel the shame for as long as I want, but typically it doesn't feel good and I am just analysing in my mind the pros and cons basically.",kayaem,17el9fo

I think we have a different view of what *good enough* means.  What I'm saying is that to be *good enough,* you have to be in motion. You have to reach, strive and improve constantly to be *good enough*. Stagnation isn't met with impunity. The people who are stagnant are *harshly* punished in life. And sure, you can rest or take a break, but only with the implication that you have to keep going at some point. 

That's what I'm bucking against; the neverending grind for improvement and growth. My anorexia was the same; that illness constantly moves the goal posts so that you're *never* enough just as you are. You can always lose more weight, eat less, train harder, until you suddenly die.  

Isolating is unhealthy, so you have to live in society, but to live in society you have to constantly improve, advance in your job, meet the next milestone or you'll be shamed and seen as undesireable. Of course you can let what other people think slide right off you, but if you do it too much and try to live as your true self, you'll be shunned for a myriad of reasons.

Finding balance seems impossible right now. I truly appreciate you trying to change my mind.

One thing that helps me is forcing myself to do something I enjoy, like watching a movie, reading a book, playing video games, etc. I have an MFA in Creative Writing, and I love to write poetry and nonfiction articles for children. When I was in grad school, I had to do critical analysis papers on poems and craft my own poems. I knew I was following my heart by learning as much as I could about poetry. I always found that I can express myself so much better through writing poetry than I ever could just speaking. However, once I graduated, I started making less time to write instead of diving into it. Then, when my mental health started to get really bad and I had to go to the hospital for the first time, I just started to lose myself and the interest/motivation to do anything. It is still hard, everyday, to get myself motivated and feeling OK. Some days are ok, and some are not so good. However, no one has good days all of the time, and I know the crappy feelings will come and go. 

My point, is to find your passion, if you haven't already. Take a step or even a half of a step towards doing something that you love. I know it is so hard to start and focus on anything when I am depressed and have no motivation. However, I have learned that if I really push myself to just pick up the pen, open the notebook, and just write a few words, I start to get so focused and immersed in what I am writing that I am not focusing on how empty and depressed I feel. 

Same goes with reading for me. I used to read books all of the time. I have so many books that I hope to have a little library/writing room. My boyfriend and I just moved into this cute, old farmhouse. We are fixing it up and making it our own. My boyfriend promised as soon as we finish our bedroom, we will work on an office for the both of us. He is going to build bookshelves so I can finally have all of my books in one place! Lol 

If you already found your passion, force yourself to do just one little thing towards fulfilling it. If you are still searching, force yourself to try some different things. Look into different hobbies. Find something that when you are doing it, your mind is so immersed jn it, that your mind can't think of all the anxieties and worries. Your mind can only fully pay attention to one thing at a time, even though it seems like it is running wild with a million things all at once.

I hope this helps! I am currently going through a depressive episode. My mom is in the hospital and I am really worried about her. Plus, the stress of dealing with my symptoms of BPD and just trying to function normally is like climbing Mt. Everest right now. My therapist is teaching me that I have to know when I need to rest mentally and physically and to not feel guilty about it, and when I have the energy (even an ounce) is when I  have to push myself. 

I wish you the best! Hang in there! We can get through the feelings one minute at a time. Hopefully you have some coping skills you can use to help. Just know you are not alone in this!",Fit-Mall3857,rfx8zw
2,"Just got diagnosed with bpd today by a psychiatrist after a suicidal episode from a simple criticism that I took out of context. But one of the symptoms I can relate to the most is the lack of motivation. I procrastinate so badly because my motivation is non existent. Some of the other symptoms like paranoia, anger outbursts and personality changes also regularly get to me. Some days I wake up all energetic and great and others I wake up with no energy extremely angry and impulsive.",CaptainnnK,rfx8zw

4,"Motivation is the ability to hold a thing in your mind. [most reasonable video about motivation](https://youtu.be/3QWIxElEnc8)

It’s understandable that people with bpd struggle with this because we’re working toward controlling our emotions and developing a stable sense of self. An idea to do something (workout, etc) is very easily kicked out of our heads if we cannot say “i workout because this is who I am.” or “I am going back to college because I am a smart, capable person.” when so much of bpd is chronic low self worth and letting emotions drive our decision making.

1,"Some organizing thoughts that help me when I get trapped like this (no, you're not the only one!):

1) will this bring me ease in the short term to the cost of the long term? If yes, I should not do that thing.

2) do I feel smug, bitter, petty, vindictive about one of the options before me? If yes, i should reconsider whether there's a REAL reason to pick this path, not one that's centered around my feelings about someone else.

3) am I in a high state of agitation? Super happy, depressed, angry, empty? If yes, take some time to rebalance and come back to the decision with a clearer head.

My brain plays tricks on me constantly, and when I set a boundary, I feel like I've done the worst thing in the world and that I just hurt the person I set the boundary with, like I'm not allowed to, and usually try to walk it back... even if they agree and understand.

It's very frustrating. 

I will quiet my emotion mind and put my rational mind to work in the background while I do something else. Eventually an answer will come, and (right at that moment) I will think it is wise mind.

I just figure the more I practice, the more I'll recognize my rational mind trying to take over without considering the emotional component and then reassess.

1,"Thank you, this is exactly what I needed to hear",jugstheclown,yeoruf
2,"I definitely think that’s possible. :)

I think the mot important thing is trying not to only go to your FP (I think this holds true for romantic partners in general) to get your emotional needs met. Make an effort to maintain and nurture other meaningful relationships, friends and perhaps family. Make time for them, take part in their lives, let them take part in your life. Share both positive experiences and struggles with them. For me the danger in these co-dependent relationships was that my well-being depended almost entirely on this one person and that’s not fair to either party. Humans are social creatures and we thrive when we have a community, a strong support network — emphasis on network. An FP isn’t a support network but a support string and when that string is strained too much, it snaps and you plummet. So build and take good care of your network, it’s so enriching to share your life with different people. :)

In terms of identity, I really recommend simply trying out different things and being curious. Think about what things have interested or intrigued you throughout your life and rediscover or try them out! Try to cultivate at least one interest or hobby that has nothing to do with your FP, something that you love simply for the joy it brings you. It can be really anything, just be curious! If you don’t know where to start, ask your friends what they like to do in their free time. That’s a two for one, strengthening your non-FP relationships and getting inspiration for new hobbies. 

Finally, if this feels weird at first, you’re heading in the right direction. You really have to make an effort to sometimes go against the impulse that tells you “I NEED FP, FP IS THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS, FP FP FP” and that will feel weird at first. But it won’t always feel this way if you stick with it, I promise you. 

Proud of you for making an effort to be less dependent, that’s genuinely a huge and scary step. But you can do this, and I promise you, it’s worth it! :)",Budget-Astronaut-660,yeoruf

It takes a lot of patience but I’ve met a few really nice people through that. :)

Another option is going the hobbies to friends route. I met a girl at a free tryout class for pole dancing, then met other people through her and so forth.

We're like onions, see... or maybe trees. We don't lose our early, inner parts as we age. We grow new layers around them. When we take damage to our core, it sticks with us like an infected abscess until we either heal, or it bursts.


The trouble with BPD is that the wound is so deep we become disconnected from the source of those feelings. Imagine having chronic pain in a part of your body you couldn't identify. How would you treat it?


The cycle will keep repeating itself. If you could just stop, it wouldn't be a disorder. The goal isn't to stop. The goal is to make progress. Allow yourself to fall, as long as you're falling forward. If you learned something from a bad experience, then you're not actually falling back to 0.

2,"Hey, I feel for you. I've been in remission for 2 years and study the hell out of BPD, and it does absolutely get easier. It's absolutely awesome that you're making progress, so just know that recovery isn't linear. I remember having setbacks like that and thinking the cycles would always continue or that I wouldn't be able to have close relationships (since they were my biggest trigger) and I'd have to chose recovery over connection. I was wrong. If you keep trying, you CAN break those cycles. 

Some people think the best people with BPD can do is learn to control symptoms and behaviors, and that's certainly a first step, but recovery can be so much more than just a remission of behavioral symptoms. Further recovery can take other elements (specific to you) besides traditional BPD treatment to get at the root causes of your symptoms and truly heal.

I have a YouTube channel where I talk about BPD, remission, and other elements of mental health/wellness and self improvement that have contributed to my recovery if you're interested. www.youtube.com/@SarruhTonin The Remission video or BPD Advice Parts 1 and 2 may be especially helpful for you right now.

Please keep trying. Do your best to acknowledge your successes and resist thinking that setbacks erase that progress. When you fall, practice climbing out quicker, and keep working towards learning not to fall down those same holes. Learning self compassion was the biggest game changer during this part of my recovery. It's way easier said than done, but practice makes perfect (or better, at least). 

Trust that you can keep improving. Rewiring our brain takes a lot of conscious, repeated effort over time, but it's completely possible. Keep going, you'll get there. Best of luck.",SarruhTonin,19a61ca

Didn't help her that her coming out as gay just made everything worse.

Many of the people I saw in the forums would say that's disrespectful to the partner/relative/friend and self centered, a manipulation, cry for attention whatsoever. Truly the worst. Even good strategies or skills are treated like its something bad and of course meant to hurt them. As if taking some time in distance isn't a completely normal and good way to deal with an overwhelming situation.

I sometimes get the feeling that it's not about what the people actually do but only about what their diagnosis is. If a mentally healthy person does it, it's considered alright, maybe even good. If someone with BPD does the same it's immediately something evil. You can always interpret something bad into every action if you really try even if it's not the truth.

So sorry this is a problem for you too 🤍 like, it feels almost invalidating to my improvement in a way. As if pwBPD are some sort of ""thing""(?) to them and not actually, you know, people. I can't really find the words to express this feeling, but it is certainly there.",helpingtobehelpful,x8afhy

1,"I know it's not much help, but I can relate. I'm in my early 30's as well, though my illnesses have held me back from achieving much of anything. 

The best thing I have found to help is to try and look at my own situation as if it were a family member's experience (or a friend, or someone else you tend to look at more empathetically than yourself). If my sister were diagnosed with the things I am and she was struggling with shame, SH, etc, what would I say to her? I'd say, ""You're doing damn well and I'm proud of you. You're carrying around this burden that beats you down and wears you thin, but it's not stopping you. Of course it feels like it's slowing you down, and some days it does, but you're achieving difficult things everyday. You're strong, even on days when it feels like you're not.""

When I discuss my feelings of shame with my chaplain at work, she sometimes replaces my mental illnesses with physical ones as an example, as it seems society views them a little differently. If someone in your shoes was not where they would like to be in life because they had been coping with MS, what would you tell them? Those words of advice and encouragement are equally applicable to you or anyone who is going through something mental rather than physical.

Rachel's therapeutic experience was both unusual and serendipitous. She actually encountered an MH professional who seemed to ***understand what BPD really is*** and what the person ""infected"" with it ***did and didn't get in infancy, toddlerhood and the pre-school years*** that left her stuck in a furball in Erikson's first four [stages of psychosocial development](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&q=erik+erikson+stages+of+development). 

Again IME, the borderline ***grew up in a world that was deaf, dumb, blind and senseless to the very young child's dire need to feel seen, heard, felt and sensed*** by those upon who that child depends for its very survival. When that happens, the child's *body* matures, but it's *brain* remains jammed full of neural networks that know little or nothing about being comfortable in one's own skin. 

The vast majority of licensed psychotherapists *still* I encounter to this day don't really get that because they blew through Child Development 501 and 502 ignoring what people like Donald Winnicott, Margaret Mahler, T. Barry Brazelton, Daniel Stern and Alan Schore wrote about years ago in books *few of them had time to read*. 

(Do our psych schools turn out competent ""jungle guides"" or do they turn out licensing-test-passing ""mechanics?"" Forgive my digression.)

(Let's not even talk about the mechanical nature of [EMDR](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&q=eye+movement+desensitization+and+reprocessing).)

4,"You got it! It really sucks when this happens. I know it firsthand :( It happens a lot to those of us with BPD and it sucks every single time...But, honestly, I think you're in a really good place here! No joke. The reason why I think that is because you just got handed a really valuable piece of information by this friend! You now know something specific that you're doing that is driving people away. That's huge! One problem with BPD is that because we're so scared of abandonment, we take everything as an attack on ourselves. It makes sense, right? We're terrified people will leave so any time something seems even a little off, we get scared and assume we did something (because we have pushed people away and we are currently pushing people away). So, we shame ourselves. We think ""this person told me they feel like they're walking on eggshells around me (literally had someone tell me the exact same thing a couple years ago!)"" and we view it negatively because on the surface, it is! We lost a friend again because of this stupid thing in our heads. It hurts. But it's REALLY useful for us! Especially because, as you said, you've been struggling to fix things and get better (which, that's so great for you! So many of us hate ourselves because of BPD but we rarely do anything about it, so great job for even trying! That's so huge!). But when these types of things happen, what's the internal messaging we give ourselves? ""I suck"" or ""I'm bad"" or ""I'm worthless"" or any number of things. And when we shame ourselves like that, we see ourselves as completely 100% bad. We split on ourselves. When we shame ourselves, we destroy any progress we've made until then. All this stuff it sounds like you've done for yourself so far becomes meaningless when we shame ourselves. So, don't view this as a shameful thing. It sucks and it hurts, but it's really valuable for you! You now know something you can do to be better and you can stop it from happening again! That's way better for you! So, don't allow yourself to see this as a step back. This is PART of your progress! This is just the next step you need to take! You ARE finding stability and healing for yourself! And this is another part of it. This is life telling you where to go next! That's what everything that happens with our BPD is: just information on what to fix next. I was exactly where you are a couple years ago and I felt the exact same way. I thought everything I did was useless because I just couldn't keep relationships. But now? I have tons of VERY meaningful friendships and my BPD is under control. It doesn't get to rule me anymore. One of the major reasons I did it is because I was able to stop shaming myself and see these events like losing a friend as learning opportunity to know what I needed to work on next. You can do it, too! I'm not special by any means and that means you can do it if I can. Cause you're not special either, sorry to say haha. You're probably not some uniquely terrible individual that can never succeed. I'd bet you CAN succeed and now you have the next step to do so! So, don't allow this loss of your friend to destroy everything you've done so far. It doesn't. In a weird way, it's adding to your eventual victory over BPD. You're lucky because now you have something to work on

So there's my rant haha. But I really do think you're in a great place here no matter how much it hurts. It's ok to feel that pain and live with it for a bit. But once it's done, get back on the improvement train. You're working on your BPD and have worked on it. Don't stop yourself from working on it again. You CAN do this!

Ok, enough motivation haha. WHY did this happen to you? Well, at least for me, it was because I had a very fragile sense of self. Everything was threatening to me because I wanted to be liked so bad. I would get upset at my friends a lot because I felt like they were attacking me or making fun of me in a mean way or whatever and I'd get upset. Usually with anger, which was just masking my fear of them leaving me (anger releases norepinephrine which acts like a balm to the unpleasant emotions like fear or anxiety. It's the same thing that happens when we almost get in car crashes or someone cuts us off in traffic. Fear, then anger). I remember I left those friends for like 6 months and when I returned, we had a group chat and I read a lot of the messages. They mentioned the eggshells more than once and they were just confused about why I was acting like that. It all came back to the fact that I wasn't comfortable with who I was. I had made SO much progress and was starting to see real benefits from my work (first girlfriend for example) but I wasn't comfortable with me yet. Once I realized they did care and what they said was in good faith and that it was ME taking things poorly because of my fear of abandonment (with a little boundary setting that they respected), things got better. When they would make a ""mean"" joke, I would make one back and they'd just laugh with me and that was that. It taught me to like myself a bit more and be comfortable with who I am, because if I'm not, I'll lose more people. Maybe it's not the same for you, but think about why it happened with this friend and how it was connected to your fear of abandonment (with BPD, it's ALWAYS abandonment).

1,"It's possible she's worried about accepting such a stigmatized diagnosis, so maybe working on breaking down the stigma, showing her BPD positivity/non judgemental recovery resources might be a step towards her accepting the diagnosis and a push towards recovery. It's not a magic bullet obviously, but I know a lot of people have trouble acknowledging they have a disorder that's been so maligned by the psychiatric community and society more broadly, which can hinder people's recovery.

Show her love and patience, especially when it feels like patience is running thin.
BPD , addiction , everything else that comes along with this.. it's hard. It's hard and on top of it it's stigmatised, even within the medical field. 
If her mum had it, there could be a fear there of repeating behaviours that hurt her from her mum (this is just an example, I could be wrong, but I would not be surprised if there's generational trauma there). This could be further making acceptance difficult.",180boneless,18n8rfy

0,"I don’t know what your level of problems is because obv I don’t know you. But 12 years ago I was drinking a fifth of whiskey *every day,* doing multiple drugs on a regular basis, and s**cidal every minute of every day. I got sober through a 12-step program and got a lot better, but still had anorexia and an exercise addiction. The combination got so bad that I was consistently tearing muscles because I was so undernourished. I went into intensive outpatient treatment, continued to work with my therapist after it was over, and I got better. 

I still struggled a lot with anxiety, depression, s**cidal ideation, intrusive thoughts of SH, and wicked rage fits. I started doing EMDR and got diagnosed with ADHD and BPD. Got properly medicated. Am still doing EMDR and I’m getting better. 

I’m not recovered by any means. In fact, I’m spinning out a bit digging into the trauma in EMDR. But compared to where I was 12 years ago, drunk and high all the time and actively avoiding unaliving myself, and where I was 8 years ago, starving so bad my body was literally breaking down, I’m downright stable. 

I think my shit was pretty bad and it’s not so bad today. Sometimes I feel pretty okay and am not tortured by my brain. Sometimes I’m not okay at all. But those days are fewer than the okay days.

1,"There’s a moment in Douglas Adams’ “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” where a society built the most sophisticated and powerful computer ever created so it could answer the most important question in the universe “What does it all mean…Life, the Universe, and Everything?” and after 7 & a half million years it finally finished its calculations and had The Answer to The Greatest Question…and the answer was “Forty-two.”

I get into my head and become lost in my thoughts all too often.  I feel like I’m the only one who can see the destination and how to navigate the pitfalls and dead ends in order to get there safely and efficiently and I exhaust myself trying to explain to everyone else how to get where we’re trying to go and what to do whenever whatever needs to be done happens.  
Sounds really simple to me but it must sound like “42” to everyone who isn’t me.

The point is, as a pwBPD I have looked to external sources and other people to give me the attention, affection, acknowledgment, validation, connection, intimacy, love and so many other things I want/need/crave/deserve…things that I feel I shouldn’t have to ask for.  And the more I understand the relationship between myself and my BPD the more I realize how much power I give away, the power I let the actions/inactions of others have over me and how I feel about myself and my life.  It’s no one’s job to love me or stay with me…it’s not the job of any person to make my emotions go away or make me feel worthwhile or loved.  

It’s mine. I’m responsible for learning about my BPD and practicing my DBT/CBT skills and learning how to manage my mental health and emotional well being as intentionally and consciously as possible.  I can inform people that I love and care for about my BPD and direct them towards resources so they can understand my neurospicyness and how to be better equipped to the experiences of my perspective.

Those who don’t want to don’t have to can leave (I hope kindly) and those who don’t want to but choose to stay in my life…well I don’t want people like that in my life anymore so I will tell them kindly to leave.

The ones that want to learn, and do …they’re in my life because of me, because I am learning about me and I am choosing me.  They see the me I know I truly am because I am learning how to see myself through less trauma scarred BPD tinted glasses.
They are the ones that I have wanted in my life all along and they will be in my life because they learned the why’s and the how’s of the way I see things just as I learned",BlackoutBarberJ,14ttxv2

0,"One of the biggest cons of DBT is that it is not built for getting to the root causes and traumas that caused BPD to fester.

You are definitely not alone—a lot of mental and physical exhaustion is something I deal with too. I can't remember the last time I felt rested.

You may want to check other things that could be adding to it. I always recommend going to your doctor for blood work and a thyroid test. A hormonal panel from your OBGYN is also a good idea. This can catch deficiencies that might be making the problem work. Also, as basic as it sounds, these things add up, so: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep a night, Make sure your diet includes whole foods and proper nutrition, try limit your caffeine and alcohol consumption, take breaks from phones and computer screens, especially when you're winding down for sleep.

You're taking the right steps towards recovery. I think exploring trauma based therapy or other styles of therapy that dig into the root of the disorder is the smart call. You've got this!",princefruit,1bzpq8o
1,"Thank you for this incredibly kind and thoughtful answer to my post, it really warms my heart.

It is validating to hear you say that about DBT. The therapists at my clinic seem to think it's the be-all, end-all of borderline treatment and that's not what I've been made to understand either.

The food stuff is hard to get right, I used to suffer from a really bad eating disorder with a focus on extreme control and now it's like I've gone to the opposite and a single tiny bit of attempt at regulating my eating makes me panic. But I'm also looking at getting into a new eating clinic to help me with this.

I'm sure it'll get better, I just have to keep sticking with it.

2,"I respect DBT's success in the treatment of BPD but I agree that it's very much seen as this cure-all, when it's not. DBT made me worse if anything else. But not all BPD is the same. Plenty of people have critiques about DBT. I think in this instance you're doing the right thing in listening to yourself about what you need. We're individuals who are always changing—and it's natural that at some points our therapy needs will change too!

As for both BPD and the eating habits—be kind to yourself. Healing is never linear and recovery is a slow, slow thing. Your struggles are valid and again you're doing a great job at understanding what you can do, versus what may not be safe for you to do currently.

It will get better, yes. And sometimes you will take two steps back, too. Remember that's part of the process. Stick with it. Your self awareness, being able to understand your own thoughts, strengths, weaknesses, and you being active in getting yourself in the best position to heal shows how far ahead you already are!

When you speak to him approach it like, “hey we haven’t spoken in a few days and I just miss you.

Well then I’m gonna be a damn good mother of my own child. I won’t have a happy life? Fuck it, I’ll just run away or something. Me personally, I’m not the best pep talker, but me I just kinda laugh at hard situations like this you know? Pretend it’s a sitcom. When characters on tv have a bad day, you can’t help but feel sorry for them but still laugh cuz it’s ironic how bad everything goes right? But all series and movies have a good ending, and if not it’s just the first in a trilogy or something. What I mean is that you don’t have to live up to your own expectations. Do things on a whim, have fun. Cuz if you’re like me and just wants to end it all, the it doesn’t matter if you just live your life being happy now! It all will work out, one way or another.

We're def no contact now, and I've gone as far as deleting my social media accounts to deter myself from lurking. I know all it does is hurt me, but I just can't help myself. I ask myself the same question: Why can't I get over this? And I think it's because I saw myself in him, or I saw all the things that I didn't have in him. I used to think it was because he made me feel like no one else had, but in actuality, he's just everything I wanted and wanted to be. 

I still miss his presence. When it gets overbearing I listen to the playlists he sent me or add to my endless document of unsent letters. I remind myself of all of the bad times, and how hard it's been to miss him longer than I've seriously known him. But I find no shame in nurturing the feelings I once had, and remembering that it was an experience, and he's just a person-even if he was my favorite.

Do not panic or let anxiety consume you, its okay. Your family, Therapist, and us are here for you.

\> Is recovery possible?   
Yes, DBT has a 77% success rate after a year only where patients dont meet BPD criteria anymore

\>Or will these issues bother me for the rest of my life?  
treating the symptoms of BPD can be effectively managed, monitored, and ultimately reduced in intensity, or entirely eliminated.

\>I told my parents but they weren't too sure on how to react.  
Its shocking on parents, especially whom arent educated. Give them time, they love you unconditionally and will support you throughout your journey. It is just something foreign for them as mental health for our parents is either a taboo subject or something never brought up in a household when they were nurtured. 

\> Any help, tips or support would be appreciated.  
Dont let the term BPD or the diagnosis consume you, and always try to focus on breathing whenever you feel like panicking. We are all here to support you.

1,"I second what was already posted. The heart of BPD is that we struggle to regulate our emotions. They’re very strong and overwhelming, and a lot of our unhealthy behavior is driven by the attempt to regulate our emotions and feel in control again.

DBT is all about learning basic skills to regulate our emotions. You will be able to feel in control of yourself and able to find peace amidst chaos whereas now it may just feel like drowning. 

Recovery is absolutely possible. 

I think I was worried about my parents’ reactions as well. It’s natural to want reassurance after sharing such big news. I literally just told my parents, “Part of this condition means that I am often, by default, afraid that you will stop loving and accepting me.

To be honest my explanation is a bit lacking but im sure the internet and your therapist are more helpful in explaining than I do.

6,"Absolutely you could potentially benefit. A lot. And pretty much immediately. Ketamine actually is frequently given in ERs when they get patients who are suicidal or self-harming. It just makes those feelings disappear (in my experience). 

It’s a dissociative psychedelic analgesic so everyone’s experience is different— but they all share the relief of almost all physical pain. Some people only need to do it once or twice and it alleviates depression or other symptoms permanently. Others (like me) benefit from a weekly treatment— it can be intense (in a good way), profoundly liberating and/or help you to zero in on exactly what you need/want from life again. 

I completely connect with feeling like an emotionless husk with a body and no soul. And when there is a soul, every moment of existence is agony. I feel you. 

Ketamine is a game changer, but of course there is no one size fits all medication. Some people hate it, I’m sure, some people it just makes them sleepy, but the only way to know is to try.

Remember that the immediate psychedelic effect can be quite a ride for some people, but it only lasts for 15 min and then things chill out (not like mushrooms or whatever at all where you’re tripping balls for hours). Generally you’re supervised in clinic for a couple of hours. 

I’m someone who gets anxiety now from even just smoking weed and Ketamine treatments are something I actually look forward to.

Something else I should note is that the experiences I have from week to week actually vary significantly. Sometimes I cry, sometimes I laugh and am joking around, it all depends. 

Let me know if you give it a go. Do you have access?",vinoprosim,vffmgi

8,"So you don't have clinical depression, just BPD, and ketamine helps to resolve feeling like an emotionless husk with a body and no soul? And resolves the fact that when there is a soul, every moment of existence is agony?",,vffmgi
9,"Oh, yeah I have clinical treatment-resistant depression. As well as clinically diagnosed BPD, GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), ADD, and PTSD. I also get non-epileptic seizures and have chronic nerve pain and TMJ in my jaw so it’s a fun basket of issues! 

So in addition to my Ketamine treatments, I’ve been evolving over several years with trial and error with different medication to treat my complex set of symptoms. Currently I’m prescribed Lexapro (for major depression and anxiety), Lamotrigine (mood stabilizer), Adderall (for ADD), Gabapentin (for anxiety/major depression/nerve pain/seizure prevention) as well as Baclofen (for TMJ). 

When even through ALL THAT I started self-harming again after being stable for a couple years my new psychiatrist recently added Rexulti (an antipsychotic that’s also used for easing borderline symptoms especially mood stabilization as well as treatment-resistant depression) at the same time as the ketamine treatments. 

Funnily enough that seems to have done the trick so much that mild side effects of depression have become my most pronounced symptoms, mainly resulting in tiredness. The shame, pain, guilt have faded to whispers in the background that I can more easily not let dominate my mental state if I’m distracted. 

Tiredness being my main problem now I’m ok with if it means I don’t wake up dreading every hour, every minute, every second of existence and wishing I could disappear like a ghost with no one remembering me so that it wouldn’t hurt them and I could end the brutal suffering. 

Everyone is different, but I will say the Rexulti and Ketamine seem to have helped both my depression and BPD significantly and other people in my life see it even more than I do. My thoughts have gone from crippling “I wish I could die, I can’t stand the thought of making it through another day and I am an enormous burden to the few people who care about me, I should cut myself” to something more like “life sucks, but it kind of does for everyone, and it sucks more for me in lots of ways, and I’m sure I’m a terrible person but at least I’m trying to get better. And at least food doesn’t taste like cardboard anymore and I have so much gratitude for everything I do have, even if it comes with horrifying guilt.” 

6 weeks ago I was literally drowning, and now I feel like I’ve been thrown a lifesaver ring. I’m still in the water, but at least I’m not going under.",vinoprosim,vffmgi
10,"To add to that, ketamine is used for treatment-resistant depression and PTSD patients too. It is definitely intense, but if you ride the wave, it’s actually a fascinating “break” from depressive symptoms because it is a dissociative. 

Ironically being a dissociative means the experience of ketamine may feel like a complete detachment from the environment and the “self” — and the extent of “ego dissolution” during treatment is actually directly associated with more positive outcomes on the patient’s perception of their life post-treatment. [Sauce 1](https://revitalizinginfusions.com/why-we-strive-for-ego-death-with-psychedelics/)

It’s notoriously difficult to put any “psychedelic” experiences into words (and I’m even a professional writer!) but a rough translation is something like… you cease to become an emotionless husk during treatment because there is no “husk” to be emotionless. You’re sort of not a person anymore— just a free-floating entity simply experiencing. What you experience is going to be completely subjective to what your brain decides you need. I couldn’t even begin to put what I actually experience into words. Well, I could try, but I would sound like some insane hippy burnout. “There is no ‘I’, you’re just one with the cosmos, dude.” 

During my last treatment, one phrase I kept thinking was “wow, this is like a spa, but for the brain instead of the body.” Another metaphor: our brains— much like muscle tissue— can get fibers and fascia tangled and twisted causing severe pain. Ketamine feels like a deep tissue massage at a spa, it can be uncomfortable as hell to iron out those knots, but at the same time pleasurable. Sort of like that pleasurable soreness after the gym. You come out the other side feeling more centered after having had a “brain vacation”

Neuroscientists are still figuring out how exactly ketamine does what it does. According to Harvard Health: 
 >*One likely target for ketamine is NMDA receptors in the brain. By binding to these receptors, ketamine appears to increase the amount of a neurotransmitter called glutamate in the spaces between neurons. Glutamate then activates connections in another receptor, called the AMPA receptor. Together, the initial blockade of NMDA receptors and activation of AMPA receptors lead to the release of other molecules that help neurons communicate with each other along new pathways. Known as synaptogenesis, this process likely affects mood, thought patterns, and cognition.*

So you can relate to feeling like you have no self, no personality, no soul, no emotions, and excruciating psychic pain that makes you want to die and you found ketamine helpful for that?

0,"Hi op, I just want to say I relate very much to feeling negative about having BPD and finding out that it’s one of the most intense awful mental illnesses and you can have your life expectancy shortened. Though, that is the negative, and seeing as splitting means seeing only in black and white, I decided to look at some positives that helped me cope—

-we are extremely empathetic and compassionate, we can be very creative, we can be emotionally intense, we can be intelligent and insightful, we are immensely loyal, we have an eagerness to soak up information, and we deeply value our relationships with family or friends even if we split sometimes

-also the information about having shorter life expectancies is because many cannot get treatment or help, and unfortunately, many take their own lives which is why our life expectancy is statistically shorter then others.

-don’t believe everything you see from a google search, it will make you spiral, and you are seeing things in black and white, like I did before :( 

-and I’m not sure what your therapist is talking about, all respect to her, but you CAN go into remission. With enough therapy, support, and a willingness to find good coping mechanisms and endure, you can get BETTER. I know this because I have a friend who is going through remission and her symptoms are lessening. She has been struggling for years with bpd, and she hopes that one day, she will be marked as healed. Maybe she will never be cured, but she is recovering. There is hope for you and me op!",BedazzledMushroom,13mzn4m
1,"I felt compelled to write a response after reading this: 

""My therapist explained to me what BPD actually is and what that diagnosis means. She also told me that it can't be healed, only treated and that it will be a long and Rocky way to recovery.""

You need a new therapist. A psychiatrist diagnosed me in 2019 and prescribed me an SSRI. It wasn't the right path for me, so I decided to go see a therapist last year. I can tell you that it took a lot of hard work, but like any disorder (e.g. OCD, anorexia, hoarding, Tourette's) you CAN learn coping mechanisms and exercises to regulate your emotions so that you can build relationships. I no longer consider BPD to be a mental illness like I did back in 2019, thanks to my therapist and wonderful podcasts like Back from the Borderline. Every time I hit a roadblock in therapy, I will usually say ""Its because I'm Borderline!!"" and he will shake his head, and say ""I really don't like your old psychiatrist. Because that diagnosis boxes you. And you are not ever going to fit into a box, we ALL are complex and multi level humans.""  

While there is no ""healing"". It is also not simply explained as illness. We are complex human beings and there ARE gifts from having deep feelings. You can and will get through this.",Tankadin,13mzn4m
2,"Woah! Your therapist sounds pretty misinformed. BPD absolutely can go away and actually has a better prognosis than many other mental illnesses. Many people will no longer meet criteria after a year of treatment and a majority of people diagnosed with BPD no longer meet criteria in 10 years even if they don’t receive any treatment. 

It’s a very intense illness and treatment is hard, but you absolutely can live a stable, happy and functional life.",ChinchillaToast,13mzn4m
3,"My psychiatrist told me I had BPD about 10 years ago. I resisted the diagnosis very heavily, because of the impact it would have had on my career.    
As I've grown older (54 f) the diagnosis has helped me understand more about who I am and why I behaved as I did when I was younger. It has helped me put events in my life into perspective and that has taught me how to avoid some of the poor decisions I made in the past. If someone were to assess me today, I doubt BPD would be the diagnosis, because I have lost / learned to moderate its worst aspects. When something goes awry these days, I know to take a breath and think first. DBT & multiple rounds of CBT have helped, even though I was deeply sceptical when I first went into therapy.   
It's interesting that you mention the menopause, because I'm menopausal and oddly I'm not a raging hormonal wreck as I know can happen with menopause. My BPD has almost certainly been tamed, but I don't know if that's related to my ovaries withering.  
BPD doesn't need to define or restrict your life in anyway. I've been married, raised a kid, held down a good job, enjoyed life etc etc. Anything you want remains possible. Living with BPD for 40+ years, without even knowing it existed, I just thought I was odd compared to other people. My diagnosis simply explained to me there was a reason behind me behaving strangely sometimes.   
One thing I think my BPD has given me, as a positive, is that I am more of a risk taker than people I know. Not in the sense of drugs or alcohol or dangerous activities (well, not these days anyway) but I do have more of a sense of ""fuck it, let's give it a go.""  That's given me a really diverse career and set of experiences and other benefits in life. In that sense, BPD has been a benefit :)",Ill_Platypus_810,13mzn4m

5,"I understand negativity. BPD doesn't have a magic cure. It doesn't have a daily pill that makes everything better. But it absolutely doesn't mean a lifetime of suffering and all the rest of that! 

BPD has a really bad reputation, but now that you know what it is, you have the choice to treat it and improve. Your research isn't wrong, untreated BPD can do a lot of damage. But a lot of untreated disorders do a lot damage. Research NPD, ASPD, schizophrenia, schizoaffective PD, drug and alcohol addiction, or any other addiction. 

At my worst, I was an alcoholic/addict, homeless, jobless, and had alienated everyone in my life except my mother. Today I am in a longterm relationship that is healthy, I have friends, I own a home, and I just started a job recently. If I can do it (with depression, BPD, DID, and fibromyalgia), there's hope for everyone with BPD.

You can have a good, healthy life. The road might be long and rocky, but it is a path forward.",CheshireGrin448,13mzn4m
6,"I don’t believe the narrative that BPD can’t be healed and that it means you will suffer for your whole life. I have only been in DBT therapy for 2 years and my whole life has changed. Noticing your triggers may not make them go away, but your reactions to them will lessen in intensity and so will your anger. I think therapists that are lazy will always proclaim that BPD is the worst and can’t be treated. The fact is that it can be treated but it is a lot of work. There are days that I was my absolute lowest during therapy and quitting my addictions and what I can tell you is, keep on keeping on! Treating BPD means you have to dig through the trenches of your life and understand why the feelings are there and validate them and then Reteach yourself a better way to behave. It is certainly possible. I am in a great relationship (still have the triggers but I react more rational and we have boundaries and rules for when we fight) we just welcomed a new baby into the world at 24 weeks old, being a micropreemie and our NICU journey has not torn us apart or led me back to my addictions, we are stronger together. He is my rock through out. I am a good mother despite what my brain tries to convince me. If you can’t hold down a job, be okay switching jobs, go into a self made career like photography or travel agency or something where your character traits can be utilized not criticized. There are so many beautiful ways to live with BPD. When I first got diagnosed I felt so sad and so afraid but now I know I am not my diagnosis, my diagnosis explains HOW I am not WHO I am. 

You will face extremely hard days trying to recover, they will not last forever. Take a nap, journal all your feelings, go outside and be away from people. Every day is a new day with new feelings. You can do this. Fuck anyone who tries to stigmatize what you feel. Nobody can understand BPD or what it’s like to live with it, but the truly wonderful ones will try to. 

Stay away from people who manipulate your feelings and you and find the ones who will love you through it all. I’m living proof that it does get better, we do deserve to feel loved and can, you can have children and experience true joy and happiness. 

Good luck OP and always feel free to come back to the group if ever you forget anything in these comments. We are always here. 🫂❤️",MindingMyOwn2021,13mzn4m
7,"Sadly most therapists are misinformed! Sigh. I’m so sorry about what’s your therapist said. It is most common misunderstanding about BPD itself. I’m disappointed. We need to reeducate to these therapists. Often it is overlapping between BPD and NPD. That’s why it’s common misinformation between BPD and NPD. There are most people who have NPD, most likely have BPD. 

I don’t think you have NPD because you’re willing to find help and try to heal.

8,"Well you can choose to take the diagnosis and stew on it, cry woe is me and let the diagnosis control your life; or you can try to look at it positively. 

For years I wondered why I felt the way I did. Why was I the only one who felt like everything was a major deal? Why was I the only one that would go through explosive rage episodes? Why did I always feel incomplete? What was wrong with me? In a way, when I got my diagnosis it was almost a relief. It meant there was a reason for all of it, how I felt and how I existed had a name. While not completely understood, it was a recognized medical condition which meant there were resources and help available. Now that I knew what was wrong, I could finally make steps towards improving myself and my life so I didn’t always have to be this way. 

While I still have a long way to go, I have gotten better thanks for finally having received my diagnosis. I became a sponge and absorbed all I could about BPD to better understand the disorder and thus be able to better understand myself, and it’s helped a great deal.",Neikitia,13mzn4m
9,"Something that might help.  A lot of posts on this group talk about the stigma that relates to BPD, and to be fair there is a certain stigma that is sometimes or even often associated with the diagnosis.  However, as you, the actual person think of it like this.  A diagnosis is a starting point in which a therapist or other mental health professional can use to find an appropriate pathway of treatment.  In a medical sense there are a variety of treatments and therapies that are often associated with various diagnosis that historically provide the most success to a patient.  But in some ways the actual medical diagnosis doesn't mean a ton.  Someone who is diagnosed with BPD has probably already been experiencing a lot of the struggles that are commonly associated with the diagnosis.  For the you the person, your goal should just be to do the things that you can and should to help you live a healthier, happier and more fulfilling life.  There are a variety of therapies and treatment options out there that though none will technically ""cure"" bpd, when actively practiced and followed can truly let you live the kind of life you want to live.  By no means does a BPD diagnosis make you worthless, or bad or anything like that.  There are plenty of people who have BPD that live very happy and successful lives.  It may not be the easiest road traveled, but if you're committed to working at it, BPD doesn't have to be a life sentence to poverty, early death or any of the negative things you posted about.

10,"Hi there! Like others here, I get why you're feeling down about this diagnosis. It can feel overwhelming, especially when there is so much negative information out there.

The prognosis for BPD is actually better than previously thought, and as studies like [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4500179/) one mention, receiving treatment is a *huge* boost to seeing improvement over time. It's also possible that when your therapist said there's no ""cure,"" she meant it in the sense that BPD isn't something you can easily control with medication, but instead treat into remission through therapy, which can be challenging (esp. if you also have trauma to address).

&#x200B;

It's absolutely possible to see improvement over time and to live a fulfilling life! Sometimes treatment can be hard, because it can take time and progress is not always linear, but it becomes really rewarding when you grow, learn more about yourself, and find healthier ways to navigate your emotions. I got diagnosed pretty early, and while I'm not completely recovered, in my late 20s, I find that I am able to maintain relationships and advance in my professional life in ways I couldn't have even five years ago.

Yeah there are different strains with different effects, but if you're trying to get a handle on your anxiety, just don't because it's not worth it. One mislabelled batch and you're full of anxiety. If you're having trouble sleeping, try other, safer methods (like melatonin), if it's to help you relax, try other coping mechanisms that you've learned in DBT or with your therapist. 

Also I don't know if you have or have ever had problems with drugs/alcohol, but the mindset that weed is a safe drug is so damaging. It is safe, if you don't have underlying issues. Anyone predisposed to addiction can form a dependency and while pot doesn't alter chemicals in your brain to cause an addiction, you can become dependent on it for other reasons, and that's not healthy because then you're using it to replace healthy coping mechanisms.


ETA: If you're really looking for a way to relax and don't want to trigger your anxiety, try CBD oil or gummies meant to help you relax. Helps you settle down but doesn't make you feel high.

I can use cannabis all day every day and really only get some laggy feelings but if I have more than maybe 2 drinks of alcohol I can have intense anxiety and depression for days after.

Strain and THC/CBD levels are a huge factor. If someone were to ask me if they should try CBD during treatment I would say absolutely because it has the healing without the psychoactive compounds. THC I would recommend against because it can be used for numbing and tuning out rather than dealing with the deeper issues.

20,"That's been my experience before, like it has allowed me to look at situations from a different perspective and understand how my actions have impacted others. That's actually how I got into therapy, was because of the perspective weed has given me.",cuntaur,d8hjkr
21,"I treat it like an analgesic drug, something like a morphine. It can be abused and will be if left uncontrolled, but at the same time it makes you available for needed gut surgery. That's why exclusive medical usage of it in therapeutic sessions can be justified.",,d8hjkr
22,What’s your take on prescription drugs?,afterschoolish,d8hjkr
23,"That's really helpful advice, a lot of the stuff I read online about affects of weed applies probably mostly to neurotypical people.",cuntaur,d8hjkr
24,"Not OP but a strain that is massively helpful to one person can be not good for another.  We have a desperate lack of research and unless you are getting it from a dispensary or a grower someone may just say that a strain is something so it moves quicker.  

Indica's tend to be soothing more of a couch lock kind of high and sativas give more of an energetic creative high and seem to be some of the most anxiety inducing, depending on the person.  Like OP's partner I choose edibles because they tend to give more body high which is what I am mainly looking for.  

Since you live in CA it might be in your best interest to ask around at well reviewed dispensaries. Do a lot of reading about the science of cannabis so you can better understand the pros and cons. It is a drug and while mostly harmless for those with mental illness it can be a nightmare if used incorrectly or excessively.",626-Flawed-Product,d8hjkr
25,"I'm not against it, per se, I think it can certain positive applications. But it terms of treating BPD, I believe it's better to work on the mimd we have rather than altering it.",washie,d8hjkr
26,"I think medication can very helpful, so long as it's not used as an avoidance mechanism. In general, I think things that get a person high are a means if escape rather than dealing with the real issues.",washie,d8hjkr
27,I can't do any better than this. I agree 1000% about going to the dispensary. Let them know what symptoms you're concerned about and what you're looking for in your experience. That was how we figured out what worked here and even that took some trial and error.,RaceskarDriver,d8hjkr
0,"Idk if it's normal but I think I stopped having full on FPs two years ago or so. It definitely makes me sad sometimes because I think I'll never gonna be able to love someone like that again, even though it's probably healthier",StellarSzintillation,u30r7a
1,I guess the goal in recovery is to not have one.,selvitystila,u30r7a
2,Yes lol. You don’t need to be obsessing over someone at all times. I’ve gone years without one.,whitedoggal,u30r7a
3,There’s some people with bpd that never get Fps at all. So yes there can be periods where you just don’t have an Fp.,YeIFeelLikeFishNarc,u30r7a
4,"I less obsess over a person and more hyper fixate on one hobby or interest at once. A band, a movie, television show, crafting, whatever it happens to be. I don't really person obsess anymore. It might be because I'm in a stable long-term relationship...? and I feel fulfilled in a personal 'fav person' type way?",okay_jpg,u30r7a
5,"Yeah, I've now been almost 2 years without an FP.",willothewispy,u30r7a
6,"I've been about two years without one. Still grieving and obsessing over the last one.

At times it feels amazing. At times it feels empty. I have only myself so when I'm doing well that feels really good and safe. When I'm dysregulated I become a mess and it's very empty. Having an FP to obsess over helps externalize those feelings to someone else perhaps. They were responsible for me feeling safe and happy, or sad and abandoned.",Uniqorn993,u30r7a
7,"having a fp is not even in the diagnosis. Don't worry, there's no normal or abnormal. I haven't had an obsession for someone in years and i still have bpd",crayoww,u30r7a
8,"I’ve gone almost two years now without a FP. While one side of me is nervous I won’t ever experience that sort of emotion/infatuation with someone again, the other part of me is relieved. I don’t think I ever want to let myself get to that level of dependency on someone ever again. I’m so much more at peace when I simply just don’t have a FP.",pifrancesca,u30r7a
9,The times when I didn't have a FP are when I've felt the most sane.,Witty_Summer2219,u30r7a
10,My FP is my favourite actor. That way I’m very rarely disappointed and get excited to watch their new movies/tv shows.,NotoriousJAM,u30r7a
11,"Never in my life had one and the older I get the more jaded I get with humans in general so it only gets harder to become ""obsessed"" with someone.",randomBPDacc,u30r7a
12,"Yes, I used to not get them at all because I couldn't form meaningful relationships. I've had like 3 in my entire life.",,u30r7a
13,I went like a year w/out interacting with my old fp and it made me feel very vacant and then I picked up a new one pretty quickly as soon as I had the option I feel like in the interim I attached to ppl I couldn’t see in real life that were on YouTube or whatever that my old fp had known,brie4784,u30r7a
14,I have not had one since I was 14!,nothingt0say,u30r7a

17,"My fp was my best friend and roommate. Then he got a job and I was without one. Then I dated someone who was my fp for over a year. Since we broke up over a year ago, I've been without. I think it's common to be without, I think it's just the tendency to overvalue one particular relationship.",foggy-sunrise,u30r7a

19,"My ex was my fp, and was for a while after breaking up. It’s been about a year without a fp, I sometimes get depressed but it definitely is a healthier way of living",VanillaExtractt,u30r7a
20,"I dont have a fp, unless you count my 7 year old, but honestly I just think that's mothers love. My partner isn't my favourite person either. I just don't want to act like that because of a person. It took work, and trauma to get me here, but I think we all should strive for healthier attattchments",jaycakes30,u30r7a
21,"I don’t know. I kinda have like two 1/2 fp’s right now so I don’t drive either of them crazy with my obsessiveness. Both are my best friends. I think about them a lot, but don’t feel the urge to span text them until they text back lol mostly because usually one of them talks to me when the other is busy 😂",piercemyclit,u30r7a
22,never had one.,,u30r7a
23,no i’m the same way! i realised i’ve stopped having a FP too,Unlucky-Scar-3594,u30r7a
24,"it definitely is normal! Yes its a huge bpd trait but its not a criteria, its not an ""essential"", and sooooo many people with bpd dont or never had an fp. I can definitely understand why you would feel empty from that as i have felt it before, but trust me when i say its kind of a blessing because having an fp has made every single thing so much worse for me and i genuinely feel like it is the worst part of having bpd, in my personal experience. 
tldr; its totally normal, and its quite good you havent experienced the obsession",mrian221,u30r7a
25,"First things first - Normal is only a setting on a washing machine - I have to constantly remind myself of that fact.

To your question - Yes, I feel very empty without a FP

I currently am intentionally going without an FP as I know that when I do I leave my wants and needs at the wayside. I **HAVE** to be alone at this point to be able to focus on myself and getting Me to a place where I am able to have a healthy relationship/friendship.",depreavedindiference,u30r7a

28,When I have more relationships I’m able to balance my feelings a lot better so that’s what I’m trying to do,brie4784,u30r7a
29,wow thank you for putting all the effort in this reply! i actually relate to the things you said and i also fill the void in me with shopping (which is obviously not good for me but every time i do i just don’t care because i tell myself i’ll be dead in 2 years anyways),sorry_idk_her,u30r7a
30,Was that a conscious decision for you? For me it just kinda happened and I went numb...,StellarSzintillation,u30r7a
31,"Yes same happened with me, after that if anyone tried to get close to me it just felt very weird and uncomfortable but there were some exceptions, like good small talks, where I'm completely open and would prolly never see that person again.",agonybreedsagony,u30r7a
32,Damn. I'm really scared of that never changing for me tbh,StellarSzintillation,u30r7a

34,I'm glad you're so at peace with yourself and your life!,StellarSzintillation,u30r7a
35,"Yes after cutting everyone out bpd is hardly a problem. What i don't understand is what I wanna do in life, when kids/teens were polishing their hobbies and finding things that they'll happily do for eternity, i was busy just to make it through one day at a time, those people are just so far away from me in life. That's where I'm lost at.",agonybreedsagony,u30r7a
0,"I mean, humans are social by nature. It is literally build into our instincts. I don't think you can completely get rid of that need. 

In my experience, when I felt the least need for friends or anyone else was when I had a work environment that required me to work collaboratively with a closed group of people and also forced me to go to other social functions--then I got socially burnt out and actually loved my alone time.",AnjelGrace,swln3a

2,"I don’t like most ppl… no one in real life has time anymore (I get it, but doesn’t make it hurt any less). When I’m lonely I go on Reddit or TikTok… usually I see ppl on TikTok that remind me why I don’t like ppl and the loneliness goes away the more buttholes I see",Themadnater,swln3a
