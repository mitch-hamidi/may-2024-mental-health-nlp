1,Solely relying on medicine.,"Has anyone else caught themselves relying solely on medication to help them? I was diagnosed in October and put on Latuda in November, which made me a raging asshole and I genuinely couldn't feel anything. I was looking for fights all the time so I got with my doctor and asked to be taken off so she switched me to a new one in February, Lamotrigine. It's better, I feel my emotions but they don't seem to be as intense. So far so good. But, my partner brought it up to me last night that ONLY relying on medicine to be the ""be all end all"" solution is only going to set me up for failure. Also that being said, there apparently isn't a designated medicine that was designed just for BPD, so my doctor literally said she's going off of what they ""think"" could help. It's also been recommended I do DBT. But it's almost like, I don't want to put in the work to get better. I just want the meds to help. And I know it doesn't work like that but how did you finally get it through to yourself that you do actually need therapy or DBT? I've been pushing it off because I just.. don't want to but I KNOW I need too. How do you get out of this cycle?

I know I should take them, I just don't, and while I imagine I'd be a lot happier with them, I don't take them anyways. I honestly, can't get myself to be motivated enough to take them; it takes me an hour or 2 to even get out of bed after waking up, and I usually wake up al 10am to noon.

15,Medicine & Therapy - Should I try?,"I‚Äôm F(20), and I feel like something‚Äôs missing for me to function like a ‚Äúnormal person‚Äù (if that makes sense).

I was diagnosed with BPD last year when I had a manic episode and I lost control of my life. I lost a friendship or two over it (probably 3 or more). I damaged many relationships for sure. I was in and out of hospitals like you change your underwear. As I was in each hospital, I never took the meds. I didn‚Äôt think or believed I needed them. I didn‚Äôt think I had a problem. I saw how the meds were making other patients feel and dictate, and it was not the way I wanted to be. 

When I returned home, I was having impulsive feelings to do whatever I wanted and go wherever I wanted. I did this to the point where I didn‚Äôt know how much it affected my parents and sisters. I eventually stopped going out on my own terms (literally). I took a break from college (I still haven‚Äôt gone back & don‚Äôt plan on it); I isolated myself from friends and family (even when family came to visit, I hide in my room until they leave or not text my cousins); and I had to be forced to go outside, whether it be to go shopping or get gas with my mom (little rides here and there). I developed social anxiety to the point where I don‚Äôt know how to speak to people (and I used to talk to anyone and everyone, I would be the one to start conversations with strangers). 


Growing up, I was always against medication. Never liked it, I always thought home remedies were the way to go. Even if I had pain, I never used painkillers or anything to heal it. I always stuck it out until it got better. But sticking out the pains of BPD aren‚Äôt helping me.

Even though a side of me is still scared to try pills, the other side of me wants to try them.

As for therapy, I miss having someone to talk or vent to, but then again, I would need to find a therapist that I‚Äôm comfortable with. I know this post is out of place and there‚Äôs probably information missing or things don‚Äôt make sense, but feel free to ask away and share suggestions.

18,Medicine,"I‚Äôm sure this has been mentioned before, I‚Äôm just too lazy and tired at this point to look any further. 

I‚Äôve been with the same therapist for a little over a year now.  She‚Äôs seen me when I‚Äôm doing good, she was there when I got really bad and had to go into a hospital.  For the first time, she‚Äôs seeing the downward swing and how bad things can really get before I do need to be in a hospital setting.  

For the past year, almost every week, I hear the same question(s): when I‚Äôm on medication, it‚Äôs am I actually taking it. When I‚Äôm not doing medicine, would I consider and make an appointment.  

It‚Äôs frustrating and I‚Äôve tried to explain many times my grudge against being medicated.  I always turn into a mindless zombie, tired constantly, weight game, and the mood stabilizers flatline me so bad I feel absolutely nothing.  

I get it. I‚Äôm up and I‚Äôm really down.  If I could find something that worked and didn‚Äôt have awful size effects maybe I could stick with it.  But it seems like any doctors I‚Äôve seen just want to drug me into an unfeeling oblivion.  

Is it possible to work on issues with therapy alone and not be medicated?  She especially worried now because I‚Äôve been beyond depressed and I‚Äôve expressed that I just don‚Äôt want to be here anymore.  I have been able to come back up from the crippling depression many times on my own. It‚Äôs hard as hell, but I know eventually I can do it.  

Is anyone else fee the same?

This routine of staying at home, being bullied at school and feeling bad from an early age due to family problems led to a decrease in my social skills and a giga depression, symptoms that were revealed at the age of 13 when my parents realized that I was hurting myself and They took me to a psychologist (after a long screaming session)

To this day I have been to so many psychologists, I have changed medications so much and this has made me very tired, currently I am only taking medication and have given up on therapy and I am once again in that state of being at home, because I was expelled from the school I was studying at, and my parents don't let me leave the house anymore (not even to buy bread or cigarettes like they did when I was in high school)

I never felt any improvement in the disorder, in fact every day I feel worse and being stuck here I'm thinking more and more about dark things, trying to keep it together with cigarettes and drinks since the medicines are practically an addictive candy with no effect for me (it isnt helping me but my body cant let go of the medicine)

71,Is it sometimes particularly difficult for you to interact with medical professionals?,"Dealing with mental health concerns for such a long time, I‚Äôve had so many bad experiences with doctors and in particular with the medical triad of doctors, insurance, and pharmacies. For example, I had to pay out of pocket recently for my medicine because I couldn‚Äôt get a prior authorization in time, due to the prior three entities basically having no decent systems in place to foster quick and clear communication with one another. Or having to go off my medicine cold turkey when I was pregnant. In general I don‚Äôt believe a for profit healthcare system is conducive to providing good healthcare for people. Add in the stigma in particular with BPD and I find myself with a short fuse with medical professionals. There seems to rarely be room for compassionate care. I‚Äôve had so many experiences at the pharmacy with techs just being so cruel or indifferent when there is an issue with your prescription. I‚Äôm on a high dose of Effexor, and the withdrawals are absolutely brutal. So sometimes my baseline for interacting with anyone in medicine is skeptical at best.

I‚Äôm a single mom who works two jobs and is solely responsible for everything for my daughter. Today I needed to ship things out for my job, pick up her medicine, prep her, etc etc. honestly, I completely forgot her appointment was today until last night when I checked. I was up late crunching numbers trying to pay what I could on credit card debt and just knew her appointment was this week-so thankfully checked and even checked with the pharmacy last night to make sure her medicine was ready. I felt proud like hey, you‚Äôre stressed but you‚Äôre doing it. I completely forgot about the Saran wrap part. 
 I just have SO much going on, even though she is in kindergarten there is legit so much paperwork they send home EVERY DAY. I‚Äôm sure the allergist sent home a to do list and I remember thinking ‚Äúdamn I don‚Äôt even have Saran Wrap at home that‚Äôs so much to do‚Äù and mind you this was the SECOND appointment for her test. I‚Äôve never had to bring my own supplies to a doctors appointment before and honestly it seems like they should just send you home with the wrap if it‚Äôs that important. 
Either way, I forgot. And it‚Äôs been a perfect storm of a day. The mail lady came hella early which she literally NEVER DOES so the package I absolutely needed to go out today wasn‚Äôt ready. I‚Äôve been consumed with my daughter having trouble in school and trying to work with her teacher on behavioral issues. I have so much going on in my head and it‚Äôs all equally important. My brain is just constantly at capacity and there is only so much I can hold up there. 
So here I am thinking despite it all I make it to the appointment with cream applied an hour before, and we get called in and the lady immediately goes ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt wrap her arms?!‚Äù And my stomach just sank. And just the way she worded it with how I was already feeling, I felt like come on lady can you give me a break and not speak so accusatorially? I told her I forgot but the cream had been applied correctly. She said we could try it but it wouldn‚Äôt work without wrapping it and laughed. So I just said well why would I do that if it‚Äôs not going to work? And she‚Äôs like well let me go get you another instruction sheet hold on.  And I‚Äôm sitting here thinking lady, I guarantee I will never forget to Saran Wrap my daughters arm when medically necessary again after my entire day was essentially wasted for a test that can‚Äôt be done now due to this wrap. And I just felt so defeated. The woman at the front desk saw me leaving and reminded me of the instructions I was waiting on and I told her I didn‚Äôt need it. The amount of paperwork, forms, patient portals, school apps I have to use is beyond excessive. She said well do you want to reschedule and I said no not right now, I can‚Äôt afford to take time off work and pull my daughter from school right now again. My daughter told me I was being rude and we should wait, but at that point I was just exhausted and left. 
I guess I was rude and I know it‚Äôs my fault, I just wish maybe they could have been a little more understanding and empathetic. I just feel like a loser, a failure, and a bad mom. 
All of the things I have to do still today I can‚Äôt fathom doing them but they have to get done. I just needed to get that out.

73,UK BPD people: what benefit is a diagnosis?,"I'm in the UK and suspect I may have BPD but don't have a diagnosis. My experiences with NHS mental healthcare have always been underwhelming, if not horrifying and damaging. I'm going through something of a crisis at present. I was recently bounced around a variety of services until someone told me I should see a private therapist for long term therapy. I'm looking but the selection of therapists near me seems very low quality; I have trouble seeing any of them being of help to me, except to drain my bank account of that pesky money.

I'm wondering if it's worth going through the struggle of getting a BPD diagnosis and what that would get me? I've tried anti-depressants in the past and always had horrific experiences so I'm not interested in medicines at all. I'm wondering what the NHS can offer except drugs? Does the NHS offer long term therapy to patients with BPD? Do they offer DBT?

88,BPD and needing to be medicated. ,"Hi, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm alone in these thoughts or if other people with BPD also think like this.
I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder a year and a half ago. Before my diagnoses I did not take therapy serious, I was VERY toxic, always screaming, throwing, being violent with my words and actions. 
The testing for it was LONG! (As we all know BPD is one of the hardest mental disorders to be diagnosed with. ONE OF, not THE) 

After being diagnosed my treatment with my psychiatrist, doctors and psychiatrists definitely changed and became more serious for myself and them. 
My mother had schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder. She unfortunately passed away from an overdose when I was 10. 
I KNOW that being on my medications truly helps me be able to live a more peaceful life for myself and those in my life. But I always have the dark thoughts such as, medicine is bad for you, these drugs are going to make your liver or kidneys fail, you are going to age faster etc. 
I know that may be in my head but I‚Äôm always second guessing. I‚Äôve been medicated for years, even before my diagnoses. But I‚Äôm always second guessing, I‚Äôm also always comparing myself to other people such as well so and so doesn‚Äôt need medication, so why do I? 
But when I do stop taking my meds I either become very paranoid or have such intense episodes that I destroy my life, by self sabotaging, being harmful to myself or others, isolating as well as severe splitting. 

I‚Äôm normally too afraid to be this vulnerable because I am always trying to fit in with whoever is around me.

Many of us are more than happy to assist you as best we can with your questions when it comes to BPD and how it effects/affects the loved ones in your life who suffer from it. 
However, I have seen too many lately that are fueled by stigma. 
Please remember:
There are 256 different combinations of 10 symptoms (I have been informed that I suck at math which is true and fair üòÖüòÖ but it's a lot of combinations), BPD is a spectrum, and we all experience it differently. 
We cannot diagnose your friends or family because having BPD does not give you a degree in medicine nor mental health related science/studies. 
We are NOT EVIL, nor toxic. Many of us are doing our best in the journey of finding ourselves and where we fit in in our own lives and how to navigate this difficult disorder. We are always learning, and always doing our best. 

And most importantly, there are people with BPD in this subreddit who may not be far along enough in their journey (YET), and the spreading of stigma can cause them a great deal of pain.

I (31F) was diagnosed as borderline by a psychologist this year. I went to therapist because I couldnt handle my psychological situation anymore. Last year, I ended a long time relationship with a person that I love so much but he (M31) always made me suffer.  I was depressed and in total imbalance and I told him a lie, and that made him never trust me again. Thats the reason that he broke up with me. And since this episode I was never happy anymore. I always think about him, and I'm always searching for him in other guys. None of my datings after this worked so far. And I work hard for 13 hours everyday, i'm a teacher and this volume of work makes me more depressed.

I'm brazilian and everything here is very expensive, included medicine and psychiatrist. Yesterday I made a video for him, with all our photos and a romantic song. I fell so ridiculous and immerse in some dark place. I cry everyday, and sometimes when i have the money I talk to the therapist. But it doesnt get better. I feel that my period makes it worse 10 times, and for maybe 2 weeks in the month i want to kill myself. Then it gets a little better and 2 weeks later it all starts again. What should I do guys?

98,BPD suffers please take care.,"Hello, my son (23) is laying in the ICU after jumping out of his 5th floor window after a night of post work (food service) drinking. The struggle is him taking his medicine and not putting himself into situations like drinking that trigger his manic episodes. I honestly thought he was dead upon hearing he had fallen. He was found naked on the ground and went to hospital as a John Doe. So no one could tell me anything. 

By a miracle or luck he is still here without brain damage or paralyzation. Lots of broken bones of course. 

My point is please try to take care of yourself , be as proactive as BPD allows.

Im not religious myself and i have nothing against religion but whenever she says that I can't help but feel hurt, discouraged. I've tried turning to god and it just wasn't for me. My mom's not a bad person and her intentions are good. I just feel so alone when she says that. She doesn't believe i have a mental disorder either, she insists that if i get closer to god i wont be this way, no medicine needed. 

 I feel so so hurt by this. It's like she's implying i choose to feel and act this way. I don't want to be this way but i dont have that choice. I've tried so hard for so long, turning to god, begging and asking for help, for him to fix me and tell me why i am the way i am. It just didn't work. I remember crying to god as a kid asking him to make me not feel this way, to not be so overly emotional. I have tried time and time again, blamed myself till i hate my very existence, i felt unworthy cause even w all of my prayers i still feel the same.

  It wasn't until i got actual medical help that things got better. Life didn't feel hopeless. But medicine can only do so much and i still get bpd episodes. The episodes are terrifying no matter how many times it's happened. I talk to my mom cause i have no one else to talk to when im in an episode. Im scared they'll get freaked out and push me away.

103,I really don't know if i am borderline 21F NB,"I and others who know me have been pretty confident in my BPD diagnosis but lately I have been wondering if i even have it at all and instead maybe I just have the symptoms from other disorders. I definitely am on the spectrum. Most likely autistic. During my childhood I was pretty heavily scrutinized and bullied for being hyperactive, inattentive and weird. I think in the 2000's there was this weird expectation for girls to be proper students and to like certain things. And from a young age I was catching onto the fact that I liked girls and I was non-binary. It was very hard to fit in with other girls, it was very hard to fit in with other boys. I was mostly by myself or hanging out with the other ADHD boys and girls in school. I had many meltdowns from a very young age in school. I think my mood swings and abandonment worries have more to do with my autism than BPD

&#x200B;

My biggest reasons for thinking maybe I don't have BPD is the fact that I don't ever have an FP anymore. I have been controlling and paranoid in my friendships and relationships. I know people with BPD are usually labeled as big romantics, and I have been in love before. But maybe three times in my life, one of those people I would say I was in love with was my best friend. The way I see love is very...i don't know it's very innocent and not always romantic/sexual. And even if it is romantic/sexual it's like I use that attraction and act to show that I love who they are, not necessarily that they're sexy. Ever since my breakup the relationships I have attempted to be in just were not working. I felt icky having people tell me they were in love with me or wanted to spend their lives with me. Maybe this is just an avoidant trauma response and I am still healing. But honestly while I feel incredible loneliness I am also relieved to not be tangled in someone else's actions and words. I really don't trust anyone to fix my emotional issues or to understand.

&#x200B;

I take Trileptal. I'd LOVE to hear your guys' thoughts on Trileptal. I think it has stabilized me and my choices a bit, but it makes me feel like a total zombie a lot of days. And I still deal with extreme and frequent mood swings. Probably every other hour or everyday it changes. And everytime I sense a mood swing, I can't help but just think ""Oh fuck me. This hurts physically. Not again.""

&#x200B;

I DEFINETLY have the pull in pull out everything or nothing mindset. But I believe with DBT and self evaluation that I have been able to handle my relationships and arguments way better than I used to. Still not good enough though because I currently have no friends, no relationship and no good job history. I got fired at my last job for screaming and crying out of nowhere.

&#x200B;

I have autism and social anxiety so a lot of my MELTDOWN meltdowns involve me being overstimulated, rejection sensitivity and beyond upset that people in my life can't understand why simple things make me feel heart-wrenching anxiety and FOMO. ESPECIALLY when I make plans with people and they don't follow them/cancel last minute. I have very frequent dreams where time goes slow and I miss a party/event and it is the worst. I need my every step to be planned when going out or I can't function. I am on SSDI because of my never ending history of having full blown anxiety attacks at work. I know. I am a bitch

105,I had an encounter today that has left me on edge and I just want it to stop,"This is so long I'm so sorry.
So I had a doctor's appointment today and my doctor refilled my medication for PTSD nightmares that I can't go without. I had another medication that the pharmacy I use had refilled before I even needed it and then proceeded to try and sell it to my granddad because we have the same last name and he also goes there. I couldn't afford both so I planned on purchasing my medicine for my nightmares because I had less of it than I did the medicine I never called to have refilled. The lady at the drive thru had asked if I was wanting it and we could hardly hear her over her mask so both my roommate who was driving and I specifically said ""just the prazosin (my meds for nightmares)"" to be sure that she understood and she ended up giving me the wrong medication. When we circled back to ask for it to be fixed they all said they couldn't take it back once it left the store and while we both understood, it didn't solve the issue. We were polite about it and asked to at least have a refund because they messed up so that I could purchase the correct medicine. The pharmacist ended up coming to the window and proceeded to snap at us and claimed he heard her tell us about the one they had already filled and asked if we wanted to put the others on hold and we said yes (I reiterate, we couldn't understand her and we proceeded to clarify which medication I was wanting and even told her that the one they already had was the one we wanted on hold) and that he didn't hear us say just the prazosin which we both called bs. By the end of the exchange he finally decided to tell us it would take thirty minutes to fill the prazosin and he could see what he could do about it but he couldn't take back the other one which we weren't even asking them to do and five minutes later it was ready and they gave it for free. My roommate says we didn't do anything wrong but I'm still...shaken up? I take a mood stabilizer, an antipsychotic, the prazosin, and an anti anxiety medication and I struggle to cope without them. To have one suddenly become out of reach is scary to me especially when it involves my dreams. I already struggle so much with my sleep that nightmares just make the one escape I have from my nightmare life absolutely miserable too. I don't understand why I still care about it because it's in the past and it's over but its almost left me afraid to go back.

108,Need help about medications with BPD," Hey!  This is my first time posting on reddit. I am struggling with taking a  decision on whether I should take medications especially mood  stabilizers for my BPD. I just wish to share my experience with therapy  and a little about my current situation first before asking but if you  aren't interested you can skip the next two paragraphs.

I  was having a bad time with my mental health for a long time and finally  decided to take therapy four moths ago. Majorly, I was diagnosed with  BPD, and was told I have severe anxiety problems with a bunch of other  issues. Once I was told about my diagnosis, I was asked by my therapist  on how I feel on taking meds .. and I said that I am not comfortable  with them. I have seen some really closed ones who have taken some meds  prescribed by their psychiatrists and have gotten addicted to them and  completely dependent on their meds. At that time, my therapist told me  that she wouldn't recommend me any meds till the time she sees that I am  working on whatever tasks she gives me and that it is having a positive  affect on me. But she did tell me that meds help in the treatment and  should only be taken with therapy because meds cannot solve the root  cause of the illness which only therapy can. I was determined to fix my  illness and really was working really hard over it.

Fast  forward to three months, I started to feel a lot better than I was  three months back, I must tell you that I haven't yet started with DBT.  Then, something happened the following week and things went downhill for  me. For the entirety of the week I had never felt this  isolated/secluded in my entire life which escalated my fear of  abandonment. During that week, I had a total of 8 anxiety attacks and  went suicidal. The only constant thought was to kms. The week went by,  and the next two weeks I was all alone at my home too which further  escalated things and one other thing happened which I don't wish to talk  about publicly but that was the biggest trigger. There were a total of  three continuous weeks of this misery where I hadn't taken any therapy  session (because I couldn't book slot in the first week and after that  the only next available slot was two weeks later), left all the coping  mechanisms I was told to work with, had stopped journaling, lost my  appetite, didn't talk to anyone, etc. I could see myself being in this  trap of depressive episode but felt completely unmotivated about working  over it in any way. After these three weeks, I started to talk to my  friends a bit and I started journaling, meditating, force feed myself,  etc. I would also mention that I am no longer suicidal, and even when I  was I would've never committed suicide. It was more of having a constant  thought which I felt helpless about and that I was tired of being this  hurt again and again.

I finally  had my therapy session yesterday and she recommended me as I am going  through a low phase I should take some meds majorly mood stabilizers and  that it will be temporary and with time as I get better she will  decrease its dosage to a point where I won't have to take them. She  asked me to book a session with the psychiatrist she works with and get  some meds prescribed. Now, as I have been mostly anti about taking meds  throughout my life, but feeling so helpless in the past three weeks I  can understand why I might need them. There is also a little part of me  that thinks that I am getting setup in a trap of therapy and  psychiatrist where I would've to pay two people as they have a  partnership but at the same time because they have a partnership they  could really help me.. idk.. See, I am a guy from India where mental  health is in general not received very nicely especially for men. But  that is still the least of my concerns, for me, taking therapy has been a  very big step then accepting that I have a disorder has been tough too  and now meds are a big hurdle. Also keep in mind my DBT starts next  week.

The advice that I am seeking is -

1. Is it really necessary to take mood stabilizers for BPD?
2. Can  I get addicted/dependent to them and how realistic is it to have some  dosage now and slowly reduce the dosage to zero as I get better?
3. Are there any side-effects to mood stabilizers?
4. What questions should I ask the psychiatrist about the meds she prescribes except for the 3 I mentioned here?

111,My spouse has BPD. Could I have it too?,"10 am. I groggily got off the couch, walked into the kitchen and grabbed the half-eaten carrot cake out of the freezer.

I took my stay-the-hell-awakish meds (I am narcoleptic), plop on the couch, turned on the TV and decide to look up that one show about a BPD person on Netflix that my friend recommended years ago, but I never actually watched because that one documentary series on Netflix with the craziness about the realities of growing avocadoes and how there are gangs that murder each other over who gets the water access because they have to have a lot of water for these avocados even though like‚Äîcome on they are avocados but I also realize that people used to murder each other over who had access to salt and pe-

Alright, moving on. So, this movie is also about someone with BPD but it's not a musical and god why are there are so many ads.

Ugh. Ok, so the points s that I wonder now if I have BPD. They confirmed my spouse to have it and I'm realizing now that maybe I do too.

But seriously, why do these gangs fight over those avocados? I mean-

Okay, so I'm trying to make it very apparent that these are my thought patterns. However, the abstraction has now gone too deep and now I'm actually getting wrapped up in these things I wrote out to make a point.

I have gone to mental health professionals for most of my life.

They always said, you have anxiety (many flavors), depression, panic disorder, but they have never mentioned BPD.

But, I'm wondering now.

I don't know if it's BPD. But, when I looked into the potential signs and symptoms, I saw so many things I actually have.

-Abandonment issues? ‚úì (This runs deep, unfortunately)

-What I have always referred to as being extremely passionate. (But like now that I'm thinking about it, maybe being overly ""passionate"" (I guess just emotional?) about everything from going on vacation to why the hell do they not make medicine for cats flavored different from kids medicine? Like come on, I know they just make it all one thing because manufacturing--. My old 15 yr old cat hates his banana flavored arthritis medicine. (Here I am trying to make a point and make fun of myself because I know it's dumb but still getting stupidly upset about it.)

-Push people away even though that is the complete opposite of what I want to do and be more clingy than anything but also still get upset about fucking up friendships that have been dead for over 10 years.

-Act narcissistic even though I detest narcissism. 

-Have been hospitalized because suddenly at work I decided I hated everything and need to just ""not"" anymore. While on a 5 minute bathroom break. When honestly, I think I was fine that morning. I'm pretty sure I had a good morning too, not just like a neutral morning.

-The crushing weight of guilt when I fuck up but also the worse crushing weight of guilt because I got upset about being upset since I‚Äî

Okay, yeah hopefully you get the point.

I guess what I am trying to get at here is--Is it possible to go to various therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists throughout my life, and none of them think I have a mood disorder of any sort?

And yet--still have one? What do you all think? If it isn't BPD, what the hell is wrong with me? Lol.",1660326295.0,False,3,3,TheBuddhistAngler,None,wmrcdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/wmrcdd/my_spouse_has_bpd_could_i_have_it_too/

114,"Ever since my Dad threw away my meds, I've never been this terrified.","CW for mentions of self-harm, EDs (specifically binge eating), and abuse...? I think?

I've never been this terrified of wanting to end it all in my whole entire life, not only is this in suicide but it's also in my general life too. My thoughts, how I function. Every single hour I'm on the verge of a break down if I'm not having one already. It's such a struggle and it's because of my Dad.

Long story short: I've been prescribed aripiprazole by my psychiatrist, with the starting dose. My godmom looked it up, and she said how she'll talk to my Dad about it. In the end I wasn't going to take those meds because my dad didn't like the side effects. He told me over text, and I quote, ‚Äú[Deadname] we trying to get you to a point of you being able to handle this world on your OWN...stop fighting us on growing up please because you're growing up baby‚Äù. Mind you this was over my medicine, he never liked antidepressants but I genuinely needed these for mood stability. Not only do I have BPD I also showed signs of Bipolar Disorder as well, specifically type one, me and my therapist both believe I have bipolar disorder. 

The next day, my Dad came over only to say how he was going to my psychiatrist appointments over the meds, basically trying to dictate my appointments. This made me more vulnerable to splitting, and not even 2-3 days later I spiraled to consuming disgusting content to cope.

116,How can I help my teen? ,"Hi everyone! 

First I just want to say that reading the information you share here is so incredibly moving and eye opening and I appreciate the raw feelings I see expressed. 

I believe that my 16yo daughter likely has bpd. Her counselor has recognized it and her psychiatrist has sent over some surveys to complete before they meet again. After lots of reading, I feel so sure we are close to a diagnosis we can finally understand. 

For the last two years, she‚Äôs been completely removed from her bio dad and received a protective order. It‚Äôs been such a relief, but it‚Äôs also opened the gates to realizing how much she went through. We‚Äôve been doing our best to provide access to medication, counseling, and anything else to help. 

Now that I see this is a major possibility, I was wondering if anyone could recommend things I can do or say to help. I‚Äôm an activator and I want to do things. I have completely invalidated her feelings before because I didn‚Äôt understand that she was misinterpreting what I said (or didn‚Äôt say) because of how she‚Äôs seeing herself in the world, instead thinking that I just needed to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù her misconception. It got so out of hand and I didn‚Äôt understand why. 

Now I know better, and I‚Äôm seeing that showing her unconditional love intentionally is something I can DO. Like, she forgot to take her medicine again, so instead of being annoyed, I just reminded her to do it when she got home and told her I loved her enthusiastically. When I tell you that changed our whole evening, she was so full of love and appreciation. I felt like that small thing made a difference. I know I‚Äôll make mistakes, but I don‚Äôt want to do the wrong thing just because I don‚Äôt know the right thing. 

She‚Äôs an amazing kid. So beautiful and talented and smart. I want to do everything I can to help her have a successful, wonderful life while she navigates this. 

Please send me any suggestions you have. Things to say, or not say, things to do, things that resonated with you as helpful.

117,Need Advice on possible BPD diagnosis for spouse,"After many years of drug use, drinking to forget/cope, incorrect diagnoses, self-hatred & depression, my spouse is attempting to do the difficult work of therapy & is working hard to remain sober and rebuild trust in our marriage and, to my knowledge, has been succeeding w/this for the last 6 months.   Recently, they sought out some ADHD testing with a clinical psychiatrist, as they've struggled with focus, attention, unpredictable behaviors and frustration for much of their life & is quite committed to gaining a more clear understanding of what they are dealing with.   
After an initial round of testing of both me *(as the person that lives with them)* and my spouse, the psychiatrist said that, while further testing would be needed, they believed my spouse's condition to be more indicative of Borderline Personality Disorder and less like ADHD.  This was very upsetting to my spouse, who cried when they told me about this 'potential' diagnosis and shared their fears around the stigma of this diagnosis and that they believed people diagnosed with BPD are the ""kind of people that end up being committed"" to mental hospitals.

This week, my spouse went to their standing appointments with their therapists - one therapist focuses on talk therapy, CBT and the holistic mind/body connection and the other focuses on DBT.  They spoke with both of their therapists *(neither of them are MD's or PhD's but therapists with certificates of advanced graduate studies in mental health and a clinical social worker, respectively)* and according to my spouse, one therapist said that further testing would need to be done before he would agree with the BPD diagnosis and the other therapist flat-out said she didn't agree.  

And now, it feels as though my spouse has decided to align with the opinions of therapists & social workers, rather than clinical psychiatrists that are experienced with all of the nuances and behaviors that my spouse exhibits that seem so clearly aligned with BPD, because they don't want this to be their diagnosis.  My spouse went from being devastated about this diagnosis to conveniently just deciding that it's not what they suffer from, based on the POV of 2 therapists that only know as much about my spouse as my spouse decides to share in their bi-weekly sessions.

**My question for anyone that manages their BPD diagnosis or has a partner that does** : what sort of things do you do to help manage your condition, day-to-day?  How did you initially handle your diagnosis and how did you eventually come to accept it?  Do you have any advice for how to handle this 3-some of opinions - one that comes from a clinical physician's POV who has performed dedicated testing and the others that focuses more on talk/creative therapy?  

I'm fearful that my spouse (who has difficulty facing the hard facts of life and coping with things that make them unhappy or uncomfortable) will just opt to take the easy way out and ignore what may be a very meaningful diagnosis, to their own life and to our marriage, and just languish in emotional purgatory - not ever happy or sad - because they resisted a BPD diagnosis.  

Appreciate you reading and any thoughts, advice or experience you can lend.

im a teenage girl and i‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. im on medication for both and it helps me but i still feel pretty much miserable. for about a year now i‚Äôve felt absolutely NOTHING, completely numb. i‚Äôve recently begun to feel emotion again but it doesn‚Äôt feel normal, like something isn‚Äôt right. i‚Äôm grateful to have feelings again but they aren‚Äôt genuine or they don‚Äôt feel real. i will feel sad, and if i get lucky maybe even cry but the whole time im like trying so hard to keep that emotion because i know that it will go away eventually. when i‚Äôm happy, i don‚Äôt really enjoy it because i know that it will eventually fade away. it‚Äôs like i can‚Äôt feel emotion without having to put a lot of thought into it. feeling emotion usually just causes me anger and rage now because of how i know it will switch again. 

i‚Äôve always kind of felt like i had similar symptoms to people with bipolar disorder, but after learning more about bpd i‚Äôve realized that i relate much more to people with bpd. i don‚Äôt want to self diagnose but i just wanted to see if anyone who has bpd/knows a lot about it could give me their opinion on how i feel. 

i have been very impulsive my whole life. i‚Äôve just recently acknowledged that and started to realize that i don‚Äôt seem to be the same as the people around me. i‚Äôve started to research different disorders, and bpd literally describes me. one of the main things that stood out to me was the FP and holding onto unhealthy relationships. my FPs are usually friendships that are very toxic. i tend to be very close to one person then somewhere along the way mess up but never know what i did. im also constantly worrying about messing things up with other friends. it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm walking on eggshells around everyone because i don‚Äôt want to upset anyone. i also have terrible attachment and abandonment issues. another thing that stood out was being hateful to people that i love. i‚Äôve always done that to my parents and friends that actually care about me. i‚Äôve never known why i do it either. it‚Äôs also very very hard for me to feel sympathy for others. i quite literally cannot understand how other people feel in certain situations.

135,Coping with BPD life,"*TW: cannabis use

Is it possible for weed to be a healthy coping mechanism? 

Hi so I know I‚Äôm still very young (22) and my brain still has more years of developing left but I‚Äôve been smoking weed since I very first started showing symptoms of BPD at 16. As I got older and into college my cannabis use became more frequent bc I realized how much better it made me feel than any of the other countless medications I had tried w different psychiatrists. Cannabis is the only drug that has been able to snap me out of a mood swing and sometimes even snap me out of frozen dissociation momentarily enough to actually move and do something. Other than my go to anxiety medication (Hydroxyzine 10 mg) which just feels sedative, cannabis does the same and more for me. 

I‚Äôm also aware I am numbing a feeling and running away from an emotion that is making me uncomfortable. I‚Äôm trying to acknowledge how this coping is helping me but also potentially harming me by distancing myself from feeling all my feelings. I‚Äôve been trying to fight this by combating the urge every time I feel I want to smoke and spacing sessions throughout the day. It‚Äôs hard as fuck but I‚Äôm trying to only smoke when my other coping skills aren‚Äôt working AND only smoking enough to feel better instead of excess smoking to numb. I hope this all makes sense and doesn‚Äôt sound as rambley as I think. Has any other BPD stoner out there manage to find the perfect balance? I‚Äôm really working to reduce my BPD symptom severity and it‚Äôs feeling a little hopeless right now and smoking is the only thing that makes it better.

140,Dr seems to ignore my symptoms,"This is my first post and the first place I thought to vent or seek some help. I was diagnosed with bipolar at 13 at recently it is now borderlinepdisorder. 
About 5 months ago I started medication lamictal and progressed up to 200mg. 
My memory is so effected by these medication I can't remember almost anything. Consistently forget stuff I just talked about with my wife, if we talked about something a few days ago I have zero memory of this. I have voiced and voiced this problem with my Dr and she doesn't seem to take any of it into consideration. 
I am still not stable, have daily ups and downs left and rights even being on meds. 
Alot of the time, I kind of feel like nothing. No emotion. Today they prescribed Wellbutrin xl 150mg a long with 7.5 of mirtazipine. 
Is it just me or does my doctor just not get it? 
This has been going on for the whole 5 months with weekly reviews. I've voiced many times I want to try something else as a base because this was the very first one we tried. It works ok, but we went down to 150mg because I couldn't remember anything and it's been really destroying my relationships with people and making my job among other things extremely difficult.

I want to hear your experiences with Olanzapine (Zyprexa) and/or with alternatives to this drug.

I‚Äôve recently started taking Olanzapine to see how it affects my extreme mood swings. The doctors haven‚Äôt reached a conclusion on what disorder I have yet, but it‚Äôs most likely bipolar or borderline personality disorder or both. 

It‚Äôs my fourth day taking this medicine and I feel amazing. I feel the same way I used to feel before I got sick 10 years ago. My racing thoughts are **gone** and I‚Äôm not overthinking things or obsessing over stupid shit. My anger is gone and I don‚Äôt feel depressed. My mind is calm.

Now, I really really don‚Äôt want to gain any weight. I‚Äôve recently lost 17 kg that I gained from medicine I took years ago, and I‚Äôm finally not overweight anymore. So I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to gain it all back and then some on Olanzapin. 

So I was wondering what are your experiences with Olanzapin? How did it affect you? Or / and have you tried alternatives to Olanzapin that has worked just as well without the side effect of weight gain? Can you compare the effects for me?

I greatly appreciate any answers as I have a new doctors appointment tomorrow.

This is the 4th time she's blocked me. But it has never been this extreme. I'm blocked on all socials, and my number is blocked as well. Totally out of the blue. She texted me good morning the day she blocked me. I am in so much pain. She is about a month or so out of psychiatric care, taking medicine, and she has a therapist. Things were going so well. We weren't back together because it wasn't a mature decision to be back so soon (broke up in May). Just a couple of days before she was telling me she'd rather be alone than marry anyone else; her life without me would be miserable; she told me she loved and missed me every day.

Now we are here. I know she's posted 10 times on Instagram since this happened. Her father ignored my text, her mother sent me an incoherent message about how I'm not a man. ""I don't know what the future holds for you and X, that's all I will say"" was how the mother's text ended.

I visited her when she was in psychiatric care. Seeing her so medicated made me so emotional, it broke me. But I waited for her. And then when she had an anxiety attack and had to go to the hospital I ran to comfort her. 

I just feel like I'm dying. I don't know why. Last time I said ""if I don't hear back in a week I'II take it seriously"" and, sure enough, I heard back 4 days later.

159,"I (24M) lost my job, my girlfriend left me, and I am friendless. It is all my fault...","Hi, so I've been looking for a place where I can share my story. I hope I am not wasting your time with this long story. If I do, apologies.

I have been diagnosticated with BPD since college. I was quite lonely growing up. My parents initially divorced a year after my older brother was born because they couldn't get along. A few years later they met again at a party, got drunk, and basically I happened. And they were forced to remarry out of fear for how their families would react. I come from an Eastern European religious society. 

But basically I was an accident. So growing up they got me toys, a TV, a computer, games, anything just to keep me busy and not deal with me. My brother did the same. My grandmother actually cared to spend time with me when visiting, but she died when I was 10. Heart attack, in front of me. I watched her die.

I was bullied in school. I didn't have friends. In high school I started having friends and learning self defense, but any friends I made, they eventually left. I had no one around and any time someone got close to me I was already too attached and any time they were doing stuff with someone else I felt abandoned and useless, like everyone else was better. 

After a failed 3 months relationship, I went into therapy during college and I learned I had BPD. But when I started making progress my parents removed me from therapy because they couldn't afford anymore and they thought I was getting better so I wouldn't need it anymore. Then the pandemic hit and isolation coupled with the fact that I was infected with covid ruined it all. 

At the end of 2021 I attempted suicide so I got again into therapy. Then a couple of months into 2022 I met the woman that is now my ex. Again therapy was working, I was making progress, that woman fell in love with me, but when I got into the relationship with her my parents again cut my therapy because it was too expensive and if I found someone why would I need it. 

She tried her best to help me and she actually succeeded, but she too had mental disorders (anxiety, bipolarity) and I too tried my best to help her. However, in my case I was kinda copying the way she was helping me, because I didn't know any other way. And that didn't worked. Which gave rise to arguments. Our relationship had ups and downs but we loved each other very much.

However, my abandonment issues came every time she was hanging out with her friends. They worse activated when one of them told me to not come with them to a party, and I snapped and attacked the person. My girlfriend took my side and she left the group. She told me she was better off just having me but later in the relationship she complained about missing them. Again I got triggered and had an argument. I felt sorry for ruining her social life and offered to make new friends together which she accepted. But still more and more arguments rose because of my BPD. I graduated as an engineer in 2023 and I got a job in an automotive company. Then after passing probation and saving some money to move in my owm house while also buying items I needed, I got back into therapy because I didn't want to lose her. And because at my workplace I had a hard time keeping calm under pressure or under yelling from my team leader. 

Again, I was making progress and I was starting to somewhat fix both my work and my relationship, even being told by my manager at the Christmas party to prepare for promotion on a new project. But in January of this year the same manager came to tell me I will be laid off without offering a reason why, when my tasks were completed and I had that promotion coming up. I was devastated and due to that I could no longer afford therapy. What I saved was not that good enough to afford it until a new job came, I had to keep my pocket full too now that I was jobless and I gave up on moving away. I was a mess, my parents offered only criticism and no support, and arguments came again with my girlfriend because she was tired of my depressive moods. I tried looking for a job, but abandonment issues hit again when my girlfriend was getting closer to some guys. I also happened to develop asthma in the years since covid because, while already existing dust and pollen allergies were already risking factors, the virus weakened me further. I saw its first violent manifestation during the onset of spring.

And then at the end of March my girlfriend broke up with me. Saying it was better for both of us but then admitting that she couldn't stand all this mental and physical health issues. 

I begged my parents to get me back into therapy but they refused. I didn't had enough money either. Whatever few friends I had left me too. My parents criticized me for not doing anything with my life other than grieving so I started hiding my emotions. I desperately struggled to find a new job, a new girlfriend, new friends, to also finish my master's degree, I tried focusing on myself and my hobbies, but one night while I was showering I had a severe headache and I vomited. My nose bled. My chest hurt. While I was trying to reach my room I collapsed on the floor. When I woke up in the hospital my entire body hurt, I felt like throwing up, and during my time being unconscious my body got a psoriasis outbreak. Turns out focusing on myself and hiding my emotions caused my nervous system to shut down. BPD was this time too powerful for my body and mind to handle. 

It took days to recover. To be able to walk, eat or be normal again. They still refuse to get me back into therapy. I could only visit a psychiatrist to get medicine to calm myself down. Those money I saved, whatever I could I used for medicine. I got back to my hunt for a job, friends and girlfriend. I met someone online but she barely talks to me. She is a nurse, probably working in shifts leaves little time to herself, but again i'm afraid that she doesn't like me because if she did, she could have replied while on the bus at least. 

I am lonely. I have an uncertain future ahead. Still no luck with the job, no luck with friends or a relationship. No way to do therapy either without a job. I do feel suicidal. I tried to convince myself that the sun will shine again, that I don't deserve to be alone or to suffer. But how could I not deserve this, when it was all my fault? I tried to fix things. BPD and my upbringing may not be my fault, but I feel guilty for my actions and even for BPD and how I was treated. I was an accident. I feel like I deserve my punishment.

161,How often does anyone else feel like the world is a malevolent place?,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm really struggling today‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been sick for a couple of weeks with a dental infection‚Ä¶it‚Äôs better than it was, but it‚Äôs a mess, I basically need almost all my teeth pulled. Since I felt a little better yesterday I did a lot of yard work, the idea was to accomplish something and to get my nervous energy out via manual labor. It was the first time I‚Äôve been out in the sun for any decent length of time in idk when. I actually have to take prescription vitamin d tablets for awhile because I‚Äôm deficient from being a shut in. 

My doctor took his sweet time calling in my anxiety medicines, and every-time they do this I get the irrational fear that they won‚Äôt refill it, but my fianc√© keeps saying that would be unsafe for me and therefore a legal liability against them not to do so, the pharmacy is finally working on that, but like I said everytime this happens, I get extreme fear that they won‚Äôt call it in, and that I‚Äôll have psychosis again like I did the last time I stopped all my meds (stupidly thought maybe I could just stop all of them on my own and be free of doctors and medication for good). 

Anyway, my partner has been acting weird, I mean no weirder than usual, but I thought since they were off work yesterday and today that they would want to get out of bed and spend time with me and have a good couple of days, I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with him, but I notice he‚Äôll be in a really good mood for a few hours, then he‚Äôll crash, have panic attacks and go to bed.

It‚Äôs as if having a normal amount of energy for any amount of time exhausts him completely. He‚Äôs pretty low energy and my energy level is much higher- so it‚Äôs never matched up. I feel sick and lonely. I had to go to the store first thing this morning and as I‚Äôm driving and looking around at this place I‚Äôve been living in for years, I find myself feeling unsafe. 

Even looking at an empty house or car anything around me, everything around me feels ‚Äúoff‚Äù. I feel chained to my doctors, chained to my meds, and chained to my mental illness and I want it to stop. 

I know I have BPD but I don‚Äôt feel safe telling a medical professional- since I have 2 medicines I need that are controlled substances and I‚Äôm afraid an official diagnosis would cause them to take it away.

I want to try an antipsychotic even though I was always afraid of them, because I just want to feel normal and ok for once, but BPD feels like another secret I need to keep from the world around me.

I have always had a huge problem with alcohol, already at 14 when I started drinking. I'm not addicted when I'm not actively drinking, but once I start I can't stop. This always ends with me being too drunk and very inappropriate. I rarely puke or pass out, I just keep on going. This weekend I hit a new low. My FPs has been quite annoyed with me since I behaved immature last time we were out drinking. That was about a month ago. 

I'm studying at Uni and we had a gala, sorority style, this weekend. I behaved really bad and tried to kiss a lot of people etc. I usually get away with this because I'm a small cute female, but I just turned 30 and most of the people at my university is a lot younger.  I got thrown out in the end and sat down outside crying. When I got home I swallowed a bunch of pills with vodka and passed out. I had uploaded a video of the pills on my social media and sent it to a bunch of people. A friend of mine called 911 and I was taken to the hospital. I have no memory what so ever of this because I was unconscious. 

Not sure when I'll be able to go back to school after this mess. I don't even know who's angry at me/who I should apologize to. I tried asking the dude who kicked me out but he wouldn't tell me.

168,Hello Y'all!,"tldr at the bottom

I've just found out that I might have BPD, so I wanted to share some of my story, and how I feel finding this place:

Hello, my fellow likeminded friends! I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts (also few attempts) my whole life. I've tried everything. Psychiatry, Therapy, ECT... They've given me thousands of medicine that did nothing. Nothing at all! I've been feeling guilty, incomplete, flawed, broken! I thought I just didnt fit and wasnt worthy of living. No one could diagnose or atleast treat me. I told my psychiatrists about constantly talking to myself, my obsession towards some people, feeling like a seperate entity in my own mind... Some time ago my latest psychiatrist started me on some mood stabilizers and adhd meds. Because appearently I have that too üòÖ. She recently cut me from mood stabilizers because she thinks my problem lies in adhd and it slowly caused me to feel worse and worse to the point Im back to being broken. Or atleast thats how I felt. (Well I wasnt ""perfect"" while on mood stabilizers but they helped I guess maybe they didnt and I thought I was better I really dont know) While i was searching for my symptoms I've heard this one condition called BPD. And I had all the major symptoms. To be clear, Im not diagnosed yet. I will talk to my psychiatrist as soon as I can about this, so I might be wrong. But I felt a familiarity I never felt. While reading about people with BPD, while reading about the symptoms, while reading about how they feel... I think this is where I belong, this is where 9+ (i dont exactly remember before 9) years of depression, alienation and a constantly broken heart brings me. So I wanted to say hello to you all.  I love you all! I feel your pain and I know probably no one understands even %1 of it. I hope all of you, all of us can find peace and happiness. Thank you for existing! You are WONDERFULL!

170,"Decision making, feeling hollow and stuck in a rut","Hello :)

I am currently undergoing therapy ONLY and stopped my medication last year. The progress has been slower as I have almost unbearable, wanting to be un alive sort of lows these days. A serious relationship just ended, I moved to a new place and I am struggling a lot, financially. 
I am having a lot of trouble making even small decisions like whether or not to take a bath today or should I make another cup of coffee. I'm in a lot of physical pain too (backache and legs feel tired) even though I stay in bed all day. 
The lack of decision making is making it difficult to move forward and staying stuck is making me want to do awful things. How do you survive without medicine? I am wondering if I should go back to meds? 
My relationship and the way it crumbled, also is something I am not able to let go off. I have really bad nightmares and living is becoming unbearable. 
I don't know what to do anymore. Sometimes I think that only a relationship can fix me. I like to feel needed and I function better. But rejection is an indescribable pain that I can't keep going through, either. 
Is there any way out of this?

P.S. Sorry for the rant

174,Want to Try Medication‚Ä¶ but Also Dont‚Ä¶.,"I was diagnosed with BPD later last year. I tried taking Lexapro shortly after for only a week. I do understand that this is not a long enough time to adjust to such a medicine, but I did not like how I felt so I stopped taking it. 

Years prior, maybe 4 or 5, I was in Fluoxetine for an entire year. It took me the entire year to realize it was making my outbursts and emotional regulation issues much worse and I stopped taking it‚Ä¶

Now here is the reason why I don‚Äôt want to take an anti depressant‚Ä¶ when I was taking fluoxetine, I was finishing my degree in theatre performance and I found my acting skills were worse for it. It also made me numb and insensitive to my partner. I don‚Äôt want to take anything that makes me feel this way even for the sake of ‚Äúnot being sad.‚Äù I understand that with anti depressants, or any hormonal medication, you have to usually try a few different kinds to find the one that works with your brains chemistry the best. The issue I have is how long it takes to even decide if you like how you feel on said medication. On average you need to spend about 3 months testing just one of these medicines (one month adjusting to taking it, one month of feeling it out or two weeks at the least, and then if you don‚Äôt like it, almost an entire month weening off of it and feeling like shit after having adjusted‚Ä¶) 

I guess at this point I‚Äôm just weighing my pros and cons of possibly trying medication again. I just don‚Äôt want it to dull me and my creativity. If any artists are reading this, and have taken hormonal medication, do you feel less able to have deep creative emotions? And do you feel this keeps you from reaching your full creative potential? 

I just don‚Äôt want to spend a whole year feeling (even more) unstable trying 4 different medications, ya know. If I come to the conclusion I just don‚Äôt like any of them. Part of me knows I would just have to DO it and try, but I‚Äôm really averse to trying things I might lose a bunch of time on with no positive outcome‚Ä¶ the only positive outcome would be I know I just don‚Äôt want to rely on medication‚Ä¶ 

On the flip side, I‚Äôm really nervous that what if there‚Äôs a perfect kind of medication mix that suddenly makes me way more normal feeling‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs like people who find the one that works for them, they talk about it like it‚Äôs magical they feel so different‚Ä¶ but I also wonder if these people have just taken the medication so long they don‚Äôt really remember how it feels to feel any other way? Like I don‚Äôt want my positive emotions to be dulled or even my negative ones because I need to access them believably for acting‚Ä¶.

176,i think i have bpd,"note: this is my first reddit post ever so i'm still not sure with how these stuffs work but i've been really wanting to post something since my thoughts are a mess these past few weeks. i'm sorry for any mistakes.

hello i (F18), think i suffer from BPD though i haven't really got a proper diagnosis since therapy sessions and medicines here in my country cost a lot and my parents never really cared about mental health.

growing up, i am the eldest among my siblings and i never really wasn't given that much attention because to my parents, i am that smart independent kid. my needs were usually neglected and my parents were too busy to care. my mom is selfish and my dad is a hypocrite and i grew up having to watch them violently fight with each other throughout my childhood. i usually never had the chance to speak out my thoughts and my feelings since i never really had a stable and healthy parental figure and in my culture, it's disrespectful if you talk back to elders. 

i've always struggled with intense mood swings and uncontrollable anger. i also tend to get impulsive with buying things that i like and i tend to overspend. i also have attachment and abandonment issues that  makes my anxiety worse. i've always felt like an irony, a hypocrite and a paradox most of the time since my mood, thoughts and views would change a lot. i feel unstable and lost and sometimes i would feel like i'm out of my body and that i never belonged in this body. it would feel that my name didn't belong to me and that i am just in another person's body. (it's weird i know)

whenever i also date someone, i tend to obsess over them and not be able to maintain stable relationships. rn i have a boyfriend and it really does get unstable because of me and my mood swings and with how sensitive i can be. it also hurts because i know he will never love me as intensely as i love him and sometimes my anxiety makes me isolate from him. i also have a hard time with opening up and trusting due to me just bottling everything up and it does put a strain on the relationship.

i tried to change myself for the better but it's easier said than done. i also wanted to take myself to a therapist but i don't have enough funds for now. when i first heard of bpd, i felt like everything made sense and that everything i felt was valid. though, it still does make me uneasy. 

i'm sorry if it became too long and i just rambled on about my personal issues with the strangers on the internet, but i've seen all of your interactions here and it gives me strength and assurance. thank you all for being a nice community. i just want to ask for help and advice from you all.",1668217450.0,False,1,2,OkCompote866,None,ystdbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/ystdbe/i_think_i_have_bpd/

Today, I am off all meds, and my BPD and Co-Dependency are ""cured"" according to my therapist who ended my therapy last fall. I am still symptom free.

My last two years of therapy actually consisted of an on-going debate with my therapist and doctors of psychology on my own thoughts of the field of psychology and the business model used today.

In short, I think it's garbage because too many people in the system (if you can get in) report a lot of their therapy not working as well as they need. 

We have Holistic Medicine, but I have an idea for Holistic Mental Health. I used my findings, studies, and practices on myself and it worked. My therapist and all my psyche friends are on board and agree... (they would do what I did, but the psyche board that runs and operates their job forbids it.)

I want the life of a normal person with a family and children , but I'm afraid that I won't be a good mom with these traits. I can barely take care of myself. I am in a loving relationship with a partner who also has neurodivergent issues. I honestly don't know what our future will look like because we want these things, however how can we be good parents if we have to use all of our energy and then some just to keep ourselves together? It's so hard. I'm very smart I have a degree from college and everything and my family thinks I'm OK but I'm really far from it in reality. 

I live in a completely different state they don't know how hard my life is how hard it is just to be able to function and do basic things and how long I've been struggling to deal with this ever since I was the kid. I've always had issues cleaning my room and got in trouble for the majority of my life and even as an adult I still can't seem to keep my spaces clean when I go through depressive episodes. I don't know what else to do. I hate taking medication because I'm not like schizophrenic or anything and I also have allergic actions and very sensitive reactions to most medicines. I only ever take them as last result if I am suicidal. However, on a daily basis, I can function for the most part until something triggers me and gets me in this funk that it takes me months to get out of.

I'm just kind of in a mood thinking about the future. I really don't want to be one of those moms that traumatizes my children for life. I want my children to grow up in a loving safe and happy environment. Sometimes I go back-and-forth in my head about whether or not I even want to have children because of this. I‚Äôm my mom‚Äôs only child and I would love for her to have grandchildren from my side. My brothers have children so now these are pretty much her grandkids, but I know she wants her daughter to give birth at some point. Part of me really feels really guilty like I can‚Äôt fulfill the obligations.

I never had a chance to find out who I really am, and because I daily use substances, mostly sedatives, weed and alcohol, I can never fucking tell that why am I acting like this.

Context:

I was diagnosed in February after several misdiagnosis and lots of wrong medicine

As of late, i found myself in a good place with my meds and DBT. However i recently started seeing someone and some of my BPD is showing. Im obsessing over him and totally infatuated. Definitely a Favorite Person situation. 

I sat him down and talked to him about my diagnosis and explained what it means for a partner. He listened, and explained he would do what he can to help, especially with not triggering some of my negative feelings. Then he asked me for the symptoms lists (after i said i scored 9/9) 

He expressed he believes he might have it as he feels 7/9 of the symptoms. Im of couse highly encouraging seeing someone about it and i can see it as he is obsessing over me as much as i him. 

My ask is this, lets say he does have it. Is this a relationship that is sustainable? Is it possible for two people with DBT to date and it be healthy relationship. Or are we doomed before we even really start. Should i dip out before i get REALLY attached? Im going to talk to my therapist about it but i wanted some perspective from others with BPD. 

Thank you.

My emotional pain is here 24/7, but I get sudden intrusive thoughts about my ex and they cause intense rushes of pain. It's not uncommon for these episodes to trigger panic attacks. My mind right now is basically: my heart is broken, she was literally my soulmate and now she found someone else and doesn't care about me, I can't handle this level of emotional pain but I can't die because I'm afraid of what comes after, but there is no cure for this. There is no medication or procedure to end this pain. I can't take it but I have to live unfortunately.

By the way, she was the love of my life and we were absolutely perfect for each other. It was my longest and most genuine and loving relationship. And time doesn't heal things for me.

In a nutshell:

-different behavior/identity with different people (chameleon, unsure of who I am)
-mood swings
-going through phases, different clothing style for example
-cutting off people relentlessly (no friends left)
-only black and white mindset
-paranoid about relationships with people (loving to hating them in a matter of moments)
-unable to hold a job down for longer than a few months
-changing sexuality (I go from disgust of same gender to being attracted to them in a matter of moments)
-isolation because I‚Äôve basically given up on my life
-fear of abandonment 
-constantly paranoid/creating worst case scenarios about what people think of me for example

192,"Potential diagnosis, need some help","Hey, found this subreddit today. I‚Äôve always felt somethin was up with me, but nothing crippling or life-ruining.  It certainly life-affecting. I genuinely believe I have got BPD but have never been diagnosed. Yet I don‚Äôt want to take any meds. As I worry it‚Äôll affect my creativity (which I wanna make a living from). 

Out of the key symptoms I suffer from;
1. Fear of abandonment - particularly from my girlfriend. I‚Äôm convinced that she and others will backstab even though I know it isn‚Äôt true. But the paranoia is there 24/7. Whenever a disagreement arises I get hella clingy and assume she‚Äôs ignoring me, that she hates me and that I‚Äôve turned her against me. 
2. Unstable/intense relationships - I constantly assume people are out to get me and will backstab (as I said before). Or I‚Äôll go from idolising someone to wishing they‚Äôd die. Then feel awful for ever considering that. I feel very much like a friend can‚Äôt be just a friend, that there‚Äôs gotta be 100% trust there, ride or die. 
3. Unstable self-image/sense of self -  I constantly question whether I‚Äôm a true creative or not. Whether I‚Äôm genuinely intelligent, a good writer, whether I‚Äôm a fraud/liar, etc. I disassociate occasionally and slip away for awhile. I‚Äôm quite versed in nihilism, existentialism and absurdism. So I sit there and accuse myself of being nothing but a loser who knows nothing. 
4. Rapid mood swings - I go from 1-100 quick af. Generally I‚Äôm pretty down beaten, except with my gf, who makes me beyond happy. But I will go from being 1 mood to another rapidly that people think they‚Äôve done something in a moment to upset me, when in reality it‚Äôs just inside I suddenly feel like I wanna punch someone, or ball my eyes out. 
5. Impulsive/dangerous behaviour - I feel I don‚Äôt exhibit this particularly besides my occasional bad habits with money. I have a stable relationship, rarely ever drink and have never touched drugs. 
6. Suicidal tendencies - Yeah I constantly feel like I and everyone would. be better off if I was dead. I constantly go over whether people would notice, then go off on one about my death meaning just as little as my life did. I‚Äôve attempted twice before but not for a long time. 
7. Feelings of emptiness - I constantly feel lost or hollow. As I said above, I constantly feel fraudulent or like any work/achievements I‚Äôve made and earned so far are pointless and that I‚Äôm undeserving. I don‚Äôt even feel deserving of my girlfriend. I feel hella empathy for others, then it becomes a twisted and selfish action to make people attached to me (what it feels like anyway). 
8. Paranoia - About everything. Whenever people read my work I assume they‚Äôre out to steal it and ruin me, that they‚Äôll fuck ip my life and I‚Äôll have nothing. I never trust anyone until I literally 100% trust em with everything (which is rare, literally 3 people in my life mean that to me). As I said ride or die. Even with things like old arguments, I believe people don‚Äôt forgive and that they secretly hate me but don‚Äôt say, and that everyone chats shit .
9. Anger issues - I tend to explode at little things and get hella frustrated easily. But gradually that‚Äôs receded.

193,I think I might have BPD,"So I‚Äôm gonna start this off by saying I‚Äôm not trying to self-diagnose. But I recently heard what BPD was and I felt genuinely seen for the first time in my life. I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs something I should maybe go to the doctor about.

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was pretty young, as well as being emotionally, physically, and sexually abused for most of my childhood, so I‚Äôve always assumed my issues go back to that. But at the same time it‚Äôs always felt a little extreme for anxiety and depression (not that those can‚Äôt be severe). 

I frequently end up sobbing for hours on end because I‚Äôve decided that somebody secretly hates me, but as soon as they give me attention I‚Äôll be fine. It‚Äôs ruined more than one relationship for me. I‚Äôm constantly terrified of being abandoned and would do almost anything to avoid being abandoned. I genuinely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever went more than a few days without crying, in my entire life. I have frequent anxiety attacks. I‚Äôve had three suicide attempts (which I‚Äôve told nobody about), my leg is covered in scars from self-injury, and I have a history of disordered eating. I also have a history of risky drug use, drinking, and hypersexuality. Sometimes I can‚Äôt recognize myself when I look in the mirror, and I‚Äôve had issues with dissociation for as long as I can remember. I have these weird three month cycles of emptiness, kinda on and off, where I‚Äôll just feel empty and dead for three months and then I‚Äôll be back to normal. I have random episodes of body dysmorphia. People around me have always described my emotions as being extremes. I‚Äôm either really happy, really, sad, or really angry and there‚Äôs no in-between. I sometimes get really irrationally paranoid that someone‚Äôs gonna murder me (for example, my dad gave me some chocolates for Valentine‚Äôs Day and I decided they were poisoned and threw them away. My dad was abusive when I was young but I don‚Äôt really have a reason to believe he would kill me.) I‚Äôve tried going to therapy before but it‚Äôs never really helped 

I never really thought that I might have BPD because I assumed it was like Bipolar disorder, for some reason. But I‚Äôm not sure. I need some advice. I‚Äôm still not sure if it‚Äôs just the anxiety, depression, and trauma or if it could be BPD or something else.",1649785443.0,False,1,4,DizzyStrawberri,None,u24v9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/u24v9i/i_think_i_might_have_bpd/

I never thought of telling them because when I told my parents they reacted badly and dismissed it. As any middle eastern parents mental health is a taboo subject so for me to tell them Im sick meant they reacted badly and were actually mad at me.

I've thought about this before and I'm just curious if any of you are like this. 

Throughout my life, I've had some physical health issues, and surgeries, that have privileged me to some of the most addictive painkillers prescribable.

I have watched some of these painkillers destroy, of hurt, people that I cared a great deal about.

But I never got addicted. When it was time to taper off, I had no problem. When it was time to stop, I had no issue besides lingering pain. Occasionally, I still need to request a bottle of some of these medicines, but they last me well past multiples of the prescribed term.

I have even tried illicit drugs (I'm a sucker for peer pressure, lmao) and tbh, never even really felt a high. I never felt a draw to go back. 

Whereas, I am extremely addicted to praise and attention. I used to play online games because I was good at them, and the praise that group after group gave me was ridiculous. I'd join failing groups and people knew my name and would be relieved.

I literally had to sell my character so I'd never go back.

I've been trying to find out what's wrong with me for a really long time because something never feels right, when I'm talking to someone, when I'm thinking about myself, when I'm not doing anything...

I've had a few theories, from depression, to bipolar disorder, to ADHD, but reading the symptoms of BPD felt like a wake up call.

I could relate to everything that was written, no matter how detailed a description, and even my best friend who I talk with everyday and never hide anything from said ""it's like you're the one who wrote it""
It was almost scary?
I thought no one could feel like I do, because it's so much and I can barely explain it, so I felt happy, for a moment.
Tho seen might be a better word?

I've read everything that everyone wrote on this sub in the last few weeks, and I don't think I'm feeling well...
The toxic, impossible and obsessive type of love, idealizing then devaluating a friend, oversharing online and deleting as soon as it gets no traction, feeling empty when I'm supposed to feel normal, the rage that makes me selfish and impulsive and wow feeling like everybody is going to leave me soon enough...

If this is all me, will I ever be okay?
Cause it wouldn't be something I have, but something I *am*

I wish this could just be solved by taking medicine, but I guess it's not depression...

203,Feeling lonely after losing relationships even on meds,"I've been on meds for more than a year by now and it's been working a lot. I take one for mood swings, one for mild depression and one for my obsession on relationships/sex. The thing is that this month has been a bitch for my relationships.

Two weeks ago I had to end a friendship cause she was being manipulative, competitive and trying to put all the bad aspects of our relationship as if it was all my fault. I really struggle about imposing myself cause I always think I'm throwing a tantrum and it feels real bad moments after I'm done, even when I know I'm right and being totally reasonable.

Last week I lost a friend. He got murdered by a security guard on a park here in the city. We new each other for sometime, but we were getting closer and I keep thinking about what it would've become if he was still here. I'm also avoiding our gropu of friends cause I think I can't and don't want to process it right now.

Like it wasn't enough, yesterday I finifhed things up with this guy I've been hooking up with. It's been a situationship for a while now, he kept giving me these mixed signals, I was getting to confused and I'm not spending money and time on therapy and medicine to be wasted on guys that can't offer me a bit of certainty and compromise, so I told him that I was done and all of the reasons cause I like to be direct and clear, unlike these f-ing guys that can't seem to learn how to freaking communicate.

Anyway, these events are triggering me right now and I'm feeling so lonely. I have this friend which I've been spending a lot of time with, but I can't count on her all the time. I try to distract myself, but this feeling is always in the back of my mind and I just feel like crying and asking myself what's wrong with me that I can't have good steady relationships and be loved like everyone else. I just feel so messed up right now.",1674431153.0,False,1,1,hadespoc,:pride:LGBT+:pride:,10iy1vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/10iy1vg/feeling_lonely_after_losing_relationships_even_on/
204,"Guilt, Shame & Blame - a mod approved research post","Hey everyone, as part of my doctoral thesis\* I've developed a questionnaire to shed some light on how guilt, shame and blame impacts the loved ones of someone with mental health needs. 

If you provide informal mental health support to someone and notice these emotions showing up in the relationship, I would really appreciate hearing from you (or perhaps you could invite the person who provides support for you?)

People who have completed the survey have reported finding the survey insightful and that it helped them understand more about their emotional experience in the relationship.

The whole survey takes around 15-20 minutes and after understanding more about your current emotional state, it goes through a range of scenarios to see how you would likely respond if it were to happen today. All answers are scales so there is minimal typing and it is mobile friendly.

You can read more or access the study here:¬†[https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_9AWrvoYWvPCqTu6](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9AWrvoYWvPCqTu6)

The person supported doesn't need a formal diagnosis but they need to have received professional input (medication, therapy, etc) for 6 months or more. The survey is available internationally and recognises all types of informal support, be it financial, practical or emotional. 

Thanks everyone. We really value the input from the BPD community as we know it tends to impact loved ones in a unique way and for us as researchers it is really important that these voices are heard.

205,My bpd bf wants to do better but don‚Äôt know how,"Hi! As the title states my(29) bf(27) has bpd, he was diagnosed around 5 years ago (we met 6 years ago) and is still on the waitlist for dbt. Our relationship has its ups and downs as one would expect and we encounter most if not all of the ‚Äòtypical‚Äô issues in our relationship. Our fights are intense and usually ends up with him hurting me (verbally, never physically) or us breaking up and then getting back together a few minutes or hours later. I have always tried to be supportive and validating his feelings to the best of my abilities but lately I have become so emotionally drained that I most often cannot handle situations well (in the sense of validating and staying calm etc). Not only because it feels like a never ending cycle of the same arguments over and over again but also because he has gotten so used to my attempts at validation that he now goes with ‚ÄúYou are so -insert issue here- and don‚Äôt say you hear me or understand that I feel like this and don‚Äôt say you want me to express my emotions because it doesn‚Äôt work!‚Äù 
And also, when he brings up resolved arguments and acts as if we don‚Äôt resolve it last week (and by that I don‚Äôt mean that he can‚Äôt have new feelings about the same issue, I mean the same in the most literal sense where he acts as if we have not even grazed over the issue, and if I mention that we have talked about it and try to bring up what conclusion we reached together last time/s then he says that the solutions we found are inadequate and that I ‚Äòobviously do not care about him since I haven‚Äôt changed‚Äô. 

I don‚Äôt want to go in to too much details because the purpose of me posting this is more so to reach out and ask you guys (if you have bpd or if your partner does) if you have any tips for how to handle the relationship, especially during the most argumentative periods where anything and everything seem to be an issue to fight about.
And also if you have any sources for me to educate myself further (preferably more so than just the ‚Äòtry to stay calm and validate their feelings, I know that it is what is most effective but I feel like I need more to be able to handle situations better)
But also sources for him to read, both to understand his diagnosis better but also for him to read about how he should try to handle these periods.

He wants to do better and he experiences a lot of guilt when he ‚Äòcomes out‚Äô of the episode, so to speak. So I am not writing this to bash him in any way as I know he tries his best, I wouldn‚Äôt stay with him if I didn‚Äôt think he was. 

Last night we reached a ‚Äòend of the period‚Äô-type argument where he said he was sick of me and couldn‚Äôt be in the same house as me etc and then later he turned and got a lot of feelings of guilt and asked me to help him find resources to be able to better understand and handle these kinds of situations in the future.

I want to apologize beforehand if I have expressed myself insesitively, it is such a difficult subject to discuss bluntly and I feel like I have underlying frustrations from this last situation being just a few hours ago.

He has been in therapy ever since, but right now as he is on the wait list most of his contact with the clinic is more so with doctors about medicine and a nurse more so for checking up on him.",1708332030.0,False,1,3,ryanodunning,None,1auin28,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1auin28/my_bpd_bf_wants_to_do_better_but_dont_know_how/
206,I think I need to get diagnosed but I don't know how,"Hi everyone. I just discovered this sub about five minutes ago, because I'm currently freaking out about what to do, but after looking at two posts I think this is where I need to spend some time. Also I apologize if there are answers to my questions already, but I'm at work and I plan to read up on this sub after work. Sorry to repeat.

I've known there's something wrong with me for years, but I couldn't ever figure out what, and neither could therapists and doctors. Some drugs and CBT helped some areas, but it was never enough. Just this morning I read an article containing 9 prompts for BPD, and it was evaluated on DSM-5 diagnosing. I checked off the first 5 boxes and didn't even continue reading. The symptoms all perfectly line up, the issues perfectly line up. I think I finally figured out what's wrong with me, but now I don't know where to go from here.

Do I go see a therapist first? All of the local ones in my area specialize in depression/anxiety and use CBT, whereas this article said I should pursue something called dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT?).

Do I go see a psychiatrist first? I think they specialize in medicine, and I'd love to go on a pill for some immediate relief (just yesterday destroyed my relationship, which is the best part of my life rn), but I think I need to eventually go into long-term therapy.

I guess my question is what do I do first. Who can I go to for a diagnosis.

209,I want to smoke weed again,"Hey all,

So I quite marijuana a year and 2 weeks ago. I got addicted to it and was smoking all day everyday to the point I became a zombie. I developed a binge eating disorder and gained weight and it just really destroyed my life in many other ways I won‚Äôt get into it.

Well, I took a long break from it and always planned to return to it when I felt better about myself and my life was doing okay because when I first started smoking before it became an unhealthy habit it was truly amazing. It made me feel good and confident and alleviated stress and helped me sleep. I used it medically at first and it really did wonders for my life. But then I craved the high 24/7 and it soon just numbed be out completely.

Well it‚Äôs a year later and I really wanna smoke again. I‚Äôm not where I wish I was mentally and still am in the process of losing all the weight I gained from my eating disorder (I‚Äôm 25 pounds down of 60) but I just feel like the weed could be introduced again in a medicinal way. I remember smoking and then running on the treadmill for an hour, and cleaning my room, and actually being social and talking to people. I remember the good it actually did for me when I used it properly and I want that back. 

I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs a good idea to start smoking again. I have a great support system and I have learned now after a year how to control myself that I truly am not worried about falling back into old habits.

210,Need advice,"I normally would not post anywhere but I really need advice. I have had a lot of things go wrong the last month and a half. I‚Äôve been letting my BPD get the best of me. I have been angry all the time, taking it out on my boyfriend so much so that we almost broke up because I have been picking fight with getting angry for reason. He also felt that he wasn‚Äôt enough for me. We are staying to together and work things out. It has been causing me to have a mental break down and all I want is to isolate myself which I know is definitely not healthy.

I‚Äôm a 27 y/o female, been diagnosed with BPD for 10 year ago and have been on mood stabilizers for the last 6 years. I needed an increase in meds recently which made my depressive episodes decrease.

214,Gabapentin and Mania,"I recently took a huge step towards my mental health and went into a 7 day inpatient program. I learned so many coping skills, gained self-love, and made new friends. While I was there, I spoke with the mental crisis hospital's Psychiatrist every day. I used to take Olanzapine 2.5mg and 5mg and I just did NOT like how it would completely sedate me to the point to where I would fall asleep no matter what. Well, I mentioned this to the Psychiatrist and she instead prescribed me Gabapentin 100mg. I did not feel much if any effects on this so she raised it to 300mg. I was feeling this dosage but still having a good amount of anxiety. That's when we raised it to 600mg.

I take 600mg Gabapentin 3 times a day and all I have to say is wow. My new self-love, combined with my Wellbutrin and Prozac makes me feel like a new man. I'm actually feeling happy again and not depressed which is amazing because I've had MDD for over a year now. It's such an amazing feeling and I don't want it to stop.

My Psychiatrist warned me about one thing though. She said she is over-prescribing me and because of that, I could start experiencing mania. Now, guys, I don't know if what I'm feeling is mania or true happiness. It's a great feeling. I'm doing much more around the house and I'm able to regulate my emotions better. But I'm scared. She said this mania could evolve into Bipolar, and im already BPD, so I don't really want that.

Do you guys have any experience with Gabapentin? Is this dose too much? Have you experienced mania with it? I want to know more about this drug or combination of drugs because I feel like I FINALLY found something that works for me.
