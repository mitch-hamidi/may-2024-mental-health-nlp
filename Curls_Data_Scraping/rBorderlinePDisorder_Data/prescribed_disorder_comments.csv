1,"Everyone's mental disorder is different, so there's no one set of medication that will work for everyone. I've been on multiple meds over the years, different dosages too. I was on citalopram for about 6 years but they had to keep upping the dose for it to work and I had hit max dose so they switched me. I'm currently on Duloxetine (anti depressant), bupropion (another antidepressant) and Lamotrigine (mood stabilizer). This combination has had the best results since my diagnosis. We change the dosages based on how I'm doing (I see my psychiatrist every few months). Medication can be tricky and frustrating, but finding a good combination has literally been night and day.
Best of luck OP!",eener_meenermineymoe,1co6wcg

3,"In 2021, Springer put out a systematic review and meta-analysis of [Pharmacologic Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8478737/) symptomatology. Table 1 shows current recommendations of medication classes for specific BPD-associated symptoms.

I'm not sure how accurate this is, but I once read that ""treatment resistance,"" such as in depression or schizophrenia, simply means that we lack the medical technology to appropriately target the specific neural correlates of certain symptoms. Some have argued that borderline personality disorder has an underlying biological component and that, one day, medications may exist that treat the condition. Again, I'm not sure how accurate that is, but it's interesting.

As an aside, this editorial from the American Journal of Psychiatry is informative: [Endogenous Opioid Deficiency in Borderline Personality Disorder](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10040634).",aperyu-1,1co6wcg
4,"I'm on an antipsychotic (Olanzapine) myself.  They put me on it, as needed, while doing my DBT/CBT program.  I've since decided to go on it daily, and it has helped me a lot.  The thing is though, it's meant to treat schizophrenia and bipolar.  It's not ""meant for"" BPD.  That being said, my BPD episodes are much better :)",SailorCredible,1co6wcg
5,It's individually based on your brains chemistry. You should ask your doctor what would be best for you. It takes trial and error . I believe there is a test now that can show what meds will work best for you too..,byagoat,1co6wcg
6,lamictal is lifesaving bro,thisisme1202,1co6wcg
7,I was put on a mood stabilizer that helped me immensely. Lamictal. There’s no one set medication for BPD but things that can help with the symptoms. For me it was a mood stabilizer and an SSRI,mholland1778,1co6wcg
8,"Nothing prescribed specifically for BPD, one of the meds I take for Bipolar disorder is Lamotrigine (Lamictal) but I feel it helps a ton with evening out my moods that are normally all over the place with BPD. Also take Abilify and that’s helped tremendously with my anger and aggression.

What works the best is going to be different for evergone. BPD is a very vast diagnosis that encompasses a ton of different traits, different medications are chosen to target different things. There are plenty of people with BPD who are helped tremendously with antidepressants, but antidepressants personally aren’t a good fit for me, for example.",mean_trash_monster,1co6wcg

11,"My psychiatrist said that no meds really work for BPD but we’re treating the symptoms along with DBT. Wellbutrin and lamictal seem to help some, and he also just put me on risperdal.",FaithlessnessNo9625,1co6wcg
12,"I was put on amisulpride for depression before my BPD diagnosis and I accidentally discovered that it's absolutely lifesaving and incredible for it. I'm not surprised it doesn't show up ANYWHERE as a suggestion or in research, because in the US it is/was illegal for psychiatric use, but it's incredible and I stand by it, 2 years after starting to take it every day. It's an atypical antipsychotic that works incredibly well as an antidepressant at a very low dose.

At a low dose, it took away pretty much 80% of all of my symptoms of BPD and has maintained that for the entire 2 years that i've been regularly taking it. I've been on MANY medications across the years since I was 13 (I'm 27 now) and this is the only medication that has efficiently worked for my BPD across all symptoms. 

The downsides for me are excessive sleepiness (on amisulpride alone I was sleeping 16 hours per day), weight gain and complete infertility (no periods whatsoever). But I'm on the trifecta of medications for my ADHD, BPD and BP and they work perfectly together. Methylphenidate keeps me awake so I don't sleep 16 hours per day, amisulpride prevents me from being a social fiend and overly emotional/uncontrollable, and lamotrigine keeps me from falling into deep intense depression. It took me many years of absolute horror to find this combination, but I'm incredibly thankful that I never gave up.",Aggressive-Degree613,1co6wcg
13,"I cannot imagine anything rooting out my brain motherboard. It's just how my brain is wired. It's how I perceive the world around me. It's how I see the events.

Impulsively said yes to marrying a person i knew only for a month through texting before seeing him physically. Got two tattoos done on both my wrist that i regrett. Did 8 body piercings not sure how i feel about them. That medicine did me nothing good but i was riding high on that medicine. Now i have got my dig of Bipolar 2 and BPD. 
The point is these meds are used my doctors on case by case basis doesn’t matter what you really have. These meds for mental disorder are used for the treatment of an umbrella of disorders.",Extension-Bath1590,1co6wcg

0,"I have ADHD and I have had ritalin for it for a few days now. Honestly, I talked a lot with my psychiatrist and they don't prescribe it for people who don't have ADHD. Basically because eventhough they don't know exactly how it works on our brains they know it's just basically c0cayne for others. So no. 

If you lack motivation and stuff but nobody has ever talked about ADHD in your case, they probably will give you other types of medication like Antidepressants but not ritalin. It's already real hard for people with ADHD to get those meds so I doubt they will give it to others haha.",Charlie_Doe7,14ik3uh
1,"Hmm, can I offer my experience and an observation? I take Ritalin as treatment for my ADHD, it helps me tremendously but has never really been the source for motivation. I've often had whole afternoons where I basically chuck my todo list in the fuck-it-bucket and just lay on my bed or some shit. 

I feel that a lack of motivation to do anything is a sign of many other things which might not be treated with stimulants. Have you ever chatted to a psychiatrist or doctor.? 

I, for example, have a severe lack of motivation and have been struggling for 2 weeks now. I know that I'm depressed because I have gotten good at spotting g the other symptoms of depression in myself - including a lack of motivation. 

Hope this is helpful I'm some way",chronically-iconic,14ik3uh

5,"ritalin doesn’t give you motivation. the other thing is, it will not affect someone without adhd the way it affects someone with adhd. just like caffeine for example, caffeine often calms people with adhd vs giving people without adhd a boost of energy or waking them up etc. if you need motivation, maybe talk to your therapist and maybe there’s certain things to do in therapy to work on that or honestly antidepressants might help more with that (im not sure, im not a psychiatrist).",Call_Such,14ik3uh

It is up to a psychiatrist to decide if someone can remain diligent and take their meds as prescribed. Also, some stimulants have more than one FDA approved usage.

8,"Over the years, fluoxetine (prozac), carbamazepine (tegretol), mirtazapine (remeron), venlafaxine (effexor), diazepam (valium), lorazepam (ativan)...

Currently on 200mg sertraline (zoloft) in the morning, and 250mg quetiapine (seroquel) morning and night, then 5mg diazepam at lunch time and tea time and 1mg lorazepam if I need something extra to help me cope. Quite heavily medicated right now as I'm in-patient and suicidal. 

Most meds I've been on seem to help for a few years, then kinda stop working. Fluoxetine made me feel worse so was only on that a month. I've been on max dose of sertraline for about 4 years now and seems like it's come to the end of its useful life for me, at least on its own. The quetiapine is an anti-psychotic, but they've prescribed it as a mood stabiliser (similar to how carbamazepine was prescribed for mood stabilising even tho it's an anti-epileptic) and there's research to suggest that it increases effectiveness of anti depressants. 

I've been on one medication or another for 20+ years now, it just feels part of life for me 🤷‍♂️",bedrock_BEWD,tzrjl5
9,"Some anti depressants helped, but for the most part I felt all the bad side effects from them all (weight gain, hair loss, blurry vision, anger, extremely sensitive to temperature, diarrhea, etc).

Unfortunately, after 4 months or so they stopped being effective (I guess my body got used to them), and I couldn't get them adjusted because finding a competent psychiatrist is impossible.  But for a bit they were very positive.

I’ve tried 4 SSRIs, they either ruined my sleep or made me gain a lot of weight. Agomelatine did neither fortunately",trymethot,tzrjl5
14,"1. Lexapro - made me wake up drenched in sweat/nauseous every morning. Got off of it after 6 months or so.

2. Seroquel - got up to 900 mg at one point at the mismanagement of a shitty psychiatrist. I guess it helped me get through college. I brought myself down to 100 mg now at night and I've been on it the longest (7 years now). Is basically a sleep aid at this point and I want to keep tapering down. 

3. Latuda - gave me akathesia which was by far the most uncomfortable side effect  I've ever experienced. Stopped after a month. Loved it though, in the beginning.

4. Welbutrin - game changer for me when I first started it. Lost 20 pounds, gave up some bad habits. 300 mg in the morning now, I can skip a day without feeling terrible and I feel it helps keep me from slipping into longer periods of depression. Doesn't help anxiety.",tentativeteas,tzrjl5

This time I’m on Propranolol. It’s a medication given to people with stage fright and social anxiety, it doesn’t last long but my dr wants me to take it for awhile to see how much I can handle. It makes it to where my body can’t have a physical reaction to anger because my blood pressure is too low (it’s a blood pressure medication, too) Im also on 50 mg Adderall XRs a day and I swear it feels like I’m floating down a lazy river relaxing and it calms my “buzzing” in my head.

For me, the most important thing is to pay attention to changes with your mind and body when trying medication, and having a psychiatrist who listens and is willing to adjust while keeping you comfortable.

But I sat on my friends off and dig deeper. Decided to do it. And boy. 

I took it at night around ten. It took about twenty minutes to kick in. My mind felt so happy. Not manic but just happy and with myself and what makes me happy. But my body felt drunk. Not too much standing happened. Lots of laughing and loving but not a lot of moving. 

Lasted maybe thirty minutes. We chilled the rest of the night until we felt safe he could go home. 

DUDE!!!!

I woke up for the first time in my LIFE(diagnosed MDD since 9y/o) without having to think. I didn’t have to think about breathing. I could move alittle. And just be. 

This lasted one day. The next day was less. Then it was gone. I tried it the same way a week later, got nothing. I decided not to continue because I was a NAS baby and that could be very dangerous for me.

Word of warning: IDK what your doctor told you in terms of how often to take it or use it (I’m not giving medical advice!) but in my experience it is very easy to develop a tolerance, so that the medication doesn’t work unless you up the dose.

2,"So you have not been diagnosed with BPD? Your symptoms could fit a few of the cluster B's but also some other MI. It is incredibly important you see a psychiatrist who is able to diagnose you via sessions or testing. Self diagnosis is a huge mistake.  I was misdiagnosed for decades and only got a conclusive diagnosis after intensive neuro-psych testing and a lot of admitting stuff I did not want to.

Therapy is awkward questions, no matter your diagnosis. Breathing exercises as well. They are time tested basic skills to lead to diagnosis and treatment. Our thoughts and feelings are uncomfortable at best and torture at worst, the goal of treatment is not to eliminate it all but to tolerate it effectively. 

You may also find someone is not thrilled about giving a firm diagnosis because they are far more concerned with symptom management than an umbrella term from the DSM. It helped me a lot to not focus on the BPD diagnosis because to me it gave me ""victim status"". For a while I became the poor broken girl with a diagnosis that made it acceptable for me to act out and not heal. I read all the things about how impossible it is to treat and fell into that. I now know that it patently false. There is treatment for BPD and it is hard work but DBT is the only broadly effective thing I have seen.  I did 3 IOP's to get my skills pretty firm and to mitigate my self harm.  I still do at home ""tune ups"" using all of my worksheets etc from the program and my regular therapist. 

As to medications, everyone is different. I know people from my program who are now med free and I take an antidepressant, mood stabilizer, and something for nightmares. For me, in my total diagnosis, they are necessary but if I had to choose between only meds or only DBT I would take DBT any day because part and parcel it is by far the most effective thing in my tool box.

9,"Hi, I would actively say that this is me.

I've never been on any long-term medication, hell I've never really been on meds at all, despite there being moments when I questioned my judgement. 

However nearly 6 years on, I would say I am not healed but I actively recognise and understand the cycles I can go through and how my environment, my support network, job, diet - all of it actively plays into being healthy and happy.

I've been through A LOT of emotionally charged situations during that time too. It has not been at all easy - I've had to focus time and energy in getting to understand myself better and almost retraining my brain to understand how people communicate, how what is said and then done can be two different things, how fallible humankind is, what my principles are, what I stand for, what I believe in, who I am, my loves, hates and lusts.

It has been like learning to walk again and learning to prioritise and centre myself as the most important person in my life. I've had earnest and difficult conversations with the people around me, I have cut people out of my life, I have had to take a good long hard look at myself in the mirror and understand that whilst the pain that I can feel is not my fault, it is certainly my responsibility to ensure that I do not pass it on knowingly and that I ensure that I put boundaries in place to ensure my long term ability to grow and thrive, vs feeding myself the scraps from other people.  

Support networks are vital and I recognise now that I need to feel that I am seen and heard - and this can occur in a variety of forms.

That said, the therapy I had during covid changed my life. It gave me a lot of clarity over what I was doing and how it could continue to feed the angst if I didn't speak up for myself. I did, but still I felt terrible and realised that my friends didn't understand and didn't want to understand, so I made a hard decision to remove my presence and cut them out. Looking back, I would do things differently, but there also comes a point, that you can feel the pressure and pain radiate through your body, telling you, 'No more. We can't take any more.'

But it is a process and you have to commit to it. But I can say that I am content - I am living a life that aligns with who I am - I am looking after myself.

47,"This was me for a long time - I could preemptively say that as something improved, another aspect of my life would come crashing down. I think, in a way, it was a feeble attempt at keeping some control over a very overwhelming situation.

I recommend sitting down and writing out the things you want in your life, both material and immaterial. Then, look at all areas of your life and hone in on the things you can and can not control. Then make a small and steady plan of action on how you can begin to address these areas one at a time.

A lot of the change came off the back of losing my Grandparents on the same day. They gave me a love that truly was only matched by one other person in my life so far - I recognised that I needed to honour their lives and all that they had stood for by pouring that love, respect, kindness into me. I knew that things weren't going to get better if I continually sabotaged every effort I made in life.

Something I also realised was, there are a hell of a lot of other people out there who do not possess this level of self awarness or desire to improve and they are living life - not held back by anything. By taking notice of that, I knew and I can see that I am where I want to be and need to be right now. 

I would much rather have gone through all of this, to ensure that I can support myself and others across the rest of my lifetime, than live an existence being none the wiser.

The biggest lesson is holding yourself to account. I know others who have BPD who do not help themselves. And I say that with kindness - if you continue to bask in patterns of behaviour which you know serve no long-term purpose in your life, being the way you want it to be, then you have to be strict and push yourself to do better, as ultimately we are the only ones who will be with ourselves to the bitter end. The people around you can love and support you, but they cannot solve the pain in your head, you have to unpick it and find reasoning as to why you feel the way you do and why it makes you act the way you feel you need to.

Once you have this understanding, it slowly begins to get easier - you can identify why you get happy or sad in day-to-day life and understand that it isn't all related to the diagnosis - you're human, and you will go through multiple emotions. This lessens the impact on your nervous system and results in confidence returns.

But the way I see it is if I weren’t on this combo (that’s working great to keep me from jumping off the nearest bridge) I wouldn’t make it past a few years from now. If this crazy combination kills me in ten years—I’ll still live eight years longer than I would’ve without the meds. 

The weird thing is I get brain zaps regularly!  I don’t know why. I take my medication religiously. I even have it organized in one of those little medication things. I suspect it’s the gabapentin. It doesn’t bother me much because it doesn’t hurt but it’s a little…startling? Especially because it only happens like twice a weak. 

So I’m on a shit ton of a medication but I’m not like raging on anyone. My biggest problem was social anxiety (I think my upbringing taught me that people = scary/bad). I’d also get horrible mood swings. Usually towards my mom because I’m most comfortable with her. I’d make her cry. So I asked my doctor for something to stabilize my mood and he gave me gabapentin. 

I think next time I’ll ask him if he thinks my medication combo is bad. He wouldn’t prescribe me aderall but said he would if I got diagnosed, which I have. I am seeing a different doctor for adhd. 

But to be honest I am questioning my BPD diagnosis. I think this has been ADHD/autism all along. I no longer meet the criteria for BPD but it’s probably because of the medication. I still relate to people with BPD and that was my original diagnosis. However, I have special interests, can’t make eye contact, I’m socially awkward, don’t make friends easily. The list goes on!  My sister has a son (my nephew) with autism so when I say I think I am autistic I am met with a lot to backlash because my sister has a son with autism and “knows what it looks like” and my mom was an assistant for kids with special needs. They think being autistic makes you dumb or something and that because I can function, barely, cause I got a degree and a profession with a salary that means I’m not autistic. Shit is frustrating to be honest. I’ve always been pretty high up on the “intelligence” scale that people won’t believe that I suspect autism.",acidic_milkmotel,u36xm6

I needed to take extended release melatonin for a few weeks to help sleep but was able to wean off of it.

97,"Yes I am, I think it's actually working! My mood swings have been occurring much less often and my mood feels generally more regulated. I've also been in therapy at the same time so that's probably helping too. :) But it's the first med that I actually think there's a difference, vs the many others I've tried that I've just felt the same on and ended up stopping/switching.",goodquestiion,11s18nz

100,"I’m still on lamictal. I had one incident where I was off my meds for about a week and the difference I felt in myself was DRASTIC. I think about that whenever I start to doubt how helpful it’s been for me. 
Overall I just feel a lot lighter; not as weighed down by anxiety and exhausted from mood swings. Instead of spending so much mental energy dreading daily tasks I’ve found it a lot easier to practice self discipline and just get it done. I still spend a good amount of time in bed (because I really like to lay in bed lol), but I don’t feel it inhibits me from doing things that I need or want to do like it did in the past. 
In general I find myself easily inspired/motivated to do new things and things I enjoy. Some days I dread getting up and going to work etc. but I think that’s normal and typically solved with a hot shower, sunlight, and a little caffeine :)",spiralingspeechie,11s18nz

102,"I'm not a medical professional but I think the sedating effect of Lamictal might contributes to that, or a placebo effect but I doubt that. In my opinion I don't think that lamictal is not affective at all because a lot of doctors still prescribe it and I've heard a lot a good thing about it. I just think that there's better options for the symptoms of bpd. If i'm not wrong, Lamictal label is use for epilepsy and used off counter for bpd and bipolar disorder :)",Ptitdino,11s18nz

But I hope lamictal and weekly DBT (haven’t started DBT yet but I will) does the trick.

I’m glad to see it’s working for you! There’s some hope at least lol",purplecatuniverse,11s18nz
112,Yes it's not recommended for anxiety I think. Wellbutrin makes me agitated so I can't imagine how intense it could be for someone really anxious :( !,Ptitdino,11s18nz

114,"the sedating effect would definitely make sense to explain that if it is just a placebo! yeah i’m sure there probably are better options for everyone, i’ve only tried lamictal because i don’t have to get blood work done for it. but yeah, it is for epilepsy, which is funny because my boyfriend’s dad takes it for his epilepsy",beeblemonade,11s18nz

7,"I understand your point, in my case I had a lot of shit diagnosed before of BDP, bc tbh my psychiatrist sucks doing a proper diagnosis, maybe in a part is my fault bc of my borderline trying to make everything look ""nice"" by lying, Ik lying isn't right but everyone looked at me like a monster and said it was internet's fault... So I forced myself to look pretty healthy in my first stupid session, but in the second one she said I'm completely fine, so I'm supposed to be fine after getting out of the hospital bc of a failed s*****e attempt? Idk bro, I ended up taking it kinda personal bc Ik it's her job but idk, she just asked me to talk a lot my messed up life... So yeah, after 5 distressing sessions I ended up having a breakdown, or how I call it, exploding with her, I tried to not insult her fr, and she said it was depression, then got the anxiety diagnosis, then got more shit, PTSD, DID and well, at this point I just realized why I felt emptiness always, like why I have problems with my self perception, and live a lot of symptoms, also a lot of times I lie to avoid distressing fights and I can easily feel shit and suddenly feel relief, also there are days I say I love my mom and days I say I hate her, so after talking about this with my Psychiatrist, we ended up in the probability of BDP, I just have all the stupid symptoms... Also do the consume of illegal substances, so yeah, I'm just messed up and afraid of screwing up everything, Ik those meds won't cure my stupid shit, will only help me to sleep, see less scary shit and calm my impulsiveness with suicidal thoughts, but sadly even this helps me to avoid grabbing a knife and end up fuck up again on a psychotic episode to end up sleeping, I'm conscious this doesn't help my stupid Borderline, the most sad thing is that after a lot of shit, I ended up discovering it and my psychiatrist just said ""Well, this makes sense""... I'm sorry for my stupid vent, Ik the BDP doesn't justify it, I just hope we can eventually get better.",Random_Sanrio_Lover,18bmj9x

&#x200B;

My daughter committed suicide last week and I recommend that you go to a doctor for help and a therapist as well.   Suicide IS NEVER THE ANSWER.   We all feel sad at times but things will get better.  I am heartbroken and can't describe what I feel.  Please don't hurt yourself and please call the suicidal hotline 800-273-8255 immediately.  
It is so important to tell someone you love and try to be around people that love you.  Do not be alone because that is exactly what happened with my daughter.    
You can write to me and I will help you.   
PLEASE DON'T DO IT.  Pray a lot and God will help you.  You have all your life ahead of you and you can be happy.  
Do not put your family through this.   
You are a good person and you need to be strong and get help.  I recommend for you to see a doctor and have them do blood work to ensure check your hormone levels or chemical imbalances that can easily be corrected.  You have to reach out immediately  because depression might get stronger with time.  You need to act now.",gracieanderson1,t4775m

83,"Hey! I woke up and I saw your comment and I got instantly awaken (thanks btw. it’s super hard for me to actually mentally wake up and I genuinely thank you for that). I’m very bad at consoling others but I want to try for you. I want to tell you that I was at the exact same place not long ago so even though it’s kinda not convincing for me to intervene, I want to tell you what were some (unhealthy) emotional responses I used to get through it. I felt like this exact way too: I kept doubting myself back and forth on whether I’m just faking all these extreme emotional reactions for attention, whether I’m actually suicidal enough to be considered suicidal or I’m just an “attention seeking whore” like how some of my classmates called me in real life. This constant urge to actually do it, to swallow the pills, to just send it and prove it to everyone and myself that I’m not lying, that I’m a good, honest, suicidal person who actually struggled so much in this miserable world, whose intensity of pain is justified and proven, and that I’m not faking any of this. If you are thinking in this way and reading this comment at this time, I want you to actually cry out and stop holding it all in. I see you, I see your pain. It’s the most real thing in this world that it actually hurts me like a knife too when I read your comment. But please remember all these feelings and thoughts are part of this evil little self-sabotage routing that BPD kidnaps our poor brain to do, which means this feelings will pass like waves after a certain amount of time. If you’ve been struggle for some hours already, I believe that this battle of yours will end soon, and you will come out of it like a warrior. Whatever you felt right now under it is real, and you are totally justified to feel that way, but now I’d like to think of them as the weapon that BPD uses to it’s innocent victims like us. If only I could travel in forms of signals and waves, I’d rush to you and hold you in my arms and let you cry as much as you can as outlets of your pain. I personally find that helps as a way to dissipate hurtful thinking. You can also try to mindlessly read benign Reddit stuff (by benign I mean some subs are def out of limits, don’t go there) to distract yourself a little bit. I personally have ADHD so distraction and short term stimulation using other content helps. And also please remember, you don’t have to prove anything to anyone, including yourself. Stay with us and I beg you to not let this disorder get what it wants. Sending a lot of hugs along the way. And trust me, this will get at least temporarily better like it did for me.

0,"\>But then she told me to stop it and prescribed me Temesta 1mg for anxiety an Stilnox for sleeping

These are also called Ativan/Lorazepam and Ambien. Quetiapin is also called Seroquel.

How long did you take Quetiapin?

The problem with both Temesta and Stilnox is they can be habit-forming or addictive. ""Benzos"" or benzodiazepine like Temesta usually are for panic attack or manic agitation, short episodes; it's not a good solution for general anxiety, and because of the addiction risk, some psychiatrists don't prescribe benzos for BPD at all.

Quetiapin often makes people very sleepy, so it's taken at night for that reason. You were on 25mg daily, which I think may be too low dose. It can have other side effects, like most anti-psychotics, so if it doesn't help after \~6 weeks, it could make sense to stop it - *but* that dose really is probably too low. 50-150mg daily is all considered low dose. There is [research using Quetiapin for anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4716733/), with good results, but a minimum dose of 50mg daily, or more. So, if you have been OK taking that, there's reasons to try a higher dose, and it seems like a better long term solution than ativan and ambien.

Of course a lot of what you feel, overthinking, emptiness probably will change by learning new skills or strategies - keeping yourself busy and finding ways to take control of anxious ideas.",TranZeitgeist,1aquuhy

I actually did microdosing with psilocybin for approximately 3 months in 2023 and my symptoms improved. Not saying that’s for everyone.

3,"I don’t, 2/3 psychiatrists I have had since my diagnosis said they don’t believe meds help with personality disorders. And so far I am sad to say they might be right, at least in my case. My current psychiatrist explained it to me as, my brain isn’t dealing with a chemical imbalance, more like faulty wiring. Meds likely won’t rewire my brain. Even symptoms that might seem like depression aren’t depression in a chemical sense, more like my brain has been semi permanently wired to constantly be in a depressive state. 

Meds do nothing for me but the side effects hit me hard. So I guess I don’t have any chemical imbalance after all.",yikkoe,1bwo812

What helped was learn to reconize when i start to get bad, what usually triggers it and how to deal with it, i found that wheno don't feel ok it was better for me to isolate myself for a bit and do stuff that makes me feel productive (working, cooking...)

5,"Everyone will be different but seems like there are a lot of success stories here for some people with BPD being medication free. 

I take setraline daily as I also have depression and anxiety (was diagnosed with those long before borderline) and have just continued to take it after my bpd diagnosis as when I have attempted to come of it I have always ended up in a crisis state. I personally am happy to take the setraline long term alongside therapy with no plans to stop it again as whilst it doesn’t really help with a lot of the bpd symptoms, it definitely makes my life that bit easier in terms of the depression and anxiety.

I struggle to cope either way to be honest, my mind is definitely not my best asset that’s for sure, but I keep muddling through somehow and I’m not able to at all when not taking anything.

I feel like this is an extremely negative post, so for that I am sorry. I want to lift people as much as possible, this is just my experience with not taking meds. Again, everyone is different and I just think if you are on meds and it is going well and you know it makes you feel better, don’t push yourself to get off them. Allow yourself that respite. But if you feel you are stronger, talk with your doctor about coming off them slowly away, see how it goes. You can always go back on them if it doesn’t work out.

I think you continue dosing until you see a decrease in your distressing symptoms. I always did it alone and important to feel safe in your environment. I’d paint, or listen to music. Sometimes I’d just cry for hours and it was so cleansing. I never thought crying would feel so good. I’ve known some people who tried Ayahuasca and said it was absolutely life changing. It’s hard to believe hallucinogenics are changing the world of psychology. Very healing properties. Check out John’s Hopkins who have been studying microdosing since early 2000’s.

24,"Weeeeell since you asked... 

1. I read a bit of Bible every night. Here's a summary of some of the research on why it's good for you.
 https://www.susanldavis.com/how-does-reading-the-bible-affect-your-brain/

2. I pray often. Sometimes I ask for help, sometimes I confess something wrong I've done, sometimes I just treat it like an open dialogue. Here's some more research.

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/06/17/health/benefits-of-prayer-wellness

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9713100/

3. When I get an impulse, I say, ""ok. If it's actually important now, then it will still be important in an hour / tomorrow after I've had time to sit with this feeling."" If it comes back, I'll consider it again... it usually doesn't come back, or if it does, the appeal has worn off. 

4. I don't make excuses. This is actually pretty hard. Accountability is *everything* and saying things like, ""well I only did that because x"" or ""I wouldn't have done that if only y"" doesn't fly. The choice was mine, the action was mine, the consequences are mine. If I don't like the consequences, then I'd do better to avoid the action that would lead to them. This is how we learn. ""Don't touch a hot stove.""

5. I carve out a little time every day and every week (even if it's just 20 minutes or an hour) to decompress and not think about *anything* that causes me even a little bit of stress. Also note that if it's a problem worth stressing over, then it's a problem worth dealing with. If dealing with it seems like too much, circle back to point #4.

6. Spend time with peaceful people. I make sure I do this at least once a month by socializing with someone close to me who is not a source of drama. DO NOT spend it talking about your feelings or your problems. That would not be peaceful. The point is to get *out* of your feelings and enjoy a bit of peace to gain some perspective on what can, in the moment, seem like a huge stressor or problem. Maybe it actually isn't, and you just need to spend some time in a different headspace.

There's so much more, but I don't know how I'd fit it all into a single post. I would say the last 2-3 years have been my biggest for personal growth, and I don't believe it's any coincidence that it started with... going to church with my boyfriend (who is now my husband).",Deciduous_Shell,1bwo812

I had been where she was, with a previous relationship. The way you wrote about how you are feeling is the same as my ex used to express himself - you don't sound vindictive, not even traumatised, but rightly stressed, tired and frustrated. Honestly, please do split. That is the healthiest thing to do, for you definitely, and perhaps even for her (though she won't be able to see it at first or for a long time).

I will say this: back then, no matter what my ex said and no matter how self-aware I was that I had BPD, I still couldn't treat him with respect and decency. Primarily because I was not in therapy, and the dynamics were so enabling for me for so long that I felt entitled to act how I had always acted. I now am so glad things ended with my ex.

You say in a lot of comments that your wife isn’t therapy averse, she just won’t stick with it. It seems like you want to give her some credit on this point, but I don’t think she deserves it. I could be reaching here, but to me this sounds she’s using starting therapy as a tool to manipulate you into staying in the relationship. It sounds like she puts on a show about changing to get you to stay longer, and then finds a reason to quit because she doesn’t actually want to change or doesn’t actually think she *needs* to change. It’s not your responsibility to help her get to that place. She also doesn’t deserve credit for getting “less violent”. Abuse is abuse no matter how bad it is now versus how bad it was in the past.

19,"The biggest realization you're probably going to have after you have left and gotten peace from all this, is how silly you were to stay for as long as you did.

Here's how people work. They can say anything, and do the opposite. You can be convinced of almost anything, and it can be a total fabrication. There are people out there to whom words mean nothing at all, and then there are people out there to whom words are still a way of communicating reality. 

The only way to tell people who use words as tools to decipher reality will behave as their words describe. The people who do not use words to describe reality behave erratically and are mostly impossible to predict by the use of their words.

You are at a point where your understanding has come to terms with this other person lot being interested in reality. It hurts. You were wrong. Don't fight it. 

You made a big mistake. The only way to correct the mistake is in the now. You cannot correct your mistake in the past. Imagine it this way. Se lured you towards the opposite direction you wanted to go to. You listened to her and you were conned. You also thought you were going the right way. That part is your responsibility. Now, you can take this reality, and the only way to stop being even more wrong is to stop immediately, and begin the possibly long trek back towards where you wanted to be. There are no shortcuts. You walked yourself in, so you will walk yourself out, no matter what. Going the wrong way even further will not create anything good. You're still going to have to walk back all the way. You best start the process now, because later is later. You'll be older and you'll have even further to go if you go the wrong way again tomorrow and the day after and so on. 

Start your journey today. First, stop the situation by stating out loud, that this is it. Then make sure that there is no more backtracking and no more going the wrong way. Tell them that it's over now. Then see if they are willing to cooperate. Give them one chance, and one chance only. Cooperate with me today, or then you will do it all by yourself. 

Create your plan. Where are you going to go? What will you take with you? Then leave to a hotel or motel, any place you can stay in peace. You don't owe them anything anymore, so they don't need to know where you're going, and their safety is now in their own hands, because they refused to receive the good you were giving them. You need to focus on you, because no one else has. After you sort yourself out to a solid position, you will know what to do with other people and how to actually help them without losing yourself.

Let it all go. You did fine. You tried. Pick up your things and walk away. You lost. We all do. Go win some more in other things, starting from learning to give yourself the good things you give to others. You'll do good.

I knew my husband deserved better. 

I was the one who sought out therapy. After I was diagnosed, I immediately looked for a place that does Intensive DBT where I live and got into a year long waitlist. I just really went into the whole process and learned as much as I could on my own. Now I don't meet the criteria anymore.

For a few years it was traumatic, but the violence seems to be mainly over now, and the emotional fallout on me afterwards if we break up I'm not concerned about, although I am concerned about the actual process,  I've no idea how bad it might get. 

I'm afraid I'm an appalling enabler (had an alcoholic parent), and 'entitled' is a word I would certainly use about my wife, she acts as if she is entitled to treat me with contempt, she is entitled to me solving all her problems, paying her bills, cooking all her meals etc. She acts as if these things are just part of the deal of being married, 'comped' by the hotel as it were, and are irrelevant if her emotions are involved. It seems to me that all she does is go with whatever feeling is at the top of the stack right now, rather like a small child, although she then is a champion grudge carrier about it, unlike a child. This gets her in trouble with other people too, not just me, she falls out with family, friends etc, when they respond in a way she deems to be incorrect, sometimes not speaking to them for years. 

An example I thought of today. A few weeks ago, I was reading a book, sat on the sofa, and my wife came in, and she just started kicking me. Not particularly aggressively, it didn't hurt, but it occurred to me later that that is our dynamic. She wants attention, so she feels completely entitled to kick me until I give her what she wants. And I'm so inured to this kind of thing, that it didn't even register with me as abnormal until I thought about it much later. 

I always half expect her to snap out of it one day. Like she did when she started taking pills. Suddenly, the dial was turned down. I half expect that one day she'll slap her forehead and say, 'my god, of COURSE it's my behaviour that's the problem'. I know how ridiculous this makes me sound, and that there probably is no hope.

That was honestly my first thought, I remember it quite distinctly, because I immediately thought 'Woah now, something's not right if that's what I'm thinking'. 

I can remember perhaps 3 times my wife has apologised to me. I recall after one particularly bad episode she did seem genuinely a bit contrite, but the vast majority of the time, she believed herself justified, and I think still does - not actually sure. 

But, she did have enough self-awareness to go to a psychiatrist, that was on her idea, not mine. I went with her, she was talking to the psych for hours (maybe 5), so I don't know what they were talking about, but he prescribed medication that is effective, and she told me that he said I should keep a diary of her behaviour, which I did, but really that just turned into an occasional dossier of her abuse.

And I don't just mean her problems with me.

The second reason is more charitable and I think is also true, that therapy requires commitment, of time, money, and emotional energy. My wife has concentration issues too, that like with her other mental problems, I really don't know how much is genuine and how much she uses as an excuse - to have me 'parent' her, or as a reason why she's allowed to ignore me but I'm not allowed to ignore her, and so on.",GreenUse1398,16fsh6o

A hard time for him too I'm sure, it is very difficult when the person you're supposed to trust more than anyone blames you for......well, everything. In mine and my wife's relationship sometimes this has become absurd, for example I recall an occasion where my wife was furious at me, and I asked her why, and she said because a girl had been raped in Pakistan the day before. I have never been near Pakistan and I am not Pakistani (nor have I ever raped anyone, just in the interests of clarity).

Once when she was in the grip of the rage, I even asked her - what is going through your mind right now? What on earth are you thinking? She said ""I feel like I'm being attacked, and I have to defend myself"". Which is odd. I wasn't 'attacking' her, and she often 'defends' herself against family, friends etc too, and ends up falling out with them, sometimes for years, over innocuous, or at least always unnecessary, things.

I will say that there is VERY LITTLE hope for a healthy relationship in the current state for you. Yes, one can't ever be 100% sure she won't suddenly have an epiphany in days/weeks/months/years. Who knows. But what matters is what are the chances?  If she doesn't put in effort to go to therapy, or get educated, learn how to regulate her emotions, apply skills, learn to empathize etc, what really are the chances? Very close to zero. EVEN if she gets an epiphany tomorrow, it takes a year or two for an average pwBPD to learn DBT skills or to notice significant improvement (for example). 

My ex was heartbroken for a long time after we split. Life/time is precious and you should prioritise having a healthy, happy life. Over time, he realised how peaceful his life became without me, and he was back to his old personality - goofy, laidback. You deserve a happy life.",nadnurul,16fsh6o

With that being said, she needs to come to terms with her BPD and get CBT or DBT immediately. Her behavior is NOT acceptable, and she's displaying a lot of classic BPD thinking.

61,"It's gonna depend on what the abuse is, and you have to take into account how you feel. You can't live your entire life for another person, and if they're preventing you from loving yourself you need to try and reconcile that, and if you can't you have to accept you can't save them.

Physical abuse (or out right malicious emotional abuse) is always a situation where you should move on.... Hope they get better but YOU ARE NOT their tool to do so.

If it's emotional, it's more tricky.. if they don't continue to progress in therapy don't throw away your life for a version of them you may never meet. But if they're actually progressing, and you truly love them, as long as it's not physical abuse when to throw in the towel is entirely up to you.",Skullyy,16fsh6o
62,"Here’s something I think matters a lot. It’s one thing to stay in a relationship with someone with these behaviors if they are working super hard on themselves, trying to get better and actually feel remorse for what they say and do AND if they care about how you feel... 

If you are with someone who is exhausting you, abusing you, never feeling remorse for how they make others feel and genuinely not caring about their partner, then in my opinion, it is not worth it. 

My boyfriend stayed with me through my most intense BPD episodes and being diagnosed and the reason he stayed and the reason I let him stay and we are still together in a much healthier relationship is because: 

• I am in therapy and we are working on ourselves together 

• if I have an episode or overreact it is not often but I damn sure apologize genuinely and let my partner know how much he matters, how grateful I am, and that I will never give up on therapy 

• I actually got better and he wasn’t being abused even when I was at my worst 

That being said, your relationship sounds doomed. It’s missing key components that make staying and working things out worth it. You absolutely shouldn’t have to ask for apologies for someone’s shitty behavior to you. The fact that there is abuse and a lack of remorse is a much bigger problem than the BPD itself. 🫡",MindingMyOwn2021,16fsh6o
63,"You make an excellent point, your wife is very reactive towards the truth. You're very aware of the problem, but it seems like you haven't fully processed what that means in this situation. The way she's acting says that avoiding the truth, that she is the problem, is a higher priority than being the spouse you deserve. You deserve much better than that. To even work on treating her mental health, she has to be ready to accept that she is the problem, and with the reactiveness you've described, the chances of her being ready to do that any time soon are practically zero. No therapist is going to be able to get her to the point of being ready. That's a place your wife has to get to on her own. It is up to your wife to handle the pressure that therapy gives her. The burden of her being unable to handle that pressure is not yours to bear.

Has your wife done anything about her concentration issues? Or these other mental issues? If they're a barrier to her having a productive and meaningful experience in therapy, then of course, she has to address these issues first, which opens more cans of worms. If you asked her to work on these issues, would BPD suddenly prevent her from addressing those issues? It sounds like there's always going to be an excuse for why she isn't working on herself. Not knowing what is genuine and what is an excuse is a massive red flag. That is gaslighting behavior. There is a massive power imbalance in your relationship. Her emotions, well-being, and safety matter and yours do not. By never changing, she maintains the power, even though she wears the mask of the victim. I say victim because of the excuses, it seems like she's spun a narrative where the entire world is against her. And while I know from personal experience that living with BPD is never easy, *her behavior* is victimizing *you.*

I just want to add that this is not how relationships where one or more person has BPD is supposed to look. I have ADD, BPD, anxiety, and PTSD. My girlfriend has BPD, C-PTSD, and ADHD. We work things out calmly and respectfully, and have never so much as raised our voices at each other. I have had multiple abusive people in my life who have had BPD (or who I am fairly certain have BPD), bipolar, depression, and other mental issues. I've been chin-deep in denial, making excuses for verbal abuse and psychological manipulation. The only thing that snapped me out of the spell my last Favorite Person had me under was him physically assaulting me. Things have been bad for me, but what's happening for you is so beyond the pale. From my perspective, this is an 11/10.

You sound like you've been mentally beaten down by a decade of abuse. I can't imagine how exhausting that must be. You deserve to have your emotions, well-being, and safety valued, and to have a spouse that treats you with the respect you deserve. Do you have any friends or relatives you can visit for a few days and clear your head? Even ""visit"" someone and stay in a hotel for a few nights? It may be easier to deal with this when you're not in the fog.

64,"So, I understand where you're coming from here, but, at risk of sounding like a bitch, I want to caution you here. My mother is a person with undiagnosed BPD. She made my life a living hell when I was growing up with her. I can completely empathize with you because I have made the exact same excuses for my mother that you are making for your wife. 

When I came out as lesbian, she was fine at first, as she was during the initial family therapy sessions where she was told that things must be so hard for the two of us, etc. Once the therapist shifted to looking at my trauma, my mother bailed, because the therapist would have started to call my mom out on being an abusive narcissist, her BPD notwithstanding. There are other details that aren't relevant at this time. 

On to your second point, therapy is a commitment that requires work. Trust me, I know this. While withholding some details, I ended up being diagnosed with BPD myself. Therapy is one of those things that you either care enough to engage in properly (that is, allow it to better you while putting the work in) or you make excuses to get out of it. I've made those excuses. After seven years of being in the sex trade, I've learned a thing or two about people making excuses. As coarse as this sounds, trust me when I say that your wife's statement that her concentration issues are why she cannot continue with therapy are no more than mere excuses.

70,"Thank you so much for replying to me, I’ve been just ruminating so much, basically: 

In the four years we’ve been together, It’s been mostly when having a crisis or feeling upset, it’s always been emotional and sometimes indirect physical (usually throws stuff around but not at me or hurts herself), the latter had been reducing tremendously. I was proud (although you said the same thing as my therapist: wish they get better, not your job to do that) 

Things were improving and she’s been consistent with therapy and pills for a year. 

This last Sunday, she had a massive crisis though, it was awful and she did something she’d never done before: spilled a can of a fizzy drink on top of me (it was more the humiliation than it hurting but I was shocked. She frantically tried to apologize after but the damage was done and I didn’t want to talk) 

She decided to leave the apartment to give me space, which I wasn’t expecting, but my therapist urged me to call an organization for victims of DV so I am currently at a safe spot until Friday because all local shelters are full. 

We’re tied together because of immigration and a good lease that is impossible to find in the market. I can’t afford changes to these two things (but my therapist says that the government can help but I don’t trust the system)

So while the social workers are telling me to leave for good, I am hesitant. I will leave for a month to stay with a friend in a different city, very far away though. 

I am planning to talk at a park tomorrow to tell her that I bought a one-way ticket and won’t return until deemed safe. I’ll be away for my birthday and our anniversary, maybe even another event we had planned, I know that will crush her but I had never left this long. 

I am trying SO hard to respect myself, and this time I have friends there for me unlike before when I isolated myself. I even told my dad and he paid for the getaway ticket but said that people can change if they actually work on it (he used to be just like her - *daddy issues* - very loving then destroying all my self-esteem, so I went NC with him for a year or so and she convinced me to give him another chance, the past two years he has been an incredible dad, he is a huge support) 

Anyways, sorry for dumping all this on you in the middle of the night. No need to read it all if you don’t feel like it, I just think you sound a lot like my therapist and it got me thinking.",holly-golightlyy,16fsh6o
71,"Your comment gave me some hope. I am in a similar situation with my partner and I honestly don’t what to do. 

She *is* trying to get better and the abuse has reduced a lot but then again, twice a month, there’ll be a huge crisis with abuse and then yelling sprinkled here and there. 

What you said about him staying / you letting him stay gave me a new perspective. Like I can tell my partner I can try to stay but they have to let me stay and that means that even more change has to happen or just admit I shouldn’t stay at all (maybe that doesn’t make sense at all, I don’t know)",holly-golightlyy,16fsh6o
72,"Thank you very much, and yes, that is an excellent point that does exercise me a lot, is how much of her problems are genuine mental illness, and how much is her taking advantage of me? How much should I feel sorry for her because she's ill and how much should I feel sorry for me because she's grifting and I'm the chump?

In other words, I am never (and have never been) sure what I should do for the best in these types of situations. Am I helping, or enabling? Should I yell back, or should I offer sympathy? I don't know.

An example I use to my wife, is the following: she had a therapist who once briefly tried to coach me on how to deal with my wife when she was in this kind of mood. The therapist said to me, 'You know, it's fine for you to just say nothing', and I thought, easy for you to say. A year or so later, my wife is watching a youtube video, and she is getting herself all irate. There's no background argument going on, we haven't fallen out, this is just a normal day, I'm just in the room with her, working, minding my own business. So my wife is ranting and raving about (person x) in this video, and I'm deliberately saying nothing, like the therapist said, because I don't want to get into a fight. Well, after this goes on for a couple of minutes, my wife stands and up and yells, ""I HATE YOU"" at me, and storms out.

I use this as an example to her, because what should I have done in that situation? Surely it's not down to me to 'deal' with her, I'm perfectly entitled to say nothing in my own house, she's an adult, she should be able to watch youtube without screaming at somebody that she hates them, apropos of nothing.

And incidentally, after that incident I spent about 3 hours just 'negotiating' to get her to acknowledge that maybe she was partly to blame (nope, I was at fault, should have been receptive to her upset, or something). But that's not really the point I'm getting at, the point I'm getting at, is that even if there was a 'right' answer, I have become resentful that I live with somebody who I'm supposed to 'manage', when surely, to my mind, it should be down to her to just behave like an adult. Always eggshells.

I married her because I wanted a wife, not a petulant child who wouldn't make it through Willy Wonka's chocolate factory alive, ya know?

She was prescribed amphetamines for her concentration issues, but there I did put my foot down and banned her from taking them. So I can take the blame on that one, although she did mention this to her psychiatrist, she told me she said to the psychiatrist ""My husband told me I'm not allowed to take amphetamines"", and the psychiatrist nodded and said ""Good husband"".

For therapy, I think if I could get a regular session paid for, online (skype or something) and the therapist was expecting her, and she knew it, and it was all booked in over a year or something, she'd do it. If that makes sense. If my wife knew that she had a social contract with the therapist, she would do it. But if she's 'allowed' to flake, then she will.",GreenUse1398,16fsh6o
73,"Thank you, I hope you are better now, alcoholism is very tough.

My wife actually has improved a great deal with her violence since being prescribed pills, that's one of my problems, is that clearly at least part of her abusive behaviour is medical, it is a brain health issue, because if she takes pills, she's much better. If she doesn't take them, she's a literal nightmare.

At her worst her violence did escalate into using 'weapons' and she did do me a few fairly nasty injuries - not hospitalisation necessary injuries (I didn't go to hospital, anyway), but welts, swellings, cuts, bruises and that kind of thing. She did used to throw things too, she once left a huge dent in the wall because she threw an ipad at me (wrecked the ipad too, but it was her's) - which really pissed me off when we moved out of that apartment, because she said that we'd have to tell the landlord that ""we"" put a dent in the wall. And I said, wtf ""we"", I didn't throw no ipad at the wall, that was you.

At the same time, this addiction probably saved my life. I had previously fallen into a pill addiction which could have gone a lot farther… but I found weed instead. Weed kind of saved me from the harder stuff. 

All psychiatrists agree that I should stop. However, they understand that weed can be a coping tool for me.. sometimes it’s between self harming/exploding or going to smoke weed.. Weed is the safer choice. 

I am in an addiction program to stop smoking eventually. But because it’s a coping mechanism, I can’t truly stop until I find other coping mechanisms. 

At least I understand the situation and accept it. And you know what? I’m doing well with the smoking!.. I’ve actually cut back a lot because I’ve been doing a lot of work trying to find other coping strats. Proud of me lol.

5,"Weed helped me until it didn’t. 

I think it can definitely be helpful for some people, but you have to be very honest with yourself about how and why you are using it. 

It made it easier for me to dissociate from things, which at first felt like I was managing my symptoms better, but ended up causing me a lot of memory issues and I ended up using it as a crutch to avoid facing my symptoms head on. It also made it much easier for people to take advantage of me because I didn’t care as much about it. 

After a while it just made me anxious, it destroyed what memory I had left, and caused all kinds of issues. I ended up in the ER a few times because it caused my bp to shoot past 200/120 and I’d end up with stroke-like symptoms. 

I feel much better without it now. 

I see it the same way I see any medication: 

There is no medication that is one-size-fits all. Any medication has the potential to cause bad reactions or side effects. It is changing the way your body is functioning, that doesn’t come without risks. If a medication’s side effects outweigh the benefits, then it needs to be adjusted or changed completely. And just because one person reacts well or poorly to it, doesn’t mean that you will react the same way.

If you know you have issues with addiction, I would recommend staying away from it. It may not cause physical withdrawals, but it can be very difficult to stop once you’ve started and it’s very hard to use “under supervision”. Most medical professionals will tell you not to do it at all, and those that give you the okay don’t really have the info needed to ensure you are using it safely and effectively. 

For example:

I take Ativan for panic attacks. It is a controlled substance because it has a high likelihood for abuse. It works exceptionally well for me, it’s like someone just turned the worry off in my brain. Everything feels peaceful and I’m completely at ease. It terrified me the first time, because I realized that it would be incredibly tempting to just take it every day because it felt so much better than the constant anxiety I was dealing with every day at the time. Because I was able to recognize that was not a good thing, I was able to set limits for myself. I will only take it while on flights, undergoing medical procedures, or if a panic attack has lasted more than a day. I have a doctor prescribing it for me who is on the lookout for any signs of abuse. I can only get so much at a time, and if I run out it would be very difficult for me to get more. Because I’m very careful about it, I usually only end up needing a refill once my last one has expired. I put a lot of focus on coping with my panic attacks head-on, and with that practice it’s gotten worlds easier. 

Meanwhile, the weed did a similar thing. I didn’t feel bothered by my strong emotions or distress while high. But since I was always told that it isn’t addictive and is harmless, I didn’t see any reason to keep from doing it all of the time. My docs weren’t concerned and didn’t have much to do with it at all, and if I ran out it was really easy to get more. As my tolerance increased, I needed more and more to get anything out of it. I started smoking maybe half a bowl a day, which turned into a bowl every few hours, which turned into a gram a day, which turned into concentrates. And if I went a day without, my BPD symptoms were worse because I didn’t have the practice facing them head-on anymore. I completely relied on weed to cope. 


All this to say: just be careful. I don’t think weed is some evil thing that’s just going to cause the ruin of people who do it, but it’s also not a miracle cure-all with no risks. If you’re going to do it, pay close attention to how and why and what it’s actually doing for you. And make sure you can stop if it starts to do more harm than good.",sky-amethyst23,1brexfe

It is a beautiful experience when it’s not uncontrolled, and even how it is for me now it has helped me tremendously. I started to ease the pain, but weed makes me see it and feel it deeply.

but i started smoking weed everyday since like august/september last year - it has given me a real change in perception (when im high or shortly after) about stuff like people’s view of the same issue or discussion 

im not saying it will change everything for the better, but it has helped me ease into the other person’s perspective of the situation we’re both in, or the argument and made me a little more relaxed to discuss stuff

i still get the usual perspective we have and symptoms or anger/panic attacks but it has helped a little on these topics

The only advice I could give would be to ask: 'what am I hiding from?'. Dissociation is an unhealthy coping mechanism. In my case, I was hiding from the guilt and the shame of what I had done to my FP, and avoiding responsibility of my actions. I completely shut down all emotions in order to avoid the uncomfortable feelings of reality.

However, what works for some may not work for others. Myself, I prefer to be medicated. It allows my brain to balance out the symptoms—that are not only characteristics of BPD, but symptoms that also overlap with other disorders. I did my due diligence of researching this particular medication when prescribed over a year ago. However, I still didn’t grasp the concept of how dangerous it was to go off of it (never planned to). So I do agree that there is more reading to be done and more to learn, but as someone with BPD we’re not choosing to be this way.

38,"Thank you. I don’t know, because after that happened, I was beyond upset, and on top of it, I dealt with a bad psychologist at that same place, too. So, I said screw it, and went off my meds, and quit going to that place. First, I weaned off the Abilify, gradually, like taking half for days and then half of that. Then, I slowly went lower on Lamictal, and I decided I didn’t want to go back on meds, because I never felt like they helped. Over the years, I had tried various antidepressants, an antipsychotic, and a mood stabilizer. The side effects on my health problems were a lot, and I felt like they didn’t really help my symptoms much at all.

In your case, I’d recommend taking maybe a fourth less for a couple days, then another fourth lower, and then again, until you run out. However, if you can figure out getting an emergency refill, like someone else suggested, and using a medication discount service to help pay, I’d do that instead if possible.",That-Dentist8239,15dvic8

0,"So, you wanted good sides, and unfortunately I'm not providing that... but:

I was on aripiprazole and venlaxafine. Took them for years and never felt like they did much for me. I gained a 30lbs, had sexual side effects (anorgasmia), and then I started getting terrible hot flashes and dizzy spells, and tremors in my hands which got so bad it was hard to write.

Told my doc about the side effects, which got dismissed as being due to other things, but I was skeptical. So (really, don't do this), I just quit without doctor's approval. All the side effects disappeared rapidly.

To reiterate about up-and-quitting, please don't cold-turkey venlaxafine. I learned that the hard way. That was the worst withdrawal I've ever had, and I've had opiate withdrawals. The aripiprazole withdrawal wasn't too bad, but if you're someone prone to psychosis, that could be much different.",Original-Document-62,137wj43

It can be difficult to sleep if you take it too late in the day..So I took it as soon as I woke up. 
It decreased my appetite too, which I also enjoyed since I tend to binge eat when I'm depressed. 

After that first time, my appetite was still suppressed but it always made me so anxious(and anxiety is one of the side effects). Helped with the sadness but was replaced by anxiety. 

I was prescribed anxiety meds to take with the Wellbutrin but the anxiety meds triggered my asthma.

So I stopped taking them both until I go back to see my psychiatrist to get prescribed different meds. 

So idk, it's obviously different for everyone. But these were the only side effects I had but these side effects were unpleasant enough for me not to want to continue taking them.",Fall3n__Ali3n,r2m7ut

0,"I was misdiagnosed bipolar 1. It took 7 years before I was diagnosed with BPD. The main thing to keep in mind are what symptoms you have, their intensity, and how long they last. 

Mania is a detachment from reality. I have bipolar friends, I’ve seen their manic episodes. One example is a coworker of mine who went into a manic episode, was hospitalized, and came back refusing to take their meds. They changed their name to Bear and began telling us about how they nearly died and became enlightened from it. They then proceeded to shop around and bought over $400 of nonsense items. For example, they bought a “2” birthday candle because it was their 6 month anniversary with their partner, and the “2” represented how they’re two people, one soul. They bought a birthday card despite it not being their partner’s birthday. None of the stuff was necessary, and they didn’t seem phased by the price. 

This, in my opinion, is different from hypomania and BPD euphoria. With BPD, I would get rejected by someone and then my ego would surge. I’d listen to upbeat music about how much of a bad bitch I am, I wouldn’t sleep well that night, I’d make plans to go out with other guys and I’d stalk my now ex’s social media. I’d pick fights with friends. But I would sleep well after that, I maintained an appetite, my mind wasn’t necessarily racing.. and it wouldn’t last more than a day or so. It was never random, instead always triggered by either something that happened in my life or a new medication I was on. The only times I experienced “hypomania” were drug induced, usually by cannabis or stimulants. That’s why I have a comorbid bipolar 2 diagnosis, but I’m currently not medicated. I haven’t had an episode since getting off stimulants and antidepressants/neuroleptics (knock on wood). 

Mania has to last at least 2 weeks. It’s either followed by depression or a return to baseline. In my experience with my friends, mania can last much longer. You’re more likely to have psychotic symptoms during mania as well. This includes hallucinations, extreme delusions (BPD can also have paranoid ideation, but there’s a difference between thinking people are out to get you vs. you having magical powers and being a reincarnation of a deity), etc. Mania is very serious. I’m not saying BPD isn’t serious, but the two look different. 

I’m honestly surprised you were diagnosed type I outside of a hospital. Most people get diagnosed after their first manic episode. Then again, I was diagnosed outpatient too, and solely off of family history. So it’s possible. 

If you think mania doesn’t fit your symptoms, I’d recommend getting a second opinion. I know it takes longer to be diagnosed/evaluated for a personality disorder, but I’d try to get evaluated too.

Also, Vraylar gave me a severe adverse reaction (that’s apparently rare?) called akathisia. It looked like mania, which led to me getting put on more meds, making it worse. It took me going into mild neurotoxicity from lithium and finding a bipolar specialist who believed me to figure out what was happening. 2 years later I am doing so much better. If you’re that concerned, definitely get a second opinion. These medications aren’t necessarily dangerous, but they are serious.",BamBamYangGang,1cunjmg

My suggestion to you would be to consider intermittent fasting. I know you said your appetite is high, but with intermittent fasting you don't change the food you eat necessarily, just the times during the day you are eating. It helped me a lot.

Diet and exercise are the only ways to mitigate the effects. However, if it's affecting you that much, keep advocating for yourself with your doctor. There are tons of meds out there, and if this one is having a negative effect on your mental health as a result, then obviously the medication isn't working to increase your OVERALL well-being.

It also probably depends on your dosage. On 50mg I personally needed something else alongside it, like an antidepressant, to keep me from becoming a complete and utter nervous wreck.

She has no respect for you, she doesn't love you or she wouldn't have even suggested it.  It's different if people go into a relationship knowing it's open but to ask to open it up after X years is a joke.

And this has nothing to do with BPD, this is a completely normal response to being shit on.

There's only one way to handle this, and that is to stop the self-harm and leave her. Tell her you're going to leave if she carries on with these demands, she can fuck around or she can have you. the choice is hers.

""She says she loves me so much she wants me to be happy even if it wasn’t with her "" that line says it all. That says, if you can't be happy with me screwing around, leave so you're happy elsewhere.

I also know what the other side of that pain is like, and while the journey is a difficult one, getting out of it is the right, healthy, and good thing to do. When you're upstairs in a burning house it's tempting to stay and let the flames engulf you, because it's your house, and the only place you feel safe; you also know that running out is going to leave you with burns and you'll be in ruin, but it's the only chance you have of not dying in the flames.

Your partner is already checked out, and is manipulating you to make it easier for them to leave and/or cheat. It's called ""poly under duress"", and it's abuse. You deserve so much better, and I know you probably won't believe me when I say that, so take it from someone who was in very similar shoes to you, the pain of leaving is not nearly as bad as the pain of staying will be.

No healthy relationship will cause you to consider the big S or abuse drugs. You know in your heart and soul that that's true, but you might feel like you don't deserve any better. If it's at all within your power seek therapy, and I wish you the absolute best.",brainbox08,1aujwis

20,"OP I have BPD too, feeling your feelings strongly is something that can sometimes overwhelm your ability to perceive things realistically, and I think that’s happening to you. 

Firstly, I HIGHLY recommend adding a mood stabilizer to your meds. (Disclaimer: not a med professional, speaking from personal experience). They don’t get rid of your moods, they just slow down how quickly they set on, so you have more time to ground yourself during mood swings and depressive episodes before they get really bad. 

 Second, in my line of work I talk to A LOT of people about their relationships and marriages, and it always feels impossible to imagine your life without someone until you actually experience it. If you and your wife split, you will not actually die from the sorrow, I promise. I’ve seen so many people who claimed they were losing their soul mate come back a few months later saying “wow, I can’t believe I settled for that kind of treatment.” 

Third, you deserve to feel secure and happy in your relationship, so does she, that doesn’t seem achievable together. Sometimes that’s it. Why fight an uphill battle for the rest of your life?

23,"I've read this post edit, to be clear. What you're going through is absolutely heartbreaking, and the fact that you have to choose which type of pain is the one you wanna take is just hellish. I'm so sorry you are going through this. 

And I agree with the masses. Leave her. None of this is your fault, you need to understand that. Regardless of her intentions and how she feels for you, you married her as a monogamous couple, you discussed your boundaries, and she has absolutely no right to blame *you* for hurting *her*, because that's not what's happening at all.

No matter what she says, you are not clipping her wings, you're not holding her back, and under NO circumstances do you need to explain to your WIFE why she can't sleep with other people.

Even if she wasn't using this to abuse you, which she is, you are incompatible as a couple. And if she had this need for an open relationship, that was her responsibility to discuss that with you well before you got married.

I hate so much that she is framing this in a way that is putting you at fault. Know that this would gut ANYONE in your situation, and know that she is 10000% the one to blame. Tell you that you're clipping her wings, holding her back, forcing you to explain your pain when it is so fucking obviously why this is painful... Its insulting. Its manipulative, and it is emotional abuse. And you have done absolutely nothing wrong.

I know that leaving is akin to telling you to choose between downing your heart in acid and suffocating your heart in cement, and that's so so so unfair and cruel to you, but you deserve so much better than this. You deserve love, but also respect. The thing about soulmates is that they don't abuse each other. She's NOT your soulmate. She's a parasite.

Don't let a parasite thrive at the expense of your pain until it kills you. Rip it out and know that through that intense pain, you have a path to healing.

I don't feel as if he's 'clipping my wings', or is somehow not respecting what I want.. I feel like he doesn't want to share a person he loves with anyone else.

38,"Hey OP! I am sorry you are going through this, it's a difficult position to be in.

I am poly and I realised that when I was pretty young and in a monogamous relationship. What I did back then was explaining that to my partner honestly and I proposed we both took the time to think about it without opening the relationship yet. For months, we kept living our relationship normally but we would take an evening a week to discuss our wishes and fears and the pros and cons of an open relationship. 

In the end my partner had agreed to an open relationship but, when it came to it almost being a reality, it was clear that he was only doing it for me and to keep the relationship. I knew it would be extremely hard on him. We decided to break up. It was painful but it was calm and respectful and we both knew we had done our best to understand each other. If you are not compatible on that level and can not find an agreement, you should consider going your separate ways.

As a poly person, compulsory monogamy feels damning for me. I understand the desire for freedom and an open relationship, but the same is true the other way round. Feeling that polygamy is being imposed to you must feel soul wretching if that's not for you. And btw, threesomes have little to nothing to do with polyamory. They are more related to sexual needs  than to emotional needs. Your wife should be clear about what she wants exactly.

She is putting her selfish impulses above your relationship and manipulating you into believing that her wants are more valid than your needs, and that you “always” gave hints that you were open to an open relationship.

No, you were not. Even with a threesome (which is very different than an open relationship, as you two are experiencing something together), *you backed out because you didn’t want to be a part of it.*

Your wife wants to sleep with other people and she doesn’t care how it makes you feel or what your opinion is. And she doesn’t feel threatened by the idea of you taking on another partner because it is clear that you are desperately in love with her and allow her to manipulate you while she has all the power in the relationship.

You will need to leave her. It sounds like she has already found someone she wants to sleep with, or has *already begun sleeping with* and now she wants “permission.” You cannot be with someone who wants to sleep with other people and share that very intimate experience, and that is perfectly normal, sound and valid feelings to have. You are not being selfish or inflexible or somehow wrong for wanting your marriage to be a relationship between you and your spouse only.

You will never again be happy with her. Either you stay and she cheats on you and manipulates you into pretending it is “okay” with you because you are so afraid of losing her, or she cheats on you and you speak your feelings and she ignores them anyway and you end up self harming. She has made it clear that she values her own experiences and doesn’t value your emotions and that is no soulmate, and no relationship to be in.

It will hurt, but you will heal, and you will find someone who loves you openly and respects your feelings and makes you feel safe and stable.  This woman is not that, and she will never be that. She is using your deep feelings for her as a way to manipulate you into allowing her to sleep with others, knowing that you do not want to live that life.

This is a *her* problem. She wants to cheat and experience sex outside the marriage and is trying to make that default yours. You married someone as a one-on-one partnership, not as an open relationship or polyamorous one. Turning the tables on you now that she has control over your emotions is abuse.

Edit:

I read your other thread. Your wife is having an emotional affair with another person, who she is using as an emotional crutch to complain and speak badly about you, and her intense emotional reaction to you saying “no” to an open relationship is because she wants permission to cheat with that person. She is already emotionally cheating. She wants to physically cheat out in the open — if she hasn’t physically cheated already. The tantrum and the fighting and the “breaking her heart” is all because she is being told “no” to exploring the new relationship she has built with this other person while dangling you on a string as a safety fall-back. She has fundamentally and permanently changed how she feels about you. You are no longer her primary love, or focus. You will likely never be able to get that relationship back. She has betrayed you.

No amount of Reddit threads are going to change the fact that your wife is cheating and wants permission to continue to do so. You do not deserve that. Poly relationships are something a couple decides together, and open relationships are agreed upon on both sides. I have not yet, in my days, ever heard of or known a couple who have ended positively when one of them decides years into their relationship that they suddenly want an open marriage.  

You are headed for divorce whether you gather the dignity and independence to do it yourself, or whether you wait for her to cheat on you physically and do acute, significant damage to your mental health while you desperately try to deny reality.",yobrefas,1aujwis

What she’s asking of you is insane. What she’s saying to you is insane. There is nothing wrong with you for not wanting to open a relationship that wasn’t open in the first place. The fact it hurts you as much as it does should be enough reason for her to stop asking and forget about it. Unfortunately the situation isn’t simple enough. If she really can’t go without the relationship being open, and you don’t want an open relationship, it seems like the best thing to do would be to leave her.

51,"I have BPD and am extremely adamant before entering into a relationship that it needs to be open (for both sides) or I do feel panicked and restrained and guilty about even the inside of my own head, regardless of whether I act on it or not (which is a very rare thing for me, as I don't particularly like most people). Key word here: *before* entering into a relationship. 

If non-monogamy is *that* important to you, you need to be clear and articulate about what you want, and seek out a partner who prioritizes the same thing. I've tried to date more monogamous people, and we only end up jealous and resentful and hurting one another, because I'd never act on something that hurts my partner, but then I'm stifling the one thing I asked for from the start. Your wife sounds a bit too ready to hurt you when, in reality, the reason you don't like non-monogamy is *allowed* to be ""because it hurts me"" - however, that might mean you're not compatible with your wife in the long-term if it is important to her, and for that OP, I'm so so sorry. 

Just remember your soulmate wouldn't want to hurt you just because ""I don't have a good enough reason not to"".",borderlinebreakdown,1aujwis
52,"English is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes. I’ve read your post after the edit. I have BPD as well and if my partner would put me in this situation it would break my heart.

Threesom and open marriage is two completly different things. Wanting to do the first one doesn’t mean that you are ok with the second one. What stands out for me is that she really push you to give her a „proper” reason so later you can „work on it” so at the end you would be ok with the open marriage. For me it feels like from her point of view there is nothing for her to work on, you are the one that have to change so she can get what she wants. There is no real dialogue/discussion here, she made a decision and expect you to do what she (already) decided. That’s not fair at all. This is not how the relationship should look. 

She see that you’re in pain. I’m fully confident it’s impossible to not notice that you are in pain and for sure she can’t overlook it. Even tho she can see it she still push this topic, it’s an abuse and for me it would be a real torture. It’s like putting salt on an open wound. That’s an awful thing to do. You already gave her your reason which in my opinion is valid and should be enough for her so there is no need for her to push you over and over again.

She says she loves you. If her behavior would be a standard way of how the love looks in the world I would never in my life want to fall in love. 

Everybody say that the best would be to part yours ways and I will say the same. This is not how the healthy relationship should look like. You deserve better, better life and better relationship than that. Deserve to be loved in a way that you want and need. Seems like she can’t give it to you anymore. I’m fully aware that getting a divorce it’s an awful experience in general but for me it looks like you should go this road. It will be a rocky and hard road but why you shouldn’t be able to go through this? What I mean it’s like look - you have lived X years without her, you’ve managed to do that so why it shouldn’t be possible now? I’m sure you went through absolutely awful things in life and somehow you found a way to overcome all of the obstacles. It proves that you can do things and you’re strong (I think stronger you think). You are much older now - in comparison with the age when you two met. It means that you have more life experience now, during this years you’ve learned things so it means that you are smarter. You are more mature now as well. The other thing is that getting a divorce when you have BPD it’s a possible thing to do in general - as others with BPD managed to do it. You are not worst than others in any means. You are not weaker or less capable. It means that you will be able to go through this as well.

Please do not self harm - it is really not worth it. I know how it is to feel like your feelings will tear you apart within a second, like you have a ticking bomb inside you. How it is at the at bottom of the deepest of the holes. How you feel like you will lose your mind in a second. It’s torture. 
Please try to think what normally gives you peace and relax you and try to focus at least a little bit on doing that and try to do that. It know it will be hard to focus on something but it’s definitely worth a try. What works for me: pilates and painting (you don’t have to know how to paint to do it). You can try to meditate, go for a run or do other physical activity. Maybe swimming, walk, joga? Maybe some other crafts something like this coloring books for kids - but version for adults. There is plenty of free online pictures to print. Maybe a jigsaw? Cooking? Bath?

Please if you have very bad thoughts please reach out to someone you can talk with. If you don’t have such person please call the number for people with S thought. I’m not from US so unfortunately I can’t provide particular number but I’m sure someone from US should be able to help. You don’t have to go through it alone. 

It’s great you decided to meet with the psychiatrist, good meds can be really helpful. They can help with going though all of this.

I think it would be good to get help from the divorce lawyer as it can be hard to navigate all of the process in such high emotional state. I wish you all the best.",Justwanttohavefuun,1aujwis

Second thing: You clearly does not want it, so you already know the answer.

When you mentioned that she feels “suffocated” when she’s not having threesomes, is this something she spoke about before being in a relationship?

Also, have you talked about your BPD with her? I know it’s hard for partners without it to understand it. (i tried with my partner & it was a waste of time) but do you think she’s the type to understand…honestly it makes me angry reading about this i’m sooo sorry this is happening to you.

 you are allowed to change your mind, she’s not the only one in this relationship & you deserve to have someone who understands.

66,"Talking about potentially having a threesome is completely different than considering polyamory and for your wife not to realize that (or admit that) is also concerning, as that means she’s not going into this with research and understanding. 

She asked for consent to a sex act. You declined consent. Her pushing you to still do the act is unhealthy communication at best and more akin to emotional abuse or even sexual assault. It’s as simple as that.

I’ve heard a lot of divorced individuals say that asking for an open marriage is the gateway to divorce. 

I’m NOT referring to those engaged in consenting polyamory. But my limited understanding is that true polyamory is a relationship among all three + individuals; so you would be included and nothing would happen without everyone’s consent.

Instead, people use this as a cover for being a “cool, progressive thing to do” rather than admit that they are really asking to have an open affair.",Psypris,1aujwis

You deserve someone who loves you the way you want to be loved. This isn’t your fault and you are enough. This is HER problem. She’s selfish and it sounds like retroactively trying to justify an affair to me. I know that’s hard to accept but that’s usually the case when someone’s pushing this hard to open a relationship. 

I wish I had cut my ex off immediately instead of believing he’s someone he’s not. I really couldn’t get past the person “I thought he was”.

I’m so sorry for what you’re going through.",Excellent_Macaron496,1aujwis
71,"Hi. I wouldn't be so harsh as to say she does not respect you or that for sure she already found someone. I don't know that. I believe you both love each other deeply. But I also agree with what TheMediaBear says and what other say: apparently you are not soulmates and you both can't give each other something that you need very much. You can't give her open relationship, she can't give you stability that you find in monogamy. Both needs are valid and apparently are incompatible. It does seem that you two cannot communicate and reach compromise. Sometimes the differences between people who love each other and otherwise work seemingly very well with each other are just to big.

Having said that, I would not rely on people in the internet for advice on such an important topic as divorce. People are projecting their own experiences on you and of course we here do not have the full picture. I am projecting for sure, I've been in open relationships in various forms and it was too hard for me.

I would try with therapists again, both couple and individual (for both of you) to perhaps find the reasons for your needs and inflexibility about them. But that considers both of you, not only you.

I’ve got a few close friends who know about my bpd but they don’t see the raw side of it. I won’t let them see it. I’m afraid if I do, I’m just setting myself up for more judgement and the feeling of stupidity for exposing so much of myself. If that makes sense",WatchMe_Unravel,1aujwis

With only 3 in person friends I don't have much going on socially but they do know about my BPD. I've allowed myself to be vulnerable with pretty much anyone who is a friend or more. If they like it, good. If not, fuck em. I'm upfront about being an emotionally needy man and so far it's been a good thing. If I keep the bad side of BPD in check I think it allows me to feel deeper and care more than a neurotypical person would. Consequently, if the bad side of BPD is not kept in check it makes us way more emotional and worse than a neurotypical.

I'm not too sure, but I think she and I are cool. Just... Casually dating but exclusive to each other... Like in the ""let's know each other"" phase.

Before meds, my baseline mood was Major Depression for about decade, then anxiety got progressively worse with added panic attacks.  Plus I had all the added bpd problems.

Both Effexor and Paxil both worked ok for approx 2.5 yrs each- for the depression. Then they just stopped working. No other antidepressants did anything. Antipsychotics & mood stabilizers never made any noticeable difference in any way. Seroquel was prescribed just to knock me out if I had an episode that got too outta control.  

Benzos worked miracles for 9 yrs (mostly valium) but I got severely chemically dependent and had a massive problem in the end with withdrawal (so bad it took multiple years to recover). That's the only thing that helped me with some mood swings *and* all my anxiety. 

I still had numerous BPD episodes on meds but had 2 abusive boyfriends at that time who loved to trigger me.

50,"I'm not sure what it was about Effexor or Paxil that made those the 'good' ones for me. My psychiatrist said those 2 meds are similar in some way plus both are known to also supposedly help with anxiety. I had tried zoloft and Lexapro before those. I think Lexapro slightly worked for a few months. 

When they stopped working it was sudden. I felt fine one day, felt like crap the next. The effexor especially. I was a high dose for awhile, maybe 300mg. Suddenly, it felt like my body was being dragged down, like my legs were made out of lead & I was just dragging myself around. That went on for a few weeks until I switched to something else (I think I went from Effexor to Paxil), then I started feeling better again. 

After Paxil stopped working, I switched to Wellbutrin (made me feel speedy/frantic in a bad way, like too much caffeine), then Prozac (did nothing) then Cymbalta (did nothing). That's when I gave up on antidepressants altogether. 

I tried getting back on Paxil after a few years of no meds. The new psychiatrist took 8 *months* getting me up to 50mg, which was a stupid waste of time. In the past, it didn't start working until I got up to 75mg. Then he told me, 'No one takes 75mg, 50 is the max', implying that I was lying about my previous dose.

0,"Hello! First of all, I am really sorry that you are being so neglected by the health care system, it’s like they won’t do anything unless you are killing yourself or other people, I’ve been through something similar and I know that it can be really hard and scary… but weed is not the way, trust me, I learned the hard way too, but it can causes panic attacks, severe anxiety and dissociation, among with other things, so I don’t think that is a good thing to do, maybe you should give it a try. I deeply suggest writing about what you’re feeling (like you just did and it’s amazing), talking to someone you trust about your fears, maybe do some research and try to understand yourself! Don’t be so hard on you, all of the fear you are feeling is understandable and I also have a tip that I used when I used to self harm, maybe it will work for you: I hold two cubes of ice and I wait for them to melt, my therapist told me to do that and it really helped. Apart from all of that, at night when I could I would invite someone in (someone that i trust) and just to have someone sleeping next to me calmed me down a lot, but if you can’t, I also watched a lot of meditation and it was really helpful. About medication, they all have side effects at first and I like to believe they are a friend that helps me a lot, but along with it, it’s really important to take care of yourself, you body too (like drinking enough water, spending a little time in the sun, maybe reading a book). All of this is just from my experiences so it might not be the same at all for you, but I just really hope you get better soon and I will be cheering for you!

1,"I would really encourage you to stop self medicating with cannabis in the meantime as it's known to cause and or exacerbate psychotic symptoms in some people. I myself cannot tolerate it for this reason, and I don't have those types of symptoms in its absence. Coincidentally I've been diagnosed with the same mental health issues as you have, so that's one thing you can do...

 I also had psychotic symptoms when I stopped taking benzos as prescribed. This can actually be a symptom of stopping the drug too abruptly. Honestly I feel the combination of my mental health issues plus stopping the medicine all at once is what caused the psychosis for me personally. 

I know what you're feeling is very scary and can empathize with your situation. That said, there are a number of things going wrong that I believe to be aggravating your symptoms, and social isolation is one of them. 

I understand the isolation came about because of the symptoms, but now I think the isolation serves to make things worse for you. This is a common vicious cycle for people dealing with any type of illness. 

Drawing from my own personal experience and what you've written here those are the two lifestyle changes I recommend making to hopefully improve things for you while you wait for more intensive treatment. Give yourself a break from cannabis especially, and finding a safe outlet for socialization. 

You can pick a safe low impact social activity like visiting your local library. This gives you proximity to others without pressure, and all sorts of distracting subject matter to immerse yourself in. 

Finally, while evaluation and proper medication could be super valuable for you, I do worry a bit about it being sort of built up in your mind as your one saving grace, as sometimes hospitalization leaves people in a worse state emotionally. 

Definitely work with a general practitioner on medication management in the meantime and do seek emergency care if you need to about the self harming. I hope there's something useful in here for you...",Most-Shock-2947,17ll7mx

Unfortunately it's really hard to find a match as far as therapists (psychiatrists are easier as they are mostly just about the meds) and meds...it doesn't really matter if you see them in person or virtual or with what service. You have to keep trying until you find the right fit. It also took me years to find the right combo of meds and they are starting to be less effective and want to try a different combo but am worried as it's really trial and error and some have bad withdrawals even if on them briefly. I suggest trying new meds when you are not about to have any life changes like a new job or moving or new relationships. Be patient and don't give up and speak up right away and don't let yourself get pressured or pushed around, if you do find another psychiatrist. Patience is key.

I was in a really tough place with my mental health and felt relief signing up.  I also really loved my therapist.  After seeing what I was billed- It seems to be a cash grab.

2,"The question is are there any Comorbidity.   Having other things going on top of bpd is very common alot of times not even knowing it.    For just borderline there is nothing fda approved to treat it. No study has ever shown anything effective.   The only treatment for borderline in changing it longterm is dbt.    

Now that's not to say meds can't show some short term relief even if you just have borderline.   So they are always worth exploring and trying different ones.  But the other issue is most people with borderline are extremely sensitive to meds.   I have had so many side effects from various meds it is to many to list.     

As far as moodstabilizers I am a big supporter of trying lithium because how many studies show how effective it is in lowering suicidal ideation.   And suicidal ideation is very common in bpd.   Not to mention we have a really high suicide rate so if there is a med protect against that it is lithium.

I had to pretty much fight my psychiatrist for lamictal lol, but I’ve taken it for almost a year now and I know opinions and experiences differ but for me it’s a miracle drug as dumb as that may sound. The longer I’ve taken it I’ve barely recognised myself sometimes because I’ve never been this stable and felt like myself, like truly the me that was under all the bpd fog. Lamictal has been the one for me, but it’s different for everyone. I only had some anxiety while tapering up but no other side effects. I had wellbutrin added early this year and it’s been the cherry on top that lamcital couldnt reach, they work great together for me, and the seroquel i only take for sleep at a tiny dose at night.

I will say, lithium did help reduce suicidal thinking but that’s it. Did nothing for my mood. 

The only thing that really helped was a stimulant for my adhd, DBT, lifestyle changes (such as correcting nutritional deficiencies and diet), changes in my environment, and a lot of personal development which I also am doing in therapy.

Edit; worth noting that medication is not meant to help BPD. **may** help some of the symptoms. Which is why the first treatment of choice is therapy",,12os79s

I could hear him climbing through windows I was certain I'd closed, could see him watching me around doorframes, and in shadows, I could smell his aftershave etc. I had the police round so many times because of it, but he'd always leave before they arrived.. That was my worst bout of delusions. Less significant, I can see like mice or spiders scuttling away, or I could hear a child's scream, I hate that one coz its pretty much constantly when it does show, ive felt stones pelting me from the sky (whilst being indoors) or someone shouting my dead name.

49,Yeah never found seroquel addictive and it definitely knocks the intensity down a couple notches,,12os79s
50,"no lithium did not help with that. splitting is a psychological defense mechanism, not due to a chemical imbalance and that’s why medication does not treat BPD. 

holding ice/rubbing an ice cube on my neck and face is great for panic attacks, they teach it in DBT. As well as slow deep breathing. 

SSRI/SNRIs, BuSpar, hydroxyzine, clonidine, propranolol are meds that may help panic attacks",,12os79s
0,The symptoms of bpd are the same as ADHD and Autism. But the therapy is pretty much the same. I don't know either which of them is the case for me but you need to get good mechanisms to fight bad urges,Heroische-Fusmassage,1blhi47
1,"I agree with him, he is a good person.",IndividualScratch447,1blhi47
2,"I would say not to view BPD as it's traits and go, I have that and that. BPD is a life long experience and the traits that follow it along with the subtypes, vary person to person. It is easy to mislabel someone with BPD and could be detrimental. 

Other conditions with symptom overlap

C-PTSD
Bipolar disorder
Autism spectrum disorder 
Narcissistic personality disorder
ADHD
Schizoid

It is very similar in presentation to the Fearful Avoidant attachment style and looks like BPD when it's not. 

3 main key traits to identify BPD

1. Emotional instability/reactivity 
2. Fear of real/perceived abandonment
3. Suicidal harm/threats/ideations or self harming behavior (direct or indirect). 

You don't have to have all 3 but they all do loop into a familiar negative neural feedback loop. BPD is very complex, presents in different ways, also has possible comorbidities and many disorders share overlap. A saying I heard I believe by Dr. Ramani is that not all pwBPD have C-PTSD but pw C-PTSD are very likely to have BPD. Trauma and BPD traits are a small element. We have to examine behavior, reactions, and moments of a mental breakdown.",Warm-Reflection9833,1blhi47

4,Kind of a bummer if true since I felt like I finally have a guidance towards treatment but now I’m unlabeled with these issues again,gnarlygnk,1blhi47
5,I feel an uncomfortable tension. Happens sometimes and cause of different reasons. For example if I'm in a crowded bus. I want to flee but need to use the bus to get to the university so I breath and count to 10 or massage my own hands. It's like a 2-3 on a scale till 10. On a 5 it's getting really annoying and I need to isolate myself to breathe or I use fidget cube  or something cool like an ice cube to have a different stimulation. And 7 and beyond I need to exercise or eat something spicy or someone have to hug me tight. In urgend situations I bite myself in the arm but it's not ideal. The urge there is to punch something. And 9 and beyond I barely can't stand it and have to fight the urge to cut myself. I often have my husband around and people who I can call to distracte me.,Heroische-Fusmassage,1blhi47

7,"Yes so I was reliant on SH for a while after I met my ex who introduced me to it tbh. But honestly, I don’t get triggered unless I’m in a relationship and majority of my bad urges stems from a relationship. Otherwise, friends and family idrc and never usually affects me. In my situation, since it normally happens in a relationship, I do genuinely want to punch or SH but it’s not until I feel like I’m not being heard :/",gnarlygnk,1blhi47
0,"I’m not your teenagers doctor but BPD itself is not something that medication works on.  Comorbidities like depression, bipolar, anxiety, etc can be treated with medication but often people with borderline get really overmedicated because the drugs aren’t impacting the core issue, emotional dysregulation, so they wind up on a constellation of things to treat symptoms.  
Behavioral therapies, CBT and DBT, get at the core issues.  It might make sense to try to get your teen into a DBT program, though they are a lot of work and they might not be ready to put that work in.",PretendCamel3989,17pt3sb
1,I think you can start helping by not accusing her of “wanting to be depressed angry sad etc”. No one “wants” to feel that way.,Sagerwilliams,17pt3sb
2,"I would say, less talk and more do.  From you at least, being the parent.  

Take out the BPD part and you still have a moody teenager who may be depressed or anxious, has no idea who they really are, and def doesn't want to talk to their lame parents.  (Speaking as a lame parent myself, no offense)

Plus, you've got a teenager, whom, in their mind probably thinks a lot like an adult already in some ways.  It's a fine line to tow between the child and the adult because the truth is that when your kids turn 18 and leave the house, they don't have to talk to you any more.  So, it's really important to start to view them less as a child and more like an adult.

If there was someone you thought was really cool and wanted to make them your friend, how would you do it?  Maybe it takes them a while for them to open up with words, but that doesn't matter because you see the special light within them and you want to celebrate that.

Honor who they are.  Focus on the positive.  Make plans for the weekend.  Go out of town.  Do something weird they may be into.  Are they into dance music?  Take them to a club.  Favorite snacks also...esp after school kids get so hungry.  How about 4:00 dinner...mcdonalds or something...break the mold...make them smile <3",,17pt3sb
3,"I avoid my parents too when it comes to my mental health. It feels uncomfortable but also because we never were the kind of family to talk about it. Maybe your child feels that way too? I would give them some space but still show that you care. It’s not easy to accept help in the beginning. You have to find the line between being supportive, empathetic and being a parent and strict. It’s not easy, I can’t imagine since I’m not a parent myself, but first I would give them space and not overwhelm them. Don’t accuse them, don’t be mad, don’t be angry just try to be calm and understanding and show them you’re there for them, whenever they’re ready.",gingerbreadspice00,17pt3sb
4,Thank you. I will definitely try to create more positive memories by finding some activities we could do. She will turn 18 next month but I don't think she's gonna go anywhere just yet. I hope.,lunar-explorer,17pt3sb
5,"Thanks. We do actually talk a lot and we basically never fight. I try to be a good listener, but I don't know what and how much to say. Should I give advice? Should I only listen? When someone is in that condition, what might be the trigger that could offer some hope or motivation?",lunar-explorer,17pt3sb
6,"Im not sure about the advice thing? If I’m in an episode and feeling angry and all sorts of negative emotions I can’t think rational. My brain knows there is a rational part for example I know my boyfriend isn’t cheating on me because I know him but the borderline part tells me all sorts of scenarios how he’s cheating on me. I always call it rational and borderline me. What helps is just knowing it won’t last long and I will feel better after. Trying to stay calm and let the waves overcome me. But that’s nothing I would advice someone who hasn’t really been diagnosed. Everyone has to find their own way, and not being in therapy is very unproductive. 
Triggers could be anything, everyone has their own kind of triggers. If you’re serious about this, try and find out their triggers. Sometimes we don’t even know ourselves until it happens. It sucks but figuring it out is really helpful afterwards. It’s a confusing phase not being diagnosed not knowing anything. I knew it for 5 years before getting properly diagnosed, but in the beginning me and the people around me went trough hell. And so will you. I do appreciate it that you as a parent came on here and tries to understand and find help. If you haven’t done it already how about informing yourself about BPD like everything there is? There is a book it’s called: I hate you, don’t leave me. This might help you and your child. Maybe after you have read it, give it to them to read. It might help them to understand more and reading could be a way …
One more thing: Sometimes I don’t need advice or help or words. I need someone to hold me while I cry and tell me everything’s gonna be okay. I don’t know how to help you get your child into therapy. This has to come from themselves…. An idea would be to try and get them to at least two sessions ? I’m running out of ideas … i hope this was helpful because my texts are always messy and chaotic and full of thoughts.",gingerbreadspice00,17pt3sb

Initially I began taking this drug to help with my OCD but it did heavy lifting for both that and my BPD.

Everyone is different so medication advice can be challenging. Its worth trying to see if it sits well with you for sure. It also has appetite suppressing effects, which for me wasn’t good but for others, especially those who are eating more frequently due to antipsychotics, it can be helpful.

16,"YES it helped immensely.   It was one of the most noticeable effects.  Even now years later when something is pronounced enough to trigger anxiety it's very much in the background and it's like strongly muted.   The biggest thing I notice is how I'm able to go to work whereas in the past I would always feel anxiously sick the night before and even during a shift.  Now I just work and it doesnt even come up as an issue.  And that was a thing that haunted me for years and in multiple different jobs and job types.
Wellbutrin also didn't help my anxiety issues, I think because of the stimulating effect of the norepinephrine in it.

8,"So my experience with Zoloft is pretty unique, apparently it doesn’t happen to a lot of people but it happens with damn near EVERY SSRI I have ever taken (I actually had a gene test done to see which SSRI I can tolerate and none of them are worth the risk). I ended up with severe Serotonin Syndrome. It was a nightmare, I was told to expect side effects so I kept taking it. I was burning up with a fever, was delusional, was sweating like crazy, I was so tense that it hurt (I had to be sedated later on because my muscles were so tense) my blood pressure was through the roof and it felt like my heart was skipping beats (turns out it kind of was) worst headache I have ever had in my life (and I have headaches daily and have since I was 8) -  anyway, I called my doctor about a week into it and was like uh.... this is what’s going on. She told me to immediately stop taking it and what was I thinking continuing to take it when it was making me feel like that & to go to the hospital where I was diagnosed with Serotonin Syndrome after a barrage of tests to rule other possibilities out. They didn’t act fast enough and I ended up having a seizure. They finally got everything under control but I was in the hospital for quite a while so they could keep an eye on me. 

However, with that being said, my dad and my brother both take this medication with absolutely no side effects at all. No drowsiness. There was an adjustment period for about a week where they felt a little “off kilter”, but it was gone within a week. My dad takes 150mg for depression and my brother took 100mg.

0,Say you need a psych evaluation because you are experiencing symptoms that align with BPD. Double check that they test for that and then make an appointment:),Farewell-muggles,1bfdscw
1,"You just tell them that you're looking for an assessment for borderline. They may ask some very basic questions revolving around why, and you can explain that your emotional extremes are greatly effecting your life and relationships. You've read up on the diagnostic criteria and strongly beleive you meet them. They may ask for insurance information and other basic new patient info. 

And they'll see when they can schedule you. You can ask them things like what to expect, etc.

My only suggestion would be to look for offices that specifically list borderline treatment/personality disorder treatment. The psychs there are typically more up to speed on the disorder.",princefruit,1bfdscw
2,"We all self harm, some are just more creative. I don’t in the traditional way but it’s there in risky decisions/ actions, drug/ alcohol abuse, smoking, dangerous sexual desires and actions.
I would not say you think you have BPD. I switched therapists a while back and they were standoffish about accepting my diagnosis right away until they assessed it for themselves. Which is what they will want to do regardless so just tell them what’s bothering you with a broad brush. 
Some don’t even give the diagnosis even if you meet all the criteria to “protect “ you… which kinda fucked me up honestly. Didn’t know I had it for another 15 years when if I knew I had it I could have started the work much earlier. M

I’d say try to find one that has worked with BPD patients. On psychologytoday.com they have little write ups and sometimes they mention their past experience. Since you know this is what you need help with you have the power here to find the right person, not be totally at the mercy of the system.
Good luck 💚",Borderline_Pigeon,1bfdscw
3,so idk how fast they would want to diagnose you but personally for me i have a psychiatrist who i do talk therapy with as well and she was still treating me and medicating me before my diagnosis it wasn't till maybe a few months later i emailed her and told her i read things ab bpd and i felt like the traits matched and she said we'd talk ab it and the she diagnosed me but i do think you'll probably need to go there for some time before they diagnose u bc idk if id trust a diagnosis in one session,losersophie,1bfdscw
0,"DBT/CBT Journaling has helped me immensely. Therapy, therapy, therapy... there is absolutely ALWAYS room for progress and improvement in everyone. Keep your head up. You are not your diagnosis. You can lessen the symptoms with determination and will. Recognizing triggers and thought patterns will be hard sometimes, but the moment you do have a solid grasp on them, then life and personal relationships seem to be a little bit easier to navigate. I'm sure different things and coping mechanisms work differently with different people. But this is what has helped me begin to unwrap my mind and figure out how to semi tame it. And my medication, I take it religiously because the right mix can help lessen symptoms, too. Get with your psych and see what could be suitable for you.",AlligatorDentist,1bmpyok

However, in addition to that I had dialectical behaviour therapy which was really helpful I also had schema therapy which meant I could safely look at my behaviours and where they came from.

2,41 here! First time diagnosed at 19 (and rejected that…) and now been diagnosed since 39! Attended group therapy to learn DBT (Community helped!!) and seeing a great new therapist after the other moved states and am feeling very productive and stable currently. Great podcast: The BPD Bunch on Apple Podcasts!! It helps me not feel as devastated or alone!!!,NorthWoodsLewk,1bmpyok
3,"I recommend Dr. Fox on Youtube (His books are great too)

Also for PMDD/PME, mood stabilizers have helped me so much. I had a really rough cycle recently, but the two before were so much more manageable. I'm still slowly upping dose though and I hope soon I'll be relatively free of that monthly nightmare.",princefruit,1bmpyok
4,"Hey, welcome to the club! I’m glad you are finding understanding through the diagnosis, but I know this can be a scary and confusing time, too. That is totally normal and understandable. But please try to remember that you're no different than you were before your diagnosis - it doesn't change or define who you are. It's just putting a name and explanation to your symptoms, and it can guide your recovery going forward. BPD is very complex, and there’s a lot of stigma and misinformation out there, so be wary of that, and know that not everything you've heard so far may be true.  
  
One thing I find especially important to stress to the newly diagnosed is that BPD remission is not uncommon. I've been in remission for over 2 years, and I'm far enough in my recovery that I don't just have to cope with my symptoms or spend a lot of conscious effort resisting unhealthy behaviors. I’ve overcome a lot of symptoms. I love myself and love life, and I have close, healthy relationships. I thought I could never get here... but I have, and you can, too.  
  
It's hard for me to break down general advice in writing for everyone here who needs it, so I started a YouTube channel with BPD information and advice as well as other topics that have helped me on my recovery journey. https://www.youtube.com/@sarruhtonin if you're interested.

  
Especially helpful for you right now might be the ""Understanding BPD"" video that breaks down the symptoms and diagnostic criteria, and ""BPD Advice Part 1"" and “BPD Advice Part 2” which are made for people in your position. The BPD remission/recovery video may also be helpful right now.  
  
Again, please please be wary of misinformation, because there is a LOT even within these subreddits. And do your best to believe that you can improve - growth is very difficult if you don't. It takes a lot of time and conscious, repeated effort to rewire those thought and behavior patterns in our brains, and the work can feel pointless and fruitless for a long time, but keep going and things will get better. Best of luck with everything.",SarruhTonin,1bmpyok

0,"If you're noticing your breathing, it's probably helpful to focus and intentionally breathe slowly.  As in count and stare at an image/clock.

There's a middle point between complete avoidance (also not good), and adding more fuel (and you know how that is). 

Radical acceptance could work.

""Yes I am angry/upset/triggered. I am. It's uncomfortable. I don't like it. Okay. That's where I am.""

But, don't add backstory, as in don't start listing everything that's gone wrong before. If a friend is running late/cancels, don't start listing every time anyone has done that, not even every time that friend has done that. That's fuel. It isn't helpful (when you're calm maybe you want to look at patterns, but not when you're upset). 

I find it helps to do my self-talk out loud, because that means I have to form words and hear them outside. My thoughts run off too fast.

I am more surprised that he has you on more than one antidepressant. Did one not work? Or is he switching you between them? Those antidepressants work pretty much the same, so doubling them shouln't be more effective but pose more risks for side effects.",Nemini20,vzwtbg

2,She said the Abilify was for mood stabilizer and the Cymbalta was for depression. But I saw online their both antidepressants? And Abilify is for bipolar but she diagnosed me with Borderline so idk.,ThroWawaY993948,vzwtbg
3,"No they are not both antidepressants. Abilify is an antipsychotic. Antipsychotics are called that because originally they were used for psychosis (in high doses), but it was quickly found that a lot if different conditions benfit from the effect this drug has. 

People tend to get weirded out when they hear antipsychotics, so a lot of doctors call them mood stabalizers. They are used for all sorts of mental health conditions, from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorders, chronic insomnia to conditions you would have never thought off like severe nausea (chemo related) or chronic hiccups. 

Cymbalta is an SNRI (Serotonin Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitor). It is an antidepressants, but sometimes people also refer to it as an anti anxiety med, because it is used for a variety of conditions that induce anxiety. 

Medications have licensed indications, for example abilify is  licensed for bipolar disorder. Licensed Indications are basically that the pharma company that developed the drug and studied it says, ""look this med works against this condition, and we have the following trial data to back it up"". The drug might be just as effective for another similar condition, but the company might not want to spend the money on licensing the drug for this condition because licensing is very expensive. 

That does not mean the drug is not effective for that other condition though. Doctors can prescribe drugs for you that are outwith the indication, like abilify for bpd, when it is licensed for bipolar disorder. That is totally ok and safe, because there are trials to back up the effectiveness, the pharma company just didn't spend the money on getting this indication licensed.

That means, that googling a drug and seeing what is it used for will not neccessarily bring up your condition. You cannot google a drug and conclude what somebody is taking it for. Somebody with blood pressure meds might take it for migraine prevention, but you won't find that out when you google it. 

Long text, short meaning: Don't google your drugs when you are not trained in medicine/pharmacy. You will come across all these super unlikely side effects and it will just freak you out. Trust your doctor and ask lots of questions if you are feeling unsure. 

If you have any more questions, you can always message me. Or you can go to a pharmacy (when they are not busy) and ask them to tell you about your meds, because you feel confused about them. They will be able to help you.",Nemini20,vzwtbg
4,"Telling people not to look up potential side effects or the other uses of medications they're on is extremely dangerous practice and if a doctor told me this I would believe that they were engaging in malpractice. These side effects DO happen, especially with long term antipsychotics. People may not know how to interpret the risks of side effects or their cause without training in pharmacy but it doesn't take very much education to be aware of the risks and their dynamics when taking any new medication, and many psychiatrists often specifically omit knowledge of potential side effects to ""avoid scaring"" their patients. Before I developed schizophrenia I was pursuing a pharmacology Ph.D. and as a result I do know how to interpret the risks of side effects, many of which actually have happened to me while taking neuroleptic medications. If I had followed my doctor's garbage advice to stop looking things up online I wouldn't have known what to tell my doctor because I wouldn't even be able to identify or connect the symptoms. I hope you rethink this matter and overcome the view of most med students that assumes all patients to be stupid and placid empty subjects that are incapable of connecting the dots. Most people are not so ignorant that they will be harmed by being aware of the potential side effects and risks they may face, especially with medications with as high of side effect profiles as the ones you're discussing.",apothecary4830,vzwtbg

Just an FYI that mood stabilizers are a separate class of psych med than APs; it's not a euphemism or alternative way to name them.",TranZeitgeist,vzwtbg
6,"I know that. I don't consider antipsychotics mood stabalizers, I consider them antipsychotics.

6,"When this happens I usually know it. I've learned to recognize the signs (numb? In prison in my head? Not eating or taking care of my body)

I try to ""do"" something then.

Self care, meaning taking a shower, trying to do a wash, clean the house.

If I am really ""out of it"" , naming slowly objects around me, trying to listen to the sounds outside,  trying to be in the now.

I sometimes dissociate so much that I do not even remember it after.

My time line means everything then.

If you start to have a warped sense of time then you are dissociating.

So trying to do things and have a routine is what keeps you sane.

I've lost it 2 weeks ago with a cPTSD trigger, I got so mad and furious I am still trying to make sense of it all.

So I had to go through many states of dissociation/derealization or even almost psychotic.

And I had to fend for me and my kids during that.

It helps me a lot to have a meaning/purpose,  because without it I would lose it, so that's fine.

Bath, music, sometimes even just watching shows on TV,  just to come down to ""reality"" ...

And the ""butterfly"" technique or another one ""Ho'oponono"" (search on YouTube) is helpful to me in order to re-center to the essential,  the now, the reality of the now.

The next thing I know I’m being physically restrained by 3 full grown men and being told that I just tried to kill my tattoo artist, they said my eyes were completely open and horrifyingly focused on the guy while I was trying to choke him. It literally felt like I just passed out and basically didn’t believe them until I learned about dissociative amnesia few years ago.

But first even while this is true for myself I also experience dr/dp(derealisation/depersonalisation) where I don't choose or not to go in a crisis of this dissociations,.
And it's what I want to say overall there, yes some people will have control over it, but first there is different types and level of dissociations. 
And second not everyone can even at the same level of dissociation.

So really it's not just a choice for everyone, some people can't choose to or not bc it's a high level of dissociation, like in DID it's quite likely most alters don't have a say in dissociating or not, bc it's a high level dissociation it's imposed by the brain to protect the body.

If your level of dissociation is possible to work on and if you have the skills to do it(which I don't say that it's not a certain skill) good for you but it's not just a choice for everyone.",AntYrbis,16wmbkv

Of course it's hard if you're that deep into it, but that's the best I've got.

It would help more if you're aware of what triggers you so you can be ready before you sink into. Washing dishes or doing anything physical like that will usually cause me to dissociate.",theghostofameme,16wmbkv

20,"I don't know how it is for you, but for me often when I'm in dr/dr crisis, I still have a bit of capacity to understand I'm in it (I think it's a skill I developped but not something a therapist make me learn to do), it's the first step to using grounding methods, bc I don't know how to say but for me in ""just a dissociation"" I can easily understand it's that and so try to use grounding skill. When I'm in dr/dp for long I didn't knew it wasn't normal, then understood the schema but still had to learn to see when I was in it kinda.

So sometime I still don't know I'm in a crisis I don't realise consciously that it's happening and in this moment I don't know how you can make more to keep you safe honeslty. 
But when I get it's a dr/dp crisis, I can use some grounding skills, or ask help to some people I trust to help with this, I can act to try and make things less dangerous. Bc I really get you with getting hurt and not caring/acting on it in crisis, or just generally not being careful of dangerous situation ((tw crisis dumping I guess XD jump to the next line to be safe)depending on the crisis even going to thinking jumping off onto a road would be fun to try bc it's a dream so ""what bad could happen?"" And like that I could see what my brain does with this dream starting so bad).
I often catch myself thinking wahoo I'm so much not paying enough attention to that dangerous thing right now when I've come to understand it was a dr crisis, but you know knowing it is doesn't just make it go, so it's still feels like it's not real anyway, so I still try to think ""logically"" and consider what would be dangerous and all, and I see so much things I don't pay attention to, but as it still doesn't feel real I don't pay more attention to them after noticing it XD, but I can try to use grounding methods. It's not like when I zone out bc ADHD and then I see I almost tripped or what and go back to being in the moment XD 

I'm sorry, I talked a lot and doesn't give a lot of advice but yeah ><

23,"Yes, the problem is that I don't realize that I'm in crisis, once as I walked down the busy street, I couldn't shake the feeling of being in a fog. My mind was a jumble of thoughts, and my body felt heavy and unresponsive. I tried to cross the street, but my legs wouldn't move. I stood there, frozen, as cars whizzed by just inches from my face.

I had no idea how I got there, or how to get out. It was as if I was trapped in a dream, unable to wake up. My senses were dulled, and I couldn't feel the world around me.

I had always been a careful person, always aware of my surroundings and the dangers that lurked in every corner. But now, I feel lost kinda? Idk it's been 2 years and I'm still suffering from the consequences of derealizing, I just want a way to break free from this crisis before it is too late.",RealAnastasiaV,16wmbkv

But yeah I feel like what you describe could have totally happened to me in dr and I have had close experiences to this too.

Also being frozen is just such a hard thing to deal with in it, bc even if I know I'm in dr, sometimes I'm too dissociated to be anything about it and yeah I'm frozen I know I should do this thing to protect myself or what but can't make myself do it at all it's horrible >< 

I can't imagine how it's like to ""only have"" dr since 2 years, I think it must be so much worst than me bc it's so distressing that having it not only happen but also be a new thing is hard for me to imagine how complex it must be to live that.

At least I hope it can make you feel a bit better knowing others live the same thing ^^

Edit : Just to add a bit bc I remembered that a part that kinda helped with the knowing I'm derealising is doing the ""reality checks"" everytime I thought I was in a dream, which has lead to a period where I could do lucid dream XD (it's like what the reality checks are from so make sens) and has simulteanously made me more able to see I was not actually in a dream in dr (which obviously doesn't do anything for rhe feeling of being in a dream or being stuck etc but allowed me to think hey maybe it's that that is happening).
So those reality checks I don't remember exactly but things like looking at the time multiple time a few moment away to see if the time goes by ""logically"" (not my favorite), looking at your hands I think it was, and the rest I don't really remember but yeah those things that are supposed to not be going to normal way in a dream but would in dr bc it's actually real XD
I didn't knew about the term dr and even less about dr/dp when I was looking for a way to understand this whole thing so it's very experimental XD
I just thought it was a crise like anxiety crisis but another type and was looking for a way to be more aware of the crisis so I could think about what I was thinking during and see what it was. 
And well as soon as I tried to remember/listen to what I was thinking at this moment I noticed easily that the main thing was this feeling that it's not real (I have a lot more dr crisis/they are more likely to be distressing than dp one where I just kinda don't do a lot).",AntYrbis,16wmbkv

For me, Rexulti was freaking awesome.  It made a huge difference in my moods and self control.

I was on .25mg, for about 4 years.  I started it because I was in a bad episode, non-stop anxiety for months and months.  Within days of starting Rexulti, I was calm.  Happy.  Well, happy-ish.

Caused a little bit of weight gain, but I was underweight, anyway.   Stopped taking it this spring, no issues coming off it.

I also feel like the time on it sort of ""trained"" my brain into being calmer, too, if that makes sense.  that is, my Mom died in April, and while it's been hard, I've been managing all right.

Considering everybody around me expected me to totally fall apart, I'd say I'm doing well.

It can go away over time. With the right treatment, people with bpd can line fulfilling lives and even be cured. Don’t stress yourself out. It may seem scary but it’s really okay.

1,This was how I was diagnosed with bpd. I took a psych course in college and discovered it while learning cluster b personality disorders and saw myself completely.

They may diagnose u with something but they will rarely divulge it to u unless u seriously push for a diagnosis).

Being female is actually an advantage in this case because the ratio for women:men is about 3:1. Since it's most common in women, it could be less likely they have an issue with it. A good psychiatrist would take your own opinion of it into consideration.

1,"I was misdiagnosed for 18 years. At 15 my symptoms started and the first psychiatrist my parents took me to diagnosed me (unbeknownst to me) as borderline, but told my parents that I “was too young & didn’t fit the mould”. I never knew this discussion happened. I left there that day diagnosed as bipolar. I was on a myriad of different medications over the next 18 years (more than 20 kinds) but mostly Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Abilify.  I never truly spent much time in therapy asbit was though that my cause was chemical so I was always just put on medication. Anyway, my life has not been entirely horrific but it’s very sad to admit that my dreams & goals were never reached, I could never finish anything I started and the manic episodes over the years were bad but the depression was all consuming. Looking back they weren’t manic episodes just breakdowns and highs from substance abuse. When I was 30 I had been unemployed for 6 years & at rock bottom. I asked my parents to help me with assisted suicide, the emptiness I had every day was just too much. I didn’t want to die but I didn’t want to live either. Anyway so soon after I end up in a new psychiatric hospital (one I hadn’t been to yet) and I was admitted for 3 weeks and placed with a psychiatrist that apparently was the pro in female mental health especially bpd. I was diagnosed that day after a few hours and i was placed on the correct meds for the first time in my life and also started behavioral therapy the next day. It’s now 6 years later & I’ve almost completely outgrown BPD. It used to be a death sentence back in the day when i was 15 (probably why that doc didn’t want to “go” with a bpd diagnosis). I have a great job and a flourishing career, I’m happy, I can look after myself. Only thing I still really struggle with is my emotion regulation & interpersonal relationships but I am still healing. I still see my psychiatrist and psychologist and they are always so proud of me. I am on Lithium, Dopaquel & Trazadone. There is hope!!!

3,"exactly!! i agree wholeheartedly; i’ve heard a few people diagnosed with BPD say they don’t understand why “everyone is in such a rush to get diagnosed” and “they must want a label, i hate labels” like okay that’s all fine and dandy but i’ve spent so many years suffering and being told by my parents that im overreacting, being irrational etc. but at the same time they will say there’s nothing wrong with me. i have been told by my high school guidance counselor to stop coming to her office because i took up too much of her time and she couldn’t do anything for me after a certain point. when i was in high school, i missed so many days because of various reasons, but all of them boiled down to having extreme emotional meltdowns i could not control. so many days i left school early because an abusive ex would break up with me in the middle of the day, and since i cannot handle the fear of abandonment, i would start crying and would not be able to stop. anyways, i 100% agree with you, now that i actually know what is wrong & it doesn’t sound farfetched, it is freeing in a way! you don’t have to reply to this, i got confusing and rambly, thank you for reading my post & commenting!",jessedarko,u1ztco
4,"Oh wow I feel exactly like this! And please don't worry about rambling <3 You're fine, if I'm speaking I talk really fast and really constantly lol.

I had a really dark homelife, part of that was they controlled what therapy I could and couldn't do (it's complicated but they didn't want me talking about certain things) so I ended up with a worthless diag and new core traumas about being hospitalized. So for *decades* everything I did seek out centered around drug addiction, even though I could just stop getting high for years and not care. 

My current diagnosis is CPTSD, BPD, and DID. For years I dealt with nasty symptoms of all that mixed together, but with no idea of what was happening to me! ""I am batsh** insane"" was the *best* answer I had. 

I did everything wrong, because I never understood what I was actually dealing with. I shut alters out, tried to just suppress and sublimate ALL of my feelings to be someone's Perfect gf, and I stayed in close contact with some of my worst abusers. None of that ended well *at all*.

I think it's fine to not want a label, but to me that's not really what a diagnosis is. It's more a snapshot of where I'm at right now than some defining thing like what color my eyes are. I'll always be a DID system, but I could go the rest of my life with no new amnesia, which symptomatically is more like OSDD. Allegedly meds and DBT therapy can help me mitigate BPD symptoms until the diag has to be re-evaluated, so the diagnosis itself may be removed (I wouldn't use the word 'cured' as much as 'asymptomatic'). And so on. So to me it's more like ""these are the symptoms you currently experience"" and therefore ""these are specific things to treat"".

It's like, I wasted so much of my life being crazy, having episodes, making dumb choices (ESPECIALLY about partners), that now I feel like I could have avoided. That's why the diag is so important to me, I don't want to lose any more years.

1,"1) I have been on lamotragine, fluxotine, latuda, quetiapine, and vyvanse. This combo of meds came from the diagnosis of bipolar (mood stabilizers, first 4) and ADHD (vyvanse) before the diagnosis of BPD. The only two I can tell when I take is quetiapine (knocks me tf out) and vyvanse (narrows down my focus). I have never felt a mood being stabilized. Most people seem to agree therapy is the best (and maybe only) way. 

2) Absolutely yes. I gave myself a concussion with how powerful a sedative Quetiapine is. We were able to lower the dosage successfully. However, if I run out I don’t sleep. I went on a trip and ran out. Didn’t sleep for 3 days.

3,"Hi OP, I don't think I have much to add in the medications aspect but your English was great in the post, I think I understood everything you were trying to communicate. 

I haven't been medicated for BPD but for depression & anxiety and an antidepressant did really help with my moods. Mostly it helped with my huge lows and really bad mood swings. It did kind of make me a little numb which I realized after getting off of it. Overall I would say it was a good experience for me. I really really think it depends on the individual and your experience will vary. Medication can be that next step we need to get ourselves to a steady baseline and consistently feeling okay instead of really high highs and really low lows, if that makes sense. If you are really against trying it (which is valid and completely within your rights!) then I'd just prepare something for your therapist with a plan to work on in therapy. Like maybe you would prefer focusing on the DBT and therapy in general and implementing what you learn into life before trying medication. I am not a doctor or therapist but that sounds reasonable to me, especially if you're having concerns of side effects or having to taper off of the medication. 

Questions I would ask about the medications would be - 
1. What are the most common side effects your patients see with this/these medication(s)? 
2. What are less common, but concerning side effects I can try to prepare for or should know about?",Quailfreezy,154rxs4
4,"Honestly, just don't bother. It sounds like therapy alone is helping, and as you continue with it, you'll progress further. Meds, especially mood stabilisers and antipsychotics can cause awful side effects, sometimes they don't even help the symptoms it's being taken for. They're more hassle than they're worth in my opinion, and NO they are not necessary. 

I can't answer about addiction as I'm not sure - but side effects can be bad, I believe lamotragine is one of the worst with that god awful rash it can give you. 

You should consider asking why they're wanting to give you a mood stabiliser for short term problems, they take anywhere between 2 - 6 weeks to make a noticeable difference, that's if they work, and they probably will give you side effects at some point. You could ask about an unmedicated approach to this situation, where you have an extra session every week, or a crisis plan that you can refer to if things get bad etc. And if you/they think medication is the best option, consider a short term medication instead - fast acting and much more effective in the short term, less side effects (for me at least), but can be more addictive.",TheLacosteCroc,154rxs4

6,"Thank you so much for such a descriptive reply! It really means a lot! What I gather and feel about this is - 

1. This numbness from mood stabilizers, someone else also mentioned. I am unsure whether it would be something for me or not. I feel I don't like the idea of it but maybe at least momentarily I feel better with having such numbness especially when I feel I have such a wide emotional range.
2. I have also realized that not all meds work for everyone. There is a trial and error basis attached to meds.
3. I would prefer having like ""as needed basis med"" like an ""SOS med"" but not having something that I take regularly.
4. Therapy will never be replaced and it is a constant for me until I feel I have overcome BPD. This med situation is temporary

I will also say that I have never done drugs and alcohol because I don't like the idea of losing my senses. Also side-effects, etc. scare me a bit. So, it is a part of my reasoning to be reluctant to meds of such sorts. But I am willing to give a try to somewhere. The decision remains in my hand but I would want the session with my psychiatrist to be as clear for me.

10,"Thank you so much! My therapist had explained me in the session that the mood stabilizer would essentially increase the production of dopamine and serotonin in my body and also the rate of absorption in neurons of these hormones, once my body is able to produce these hormones at a good rate by itself, they will lessen the dosage of these meds. Moreover, I was told that she is recommending me to the psychiatrist only because of this extremely low phase. So, I assume that I too am being medicated for my depression but when I have my session with the psychiatrist I will clear this up too. 

I want to ask you (I hope I am not crossing any line here) once you got off the meds, and felt this numbness did you ever feel that you got dependent on them at any time or later realized something of such sorts? Do you know why that little numbness was felt? Apologies if I am asking way out of my line .. lmk if so I'll edit this part ..

14,"Not crossing a line, no worries at all! I think for me, I miss the numbness only because it helped me feel so much more balanced. Like yeah, the numbness sucks in hindsight (because I really couldn't detect it or realize it until I returned to my normal state of ""chaos"" lol) but it really helped me feel like I had a steadier ""baseline"" if that makes sense. Like yeah I was a little numbed but I prefer that over feeling very very depressed ya know? That's just a personal preference though. Most people I know (who don't have BPD to my knowledge) who have been on antidepressants usually say they did NOT like the numbness and wouldn't want to take them again. But I liked that I felt more balanced, like less over the top upset at small things, felt like I was able to think more clearly about situations that upset me, that kind of thing. It also just generally was very helpful with that heavy, dark depression feeling I experience. So overall I had a good experience but of course it all depends on the individual. 

I wish you the best of luck with whatever you decide to do!

2) AffordableTherapyCanada ? i think is the name of the site? but I found my current therapist from there, found one in my city that worked with my budget.

1,"I’m prescribed Oxtellar, Remeron, and Effexor. Keep in mind I’m also Bipolar (hence the Oxtellar). Remeron has been amazing for my sleep and low appetite, and Effexor has been a miracle for my anxiety! Also highly highly recommend Buspar if you have a lot of anxiety. Depakote also really helped too (another mood stabilizer). The tricky part with BPD is that it can’t be treated with medication, just the Comorbid disorders/symptoms. I definitely notice a huge difference when I’m off my medications though, so I know it helps me a ton!

12,"Prescribing mood stabilizers is something that a person should know how to do. So maybe try to see it that way. It's not like you are making something up. It's more like that specific health professionals don't have the experience to give you certain mood stabilizers. 

Giving someone Lamotrigine for example can have pretty extreme side effects when it is not done correctly. Also Lithium is something that needs a loot of experience to give it to a patient. The only thing I know that is easier to prescribe is valproate. 
I once got valproate because I had a grand mal seizure. Mood stabilizers like valproate or Lamotrigine are often used for epilepsie as antiepileptics. And with valproate you can just take you dosage. With epilepsie the dosage is way higher than for bipolar disorder. I did not like valproate though.",SpecialMitra,s1ljkq

I live in South America and here we grow lots of Boldo which is supposed to help with stomach issues, but that didn't do the job. Then I started  on simethicone and it helped in the beginning, but from the 3rd until the 16th day it just wouldnt work. It's gone away now, as has the exacerbated anxiety.

I have two complaints at this point, about 23 days after I first took it:

sleepless nights - I take it in the morning, go to work, get home about 8 pm, have a couple drinks, have dinner and go to sleep by about 11:30 pm. I have woken up at about 2/2:30 am EVERY SINGLE FUCKING NIGHT and I can't sleep until about 5pm, which is fucked up cause I get up at 5:30 am to go to work.

stiff muscles - I didn't feel that in the beginning but I've read about it and today it hit me for good. I feel as if I need to stretch the fuck out ever 10 minutes and I just can't afford to stop and do that because of my job.",No_Editor1065,148kx43

We talked a lot about BPD triggers (as it's my secondary diagnostic after social anxiety), about drug use (which I'm very fond of) and damage reduction related to drugs and drinking 
Thank the universe for not fucking it up when it comes to drinking on Zoloft, Im sure I wouldn't bear it.

7,"I get what you're saying but I like to approach all trauma as equally valid. It's a very subjective thing and the same thing happening to two different people can vary greatly in how traumatic it is. I was just using that as an example of doctors are still figuring this stuff out so just be skeptical if they push you to do something you feel isn't helping. I think waiting for a while is a very wise idea. Especially with these kind of meds because it takes a while for it to plateau so you're not going up and down all the time and it's more stable. And, if you still feel its not helping, you can always up the dose or try another route, whichever works best for you.
Oh my god... 'damage reduction'... That's given me a blast-from-the-past hahaha. I, too, had a strong affinity for drugs and that's the exact kind of thing I'd discuss with my therapist hahaha

That might be in a month  two or more but it always comes about. I'm still struggling to get official help with this because I've found the moment you tell docs you've been doing illicit drugs they stamp you 'DRUG ADDICT' all caps and refuse all help so now I'm going about it differently but it's a process that has taken 4 years so far and I expect it to take more.

There are tools to help even without diagnosis but I’d say it would be harder alone. Without a group and 1/1 to talk it through with x ask for a second opinion. Get all of your research together and put your point across. If it falls on deaf ears, ask for a second opinion. You can pay to see a private psychologist but unless they have a speciality in BPD, I don’t think it would help.

3,"You feel helpless and like you cannot effect change. It seems easier to take it out on everyone than to face your pain. I know I’ve been running from pain for 50 years and beating myself up where some people want to release it on others some release it on self. Then that gets too hard to handle, we try to move outward. 

We all have trauma and we must learn to see that others out there—out here are acting out their traumas too. It’s sad that many do not know what their diagnoses would be if they were to get help. 

Seeing my diagnoses as a gift empowers me because I can do something about my traits, my triggers, my brain health. Many don’t get that gift and yet we get outraged at them when actually we can use our gifts to effect change after all. We can. You can. It’s what we want the most is to effect change; however, trying to go about it in a negative way would  not actually be effecting the change we want - we are just reliving our trauma in a way that keeps us feeding on more trauma and we think by giving it to others we will release it. Nope that doesn’t work.  It’s exactly an abuse loop like a dog chasing cars. If only there were a Cesar Milan for bpd people… well there is. There are bpd whisperers!! I promise the way to effect change is to change your brain… at the deepest level that is what you are asking for and the rage is here to say heal me. 
The rage is really your wounded inner child and a helpless child doesn’t have a clue how to effect change in abusive grown ups.

It’s time to start having conversations with your young self at different developmental ages and letting him/her know that it’s ok - they can go play and have fun and that you are going to step in now and do what the adults could not do for your young self. For every traumatic experience your young self experienced go back and give him/her what they needed from the adults who were unable to do so. 

There’s lots of help you don’t have to do this alone.

2,"Don't put too much pressure on yourself to do things right at the moment. It's okay if you lose it a little. If you can look into support groups for bpd or for loss it might help you meet new people and get out and socialise and maybe have people to rely on.

If you have general aquaintences that showed up to the funeral and offered vague ""if you need anything"" sentiments. Call them up on it. ""Can you take my dog on a walk?"" ""Can you cook me dinner?"" etc. Sometimes people say that stuff and don't mean it, sometimes they mean it. Find out.

8,DBT is essentially the “gold standard” for BPD is how it’s been explained to me many times. I also have BPD and it can be very challenging trying to manage those very intense symptoms so I feel you. I think if you have other mental health stuff going on like anxiety/depression etc medication would be beneficial that way but not so much in managing the symptoms of borderline. There isn’t much medication that helps with BPD and is mostly done through working with a therapist who specializes in trauma and just putting in the work to do it. This is a privilege though considering how unattainable mental health support can be in most areas of the world. DBT is also a very structured therapy program from my understanding... it’s like you do that and nothing else while you do it and it can do wonders for many many people but it’s also very rigid as you do it. You can get our patient programs from the hospital where I’m from in canada and I’ve done them before but it’s not going to be as helpful as actually having full access to it like 4 days a week for several hours. It’s very intensive. I have other issues besides BPD and meds have helped me a lot in managing those but as for BPD the help really comes from elsewhere other than medication. Even benzos can trigger me more in BPD flare instead of calm me down.,notsure8989,oqm6aw

My CPTSD was causing me the most distress, so it was mainly prescribed for that. It really helped me stabilize and be able to stop existing in fight-or-flight mode. It also aided me in my addiction recovery process. Like all meds, it's meant to do its job in tandem with appropriate therapies and restructuring of one's life to remove stressors. It's not a cure, and it's not necessarily meant to work long-term. Everyone is different regarding what works for them or not. It's not an easy process to find the right med for you. It can be long and tedious riding out side effects and figuring out doses. And it's important not to stop them cold-turkey, or change meds too quickly.

Then I have used both zypadehra (zyprexa injection) and zyprexa tablets (up to 30 mg a day, but 20 is usually highest dose). If I would be able to choose, I would choose seroquel over zyprexa. But there’s a lot of different kinds of seroquel. I guess you took in the evening for sleep and “calming of the head”? When you regularly take seroquel depot, ur usually just tired in the beginning, to my knowledge it’s one of the first they try to give u since it’s one of the “lighter” ones. Zyprexa can be intense, especially in high doses. Some people are fine work calming effect on as low as 2,5 mg. 20 will make u pass out in the beginning. When I was on high doses, I was a zombie.

3,"Hi there! So, I actually ended up coming off of Vraylar in June of 2022 due to a HUGE ton of mis-diagnosises and a paradoxical reaction from benzodizepines (long story, it's pretty intense, the tl;dr--not really possible-- is that I was put on benzos ten years ago after a doctor purposefully misdiagnosed me with bipolar, I cycled through 18 different psych meds, they threw me on benzos, those made me psychotic, literally, and then I was diagnosed with Panic disorder and anxiety, they kept upping my dose of benzos which made everything worse to the point where they diagnosed me with BPD because I literally had every. single. symptom. of it. Eventually--because medical things are my OCD/special interest, I realized I was probably having withdrawal from benzos, ended up coming off my meds, that was a nightmare (the benzo withdrawal), and then came off vraylar). 

I got up to IIRC 3.5mg and it really helped my moods at the time.

I would caution literally anybody ever with respect to antipsychotics because there's a lot of things that they can do wrong with your body in the movement disorder category.

I was one of the 10% of people that take Vraylar that got Drug-Induced Parkinsonism (DIP). There's a random NIH dot gov study out there that has one little blip about cariprazine and DIP, and I had to prove this to my psychiatrist that I am not making the fact that my entire body is having tremors among other things and that I was being harmed by the medication.... HOWEVER, so, I was on three medications (antipsychotic-vraylar, anti-anxiety med -buspirone, and an anti-anxiety medication- a benzodiazepine, specifically klonopin, which has one of the longest half-lives of the benzos class).

The vraylar gave me DIP, akathesia in my legs (restlessness), and I also got tardive dyskinesia in my mouth. It has all been permanent for me, though it's not as bad as it was last year, and I'm using medical cannabis to keep the tremors and whatnot at bay at this point because it is the only thing that stops my issues (to an extent). The DIP was being masked by the benzos though, and as soon as I cut my dose (unsafely as per doctors orders because nobody knows how to do it \[benzo cessation\] correctly in the medical community) I immediately began having issues.

If you do take any anti-psychotic medication, I would caution about movement disorders and to ABSOLUTELY monitor them. I looked at your post history just a bit, and I saw that you're having restlessness from medication, and I would talk to your doctor about that (if you haven't already) because akathesia is a common side effect from psychiatric medications, and I want you to be knowledgeable about this and able to take control of your life.

I actually have drug-induced amnesia, from about the end of 2016 to March 28 2022, so what little I do remember is... very sparing, like, I remember a house fire, getting the mail wearing a specific shirt, looking at a bug... just really random stuff.

You know, the one thing that helped me the most though, the literal one thing that helped me and has continued to help me to this very day, was DBT. It's to the point I would recommend DBT to literally anybody ever that wants any type of self-help at all. Specifically I'd recommend the large book by Marsha Leinhan (DBT creator actually) and the book is titled DBT Skills Training Handout. It's an AMAZING resource, like, I CANNOT stress enough much that book changed my life.

Although I am not diagnosed w/BPD ATM, I was absolutely 10000000% a more serious case of all the symptoms to the point where if I hadn't gotten off my medication last year, I probably would not be here today.

I know that this response is extremely long (username checks out, lol), but I just want to be as transparent as possible to anybody asking about medications, so that if/when they decide to try any medication, they're armed with knowledge and can proceed and improve their lives.

I would not recommend benzos to anybody unless it was literally once a month, one time per month, maybe because you have to fly or get a procedure done, because they are, IMO, more dangerous than opiates.

I sincerely wish you (and everybody else) the very best, and I want to remind anybody at all who reads this that they matter, their lives matter, their lives are valid, their opinions and thoughts and wants and beliefs are valid, and that no matter what happens, at the end of the day, if one is sad or unhappy, that there *are* people out there who care, there *are* people out there that are in their corner, and there *are* people who will sit with you (be it via the internet or in person) and be there to listen to you and give you a hug (even if it's an e-hug lol). 

So, with all that being said, much peace to everybody here. DO NOT let my story scare you with respect to anti-psychotics, but DO be aware of your body and if you start to feel weird physically, DO bring it up to your doctor.

Peace & Tranquility my friend.",,pqpn9g

It's an amazing resource... lol, the teacher's guide, idk why but I suddenly remembered elementary school where I actually had a teacher's history book and it had test answers in it and everybody was like, ""Ooo!""

The key for myself has been research, and standing up for myself when speaking to my psychiatrist and GP. I am currently on one that works wonders for me, but I have been on so many drugs that have ranged from 'this is okay but side effects suck' to 'holy fuck never again wtf.' 

And which one your body responds to well is... unfortunately only you will be able to tell. So be honest with your practitioners about the side effects and how it's doing for you.",a-stranded-rusalka,sgjn90

0,Based on my own experience- Wellbutrin is good for energy it will get you moving and out of a black hole. However it did increase my anxiety and I  couldn't sleep. I found that the most stable meds for me to be on were Viibrid and Lithium. An antidepressant plus mood stabilizer. So if you want to try Wellbutrin first and see how you do for a couple weeks and maybe add an anxiety med or mood stabilizer to help with it only if you need. I just couldn't do the Wellbutrin anymore because I couldn't sleep but I will always go back to it for severe depression and fatigue. The drugs I'm on right now are maintaining very well. Just my opinion if any of this helps you.  Give it a try!,,w29xoc

It's a mood stabilizer and I noticed times when I would otherwise be anxious and upset and with the medicine, my body would just be chill and roll with it.

LamoTRIgine almost completely got rid of it and it leaves me with enough mental energy to solve my remaining issues.

I just had my first appt with a psychiatrist since 6ish years ago. Both times, I explained everything I've tried. Both times, argument. With my PCP, I explained my history, even asked for alternatives, and when they failed, she was fine doing Xanax or temazepam. I requested other meds on my own. She knows I'm not abusing it.

(I use the Five Stages, too, but my background is heavily rooted in addiction treatment, and I do not see any of the stages as ""absolute or ironclad."") 

I would never myself suggest benzos (or diphenhydramine-based hypnotics) to anyone likely to either misuse them (based on past history) or who has demonstrated fast-onset tolerance and dependence in the past. 

**BUT** we do have a third alternative, and it is one I often recommend for people with [CPTSD > BPD](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2020/12/complex-ptsd-how-we-catch-it-how-we.html): Low (and I mean *low*) doses of sedating neuroleptics like Seroquel quetiapine, Zyprexa olanzepine or (if the others don't work) Clozaril clozapine. 

These meds are widely used for post op sleep support, and increasingly used (at even lower dose levels) for management / suppression of the [general adaptation syndrome](https://www.google.com/search?q=general+adaptation+syndrome+definition&oq=general+adaptation+syndrome) disturbance that is typical of CPTSD > BPD.

Bloodwork is required periodically just to monitor the lithium levels in your blood because if it gets too high it can cause serious medical problems but that is very rare because it’s monitored every couple of months. I personally love it and it has helped me SO SO much. I take it with Lamictal and the two together make a big difference for me.,SliceProfessional600,104h3se

0,"Lamictal gave me an allergic reaction and I was told to stop it pretty fast. I’m on 50mg (morning and night) of Seroquel (along with lexapro, oxcabazapine, and Allegra). I will say it’s definitely been helping. It has been making me a bit foggy and drowsy but it feels like you get used to it more every time. I have pretty bad allergies and it just kind of reminds me of taking something like Zyrtec where it can make you super drowsy but over time, your body kind of adapts. I’ve heard lower doses during the day can make it easier. I have chronic pain too tho so the tiredness has been helping me catch up on sleep my body already needs. I haven’t had any other side effects. I know I’ve heard some people say it needs an antihistamine to bind to or some antidepressant. Again, I really don’t know tho cause I’m kind in the same boat as you with reading all the stuff about it and psyching myself out. Each time I take it, I feel better about it.

0,"I dissociate as a survival skill.

Did so for years without acknowledging it, and that wasn't healthy or productive for me, just consistently ""not-killing-myself"" but not feeling the self-worth to try and improve my situation. Over time, i recognized that was what i was doing, but it still took some time before i actually changed my behaviors in what i was doing about it and trying to figure out how long i could reasonably dissociate for relief.

Now, as a returning student in college, i _have_ to find ways to break up the stress or it is a solid semester of stressing over staggered due dates from my multiple classes until it ends (and i begin my summer or fall semesters; repeating the cycle).

I got a 102% on an exam recently by doing well & nabbing the extra credit and initially only spent 4-5 seconds feeling good about it before my eyes jumped to the next due date on the list and my anxiety restarted. Just enough time for the post-stress diarrhea, then right back to actively stressing about next week's assignments while I'm still on the can.

I'm in therapy, which helps a lot in strategizing about treating my symptoms, but i could not do this without occasionally dissociating into some fantasy game or tuning out everything but an album/playlist.

It's not an eraser; the thoughts/anxiety returns. What goes up must come down. But I'm not still riding that emotional wave and convincing myself ""this is the only option"" or similarly catastrophizing scenarios. Sometimes a few moments to catch your breathe makes all the difference.",iThatIsMe,11h0gtu
1,"I dissociate to relieve the pain, that’s why we have this coping mechanism. And to hope to dissociate, yes I feel that way A LOT. It’s the worst when you wake up and realize that the dissociation has worn off and you’re back at zero. Sometimes I’ll even push myself into the memories with the sole purpose of dissociating. My therapist says there’s nothing inherently wrong with dissociating, but the goal is to manage the feelings until they pass. Personally I’d rather be stoned than sit in my feelings for extended periods but that’s me.",erinr78,11h0gtu
2,"Thank you for sharing something so difficult. I really resonated with what you wrote, as even now disappear into myself, most of the time without knowing. Sometimes there are ways of almost triggering the dissociation, either by endless scrolling, or by wandering into various memories that hurt me into hiding into a corner of my mind that paralyse me. 

These days, like you, I wake up completely raw, exposed to the pain of being an embodied, thinking, active person, with memories and a past and a future. The future is a burden but it is also a realm of possibilities. You can experiment, you can try things that only you can do . I never exercise, but to move the pain outside of me, I push myself to move to channel that electric fire out of my heart and head and into my extremities. I probably look strange doing so. The feeling of my heart pumping and my breath getting hot reminds me of my worst episodes, but I’m the one doing it, actively and not as a reaction. It makes me cry more than anything, but that is a release, too.

We are in so much pain, and our agency and power is often exercised in ways that hurt others, and ourselves. If we can do something that just allows us to see how it works, we can gradually find the little tricks and techniques that can save us when we would have fallen apart or hurt ourselves or someone else. 

This isn’t easy. None of it is. But we have depth of experience and feeling that most do not have. Let us be creative in harnessing this pain. I really believe we can.",threeleaps,11h0gtu

I went off zyprexa before because of the weight gain. This time has been slightly better because I'm also on metformin (not prediabetic but on it when I lost those 30 lbs). When I switched back to zyprexa I went from Sunday weigh ins to MWF weigh ins. My nutritionist also recommended I eat three meals a day even if I'm not hungry in the morning.

0,"Hi. I was diagnosed in 2015. Your friend has probably googled her conditioned. Unfortunately, the internet is CRUEL to people with BPD. There are also a lot of myths about BPD like ""There is no cure."" (Yes, there is). ""I'm unloveable."" (No we're not). or ""I'm doomed to live alone for the rest of my life."" (No you're not).

My advice, reassure her that there is treatement, and that BPD just means you've been hurt so bad that you've lost yourself and you need to find you again. 

Validate her. Up until now, there is a good chance almost no one has. Her biggest fear is being alone AND she's convinced she hurts the people she loves. 

People with BPD are Hyper-Sensitive people already and (I believe) are Empaths who have been traumatized. She needs an Emotional Management Plan and a Self-Love regime STAT.

I’m also anorexic and was similarly afraid of weight gain when starting on it. However, what my psychiatrist has told me (and what has proved true at least for me) is that weight gain caused by psychiatric meds usually present in the general population is not reflected in the anorexic population, because our ED voices are too strong to let our eating behaviour be influenced by the meds. For example, there have been clinical trials where they gave one set of anorexia patients daily Seroquel (a drug notorious for weight gain) and the other set of patients nothing. The patients on Seroquel did not gain significantly more weight than those not on Seroquel",myqueershoulder,z5dhvl

The medicine doesn’t directly cause you to gain weight. It makes you hungrier which in turn can cause you to eat more which then makes you gain weight. 

If I could keep my weight fine at 200mg I feel like you are in the wayyyyy clear at 25mg.",CurlyHairedTaurus,j8668m
1,"I didn't gain at 25mg. I have bp1 and like, a million other things. I did, however, go through a really stressful time and I increased my dose to 50-150mg depending on how I was feeling and I gained 25 pounds in 3 weeks back in April and since then have put on another 5 pounds. Fantastic. Let me tell you, I absolutely love it. It's not like I obsess over my horrible new body several times a day or anything.

So. At 25mg you should be fine. At 50mg you'll likely be ok. But beware anything higher.

Also, 1200mg of lithium is like, a lot. You're way more likely to have symptoms, including weight gain, from a dose that high. I only take 600mg. It might be worth seeing if you can live off 900mg or 600mg before it's too late and you're stuck with a horrible new body, too.",,j8668m

The weight gain will come because it also acts as a sedative, you dont spend that much energy, it throws you in a vegetative state. I hated it, it fixed nothing, just deleted part of me while on it.

You need to meet criteria to have a diagnosis.

\>2. Is it possible to have all of those overlap?

Interestingly, no, it's actually not possible in this case. Bipolar and MDD are both mood disorders, only one of which would be the correct diagnosis.

Then it means no one gave us the skills to live a happy life for many years while we bounced from boyfriend to best friend to break up to isolation. Then when we finally realize there's something wrong with our behavior, we're told it's 100% our responsibility to fix it and by the way did you know therapy was expensive as f***? 

I didn't want to accept that either. DBT is the only place that taught me that there are other ways to look at my situation and if I just change some of my behaviors, people will truly understand me and see me and I don't have to feel like a monster anymore.

DBT taught me there is an inner Spirit within me that doesn't have borderline, that can't be affected by trauma and abuse, that simply just exists and if I put the skills into practice I can usually tap into it.",,tjccd5

At first it just gave me a headache. Then, bad mood swings (or maybe it were regular bpd swings, idk"".

About 3 weeks later, I was outside on a walk when I heard birds sing. And I could smell flowers, the sun was shining. In that moment I just felt calm and somehow normal. That's it, nothing more.
I'm still taking the pills, just now I am reducing the dosis. The medication has helped me a lot, but this is important:

Nothing gets you addicted as antidepressants. A few hours too late taking your pill? Dizziness, nausea, your balance gets off and just everything is awfull. Once you want to stop, a doctor has to make you dose out veeery slowly. 

Good things: if I would do coke or MDMA right now, it might kill me. So I've never touched anything besides weed for 2 years. Also I gained weight yes, but heeeeell I just got more boobs and ass so that's a plus for me.

What I can say about Lamictal is it 100% did balance me out. I wasnt terribly depressed and I wasn’t manic. I didn’t have severe mood swings and no breakdowns or episodes. But, I was a total zombie. I felt like a passenger in my body. I felt really sluggish and low energy and just kind of stupid. It wasn’t worth it to me. I would rather have a manic episode than be devoid of all emotion, personally. So I made the decision to get off of it. 

But I’ve read of this being the miracle drug for people. And like I said it DID noticeably balance me out and prevent me from going too down or too high. My Dr. said adding other meds like Wellbutrin would’ve helped my zombie feeling but I made the decision to just ween off and try no meds for awhile. That was *my* decision. Who knows maybe if I added Wellbutrin and adjusted my Lamictal dose that would’ve been the perfect mix. 

My point is, don’t be scared. Meds are just like therapists. You have to try a few until you find the right one. Your doctor is there to support you, if the meds aren’t working you will know and your doctor will listen and adjust it. 

I will finish with this, even after a few weeks off Lamictal I feel back to how I did before I was on them. So in the event Lamictal isn’t the right med for you nothing it did is permanent.",Successful_Map4660,12ug2cs
1,"It’s so important to remember that everyone is different so you can’t rely completely on the experience of others. 

I’ve seen people report that they love the medication and others that they don’t. I experienced both. At the same time as I was going on Lamictal, my psych took me off of adhd meds. I joke that I slept for an entire year. There were days I just couldn’t move. Like most days. I was also really foggy all of the time and would lose my train of thought constantly.

It really helped my mood which is what kept me on it. I was having a really hard time and my mood swings were wild when I started. I was on it for over a year. Over that time I gained 40 lbs. I also started losing a lot of hair in the shower. This was super difficult for me because my hair has always been thick and nice looking. I developed eczema on my face and eyes that continues to flare up. 

That being said, I needed to even my moods for that time and work through things in therapy. And when I was comfortable I weaned off. I was on 150mg. My pcp then put me on Phentermine for the weight gain, a round of prednisone for the rash, and I use nioxin for my hair loss which seems to be helping. All this to say… I’m so glad I went on it and was able to really put my mental health back together in that time. It is exactly what I needed! Good luck!",,12ug2cs

Talk to doc about your concerns and they can help make a decision WITH you.",seeingsmells,12ug2cs

Adhd, bpd, bipolar, and depression all have similar and same diagnosis in their clusters and they are comorbid a lot so they sometimes get mixed up. 

I was originally diagnosed with bipolar 2 but due to my antidepressants causing my minor depressive episodes to look like prolonged majors, these was changed after removal of ssri’s(my personal experience not everyone’s)

Insurance will require therapist to diagnose in order to get paid out, depending on the type of visit you had with your doctor if they are your GM they may have coded the visit that triggered insurance to require diagnosis. You can definitely ask either the doctors office or the insurance about that visit, with the new laws they actually have to tell you now if you do ask.

0,"The weird thing about it is I felt the exact same when my therapist finally understood why I thought I had bpd, and wants to explore it. While it's not an official diagnosis since both my psychiatrist and my therapist work towards healing symptoms rather than diagnosis.

My therapist has coined BPD as an ""attachment disorder."" Man, if that didn't sound so much more peaceful than borderline personality disorder (No shame, but it was like a weight lifted off of me.) 

I've had the same idea of BPD of being a monster, and I think that caused a lot of internal conflict. However, having some sort of ground baseline to my symptoms made so much more sense and led me to join these subreddits and it's healing that internal conflict everyday. Thats why I respond to so many people, it's helping me help people. 

If you need to find a new therapist, psychiatrist I found mine on [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) (You can reach out via email and so you don't have to call random places. I reached out to around 7-8 therapist in a matter of 30 minutes, heard back from one the next day, scheduled my appointment the next day, and the following day I was in a telehealth appointment.) I have to say psychology today is a golden shovel into finding providers. (It lets you search for psychiatrists, therapists, and counselors.)

Personally, the rage is my biggest issue and something that is treated almost instantly by cannabis use. I am currently in talk therapy (can’t afford DBT nor is it widely available in my area) and do not currently use pharmaceuticals. It certainly doesn’t treat all of my symptoms but I treat it as my saving grace. The only negative that I’ve noticed is this: when I get manic (I have bipolar along with BPD), I convince myself that I have to control every single little tiny thing in my life. In doing so, I’ll often go without cannabis, citing reasons like “I don’t need any substances to make me feel better because I feel just fine on my own!” We all know that’s just a part of the cycle and I definitely wouldn’t blame cannabis for that.

I don't have any experience with drug use. However, I'm studying Medicine (Still fairly new at it though) and suffer from Borderline myself. Drug Use is not a good way to cope with a mental disorder. Cannabis is far from the most damaging drug, but it makes you ""lazy"" and it builds up in your system. This means you slowly become more and more ""lazy"" as it builds up in your tissue (You won't necessary notice) and get more depend on it.
I know it is terrible having these ""rages"" as I have experienced them myself. But drugs and especially things not coming from a medical professional is a bad idea. Some drugs may interfere with each other and cause problems like one drug not working at all or working more than intended.

Therapy is best way to go. And drug use will only make therapy less effective, since you aren't in a state to tackle your trauma head on.

Sorry if I offended. 

EDIT: I'm not a medical professional (Yet), so I'm just telling what I have been taught uptill now. Also, I'm not claiming that the ""lazy"" or calming effect of cannabis can't be useful to some, however it can also hurt more than it helps.

4,"I have been on Cymbalta for almost a month now as well, on 30mg. Hold on tight and never skip a dosage 'cause this baby is going to test you!⚠The first week was bumpier, as I had all sorts of mood swings to their extremes and I was feeling confused, out of nowhere, extreme nausea around afternoon, feeling sleepy all day followed by disrupted sleep (I just take Xanax whenever that happens and go back to sleep), decreased appetite, non existent libido and inability to reach and maintain an orgasm and I was sick for half a month, straight, without getting any better.On day 12 onwards, I started being jittery, always on edge, having paranoid episodes, being overwhelmed by a feeling of impending doom and being enraged and irritable all the time. However, the more the days pass, the less frequent these instances are. I now have more energy and I am more elevated to wake up in the morning and plan my day ahead, I can reach an orgasm 5 out of 10 times, I got an increased appetite and sex drive, I wake up less frequently during the night, I am more energetic throughout the day and the nausea is very much gone (also, never take your pill on an empty stomach, eating a slice of cheese or something fatty, helps with the nausea). I've also found that it has helped with my IBS and that I dissociate less (which is a big issue for me) and can maintain my focus more, something I haven't been able to do for years.From my understanding, some research I have done on the internet and also having been on an SSRI in the past, SNRIs are much more potent than SSRIs and generally don't take as long to kick in, but do put you through a hellride when you are starting them, and absolute hell when you are stopping them. Btw **always tapper off**, **NEVER stop taking them cold turkey**.From what I can say is that:

1. Make sure you get a sedative/anxiolytic/beta blocker along your SNRI to counteract the sudden elations and help with the sleep.
2. If you are like me, and have predominant aggressive traits and anger issues, take and mood-stabilizer or antipsychotic along your anti-depressant to avoid aggravation.
3. You can always add some Wellbutrin if you are experiencing sexual dysfunction, with the guidance of your psychiatrist
4. Do not mix any other substances with your psychotropic drug as you risk mania, psychosis and something called [Serotonin Syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/serotonin-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354758).

There's two helpful groups about Cymbalta one here, on Reddit r/cymbalta and two on facebook.

This gives me.hope that the efforts I'm making right now might actually lead me and my son to a better quality of life, and aren't me just wasting my twenties away.

I have a job interview today in like an hour. I'm nervous, I havent been in the game for a minute. If they hire me I'll be making ten dollars hourly! Lol.  Because of my BPD and having a toddler I haven't worked in nearly two years. My ex partner worked and I stayed home with the baby. So my people skills suck. But I need the income. 

I'm also a sophomore studying psychology and hope to get my bachelor's. Maybe then I'll be  able to get a better job that I actually like someday soon. 

BPD sure does make it difficult to achieve and maintain long term goals. But you're proof that it is possible for someone with bpd to experience success.

It's been hard to keep going to school while having BPD. I  struggled through the first two years because of relationship issues  that had a big impact on my studies and moving around a lot, general confusion about what I wanted to major in. So I acquired 2 years worth of credits over the span of like 6 years. I could never decide what I wanted to do and was constantly changing my major.  However, I've been sticking to psychology this time around, it's the only subject I am passionate about. 

But even making 40k-60k a year would be a huge step up from where I'm at now. I can't even visualize myself making 6 digits a year! Yet you're a living example that those of us with bpd can do it! I bet it feels unreal!

0,"(Coming from somebody who has major depressive disorder + borderline + mild anxiety and is a pharmacy technician studying to become a pharmacist)

Trazodone was my first sleep aid and I DEF felt the same way. Once it knocked me out, I was out and it took forever to recover. It's kinda weird b/c it can also be used as an appetite stabilizer. I eventually ended up on Seroquel (Quentapine Furmate) as my sleep aid. Seroquel doubles as a mood stabilizer and anxiety reducer (tho personally I don't feel those effects)

Anxiety wise I started out on Ativan (Lorazepam) and it tends to be the weakest of the ""big three"" (i.e. Klonopin/Clonazepam, Ativan/Lorazepam, or Xanax/Alprazolam). Currently I'm on a low dose of Klonopin and the only thing I notice is that if I take my anxiety meds and sleep aids together; I go to sleep really quickly and stay asleep for more than 8 hours. 

For depression there are A LOT of amazing articles by Pharmacists and Doctors on how anti-depressants work, but also about how we're not entirely sure how/why they work. There are mainly two types of anti-depressants that docs will prescribe. SSRIs and SNRIs. From an Anatomy and Physiology perspective think about it as there are docks where boats can land. But if a boat is already in the dock, another boat can't occupy that space.

So, SSRIs (Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitor) will occupy the space where serotonin will be reaborbed and therefore no longer be acting on the brain. SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine-Reuptake-Inhibitors) act on both serotonin and norepinephrine.

1,"I'm on 200mg Zoloft and in the beginning it helped a lot with my inactivity. I also started to have a much faster thought process and I don't feel laziness when writing or speaking anymore. 

I started with a lower dose but kept increasing due to advising of my psychiatrist and because I felt the effects worn-out. I'm now on maximum dose (200mg/daily) and although the effects are nowhere as near as those I had in the beginning, I still believe I'm much better than when I was without them.

Zoloft usually helps dealing with depression, OCD, social anxiety, etc.. and medication usually helps to cope with these symptoms that are comorbid to BPD. Borderline Personality Disorder can only have remission phases but with the comorbid symptoms attenuated, those phases of remission last longer.. so yeah, Zoloft (sertraline) can help cope with BPD.",the-downward-spiral,jvp2qh

0,"I'm diagnosed with BPD, Depression/anxiety, and ADHD. I don't take Adderall specifically but I do take stimulants. Everyone is different so take my experience with a grain of salt, but when I first started them, I went from 0.02 GPA points from failing out of university to making the dean's list the next semester. They changed my life.

&#x200B;

I think the stimulants helped me feel less horrible about myself since I could actually focus and accomplish (most of) the things I wanted to. The motivation helps you build self-esteem which helps with the negative self-talk brought on by BPD and Depression. I find that I'm also much more capable of self-care when I take stimulants, because my executive functioning skills are pretty crap without them. As a side bonus, you can absolutely feel a little less depressed when taking them and they make it easier to get out of bed/work out/etc.

The downsides: you can feel really depressed/emotionally raw on days you don't take your stimulants. It's manageable, but you need to be aware. Similarly, I can be more quick to anger when I do take them. I generally have a more flat affect with them, but I can go from 0 to 60 pretty quickly if I'm not careful. Oh and the general downsides of stimulants apply here too. Be sure to make sure you're not clenching your jaw all day if you do talk them! :P",TemporaryIntern,owj3h5
