0,"Started drinking at twelve, pothead by fifteen, heavy meth user by nineteen, battled with benzo addiction through my twenties, kicked that, got into pain pills later in my twenties, now I've been addicted to kratom for five years. Can't function without. I still take meth occasionally. I'm able to keep it under control. On the bright side of things, I'm no longer drinking daily. Maybe two or three times a year. I want to get off kratom. Oh and I don't smoke weed anymore.

I guess all I ever wanted was to feel something...",mynongenericusername,1bktkzg
1,"My official diagnosis is bipolar 1 with borderline tendencies, so I'm not ""true"" borderline, but I can relate to the addiction issues. 

I used drugs heavily from 18 to 23, when I was finally forced to get clean. Weed and alcohol were daily necessities, and I did whatever other drugs I could get whenever I could get them. There was a period where I did a lot of psychedelics in a very casual manner, and there was a period where I did a lot of coke and abused adderall and vyvanse.

When I stopped doing drugs, my addiction manifested in other ways. Men became my new drug and I used them a lot and often.

When I was 25, I got into a relationship with someone who had also had a drug problem. We relapsed BAD when I was 26. We went from complete abstinence to crippling heroin addiction in a matter of days. I know that sounds ridiculous, but as soon as we started using again, we were using multiple times a day every day. I ended up in rehab over a year later (after overdosing at my parents house). 

I've been clean from drugs and alcohol since 2020, but my addiction still finds ways to mess up my life (big shopping problem).",ChaosGoblinn,1bktkzg
2,"The best thing I've found with this is 
Making a routine",changeofheart999,1bktkzg
3,My borderline tendencies also started at 10-12 during puberty. Was also a pothead starting at 16 and of course escalated and have done pretty much everything. At one point I was drinking an entire bottle of vodka every day. I’m clean now. The process of getting clean sucks but it’s the best thing you could ever do for yourself.,Paulett21,1bktkzg
4,"Definitely not the only one, addictive behavior and substance abuse is tied to BPD a lot of the time. I have been using pot daily since I was 17 basically (33 now), drinking was a huge issue for me in my teens and 20s. It was just self medicating really to try and deal with the suicidal tendencies and depression/anxiety. 

I have recently started the journey of weening off of pot which has been a bit of a struggle and has sent me into a depression. I guess that was to he expected after all this time leaning on it. Everyone copes differently but I would like to start a family so this is a necessary change for me.",Krombopulos-Dani,1bktkzg
5,"I've always had a problem with alcohol, basically since I was in high school, and there were times where I literally drank every day. 
Three years ago I got into the rave scene and I opened the Pandora's box, I tried cocaine, speed, ketamine, mephe, crack, popper, mdma and out of all of this shit I developed an addiction to cocaine.
It's okay to control if I don't drink alcohol, but it's hard to control myself when I'm having one of those ""I'm feeling empty"" episodes.",ataryes,1bktkzg
6,"You’re not. Actually, I think you’re doing way better than you give your credit for. 

Personally, I don’t consider the ZaZa a drug. I smoke a good amount everyday and it helps me tremendously with BPD paranoia, and anger. Just takes the edge off.

I’m 32 and started smoking Zaza at 13. I don’t drink alcohol though that stuff is poison and false happiness. 

BPD and addictive behavior are related. I was a legit coke addict in 9th-11th grade high school. Got clean and sober for seven years and relapsed extremely hard. Like finishing eight ball in 12 hours hard. Got clean again.

I moved out of state and where I live now there’s MDMA everywhere and it’s extremely cheap. So now I’m currently getting clean from MDMA because I was a hard-core user for a year and a half. MDMA floods your body with serotonin from your brain. If you do too much, you have zero happy juice in your head. normal dose is three pills. I was taking 12 at a time multiple times throughout a bender 

I would go on 4 to 5 days, hard-core benders, where I didn’t eat, sleep, or hydrate. I look like a holocaust survivor six months ago. 

Yes, BPD I think, gives you a proclivity for addiction, especially uppers. 

A Saab story is not my intention.  But I wanna put things in perspective for you. You’re doing so much better than you think because it can get so much worse.",Omni_Tsar,1bktkzg

0,"I kicked my addiction back in October, which before I was going through about 3-4 grams a week (getting it pushed on me by abusive ex, but that parts a different story). When drinking, it kinda just woke me up. Otherwise, it gave me some energy, similar to how caffeine affects neurotypicals.

Edit: whole lot of anxiety sometimes, depending on the batch",AMPSpace,158nfci
1,"It varies, but I definitely understand what you’re saying. I’m actually about to do coke right now, by sheer coincidence, cause it’s not a drug I seek out myself.


I have some other weird drug reactions too. Like MDMA gives me hallucinations and sometimes makes me feel depressed immediately after taking it. Only acid and I are pretty much always good.",Ur1950sHousewine,158nfci
2,"First time I tried it I was around 19. I got the results I expected, felt some type of euphoric energy (the rush?), things were sped up, it was positive. It was never that good ever again. 

Over the next 20 yrs, maybe I did it another 40 times? I don't know. Maybe 5% of the time, I felt that euphoric rush but it's only for the first 4 seconds & it wouldn't repeat. So doing more of it that night was pointless. So it was very rare I got that rush & it was extremely short lived. 

Definitely not a drug worth doing, I hope to never do it again. It just has no value to me.",Piconaught,158nfci
3,"Cocaine doesn't nothing for me. And, Vicodin and Tramadal do nothing for me. I'm weird that way. I was glad about the cocaine as I couldn't afford it at the time. Now, I have been clean and sober for 23 years.",desertrosebhc,158nfci

10,"I don’t always get the textbook result. Sometimes I used to get anxious and it didn’t make me feel any less hungry or sleepy, for example. I don’t know how much you are using so it’s hard to answer your question. In my experience it’s not necessarily about the amount, I think it’s more related to the quality of the product. Quitting cocaine was one of the best things I’ve done tho, the “hangover” would mess up my brain gravely (I’m bipolar 2 so I struggle with major depressive episodes)",b1u3brdm,158nfci
11,"Haven't done cocaine for about a year now, but my experience was usually the same every time. The first line I would have would cause me to have anxiety. After about half an hour, the anxiety would usually go, and I'd then do a second line. The more I had, the less anxious I got, and I got more of a buzz. My issue was that at the end of the night, when all my friends would stop, I'd want to carry on. I'd keep saying that I'd have 1 more last line, but I'd keep repeating it. It either got to the point where everyone else is asleep, but I'm still buzzing, or I'd run out and then be really depressed. I also found that for the next week after my mood was really low. That's part of the reason I don't do it anymore.",mk2polo96,158nfci
12,"Coke these days is relatively dirty, you’re probably just doing speed tbh",shmulez,158nfci
13,Drugs effect everyone differently. If it’s not a pleasurable experience for you I wouldn’t recommend to keep on doing it bc you’ll likely get addicted. Another thing with coke and most drugs is your mindstate affects how the drug affects you.,AdvancedCouple843,158nfci
14,"I've never had anything from coke, in fact I didn't really bother with it in my life. Literally as OP described,  just sort of heart beating faster than usual and more awake, more energies . It feel like chugging down 2/3 redbull for me. 
Nothing more than that, no euphoria,  but then side effects the next day.
 I do get quite strong effect from weed though.  Before I was functioning on it everyday, never knew what anxhiety and paranoia from weed were, I was smoking it like cigarettes,  I would work with no issues on it! 
Then I had a 2 years break from it (because of pregnancy and breastfeeding), and when I got back to it , I noticed that it's so strong for me at the moment, I can'tabsolutely function on it anymore. Literally a few puff knock me out and too many puff cab get me paranoid, anxhious and can even get me delusions.  
I switched to cbd weed and I would sprinkle a little bit of thc on it but again, this is like an evening treat.
 I do use sometimes shrooms and lsd and even with those I get little effect unless I get on higher doses.",Emergency_Addition98,158nfci
15,I honestly cannot stand doing coke. I’ve never had someone else they didn’t care for it.,Sexy-para743,158nfci
16,"Coke isn’t supposed to do anything more than that don’t worry. When there’s a lot of amphetamines in it it makes ppl very talkative and happy to be there, hence the ""rush"" feeling",randomthembo,158nfci
17,"I went on a bender last year and was doing about an 8-ball per two days. Quality is atrocious and risky with the cuts. Getting clean and decent coke that makes you feel “rush” is almost impossible. Be careful and get test kits if you can, fentanyl is no joke.",,158nfci

28,I need that in my life lmao,susabb,158nfci
29,Yeah I have to add one exception: back home in CA I tried “XTC” for the first time. It was a gross home-filled pellet containing something brown and I felt exactly like I did after the one and only time in my life that I’ve used meth. I never count that experience though because when I tried actual XTC in Europe I realized that there was nothing MDMA about whatever the fuck they were peddling in my neighborhood back home.,Ur1950sHousewine,158nfci
30,"It's crazy how many drugs there are lmfao. It reminds me of bath salts and all the bath salt copies that have popped up ever since their creation. This random chemical that keeps getting tweaked just enough so it's not illegal and can be found in public. I wish the government would do more in depth research on these chemicals and their effects. Maybe one day they'll be able to find something that can benefit society, kinda like how ketamine and shrooms have in recent history.",susabb,158nfci
31,Oh but what exactly do they mean by bath salts? I remember spice being a really bad thing like 10 years ago :/. I use some analogs like 1P-LSD but it’s always good to be cautious and steer clear of newly developed designer drugs.,Ur1950sHousewine,158nfci

1,I remember the first time i was suicidal was when i was around 7 or 8 years old. i’ve never lived my life where suicide wasn’t hanging around in my head somewhere.,Jellyrose-the-author,13zbq6j
2,Mine were crazy intense when I had them. It's the most backwards coping mechanism. I'm really thankful they're gone mostly. I almost feel like a recovered drug addict.,LacusLacuna,13zbq6j
3,"I had SI when I was 12yo, over something trivial ... I thought I lost the house keys and I was going to be punished. That was decades ago. Recently, I heard from a psychiatrist that it can contribute to feeling in control of a situation that feels helpless. It used to help me cope, or keep me grounded during times of conflict and spiralling negativity   
  
In the last few years my SI has increased but it's grown from imagining myself getting run over, to wishing I had a gun, to feeling relief from the idea I could bash my own brains out. Time passed and the thoughts escalated/shifted to active planning — I listed the people to address in a note, what I would write, realising I have everything I need to go through with it thoroughly so there won't be a need for a second attempt. the logistics and possible location(s) thought out.  
  
For me, the pattern of SI is so ingrained and destructive. It was a helpful tool a long time ago, so it became addictive because I had a lot of conflict. I still have conflict now, but I don't want to keep using SI to get me through coz it's a slippery slope, and if I can keep fighting I could have a decent future.   

I hope we can all find more helpful tools to deal with our distress",lilbitofvitriol,13zbq6j
4,"Not sure about liking it, but as pwBPD we do find instability familiar and therefore more comfortable even if we feel horrible. Also Marsha Linehan said that thinking about suicide does calm suicidal people down, so there's that.",justagirlinterrupted,13zbq6j
5,"Yes, overthinking is a symptom for us BPD folx. 

As self-soothing as suicide/death/not existing equating to a cease in suffering is, fixating on death is dangerous. Our thoughts shape our reality, and the more we overthink, our thoughts become our lived reality. Thoughts are energy, which can be scientifically measured. What kind of energy do we want powering our bodies? 

Personally, being in my 30s and not knowing my diagnosis until now, I try and talk myself into going through with suicide during lows because the thought patterns are so engrained in my neural pathways from idealizing death since 7yo. However, with neural plasticity and exercise when suicidal thoughts occur (and prayer even if the words feel inauthentic), keeps the light and hope for a better future. 

If we are at the point where we want to change and live healthy, quality lives (we deserve to be content and consistent), we must validate the inner-self with compassion (“we are suffering, it’s going to be okay, I am loved and not alone”) and redirect our thoughts and actions to a healthy skill (deep focused breathing, practicing a DBT exercise) to get us away from the triggering stimuli. 

Again, we deserve to be without these thoughts as an escape mechanism. These thoughts will destroy the sanity we have.",Plenty_Lavishness308,13zbq6j

It's so twisted, i feel so ashamed and feel hesitant to open up to people around me. I know not everyone is equipped to handle the extreme emotions that come with BPD.  

but when I have tried to be honest about what I'm struggling with, some people I relied on have been dismissive or implied I was making empty threats about harming myself. It contributes to the feeling that my existence is meaningless",lilbitofvitriol,13zbq6j

32,"Thank you!! Well first of all, I got a blood clot in my shoulder which was an all round fun time 🙃 had to get emergency surgery to have it removed and the surgeon lectured me about smoking which scared me. Since I dont really enjoy smoking weed without tobacco, it kind of came naturally. Once I was over the nicotine cravings it was more a matter of doing activities to distract myself with and trying not to spend so much time alone which was when I would smoke. I will say I've started going out again and drinking a bit more (I had stopped for about 10ish years). But for me drinking has never really been an addiction, I only really stopped because I couldn't afford to drink and smoke. 
The things I found helpful for distracting myself are, like I said, the gym, and also spending more time outdoors, seeing friends, being around people who don't smoke or asking friends who do if we can do something else. They were all very happy to do this and I kind of set off a bit of a chain reaction of people cutting down/quitting because we were doing other kinds of activities.

As most anecdotal experiences, YMMV.",mouse_11,15vo9nq
3,"Coming from someone with BPD that abused most of the popular drugs, it would be best to stay away from them.

That being said, if you do decide you want to try something, go with psychedelics and don't combine them with weed. Make sure you don't have a history of schizophrenia in your family. Also don't trip with many people, ideally you want one person you trust with you. 

I advise you to stay away from MDMA (exctasy). It has one of the nicest highs if not the nicest, but that will probably make you want to do it again and again; doing that will affect your serotonin levels permanently and that will increase the negative effects of BPD (especially depression). Trust me on this one, out of all of them, I regret abusing MDMA the most.

Speed (amphetamine) is also bad. High abuse potential, no sleep, it has the potential to cause an eating disorder if you don't have one already and if you do, it can make it worse. If you decide to try it, always limit yourself to one evening (easier said than done), as long as you don't stay awake for more than one night, it is relatively safe.

Meth is just speed on steroids, avoid it at all costs. There's no shortage of meth head videos on the internet that will make the argument for me.

Also avoid heroin (or any opioids), like MDMA, it has a very nice high for someone with BPD and I don't think I need to tell anyone what happens if you develop an addiction to it. Not to mention the risk of getting fentanyl and overdosing.

Cocaine is not worth it at all, too expensive for a high that is in my opinion worse than the one you get from speed.

Benzos are again not worth it, you are better of smoking weed. They can accentuate depression.

Ketamine can be therapeutic if you use it for that purpose and is generally pretty safe for trying. I personally don't like it that much because it makes me dizzy in a weird way. Not the most social drug although many would disagree.

Stay away from delirants and research chemicals.

Pretty much this was my experience with them, I tried other things, but I don't think they are worth mentioning and even less worth trying. 

**It is very hard for me right now not to use anything, I'm not addicted to a specific drug, but I am addicted to getting high. My mental health is worse because of them and I got to the point where I don't even enjoy being high anymore, but I still do it. So it is better that you stay away from them.** 

**If you do want to try something, first of all buy a testing kit to make sure you have the right substance and practice harm reduction. A great resource for that is** [**Psychonautwiki**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) **where you can find pretty much all you need to know including interactions, subjective effects, objective effects, dosage, history, duration etc.**

18,"Cocaine releases huge amounts of dopamine when consumed, hence why it has such a short, intense, euphoric high.

Your brain struggles to produce dopamine *after* the comedown as well, which causes you to want to use again & again. 

I was ok doing it when I drank to balance each other out.. but the few times I did cocaine w/o drinking, I was paranoid as fuck, really depressed, anxious, guilt ridden, i wasn't a fun time to be around once the comedown started.

I never realized how alcohol exacerbated all of my symptoms until I stopped drinking. I come from a family of addicts/alcoholics, it was and still is very normalized in my family...

I was arrested at least 12 times in 2016 alone. The last arrest was the felony.. getting picked up for stupid misdemeanors and bailing out immediately taught me nothing. I didn't stop until I *forced* myself to stop by making an idiotic decision, thinking I wouldn't get caught & getting arrested on that felony. Hindsight is 20/20. That felony saved my life. I wouldn't be here if I didn't end up where I did. 

If you've been drinking for an extended period of time, be careful detoxing. Don't be afraid to reach out for help. I spent many years in that cycle & I let it destroy me. I'm one of the lucky ones that was able to make it to the other side of that situation.. *many don't.* 

Idk how old you are. But one day you will get tired of the bullshit. I can tell by the fact that you acknowledge that your drinking is becoming a problem. Most addicts/alcoholics refuse to acknowledge that, they're in denial, because they don't *want* to stop. 

I did my fair share of moronic shit while drunk. I was arrested many times for things I could have avoided. One time I decided to interfere with an arrest (my boyfriend at the time) caught 3 charges that day.. disorderly conduct, resisting arrest & fleeing/eluding. Decided to slip the cuffs in the back of the car, pulled one hand out, opened the door from the outside & took off.. One of my more embarrassing arrests.. didn't make it far. didnt even know why I was in jail when I woke up. I still didn't stop after that. I had been mentally checked out & in active psychosis for months before that arrest. Alcohol (medication & drugs) played a huge role in that.

2,"Sudden explosive anger like that is just one symptom and nowhere near enough info to even begin to guess what his possible diagnosis could be. Personality disorders involve more complex patterns of behavior over years than just one particular trait, so you'd need to look at more of his history. He would have had certain issues his entire adult life. It's possible he's always had problems, but you missed the signs years ago?

I'm a little confused what you mean that it developed 'all of a sudden slowly'. You mean, 10 yrs ago, out of nowhere, he started acting differently? Then it slowly got worse over those years? I'd say it depends a bit on old he is and how well you actually know him. For example, if he's 60 and there was truly never any sign of him ever having any type of issue until he was 50, I'd guess it's probably *not* a personality disorder. But, some people are able to keep things hidden for years or it goes back to whether or not you noticed the signs. 

When it comes to the money thing, my first guess would be drug use but could also be a gambling problem. Either one can make mood issues worse & harder to control/hide. People with BPD often struggle with addictive, reckless/dangerous, self-destructive behavior like that but that's certainly not limited to people with personality disorders. 

My father had BPD and was a chain-smoking alcoholic, compulsive gambler, chronic cheater & extreme hoarder. I also have BPD, used all sorts of random drugs, had a drinking problem in my teens/20s, was a chain smoker, used to shoplift & had a sex & love 'addiction'.

5,"I've smoked cigarettes and got myself drunk a few times but I've surprisingly been able to go weeks clean from that. However since I don't really get addicted to those, I've gotten around cutting, which... yeah, is my addiction.",EmoComrade1999,17todbt
6,"I've never been addicted to anything to the point I needed help (only thing I've done frequently is smoke but I mainly do a cigarette per day after dinner as part of my routine in unwinding I guess, and I've quit before for months or a year on a whim until I got in the mood for it again). I also sometimes smoke weed about a couple times a week.

I have done multiple drugs in my life and do drink from time to time. I even had a benzos period (prescribed) that was more or less not a problem.

I do have a kind of substance abuse problem though, which is that in periods of stress I end up overusing whatever substance Im more into at that time. Usually it culminates in a one off event that goes a bit too far for my liking and then I drop whatever substance it is for the forseeable future. But it doesn't have to be a substance honestly, it could be sex, shopping, sugar (well I guess thats also a substance), s/h, whatever.

So I'd say I dont have the propensity for addiction but I have impulse control problems. I do my best to contain them without demonising the substances because I feel like making a substance into a ""taboo"" in your head makes things worse somehow. 
But idk.

Currently my issue is impulse shopping honestly and it's real trouble. My savings are suffering badly 😭 Somehow maybe because it feels more innocent on the surface I have trouble getting rid of it!",BlanKatt,17todbt

But I don't do mushrooms often bc it's not covered by insurance while the ketamine is. I still don't drink, it doesn't mix well with my meds and I get really sick.

9,"i’m a stoner, i’ve smoked weed every day for nearly 2 years. am i addicted, yeah but obviously not the same sort of addiction as something chemically addicting. i don’t personally see a problem with smoking every day, it doesn’t affect my day-to-day life, my school, my work, or my relationships. to me, i view it as medicine almost like taking an anti-depressant every day. it clears my head, gets rid of my anxiety, makes me more optimistic and happy to be around, etc. 

i drink only on occasion. maybe once every month or two. my parents were/are still alcoholics so i think my subconscious doesn’t let me get too invested in alcohol because of that. i still enjoy drinking when i do it, but i definitely don’t gravitate towards it regularly. 

i’ve never done any other type of drug. i don’t plan to try anything else in my life except for i eventually i would like to try shrooms, acid, and molly atleast once before i die.  

i was a nicotine addict (vaping) for about 6 years. i just recently quit, today i am 120 days clean from nicotine. i feel a million times better and i don’t plan to ever use nicotine again. i still get cravings for it every once in a while, and that’s a sign to me to not indulge ever again. 

overall i would say i have an addictive personality like many of us here but i focus all of my addiction into weed, and i’m honestly okay with that. the only thing that concerns me is my lung health one day, so eventually i’ll switch over to dry herb vaping/edibles to continue my habit in a healthier way.",ham_alamadingdong,17todbt
10,"I wouldn’t drink too often but I always overdid alcohol when I did drink. I loved being drunk and not dealing with my brain and I would make a complete ass of myself every time. I also suffer migraines and eating disorder so after drinking way more than I should, I’d vomit and develop terrible migraines. 
I didn’t register it as a problem because TV always shows that as the norm for drinking and my friends got drunk too. 
But at some point late last year I realised alcohol just doesn’t suit me. Now I almost never drink and when I do I simply do not go beyond one drink. If I’m feeling even a little uncomfortable from the drink, I stop. And I’ve developed a slight mental block towards alcohol too so I develop headaches very quickly when I drink now. 
But yeah I’m almost completely sober now because I finally accepted alcohol was an unhealthy coping strategy and an attempt for me to Fit In. 
And it was doing the opposite for me anyway. I didn’t fit in while drunk I just looked like a fool. 

Im glad I didn’t keep drinking unhealthy amounts because I’m so much more comfortable with myself and my body by being strict with my alcohol intake now. 

It’s helped me feel more self assured especially because I’m not doing something just to fit in with other people. I’m respecting myself. 

And lucky for me the friends I have now all don’t drink. One is a recovered alcoholic and doesn’t touch alcohol anymore. One is uncomfortable with alcohol and very rarely drinks. Even when she does it’s only one drink and not more. 
My partner also avoids alcohol for the most part and drinks very rarely. 
So all our activities are not alcohol centred and we actually get to do fun things like go book shopping together or watching a movie together instead of just drinking when we hang out.

44,"When I was younger (early 20s) the pressure of adulthoods and being all alone to deal with them completely sent me over the edge. I wasn’t addicted to one drug, but I was addicted to getting high. i was addicted to escaping my pain and reality and took mostly uppers and psychedelics, but did downers if it’s all that was available. I was broke at this point and barely working, if at all, so basically I payed for gas in my car and took whatever drugs I could find along the journeys. I was an attractive young girl who was mostly invited to parties to help the ratio and given drugs in hopes id be “easy” so for the most part I wasn’t exposed to anything too crazy and mostly just partied at night. 

I will say I did start out with alcohol but quickly turned to other things when the alcohol made keeping a job impossible. Weed is my “choice” and I am very much addicted to it. It’s the only medicine that gets me by and I work on my relationship with it to make sure it stays my medicine, but I’m sure I sneak enabling factors in there. I would love to go back to acid or shroom use tho because I felt most enlightened and like I knew myself more and what I wanted when i did them.. which is kinda subjectively the point of them.

45,"Started smoking weed when I was 19 then I started working at a restaurant a few months later that had rampant drug use. I’m talking managers doing coke in their office. I got wrapped up in that and started doing blow. My at the time boyfriend and I would go on binges lasting up to 3 days. We did that for almost a year until I realized I needed to stop. I was ruining myself financially. It was actually quite easy to stop doing cocaine although I still occasionally get cravings when someone mentions it. I’ve only done two binges since quitting six years ago. Later I did make the connection of how cocaine made me feel calm compared to seeing my ex pace and talk nonstop. A year ago I got diagnosed with ADHD so it makes sense. A few months ago I kissed someone and could taste the blow on them, I’m pretty proud of myself that I didn’t ask for any, I am medicated for adhd now though so that probably made a difference.

Weed on the other hand… I struggle with that. I smoked everyday for about three years and then I began trying to quit. I’ll get a few months off and then go right back. And once I start I can’t stop. I can’t just casually partake in it every once in awhile. I did quit for about a year but used delta 8 occasionally in that time. The only way I can quit is when I have no desire to smoke. It’s happened about three times where I’ll have a stash but I just don’t want to smoke. It feels like a chore to smoke and the I’m able to easily stop. What’s hard is it helps me in some ways like with insomnia or with my chronic pain. (And yes I’ve quit for several months and developed good sleep hygiene and I still can’t sleep.) So sometimes I’m just so desperate to sleep that I turn to weed. Weed is so addicting for me. I don’t know why it’s the one drug I’m dependent on.

I have a weird relationship with alcohol. I never drink alone and I don’t ever really seek out drinking however I’m a huge social drinker. If my friends are drinking then I’m definitely drinking. The problem is that when I drink, I drink to get drunk. I binge. I think it has to do with social situations. Usually I’m pretty uptight and never know what to say or I’m too nervous to say something. When I drink alcohol all that social anxiety goes away and I’m able to participate fully.

In high school for a few months I was using an old prescription of pain pills we had lying around the house. If I had a supplier and if they were more affordable I’m sure I would still be doing them. They are my drug of choice. More so than weed. They let me escape all of my thoughts. I’m so grounded when I’m doing them. I had a resource period in the morning, study hall following that, and third I had a ceramics art class. So I would get permission and spend the first two hours of my day completely alone working with clay and then the third period people would join but I’d be in the zone. No thoughts. Just feeling the clay in my hands and creating something. It was truly bliss. Eventually the come downs were pretty bad and I even showed up at work a couple times pretty sick from it. My nose would also itch like crazy and I would get bloody noses from rubbing it. If I was working with clay I couldn’t do that so it was only a problem if I took them at home. Eventually I went through a bad break up and took the rest of them trying to unalive myself. So that’s the end of that chapter in my life.

I’ve tried other drugs but it was just a one or two time thing. I refuse to hallucinogenics now because I’ve had two bad experiences with mushrooms. First time I had ego death and was spiraling because I didn’t know what made me ME. I went from tears of joy to tears of panic and sadness in the flip of a switch. Second time it didn’t last long and wasn’t that bad but I was sooo anxious. I tried blindfolding and listening to soundscapes but I couldn’t get rid of the anxiety. Molly I do like but I’ve never known a supplier. I’m sure if I knew someone who dealt molly that I would do it more often.

I’ve never tried crack, ketamine, meth, dmt, or heroin although I could see myself trying heroin trying to chase the feeling the pills gave me. That’s pretty bad to say because I know the damage heroin does and how addictive it is but depending on my frame of mind I think I would give in. I try to stay away from anyone who uses drugs besides weed and alcohol. I’ve since found a fantastic friend group who are all pretty straight edge. Some use cbd and delta 8 and they do drink but I’m the only one who smokes actual weed. One friend is completely sober and doesn’t even drink so I can rely on them. I know if I got wrapped up with people who do other drugs that I would get sucked in pretty easily",thunderlightboomzap,17todbt

He also started a lot of cocaine binges by bringing a bit home or asking about it. Then I would binge and buy more for us. I think he did it knowing I would buy more. He also encouraged me getting really really drunk. He’d reassure he would take care of me and feed me shots. Sometimes he would get really pushy trying to get me to take more. I liked it but sometimes it went too far. And he knew I would get really affectionate and do anything he wanted. I moved out in 2020 out of the apartment we lived together in yet still couldn’t give him up. Definitely trauma bonded. I think I finally cut all contact in mid 2021 but we’ve talked a few times since. It was mid 2022 that I started ignoring his calls and texts. He still tries to contact me occasionally, in fact just two months ago.

Probably cause I get rid of the 24/7 anxiety I have when I’m sober which limits me from truly letting go and being myself. Haven’t heard someone else with BPD say that about hard drugs yet, which is why I’m surprised, it’s always something negative. Totally relate to what you said later as well about not wanting to go back to reality and staying in your lil dream world, which I guess is the negative side of these drugs. To answer your question; definitely think it depends on which drug and the amount (+ how much you know your limits and if you can self-discipline).

I always thought I’d be one of those people who would smoke weed forever or do other things forever. finding a very good DBT program and individual therapist has helped me A LOT in this regard. Mostly because I need to relearn healthy coping mechanisms. 

It’s no fun to HAVE to go to AA / NA / MA meetings. It’s wonderful support if you need it...but it sucks being a full blown adult and still dealing with problems this way.

(I know for me I struggle with this because I know I'm A LOT so I try to not overload my husband. I can't expect him to fix everything but I can expect him to listen to me.)

If you have a good relationship with your Mom I would recommend talking to her about it too. Probably after you talk to your partner so you can process your feelings some. That way you can organized and think of some questions you may want to ask her.

Edit to add: There is no ""right way"" to handle or react to this. It's okay to feel what you feel. We are all complex individuals who would react differently. Your feelings, emotions and thoughts are valid.",boundbystitches,us2u0k

Almost a year ago now I slowed down on my durg/alcohol abuse. I was not good mentally and I was partyin all the time. Now i just smoke weed, a lot less. 

It becomes a problem when it becomee your priority. I would call in sick from work to get high. Thats also when my BPD started to act up a lot.

6,"I never really thought I had a problem with drinking, until like a few weeks ago where I started to go on these walks with a bottle of vodka, listening to music for hours. Always came home extremely drunk after 2-4 hours and that is just not okay and safe.

When I think about it, I've always misused alcohol. During highschool I used to bring wine in a sports bottle to school some days and at home (I lived alone from when I was 17) I always had alcohol available and would always drink until I puked at parties. Later when I worked I would use alcohol to be able to sleep a few hours before going to bed. Some days I would drink so much that I was still drunk when I woke up.

I didn't think it was bad.

I still haven't overcome it. I don't go on these walks right now anyway. But it's hard to not drink. My boyfriend has always booze at home, and a lot. He has a right to drink if he wishes to. But It's hard for me to not take some of it.",albinobunny91,rda5gq

It was kind of the same attitude with my anorexia. Even when I was crying in pain, he kind of unsurely/annoyed asked if I want to go to the hospital and I of course say no and he just went on with life until my boss had to step in.

While it is true that the number of people with BPD have a higher likelyhood and rate of substance abuse in statistics, that doesn't mean everyone with BPD takes drugs! It would be the same to say you don't injure yourself, you can't have BPD (or the other way around) just because 14-15% of BPD people do that. Yes it's higher in compairson and it CAN be relevant for a diagnose but that just works when looking at the persone and problems as a whole.  


But it is true that many BPD traits are seen in teenagers and it can be hard to differentiate if it's a case of BPD that stays within that ""typical tennage range"" at a certain age. Also there is early and late breakout of BPD, age could come in there but you are above the age for both types, so that doesn't matter in your case for now.   
While we obviously can't and won't diagnose you, that is already a bad start and base for a therapy. When the therapist makes up wrong facts like this and talkes bullshit, it would not really help with my trust at least. Therefore I say search for another therapist.  
   


To me that sounds equally trustworthy as the one who told me my diagnosis of BPD is wrong because:   
I count everyday things up to a certain number and can't stand certain things like someone turning something around to look at it but not turning it back to it's original point or just turning it further to the original point instead of back. But it's not really disturbing my day to day life or would be noticed by anyone.

First of all the moment a therapist tries to diagnose you, thats a red flag. They are not qualified to do so which is why they are not suppose to. 2nd I am diagnosed BPD I do not abuse drugs or alcohol and I've definitely had symptoms of BPD since 13 years old. 18 is more than old enough to get a proper diagnoses. A therapist more than anyone should know there is a difference between the regular teenage stresses of growing up and a mental illness. Frankly this therapist seems like shes not knowledgable and I would not take any diagnoses seriously from her. If shes a therapist and shes minimizing your experience you should also find a new therapist. Therapists are suppose to validate you and your experience. That's like therapy 101 lol. So unprofessional.",oceansidedrive,j4wkrd
11,"As others have said, there's a percentage at play in the diagnosis. Also, I recently learned there are four subtypes of BPD. You may have only one or some combination of two, three, or all four, but even within those categories, I believe it's a three out of five symptoms type deal.

Find a therapist who specializes in BPD and keeps up to date with the research of you can, and if you can't, find a new therapist anyway because this one is crap. 

I have never abused drugs or alcohol and I have been independently diagnosed by two professionals and confirmed by two more. Your therapist is bad at her job!!",sylvanwhisper,j4wkrd

0,"Honestly it's possible they already know. Open up to him. 
Yes there may be consequences but rip the bandage off sooner rather than it going on until you are found out or confronted.  At least then you hold some of the reigns of how it comes out, when and where etc. You'll hold none if you have a confrontation. 

I think with some people too, especially if they know and understand bpd and addiction they know some of this comes with the territory.

0,"Thanks for posting!! I cannot understand any professional reasoning putting a 3 year old on Ritalin. If anything I would be the most concerned of how that affected your development and mental growth through very important years. I’ve never heard anyone professional or otherwise say ADHD “turns” into anything else, especially Borderline. I understand you can have both ADHD and borderline but each is it’s on diagnosis. They don’t turn into something different. Have you went over the deciding factors of being diagnosed with Borderline with a professional? I would start there. Mood disorders are very tricky to diagnose sometimes. You really have to have someone skilled that has been in the industry. I am now on a combination of drugs that seem to work wonders for my BPD. Prozac, Lexapro, Buspar, Tegretol and vyvanse. It can take awhile to find the right medicine and can be very discouraging. That’s why it’s important to get a great doctor who is ready to ride it out with you until you find the right combination. 
Good for you tapering down. It can be very frustrating getting on and off meds. Withdrawal sucks. I’m still learning everyday about what works and doesn’t. It’s a journey that is very personal to each of us. I wish you all the best in getting stable so you can enjoy life! ❤️",MercyEveryMorning,e7ew8s
1,"I really couldn't say it better than you. My regimen is Lexapro, Elavil, Lamictal, Catapres and Xanax XR. I know the issues with Xanax but sadly I have been on some form of it since I was 15 so 30+ years. At this point the risks of stopping are more than the risks of staying on it especially since I have never abused it. It took a very long time to get the proper diagnosis and it was a battle getting the right med combo for me that treated my BPD but also my OCD but in the end it has been worth it. I still struggle at times but it is so much less so especially with my DBT skills in my pocket. 

I also have never heard of ADHD ""turning into"" anything else either though I have seen it as a primary diagnosis in children who are later evaluated as adults to have Bipolar particularly type 2. It is so hard to diagnose children and teens because they are difficult and unpredictable by nature. It saddens me to hear that some kids are medicated to remove the symptoms of being a child. Conversely I have a dear friend who has been medicated since he was 5 when he presented with his first suicidal ideation and an attempt at age 7.  Psychiatry is still a nascent field and our knowledge of the biology and environmental factors grow so slowly as its stigma as a simple weakness is now understood more. These factors do make it so much more complicated but as you say a very personal journey to each of us.

I told him how the little things kept piling up and made me upset so now I have to get out of the house.

1,"Getting up at about the same time every morning and having a routine helps me a lot. Makes me less prone to act impulsively, especially if I have to go to class or have laundry booked. 

I also try make sure I have stuff to do every day, but not too much so I get overwhelmed and stressed. Exercise is difficult for me to plan, but just getting out of my apartment and going for a walk helps. Nice, clean air and just taking in nature. I live in Sweden so we have a lot of it here. 

Essentially, I try to live as balanced as I can. It might sound boring to many but my brain is always 0-100 so I try to keep it at 30-70 at least.

2,"Before therapy, I started doing basic self-care things like going to bed early, waking up early, doing some yoga, working out, and having a well balanced diet. Those seem like obvious things everyone should do, but for me it gave me a sense of purpose. It helped clear my mind and achieve my goals. I realized it wasn’t enough because even though my symptoms were contained, I was still suffering from severe anxiety and splitting whenever the trigger arose. So all of those things combined with therapy pretty much nearly cured me. I had someone to vent to and talk to that wasn’t going to judge me.

4,"I’m sorry to hear you’ve not been doing so well. It’s a year since I was last hospitalised, here is what has helped for me:  

- Schema Therapy: this has been my holy grail and it’s only been around 9 weeks of weekly sessions. I would definitely recommend researching it or asking your psychiatrist about it. With my experience of DBT, it is more of an instruction manual on how to cope with and safeguard yourself from a fire. For me, Schema is an instruction manual on how to turn the gas off, to extinguish the fire. A lot of experiences in our childhood and how we coped with them become a part of how we cope situations as an adult, a lot of the time manifesting themselves in the form of drug or alcohol addiction. Learning about your specific ‘Schemas’ is incredibly insightful, and has helped me massively in terms of accepting the terrible traumas of the past. Definitely read into it.   

- Expand your support network. Reach out to old friends, family, etc - and talk to them. Open up to them. Arrange to see them and do activities together or even just coffee! Staying sober whilst your husband actively drinks must be really really difficult - so try and foster healthy habits by surrounding yourself with healthy, sober friends.  

- Find an outlet. Drawing classes, singing in a choir, playing golf, sewing, yoga, volunteering at an animal shelter, hiking. Absolutely anything. This also opens opportunities to meet like minded individuals - a healthy social life is so important when suffering from BPD I believe.  

My phone is gonna die soon, but here are just a few ideas. Wishing you an upward journey in your recovery. Lots of love.",frickened,dgu2bb

2,"My medical marijuana card has changed my life for the better. I’d like to get to a point where I don’t use it as often, but for now, it’s helped me cope with my BPD diagnosis tremendously.

It brings my intense feelings and emotions down to a neutral level. If I’m really down or sad, it dulls it a bit so it’s not as painful or overwhelming. It really helps to keep me from being overstimulated or agitated. 

It also helps me sleep, because if I don’t sleep well, I’m 2x as likely to have an episode. And it helps me eat! I can’t eat because medicine I take severely suppresses your appetite. Or even when I’m in a depressive episode and I can’t eat, it makes me have an appetite again so I can nourish my body.

It’s helped me deal with the pain so much I can’t even believe it. For me, it HAS to be indica. My body does not like sativa (it makes me anxious). Indica relaxes me and has changed my life for the better while I figure out my way through this.",eil15ata5n,1brexfe
3,"Im addicted to cannabis. I’m in a program to quit,

At the same time, this addiction probably saved my life. I had previously fallen into a pill addiction which could have gone a lot farther… but I found weed instead. Weed kind of saved me from the harder stuff. 

All psychiatrists agree that I should stop. However, they understand that weed can be a coping tool for me.. sometimes it’s between self harming/exploding or going to smoke weed.. Weed is the safer choice. 

I am in an addiction program to stop smoking eventually. But because it’s a coping mechanism, I can’t truly stop until I find other coping mechanisms. 

At least I understand the situation and accept it. And you know what? I’m doing well with the smoking!.. I’ve actually cut back a lot because I’ve been doing a lot of work trying to find other coping strats. Proud of me lol. I could be on the streets, i could be dead, i could be so much worse.. but i’m still here trying.

Edit; I forgot that I also smoke weed for health stuff! Crohns disease, PCOS, back injury. I never take pain meds because of my history of pill abuse, so weed had been a saviour in this sense. When I eventually tackle this addiction of smoking weed, I will probably still take THC&CBD supplements for all my health stuff.

4,"Bruh I'm so tired I thought this said ""BPD and cannibals""",psychxticrose,1brexfe
5,"Weed helped me until it didn’t. 

I think it can definitely be helpful for some people, but you have to be very honest with yourself about how and why you are using it. 

It made it easier for me to dissociate from things, which at first felt like I was managing my symptoms better, but ended up causing me a lot of memory issues and I ended up using it as a crutch to avoid facing my symptoms head on. It also made it much easier for people to take advantage of me because I didn’t care as much about it. 

After a while it just made me anxious, it destroyed what memory I had left, and caused all kinds of issues. I ended up in the ER a few times because it caused my bp to shoot past 200/120 and I’d end up with stroke-like symptoms. 

I feel much better without it now. 

I see it the same way I see any medication: 

There is no medication that is one-size-fits all. Any medication has the potential to cause bad reactions or side effects. It is changing the way your body is functioning, that doesn’t come without risks. If a medication’s side effects outweigh the benefits, then it needs to be adjusted or changed completely. And just because one person reacts well or poorly to it, doesn’t mean that you will react the same way.

If you know you have issues with addiction, I would recommend staying away from it. It may not cause physical withdrawals, but it can be very difficult to stop once you’ve started and it’s very hard to use “under supervision”. Most medical professionals will tell you not to do it at all, and those that give you the okay don’t really have the info needed to ensure you are using it safely and effectively. 

For example:

I take Ativan for panic attacks. It is a controlled substance because it has a high likelihood for abuse. It works exceptionally well for me, it’s like someone just turned the worry off in my brain. Everything feels peaceful and I’m completely at ease. It terrified me the first time, because I realized that it would be incredibly tempting to just take it every day because it felt so much better than the constant anxiety I was dealing with every day at the time. Because I was able to recognize that was not a good thing, I was able to set limits for myself. I will only take it while on flights, undergoing medical procedures, or if a panic attack has lasted more than a day. I have a doctor prescribing it for me who is on the lookout for any signs of abuse. I can only get so much at a time, and if I run out it would be very difficult for me to get more. Because I’m very careful about it, I usually only end up needing a refill once my last one has expired. I put a lot of focus on coping with my panic attacks head-on, and with that practice it’s gotten worlds easier. 

Meanwhile, the weed did a similar thing. I didn’t feel bothered by my strong emotions or distress while high. But since I was always told that it isn’t addictive and is harmless, I didn’t see any reason to keep from doing it all of the time. My docs weren’t concerned and didn’t have much to do with it at all, and if I ran out it was really easy to get more. As my tolerance increased, I needed more and more to get anything out of it. I started smoking maybe half a bowl a day, which turned into a bowl every few hours, which turned into a gram a day, which turned into concentrates. And if I went a day without, my BPD symptoms were worse because I didn’t have the practice facing them head-on anymore. I completely relied on weed to cope. 


All this to say: just be careful. I don’t think weed is some evil thing that’s just going to cause the ruin of people who do it, but it’s also not a miracle cure-all with no risks. If you’re going to do it, pay close attention to how and why and what it’s actually doing for you. And make sure you can stop if it starts to do more harm than good.",sky-amethyst23,1brexfe

It is a beautiful experience when it’s not uncontrolled, and even how it is for me now it has helped me tremendously. I started to ease the pain, but weed makes me see it and feel it deeply.

70,"To be emo and quote Bring Me The Horizon, ""Even hell can get comfy once you're settled in.""
I agree with the least amount of medication possible. When I was a teenager I spent a lot of time in psych wards which inevitably led to having a lot of different medications tested on me. At one point I was on 9 different psychiatric medications at once. They kept cycling me through different antidepressants and antipsychotics, ECT, ketamine, etc. and nothing worked. I only started getting better when I got actual social support and THERAPY. There are psychiatric conditions that require medication as a first line of treatment, but BPD doesn't respond well to medication-- therapy is necessary.
Healing is not comfortable at all. I've gotten a lot better and I still struggle with coming to terms with that fact, but since it's been so long that I've been on this medication I know that I'm a lot better off enduring uncomfortable change than staying stagnant and watching the world pass me by.
You're aware of what you need and that's awesome. Don't let some psychiatrist suck you into taking excessive amounts of medication. Ask lots of questions about why you need these medications during your appointments if you are unsure. And watch out for psychiatrists who don't want to listen to you talk (appointments are very in and out, mostly just talking about medication and not about any other factors contributing to your mental health.)

I always had access to Valium,  but I rarely took it because of hangover, therefore it never became an addiction. Also, I instinctively knew that it would, over time, be less effective.

Having ADHD since childhood, I've struggled to keep up, so downers were never attractive to me.

I've also heard of one case of seizures while on kratom AND other substances wich definitely played a part in the seizure but aight.

I don't know what you guys put in your kratom in the USA , but if you get good , tested kratom where I live , and don't fuck with insanely high dosages , it's WAY SAFER than heroin.

2,"Boredom is peace. You’re just not accustomed to it so it’s uncomfortable right now. It takes time to adjust to not going through constant phases of extreme highs and lows, dopamine rushes, crashes, etc. In the long run, though, it’s much better. I’ve been sober for a little over a year and a half and during that time I have made the most progress in my BPD recovery, exercise, hobbies, my career, and basically every other area of my life that actually matters. It’s a hard truth but if we want to live fulfilling lives we pretty much have to be sober. I think it’s normal to go through a period of substance abuse, and it might be the best coping mechanism you can find at the time, but it’s not gonna last forever. Sobriety is healing, rewarding, and peaceful. (I hope this didn’t come across as judgmental.

I know some people can’t do that though and I get it.  For me, I have to be cautious and only have drinks on occasion and not daily or I will go overboard.  

I tend to try to keep my life feeling more exciting to stave off the boredom.  I have to have plans and frequent changes or I lose it.   So we move often, I am in a constant state of renovation on my home, I change jobs a lot, I switch up hobbies, I even switch up my personal style and aspects of my personality when I get bored with them.

7,"I know what you mean.  Every time I feel empty inside for whichever BPD reason, I automatically go to a coping mechanism of some kind.  When I drank, I would grab another drink or start my drinking for the day in response.  Or I would obsess over an FP, likely reaching out to them.  Now that I've taken those off the table as options, it's unpleasant to have that feeling and nothing to do in response that I'm familiar with.  I've found that committing to a hobby is a necessity, not a leisure activity to do when all the inspiration and vision is lined up.  I've been feeling like ass all day, back before I took away some coping mechanisms, I would have just started doing those things in response.  But I've found plugging in some tunes helps a lot, and I've been working on a project to Spotify.  

I really wish the challenge of getting sober meant something became easier right out of the gate, but we take mind-altering substances for an underlying reason, and get sober as part of our strategy for addressing it.  

I really don't miss pissing away so much $$$, nor blacking out and being obnoxious to my bf.  I do miss kicking back and getting buzzed every once in a while, but that's not the kind of drinking I do lately, and haven't for a long time.  Because I've been struggling harder lately even though I'm armed with some really great tools, I'm looking at accelerating my physical activity plans because that actually helps.

It would be nice if we all were neurotypical and lived in a Miller Light commercial, but we aren't and we don't.  Some people go on Survivor to challenge themselves and experience extreme effort as part of getting in touch with themselves, we all do that just by waking up each morning.",,xmw2jd
8,"I feel you OP, about a week ago I went into rehab for weed abuse, thinking it might help, and while it has helped to set up contacts with further places and people to further look for help, it's not at all what i expected nor wanted. Life without anything to alter your perception of reality feels meaningless and void. Sobriety has never lasted long for me, at most it was 8 months and I didn't even do it for myself but for my ex-partner. But the only encouragement i can tell you to keep going on is the path of sobriety might be blurry looking into the future but just know that it's there and it goes all the way. The other path might look much more interesting but at some point there's a cliff and you'll just drop down without noticing it.
This is all just personal experience and advice, by no means am I saying everyone has to do it exactly like this, but I just hope my story helps someone at the very least.
Much love to everyone, stay strong ❤️",cholito_19,xmw2jd

The problem is, it's just not sustainable unless you're independently wealthy and have no responsibility to yourself or others. 

I go to work everyday and I hate it, but it keeps me busy. I also have a kid to take care of, so that also keeps me on a straight path. I gotta do what's right for my child above my turbulent inner emotions because I REFUSE to fuck him up and give him mental health problems.

16,"I wish for a time in my life I don't feel like I HAVE to do something to feel whole. First it was weed, then Cutting, Nicotine, LSD, and Burning or this years thing, Ketamine. I feel like Im on a leash at my worst, I cant run from my greatest fear(death) and each thing has its HORRIBLE outcomes. Im a grenade and all my substances do is make the fire pink.

Weed started my psychosis, I started hearing things in 2018 and its still here.

Cigarettes raised my health anxiety exponentially for YEARS. The fear of a Blood Clot fucked me up so bad I went to the hospital twice in one year for nothing.

LSD just helped ruin my self esteem. I would constantly be forced to be one on one with the things I truly HATED about myself. I spend the following few days torn apart inside and I always asked myself why I kept doing it.

Self Harm is just too much, its competitive, I have two permanent reminders on my left hand of the time I couldn't keep my shit together. It only takes one intense day of turmoil to end up in a weewoo.

Ketamine....Im done talking about it. My bio is full of that saga.

I smoke weed and Vape. Both are maxed out tolerance and Im too fucked up in the head to put either down for even a T Break. This shit isnt glamorous.",,xmw2jd

After every good thing I just can’t be content, no matter what happens, but alcohol helps. Even though it’s a shitty coping mechanism, I drink to numb emotions or until I just lose consciousness entirely.

I chased after it and started doing races, trail running (running in the woods), obstacle courses, etc. It is the best thing I've experienced since quitting other ways to self medicate.

I need to get back into it. I need that feeling again. I know running probably sounds like something most people would hate to do, that was absolutely me before. I'm not saying it was easy at first, but over time it got better. And I used it to push through some really shitty feelings. It was therapeutic.

&#x200B;

My daughter committed suicide last week and I recommend that you go to a doctor for help and a therapist as well.   Suicide IS NEVER THE ANSWER.   We all feel sad at times but things will get better.  I am heartbroken and can't describe what I feel.  Please don't hurt yourself and please call the suicidal hotline 800-273-8255 immediately.  
It is so important to tell someone you love and try to be around people that love you.  Do not be alone because that is exactly what happened with my daughter.    
You can write to me and I will help you.   
PLEASE DON'T DO IT.  Pray a lot and God will help you.  You have all your life ahead of you and you can be happy.  
Do not put your family through this.   
You are a good person and you need to be strong and get help.  I recommend for you to see a doctor and have them do blood work to ensure check your hormone levels or chemical imbalances that can easily be corrected.  You have to reach out immediately  because depression might get stronger with time.  You need to act now.",gracieanderson1,t4775m

You can combat these thoughts. Remember all of them are how this disorder kidnaps your brain to satisfy its evil wish to make us self sabotage. The thoughts will at least temporarily wear off.

81,"A bigger hug for you dear stranger. I’m not suicidal anymore since I had to become the caretaker for my bipolar girlfriend (who’s currently having a strong mania episode with psychosis now.) I had to be strong for her and my brain is still in this fight mode, so I’m not that depressed right now and can look at things with a slightly fresher perspective now, but still thank you for your kind words. I’ve been on r/suicidebereavement a lot lately since a classmate of mine committed suicide, and every single time I went on there, the second-hand pain I felt between the lines just kills me. I had made a wish to never do that to my parents unless I really, really have to. As for your situation, I wish I can say I understand your pain, but I sadly couldn’t experience the depth of sorrow and love you hold for your daughter. I hope you can find courage at this moment, peace eventually and lots and lots of love. ❤️ Our life is not infinite, and so isn’t the pain.",Mulberry-Bitter,t4775m
82,"Had it particularly bad last night due to avoiding stimulants for a long time and suddenly taking it in very high dosages, lemme post about it :/ No but actually I really tried to emphasize with your comment, and I think I’m understanding it a little bit too! It certainly is a way to live to just be spectacularly triggering to those you hate, and I honestly think it’s kinda cool because now I’m imagining all these ppl who hate me or despise me have to live with the fact that I’ll constantly be around just to trigger them, and that made me smile lol. That last part seems like a personal relationship issue because it seems kinda complex. I mean I’m a bit inexperienced to comprehend these situations so I can’t offer any real advice or consolation but I do have some virtual hugs for you too!",Mulberry-Bitter,t4775m
83,"Hey! I woke up and I saw your comment and I got instantly awaken (thanks btw. it’s super hard for me to actually mentally wake up and I genuinely thank you for that). I’m very bad at consoling others but I want to try for you. I want to tell you that I was at the exact same place not long ago so even though it’s kinda not convincing for me to intervene, I want to tell you what were some (unhealthy) emotional responses I used to get through it. I felt like this exact way too: I kept doubting myself back and forth on whether I’m just faking all these extreme emotional reactions for attention, whether I’m actually suicidal enough to be considered suicidal or I’m just an “attention seeking whore” like how some of my classmates called me in real life. This constant urge to actually do it, to swallow the pills, to just send it and prove it to everyone and myself that I’m not lying, that I’m a good, honest, suicidal person who actually struggled so much in this miserable world, whose intensity of pain is justified and proven, and that I’m not faking any of this. If you are thinking in this way and reading this comment at this time, I want you to actually cry out and stop holding it all in. I see you, I see your pain. It’s the most real thing in this world that it actually hurts me like a knife too when I read your comment. But please remember all these feelings and thoughts are part of this evil little self-sabotage routing that BPD kidnaps our poor brain to do, which means this feelings will pass like waves after a certain amount of time. If you’ve been struggle for some hours already, I believe that this battle of yours will end soon, and you will come out of it like a warrior. Whatever you felt right now under it is real, and you are totally justified to feel that way, but now I’d like to think of them as the weapon that BPD uses to it’s innocent victims like us. If only I could travel in forms of signals and waves, I’d rush to you and hold you in my arms and let you cry as much as you can as outlets of your pain. I personally find that helps as a way to dissipate hurtful thinking. You can also try to mindlessly read benign Reddit stuff (by benign I mean some subs are def out of limits, don’t go there) to distract yourself a little bit. I personally have ADHD so distraction and short term stimulation using other content helps. And also please remember, you don’t have to prove anything to anyone, including yourself. Stay with us and I beg you to not let this disorder get what it wants. Sending a lot of hugs along the way. And trust me, this will get at least temporarily better like it did for me. Or try go to sleep like I did!",Mulberry-Bitter,t4775m

0,This is how I felt when I was at my worst. Medication and no illicit drug use helped me abstain from SH. I’ve had some rage and other crap behaviors in recent year but nothing drastic to my safety. Just want to say it’s possible to get to a point where you don’t engage in any of those behaviors. Best thing to do is find a therapist you trust and find a life routine that keeps you stable.

30,"labeling yourself does nothing other than reaffirm the belief that you are inherently flawed and beyond change. 



for instance: ""I am a thief."" VS: ""sometimes I've stolen things. Not always, but many times.""

""I am manipulative."" Really? So you always manipulate people-- all the time, no matter what, no exceptions? Or do you manipulate sometimes? Under what circumstances? Maybe you manipulate sometimes moreso than others, and maybe you manipulate more than most people do, but that doesn't mean that's *who* you are. 

""I am full of rage."" Are you? Always? Do you have days when you *feel* full of rage? what about others? Are you *always* filled with rage, all day everyday? Or can you remember days where you felt happy? Peaceful? Kind? Sentimental? Somber? Introspective?  Loving? 

""I am immature."" Immature in regards to what? Emotionally immature? Are there no characteristics, decisions, thoughts, etc. you've had that you would consider mature? Are there certain areas where you're mature and others where you're not? Or are there only specific instances/encounters, where you think ""Wow, I was acting really immature there?"" Or is that *all* there is to you and all there ever has been?



And so on. Reenforcing the belief that these behaviors and bad habits *are* you only stunts growth and assures your mind that you are hopeless. They're not rooted in real life.

64,"So, I wanna weigh in on this one, because I struggle with the same thing. 

If you're actively engaging in this, then, imo, yes, okay. Use that as motivation to change, but be kind to yourself also through that process. It sounds weird and definitely feels weird at first. 

So my process with this is, when a memory comes up I'm deeply ashamed of and feel remorse over, it could be yesterday or years in the past. I go, ""yeah, you did that. You were a liar. Are you gonna do that again?"" And carry on. I respond with ""we not doing that anymore"" when a thought comes up, or a thing I wanna do that aint healthy, helpful to myself or others, etc. 

Acceptance is fine. Again, this is my opinion, and I'm not a psych or a professional. There's a fine line between self-accountability and self-flagellation and I don't walk that line well, I'm still trying to find it. 

Re-parenting in a gentle but firm way seems like the best course of action. You don't have to be coddling yourself, but gentleness doesn't mean permissiveness or enabling oneself. It can feel like that at first, especially if you've spent a decent amount of time in a rigid, authoritarian environment (hey, how ya doin). 

Basically, what I'm saying is, it's fine to identify yourself. ""I am these things. I have been these things. I do not want to continue to be these things. I will make genuine effort to not do these things, and in doing so, I will no longer be these things."" Maybe? It's the process I'm using but everyone is different.

The body shocks lasted about 2-3 weeks, from what I remember. It is not pleasant and varies in severity from person to person (mine get very severe - impacting my driving because I feel like I’m blacking out when the shocks get so bad - very much like tunnel vision - my peripheral vision goes black) but you will make it through. My partner switched SSRI’s and had shocks only briefly and not as severe as mine at all. 

Just have to be safe (know your limitations - ask someone to drive you if you need) and be patient. If you really want to get off of Lexapro, just know the shocks will eventually stop.

144,"I just feel like I’m on too many medications. Lexapro, Wellbutrin, gabapentin, Xanax and aderall. Like that can’t be good for my liver or kidneys or whatever other organs. But the way I see it is if I weren’t on this combo (that’s working great to keep me from jumping off the nearest bridge) I wouldn’t make it past a few years from now. If this crazy combination kills me in ten years—I’ll still live eight years longer than I would’ve without the meds. 

The weird thing is I get brain zaps regularly!  I don’t know why. I take my medication religiously. I even have it organized in one of those little medication things. I suspect it’s the gabapentin. It doesn’t bother me much because it doesn’t hurt but it’s a little…startling? Especially because it only happens like twice a weak. 

So I’m on a shit ton of a medication but I’m not like raging on anyone. My biggest problem was social anxiety (I think my upbringing taught me that people = scary/bad). I’d also get horrible mood swings. Usually towards my mom because I’m most comfortable with her. I’d make her cry. So I asked my doctor for something to stabilize my mood and he gave me gabapentin. 

I think next time I’ll ask him if he thinks my medication combo is bad. He wouldn’t prescribe me aderall but said he would if I got diagnosed, which I have. I am seeing a different doctor for adhd. 

But to be honest I am questioning my BPD diagnosis. I think this has been ADHD/autism all along. I no longer meet the criteria for BPD but it’s probably because of the medication. I still relate to people with BPD and that was my original diagnosis. However, I have special interests, can’t make eye contact, I’m socially awkward, don’t make friends easily. The list goes on!  My sister has a son (my nephew) with autism so when I say I think I am autistic I am met with a lot to backlash because my sister has a son with autism and “knows what it looks like” and my mom was an assistant for kids with special needs. They think being autistic makes you dumb or something and that because I can function, barely, cause I got a degree and a profession with a salary that means I’m not autistic. Shit is frustrating to be honest. I’ve always been pretty high up on the “intelligence” scale that people won’t believe that I suspect autism.",acidic_milkmotel,u36xm6

But I had crippling social anxiety. Like sweating profusely, mumbling, clearly in distress sort of crippling anxiety. And it helped a lot with that. Which that I know of there isn’t really much for social anxiety except benzos. But I will say it made me a little too uninhibited. Like some family said it was like I changed from one day to the other. From being quiet and kinda shy reserved to outgoing, funny and loud. I participated a lot in my college classes.

15,"Best you can do is quit before heavy drinking turns into full blown alcoholism. I'm almost 25 myself. I lost the entirety of 2023 (and 2022 to an extent) drinking til I blackout, or nursing a hangover. In fact, I'd say that out of the 365 days of 2023, only around 20 (not consecutive) I spent them fully dry. I didn't exist last year. I lost really good moments and opportunities because of my addiction and I'll never get that time back. 

Anyway, I recently decided to quit. I'm 11 days sober so far, and I've been feeling better than I have in more than a year. I'm fortunate enough to say that my addiction, though a serious fucking problem because there have been several instances where I could've died or gone to prison, is 100% psychological. Stop before it gets to the point where it becomes both mental and physical, because an actual alcohol withdrawal is deadly. At the very least, try to cut down. Life is tough as shit, specially for us people with mental illness(es). But substance abuse only makes one's pit of misery even deeper and wider. With alcohol you exchange hope itself for a few hours of fun and pleasure and being a little bit more social. Seek long term gratification instead.",JanoAnima,198bhfa

Which it sounds like from the limited information you provided is what it's doing for you, what others call liquid courage is freeing you up to get you a jump start of happiness. Frankly, I'd rather monitor my own drug use then be given some scripts, so it can be a risk worth taking. Just offering some advice, it won't always keep producing the ""good you"" and it certainly has other side effects like any other drug.",MainAction9667,198bhfa

36,"No judgement here if you find you can maintain a healthy self-medication regimen with alcohol. Hats off to you. But I think this is a problem. I know of one period in my life before I finally quit drinking, when NOT drinking made my symptoms worse. I was in denial of my addiction and undiagnosed with the BPD. Irritability, disassociation, splitting, paranoia…I was hard to be around because I was so intense and overwrought. That went on for about four months that time. Things eased up when I got back on my liquid psych meds. 

I got sober at 38, after 25 years of hard drinking. It brought immense relief once everybody stopped spinning but there was more to come. I didn’t zero in on BPD until I was about 44. My wife and kids were suffering along with me so I took the first step all over again and admitted I had a problem and was powerless to solve it. I got a diagnosis, spent ALL my discretionary income on therapy and have made a good recovery from the depths. 

I say all this to make two points: I was a pro alcoholic, drinking hard from about 13 on; I wouldn’t have ever dealt with BPD, just self-medicated my way to a likely early death. Sounds like your drinking may not be super disruptive at this point. Also, if you know you have BPD and you’re doing CBT or DBT, you might develop some real skill with moderating your drinking.

Think of it like this: The way you feel now.
Your trying to find an escape.
But look at it this way. Let's say right now you did all of those things, And you are still in the current mindset you are in now.

Do you feel better? Or did you think it would make the problem go away?

Which in retrospect feeling that void you feel now is still there.

You have to think of a different perspective to fix whatever it is you are facing.

This is probably bullshit advice I'm giving now.

I did all of that stuff and I'm still in the same mindset from before pertaking in those activity's

Just try and find the silver lining in the problems you are facing. While it may seem nothing will workout. There has to be at least one thing that could make it better. 

I have faced and still face a shit ton of mental health issues.

I would do drugs and other risky things to try and ghost the problems of mine but it made everything worth.

0,"I'm very similar (without the ED). And I am sort of dependent on a tiny circle of friends, but socializing is something I hate.

BPD is super varied. Impulsivity and addiction are types os symptoms, but we all can experience different symbols. We all also fall on a spectrum. Some people struggle more than others, and we struggle in different ways.

These are why subtype models exist, to help us understand the many variations of BPD and to help different groups with different approaches.

For the record, using the most popular subtype model, I am a mix of discouraged (aka quiet aka very internal symptoms) and petulant (aka angry everywhere all the time with a very aggressively negative view of people and life in general).

You're definitely not alone. Plenty of high functioning BPD havers who stay largely out of trouble. We're no better or worse or more or less BPD. Just different.",princefruit,1bvtb3i
1,"I’ve found that self-identifying with CPTSD is much more effective for addressing the root cause of my suffering than BPD. The BPD criteria is like a checklist of common “destructive coping” behaviors which people develop in response to trauma. The specific behaviors are not as important as the mechanism of emotions leading to escape urges, which can be internal like SI or EDs or external like reckless driving and drug use

Focus on the symptoms and traits that are in common between your lived experience, BPD, and CPTSD, and don’t worry about the criteria that aren’t familiar to you. By studying the function of different emotions and developing mindfulness of your thoughts/feelings, you will feel a sense of self-understanding. I hope that this helps.

My authority to offer this advice: I was diagnosed BPD and CPTSD in 2019 and I have recovered using a mix of DBT and internal family systems/inner child therapy. I’m also relatively “successful” and “not visibly destructive”, so I experienced similar confusion to yours.",TheGayestAlien,1bvtb3i

I avoid common addictive things like alcohol and stuff due to addictive personality and addiction running in the family.

I both self isolate and get attached to people depending on the person and mood, although I try to make friends. I’m attempting to recover from self harm and am suicidal. I am so easy to anger, but I generally keep it to myself. I just silently rage constantly. I generally think the world and society sucks as a whole 

I’d suggest getting the BPD workbook if you can. It helps identify symptoms, causes, and tries to help with recovery. I haven’t finished it, but I like to do it when I’m angry and it helps calm me down. It also goes through the types of BPD which could help you figure yourself out more",eris_entropy213,1bvtb3i

I have done drugs but stopped. I do constantly wonder why people don't like me. I don't like a lot of attention but still seek it out. I have self harmed and tried to kill myself. So I took DBT therapy and currently see a psychologist and psychiatrist and a lot of the behaviors have stopped but the urge to do them is still there.,Character_Tale_1979,1bvtb3i

When I have a bad habit, I first think of what need I am meeting with that habit.

Is there another way that I could meet that need? 

Now, to start doing the new thing that meets my need rather than the old thing, I create a sort of commercial in my head that is really convincing and amazing for this new thing that gets me excited for it.

Whenever I want to do the old thing, I realize that,  for me, a sort of commercial is playing in my head where I am imagining how good it would be. So, instead I create a bad commercial for the old thing in my head, that makes it seem really gross and undesirable.

The next important thing to do is to understand that I do have the ability to take the steps necessary to make that new thing happen, and just believe in my personal agency, to know that I am not a slave to these old ways of doing things.

why is the default assumption that OP is freeloading and blah blah have i wandered into a conservative subreddit or something? like “it’s your own fault” is literally the level of advice here? first of all how the fuck would any of you know that? and even if you did, what is the relevancy beyond your weird moral posturing? 

maybe the situation is that OP’s family stunted their development during childhood and now systematically denies them assistance in adulthood, all while rewarding bad behavior in the “favorite” sibling? surely this is just as, if not more likely, than whatever scenario you’re currently projecting? you know, since it’s a borderline sub? i.e., a sub full of people with complex ongoing trauma often related to their families not supporting them in a loving, unconditional way?


if i ask my parents for $15 to help with rent, they send me $15 because they love me, know i work hard, and know i wouldn’t ask unless i was really stuck between a rock and a hard place. in fact my parents would send me $500 or $1000 if i asked and i really needed it. what sort of family structures are you people living in? kick the bird out of the nest at maturity and let it fend for itself? ok lol. is this really your reality or is this some bizarre psy-op",jbartee,1clpy3z

I’m sorry to hear that your family members are not as supportive in this matter. I hear your concern and your feelings are definitely valid and somewhat shared and felt in terms of cousins not being as present or close to me as compared to others. 

What I would take of this is to try and focus not just on your maternal and paternal family but also your own chosen family. If you are familiar with “Ohana”? It’s a great concept of focusing on those that you love and that love you back and appreciate you and your time and presence. 

Not to say to cut off your relationships or anything, but definitely try to reflect beyond the financial aspect. It obv matters when it comes to that kind of showing up and willingness to lend money or so. But try to look from another lense, how do they show up in your life?

I’d like to think of it as time that we cannot get back, so we learn to appreciate the power of now and the moments it holds. Yes, people come and go. Yet their impact stays on us and so I look for those that do me well. Not in an advantageous way but more of a mindful observation of what we have in common and what brings us together. And from there evaluate if it is a healthy, happy relationship or not. Work on it from there, and if there isn’t much change or improvement, I utilize what is in my power to protect myself and my feelings.

9,"Hi, I would actively say that this is me.

I've never been on any long-term medication, hell I've never really been on meds at all, despite there being moments when I questioned my judgement. 

However nearly 6 years on, I would say I am not healed but I actively recognise and understand the cycles I can go through and how my environment, my support network, job, diet - all of it actively plays into being healthy and happy.

I've been through A LOT of emotionally charged situations during that time too. It has not been at all easy - I've had to focus time and energy in getting to understand myself better and almost retraining my brain to understand how people communicate, how what is said and then done can be two different things, how fallible humankind is, what my principles are, what I stand for, what I believe in, who I am, my loves, hates and lusts.

It has been like learning to walk again and learning to prioritise and centre myself as the most important person in my life. I've had earnest and difficult conversations with the people around me, I have cut people out of my life, I have had to take a good long hard look at myself in the mirror and understand that whilst the pain that I can feel is not my fault, it is certainly my responsibility to ensure that I do not pass it on knowingly and that I ensure that I put boundaries in place to ensure my long term ability to grow and thrive, vs feeding myself the scraps from other people.  

Support networks are vital and I recognise now that I need to feel that I am seen and heard - and this can occur in a variety of forms.

That said, the therapy I had during covid changed my life. It gave me a lot of clarity over what I was doing and how it could continue to feed the angst if I didn't speak up for myself. I did, but still I felt terrible and realised that my friends didn't understand and didn't want to understand, so I made a hard decision to remove my presence and cut them out. Looking back, I would do things differently, but there also comes a point, that you can feel the pressure and pain radiate through your body, telling you, 'No more. We can't take any more.'

But it is a process and you have to commit to it. But I can say that I am content - I am living a life that aligns with who I am - I am looking after myself. I am finding solutions to a decade-old issues or problems around my self-worth, and I am ensuring that I do not do anything that does not align with my body and my mind.

47,"This was me for a long time - I could preemptively say that as something improved, another aspect of my life would come crashing down. I think, in a way, it was a feeble attempt at keeping some control over a very overwhelming situation.

I recommend sitting down and writing out the things you want in your life, both material and immaterial. Then, look at all areas of your life and hone in on the things you can and can not control. Then make a small and steady plan of action on how you can begin to address these areas one at a time.

A lot of the change came off the back of losing my Grandparents on the same day. They gave me a love that truly was only matched by one other person in my life so far - I recognised that I needed to honour their lives and all that they had stood for by pouring that love, respect, kindness into me. I knew that things weren't going to get better if I continually sabotaged every effort I made in life.

Something I also realised was, there are a hell of a lot of other people out there who do not possess this level of self awarness or desire to improve and they are living life - not held back by anything. By taking notice of that, I knew and I can see that I am where I want to be and need to be right now. 

I would much rather have gone through all of this, to ensure that I can support myself and others across the rest of my lifetime, than live an existence being none the wiser.

The biggest lesson is holding yourself to account. I know others who have BPD who do not help themselves. And I say that with kindness - if you continue to bask in patterns of behaviour which you know serve no long-term purpose in your life, being the way you want it to be, then you have to be strict and push yourself to do better, as ultimately we are the only ones who will be with ourselves to the bitter end. The people around you can love and support you, but they cannot solve the pain in your head, you have to unpick it and find reasoning as to why you feel the way you do and why it makes you act the way you feel you need to.

Once you have this understanding, it slowly begins to get easier - you can identify why you get happy or sad in day-to-day life and understand that it isn't all related to the diagnosis - you're human, and you will go through multiple emotions. This lessens the impact on your nervous system and results in confidence returns.

2,"most of times i think of fkn everything up and cutting any relationship off, when im stressed out. i hope they leave me, so i won't have to, so then it will increase my abandonment issues, and it will be a cycle in which i won't be able to get out. 

I can't stand it. i can't be vulnerable, it makes me feel sick, it makes me feel like im too needy, too stressful, maybe ""im too much, i need to tone it down"", and i do... with people, i stop externalizing it. 

but when in alone, i scratch myself and cry and scream in silence, i feel the adrenaline exploding into my veins and all i can think on is ""you fkn idiot, you fkd up, what did you expect?"" and i get on this spiral of ""i shouldn't have anyone near me, i shouldn't let them, i hurt them, im a bad person, im so dramatic and needy, i need to hide myself"", and i do. i hide, until i feel better, like a switch. and i get blank, and feel this void. 

i want to fuck up everything in seconds, but i know ""im exaggerating"" so i shut up. i shut everyone, and everything up. i give up for a minute or two and i think: it's okay, everything is fucked up already, i cannot fuck this more, but, oh lord. i can. i for fucking sure can do so. i can damage myself quicker than anyone else and traumatize them to the point that i will enjoy (knowingly that i will feel such a guilt trip afterwards) doing it out of just pure rage and pleasure. 

it makes me ick the idea of hurting anyone, yet i desire to someone make me explode and just break that leash out. but i never do. i can growl back, but i won't bite. i don't bark, i growl. and it you keep poking, FUCK IF I DON'T BITE, i will rip off that neck.

so, yeah, i want to ruin everything at least once a time every two weeks or when i fuck everything up (or i feel like i did, mostly bcs i made a mistake). 

i want to be perfect. so i do my best to be cold and serious, calm and try to be almost like a soldier. but when i get carried off, im such a big nerd, such a kid, i feel safe sometimes, and i get carried away. just to let something slip off by accident, my own overthinking, and again, making me feel like i made such a huge mistake. so i keep silent and want to run.",nephesh_atreides,10gjzam

For me it's been a revelation, when I cut off my dad and left the markets and no longer pursued this wrong objective of living for another, and then I discovered the truth about my own peculiarities by just allowing myself to be myself, the mental torture stopped and the feelings of always being late and inadequate became so much more calmer.

I do not sit down, i do not procrastinate any longer, i do not wait until my food is done before I start. I just go and gather everything in categories and over the course of the day I'll take each section e.g. clothes/ dishes/ school utensils and put them to its proper place.

She layed around all day long taking whatever she could to avoid reality.  Since my arrest she has got a job, her own place and acts as if she is this changed happy person.  So why could she so suddenly work so hard at being a better person and not have done that for me during all those years.  Even when I had 7 strokes in 2016 she refused to work.  I had always worked, paid all the bills, took care of the house and kids.  She has zero responsibilty placed on her bc she wouldnt do it anyway.  There was no forcing her or you had hell to pay.

I can't help but feel she truly doesnt want the divorce but she feels there is just to much she has to face if she stays with me.

That's not the case unfortunately but even if it were I'd still be wary of where my feelings and attraction for them are coming from. I might find them physically attractive but I can't not question what this ""good time"" is. Ideally, I'd like it to be just that, however the reality (bec BPD) is almost always that this is an FP dynamic and therefore it's nothing that would be sustainable.

It's 'most effective' if I can't perceive the stimulus like completely like in the people talking on the floor example. I hear them talking but can't really make out what exactly they are talking about so my brain fills in the blanks and of course they are talking bad about me since my worst fear is being rejected and abandoned) aren't the worst parts / symptoms for me.

Like this is ridiculous and wtf am I suppose to do about it…..? just accept it I guess. Even learn to embrace the humor in it. 

Can’t think on it too hard makes life a bit spooky. Gotta keep it pushing. And if life was an odd truman show knock off or people are in on something. I’d never prove it to myself, and the amount of time and effort it would take is too much, so people would have earned a place in my life at that point.

Honestly idk who tf I know and who tf I don’t know. I need reminding and then it comes back to me. I don’t remember things based on names/titles either.

129,"My theory on ‘thinking everyone is laughing at me & talking about me when I walk by’ is that if we have that we were stunted (perhaps by a traumatic event even if the trauma is you were left to your own devices & no one helped you on how to think about things) somewhere between 11-16 that is when the following developmental stage happens:

“Adolescent egocentrism is characterized by excessive self-consciousness. Tweens and teens are preoccupied with what others think of them. They may even become paranoid, believing that others are scrutinizing their every move. For some teenagers, adolescent egocentrism leads to intense insecurity.”

“Imaginary Audience: The imaginary audience phenomenon involves the belief that others are constantly observing and judging the adolescent’s appearance, behavior, and actions. This can lead to self-consciousness and anxiety about how they are perceived by others.”


Of course I egocentrically would theorize that everyone has this for same reason I do … my mom died at 13 and no one helped me process anything… left to my own devices. What was your trauma that stunted you? 

We didn’t grow up out of adolescent egocentrism so that imaginary audience is still there. But learning about this can help because you can call it what it is.",Chephira,17fj251

However, I don’t really see much of a difference with my mood, impulsivity, and other BPD symptoms. I’ve been told by a psychiatrist that there aren’t any medications that specifically treat BPD, but they can treat symptoms. In the past, I’ve been put on antidepressants to treat my depression, and I’ve been put on beta blockers to treat my anxiety.

40,"See, I see myself in Rue in a different way. I feel like my addiction is in abusive situations. What I mean by that is I don’t know how to function without them, even if I have to create them myself. So when she relapsed, it feels like me relapsing with my anger. I have severe anger issues and am in therapy for it, but I definitely relate to her lows and her highs. I also relate to her when she is causing a bunch of issues with the people she loves and cares about. When she is super sad about hurting people, I feel myself in that. I know how the despair feels. I know how the guilt and shame is. The anger I see in Rue with scenes with her mom, that’s what it was like for me growing up with BPD. Exactly like that.

I still have moos swings (just started taking taking medication for that) but less intense and I can control my actions better. I also understand  wanting to look like rue , she is influencing my style a lot as well and I really can't tell if that's just cause I genuinely like her style or because of my unstable sense of identity.

60,"I don't feel like the drugs are glamorized in Euphoria. Actually, in this latest season, they show how drugs can turn you into a completely different person and hurt those you love most. I, however, also see myself in Rue. I feel somewhat triggered by this too. I'm still going to watch the show because I think it's so brilliant and aesthetically pleasing. OP, whether or not you keep watching, keep in mind and be aware of the consequences that come from all of your actions. Which is what I think the show is trying to depict; the actual horrors of thinking drugs are 'fun' or that escaping reality will solve all of your problems. It's glitz and glamor on TV, but it shows the depths into which a person will go to continue in the dark world of addiction.

If you already struggle with addiction and even more so, if you happen to be impulsive and like to have ""fun,"" drugs are NOT a good option; especially if you're in the drug crowd which, where I live, glamorizes it and makes the addiction 10x worse with the eccentric parties and such. I'm damn lucky, for once, that I have BPD because I dropped out of school and then cut everyone off which made me lose contact with my dealers.

99,"By that logic every Christmas movie ever is mostly unrealistic cos they all feature snow and some countries celebrate Christmas during the summer. You may not have had that high school experience, but that doesn't mean that it's not realistic, no matter how rare it may or may not be.

Also, Sweeney said that the only reason she able to get those scenes cut is because she spoke to the director, asked him to cut them, and he didn't push back at all. She then went on to say that she's never felt pressured to do a scene she didn't want to and praised the show and the director for not having extravagant nude scenes, especially for a HBO show.

I agree, it shouldn't be replicated. It's a cautionary tale in almost all aspects. The show is framed this way. Rue has her candy colour version of reality shut down by multiple characters and the show itself. It's a stylised show, sure, but not a glamourised one.

I'd been in recovery over a decade, they thought I was new :) 

But I talked to one person and asked them to sponsor me. Walking into a meeting with my sponsor took most of that fear away. After a month, I was just fine. But years later, when my anxiety kicks up, I call them or another friend so I don't have to go alone. 

The Higher Power thing... Well that depends on where you are starting. If you are an atheist, look for literature and meetings for atheists. If you have a religion you follow, go back to that and do what they teach. If you are in the I don't even know where to start category, but believe in some sort of higher power, then look for literature and meetings for Agnostics. But you don't have to define your higher power now. For now, go to meetings and be open to feeling that higher power. It'll make sense, one way or another, eventually.

6,"I had a successful career and had my own business up until 2020 (I’m 41 now and diagnosed 3 months ago) - but I had this pattern of blowing up and not dealing well with certain types of clients. I’m more quiet BPD, so while I did occasionally lose it on people I worked with, most of the stress was internal or manifested by blowing up on myself and others in my personal life. 

I burnt out right as the pandemic started and that has sent me into 3 years of unstable work and deep digging on my mental health. Now I know my diagnosis and  have a good treatment plan, but I’ve lost a lot of the skills I used to have and am pretty sure that I won’t be able to function in my former career field anymore. 

Therapy helped me realize that I picked a line of work that was rooted in the trauma-based coping skills that I learned as a kid growing up in an unhealthy environment. Of course, I was really good at what I did because I had relied on those skills to survive! So now I realize that I just kept recreating unhealthy work dynamics for myself that mimicked the dynamics of my upbringing. What a mindfuck that has been.

20,"I didn't struggle to maintain a full time job, I just hated doing it. Towards the end of my career (30+ years in one industry) I think I just got too old to be arsed to rein in my 'natural' temperament. Oddly, I got a (good) reputation for speaking my mind. During those 30 years though, I never felt I fitted in at work, but I did learn how to mask very well (even though at the time I hadn't been diagnosed).  
During the earlier part of my career, I had to rein in a lot of how I was feeling. When I got angry, I would simply walk away and hide in the toilets until I calmed down. I would bite my lip if I thought someone had ""wronged"" me. I learned this as a child anyway, so it wasn't too different. (In my childhood there was no emotional validation, so I'd already learned to suppress my emotions by the time I became an adult.)  
As I got older though, I gave less of a fuck about fitting in with other people's expectations of how I should behave. For me, it felt like I had a heightened perception of what was wrong with a business and in hindsight my BPD, and ability to massively overthink things, was a positive when I applied it to the technical aspects of my work.   
That said, as my career peaked, I grew tired of dealing with people. Sweeping generalisation, but I'm not a fan of people generally, I don't trust them. So I quit my career and started something that suits me more. So far it's working out.

32,"For me the big struggle is maintaining adequate sleep while being employed. I have such awful insomnia on and off and I have definitely noticed that my BPD symptoms are at their most intense when I am tired. I am not one of those people who can keep it together on 5 hours of sleep. If I don’t get at minimum 7 hours of restful sleep, I become extremely volatile by the afternoon and start having suicidal thoughts. Shift work is a definite no for me. I need stability and predictability. The most successful jobs I’ve had are as live-in nanny or live-in caregiving. Being able to wake up at work and have my own bedroom to escape to when I need to take a few minutes to myself is invaluable. I’ve taken lower paying jobs over higher paying jobs because they accommodated my needs better to manage my BPD.

40,"Yes, I think it’s even one of the DSM (??) markers? Sorry if I’m not using the proper terminology. The only reason I have been able to keep my job is that my boss understands me. He doesn’t know I have BPD but over 11 years I’ve had many meltdowns. One of which led to my diagnosis where I would come to work and just cry in the bathroom most of the day. This went on for a month before I started getting better. My office became family and I understand that most people don’t have this type of relationship with their employer. He knows I struggle but he’s also been incredible for my BPD because he has always pushed me to be better and in some ways forced me to overcome my symptoms. Now I’m in law school and I recognize there’s no way I could have done it without his care and understanding.

0,"I broadly agree with you, but at the same time... Let's not disempower ourselves. It is true that on a neurochemical level we are fighting an uphill battle, but research shows that if you do DBT (and respond to it - this likely works for any therapy too, as long as it is effective for you) then you actually experience an increase in volume of grey matter in areas of the brain related to things like emotion regulation and theory of mind (which people with BPD tend to struggle with)

 So while it's important to understand that we are not to blame for our disorder - it is a product of an unfortunate biological predisposition (e.g. temperament) and an upbringing where we did not have the opportunities to develop in an emotionally healthy way, we are not as a result victims of destiny, condemned to suffer from BPD for all eternity, rather, we can take action to change our patterns of behaviour, ways of thinking, and even the structure of our brains to go on to live a happier life and a more coherent existence",Quinlov,twdmbe

I keep hoping this episode will end soon. She tells me she has a lot of love for me, and cares for me, and I am important to her, but she isn't feeling those things for me. It's like she can't connect those feelings to me. I imagine it's alot like being on Oxycodone. The pain doesn't go away, but it is disconnected from you. Like you are aware of the pain, but it's not your pain. It's someone else's pain.  
  
She says doesn't know how she feels other than she isn't happy right now, and is very sad. I guess I should count my self lucky that she hasn't moved out just into the other room, and doesn't go out or anything. Just plays video games to distract herself...

True forgiveness. 

The fact that you are even trying to change and that you hold yourself to a higher standard of behavior shows that you are a good person. You are respectable human being and have sound reasoning.

I feel this to my core. I've experienced almost everything the same and can relate so hard it hurts. However, when I take a step back and look at how I want my life to be I can see the progress and goals I have for myself. It is extremely hard to look forward, especially nowadays. I often find myself longing for the extreme highs and lows I once experienced but I always have to ground myself and think of the things that keep me going. I look back at the trauma that living that lifestyle caused me and snap back to reality. I DO get bored and want excitement, more often than I'd like to admit but I have to focus on more positive hobbies and activities. I am, by no means good at it and still have my episodes of longing to be where I was to numb the feelings. 

I've taken up gaming recently to be more social and relaxed. It also helps me get out my emotions, as well when I rage at a game lmao.

3,"I’m a little older (31), but I had an extremely similar lifestyle 13-22. By 23 the novelty had worn off and then 24-29 I lived and worked internationally and obviously travelled for fun as well. Constantly being in new places/cultures/situations definitely satisfied my love of chaos and wanting to be crazy but in a healthier way. In the last few years, I took up rock climbing and it’s been one of the single best choices I’ve made. You still get the rush sometimes and most people still glorify you as crazy but you’re also constantly getting to problem solve, risk evaluate, and focus on/accomplish new goals. The content you get at the top of a 2000ft mountain isn’t bad either :)

Based on the behaviors you listed it sounds like you evaluate quickly, creative problem solve, make split second decisions, you like a challenge, you can read other people and even play them if you want to, you have a love for the act of enjoyment (which not everyone has) and you’re ballsy. All incredible attributes and no doubt there are more.

Sex, drugs, and stealing are ways of putting yourself in situations that light you up and bring out these qualities. And naturally you found them first because they’re the cheapest and most easily accessible.

But as you figure out how to apply your skills to a wider variety of situations in work and life you’ll start to have the freedom to explore other hobbies or lifestyles that light up all the same feelings and even unlock deeper meaning in them.

TLDR; you’re brilliant and your list of activities was just the first wave of ways you’ve discovered that let it shine. As you branch out you’ll find other activities that can stimulate you in all the same ways and more. Think big🧡",Diligent_Airport340,1636kz1

0,"Can't speak for everyone but from personal experience and what I've read minor hallucinations really aren't all that uncommon, even for people who do not have BPD or other disorders that involve high amounts of anxiety and fear. Unfortunately paranoia is a survival skill,  the human mind is pattern-seeking and tends to fill in the gaps between stimuli prematurely on the off chance that someone _really is_ sneaking up on you or calling you. I would only really worry if these moments become more frequent/intense.",GiveBackTheBoard,17cyv9t
1,"The kind of hallucinations you're describing are really common for trauma survivors. Trauma can cause psychosis which can cause auditory and visual hallucinations. If they become distressing, definitely talk to your doctor.

2,"Had this a few days ago. Screamed so much until it hurt.  All because my boyfriend followed his ex while we were going through a fight, well, at the very least that is what triggered it.

I drove to a fishing pond and drank myself silly. then fell asleep after awhile in the back of my car. When I woke up, I decided to take my last 60 bucks for groceries and gas and drove myself out camping for a night. That helped a lot. I needed to tune out everything. Just made a bed in the back seat and brought a book and some weed. I didn’t speak a word for two days straight probably. 

I know you’re going to be ok, I also know the person you’re upset with will probably make it right or talk to you in a few days anyway

Temperature- cold shower, holding ice cubes, drinking cold water, splashing your face and neck, holding an ice pack on the back of your neck or even wiping your face with a baby wipe can bring your body temperature down, which can help you reset

Intense exercise- Get it out in a way that isn't harmful. Go for a run, punch a pillow, dance, swim laps, even just doing jumping jacks for a while can help

Paced breathing- Breathe in for 5, hold for 5, out for 5
Repeat until you feel more grounded

Progressive muscle relaxation- starting at your toes, tense then relax every muscle in your body until you reach your head. Physically making your body relax can help you relax mentally. 

I hope this helps even a little, I do it for myself as often as I can remember and even on moderately bad days I usually only need the first two before I start to feel more settled.",,14h6lc7

7,"When I'm in a rage, I go for night walks, find a field and start screaming. If that's not an option I lock all the doors, find songs that feel like my emotions and scream/sing those loud enough to break windows. Try to put all the feeling into it until my throat is raw and I'm sobbing. It's amazingly relieving. 

If I think I'm going into dissociation (I get psychotic dissociation), I isolate myself and count my fingers. 10 fingers means I'm not dreaming and I am real.

Just, whatever you do, try not to interact with anyone until you're calmer. You WILL regret what you say and do, and it can lead you right back into the spiral.

1,"I feel this to a certain extent. I wasn't diagnosed until later in life (BPD & ADHD, in my mid 30s). For most of my formative years, I always knew something was ""off"" and it was usually chalked up to depression and general anxiety. I would fall in with groups of people who were pretty bad role models, and I was living extremely impulsively and recklessly, often going with the flow of whatever group I was around. 

I made a ton of bad decisions and mistakes but even so, I would often become lucid enough to recognize how bad I was spiraling and find ways to self sooth, even isolate, and take time to heal alone and get back on track. But after DBT, after diagnosis, after therapy, I'm now so self aware of all my though patterns and actions and I feel completely lost most of the time. 

I don't have much of a support network anymore, and whenever I recognize that I'm slipping I want to find ways on my own to use skills, or alter behavior, but if I can't get back on track immediately, I denigrate myself and it becomes a self-loathing cycle. I know what I need to do, and what behaviors to change, and what problems I need to focus on, but if I can't resolve it immediately, I feel worthless and too weak to do the ""right thing"" in a given moment. 

I guess I miss being somewhat oblivious, I didn't hold my worth to the same high standard as I do now, and would naturally find ways to ""just exist.""

5,"I felt totally useless until last week when one of my cats got very ill. 

She was not eating and sleeping a lot more than what is usual for her. Usually she’s the first in line at dinner time, so when she wouldn’t even look at chicken I knew something was really wrong.
I came up to check on her and found she was bleeding from her back-end. 
This was very scary and I immediately called family for help because it’s all I could think of. I begged my mother to help me pay for an emergency vet visit as it was after hours and she refused. (I of course would have paid it back, just didn’t have that amount sitting around for emergencies and don’t have credit like they do). 

My family then proceeded to tell me that she had likely eaten something poisonous and would therefore spend the night bleeding to death.
Can anyone guess why I developed BPD? 

I stayed up all night with her lying next to me petting her and talking to her softly. I told her she was brave. Which she is, incredibly so. 

I searched the internet until I found a vet I could afford to take her to be evaluated the next day, and made sure I had all the info lined up so I could call the moment they opened.
I got an old medicine dropper from the kitchen and filled it with water. I even got her to drink some sips. 

Come to find out she was suffering from a bacterial infection, not ate poison and going to die from internal bleeding. Note to self: do not call family with an emergency. 

The point is I kept her alive. After the vet visit she still needed me to give her the drops of water, and her antibiotic shots. Turns out she had a bacterial infection. I bought her tuna so that when she finally ate she would get lots of water from the meat, and now she’s almost back to her old self. I made sure her litter box was kept immaculately clean. I clean it once a day anyway but kept it spotless so I could monitor that she was going to the bathroom and make sure there was a normal amount of urine with no bleeding. 

I became a mom again. I hadn’t been needed as a mother or otherwise in so long I had forgotten what it meant to be needed and useful. The experience was terrifying, but it reaffirmed in me something I had long forgotten. I still have love left to give, I can think and make rationale decisions and know how to care for someone else, I have love in my heart, I’m not useless.

Actually my relating to what you wrote doesn’t end there. Everyone told me Peaches had eaten something bad for 7 months not even the vets did a fecal just an x-ray. After I said enough is enough I took her to a different vet that decided to do a fecal exam. So that’s how we solved the issue which was actually really hard because it lives for weeks in the cold. I had all the carpets steamed and the couch and all bedding washed and dried on high heat for 30 min as per CDC.

1,"I'm sorry you experience this aswell, ya it is tough forsure an ongoing battle.  Do the violent thoughts mainly happen when your angry aswell?

When it happens, I like it to a jet taking off full afterburner..and once I get to a good altitude I can't turn the burners off..I just go, and go fast till I run out of fuel, gaining height... Then I burn out.. and fall back down to earth shaking myself apart as I fall, wondering why I didn't save my fuel this time as well... I don't know silly analogy.. on the abcerse, it happens when I'm calm as well.. the thought isn't so loud. It's like chirping in my ear as I'm talking to people. Or just sitting by myself.. listen.. I hate this shit.. I have ZERO intentions of acting out any of those intrusive thoughts.. but they are there, and sometimes they are loud, and I believe, if I was still drinking and drugging, I would have killed someone, or more, in a complete loss of impulse control and self awareness.. these things.. an awareness of self and my thoughts, and understanding, that as fucked as those thoughts are, they ARE ME, just the caveman portion. I have to acknowledge them. And 2, that I DO NOT like this aspect of myself. So I do everything I possibly can to work against that shit, but with that comes the suicidal ideation. I love people, but I hate that I feel like I can't be understood, or that I can't seem to get this social quing down. Its like I'm 95% functional, but that 5% kills every single relationship.

3,"Thankyou for sharing, that is a really good analogy, I relate forsure, and everytime after I feel that crash aswell.

Ya that's one of my issues is I use opiates often, kratom all the time and weed all the time, I do think it may contribute to dark thoughts.

Also like you said being aware of it may be a good thing and knowing that's a side of ourselves we dont want to give into, the caveman side.  It also reminds me of when yoda faces his dark side, in the end he realized to be at serenity at death and at peace with his true self he must acknowledge his dark side, then resist it if he still chooses. 

I think so many people are just dishonest and so when people have dark thoughts they think they are just fucked but mabey we all have a dark side we must face and beat to fully live in the light, something I'm sti trying to figure out.

Ya relationships really are so hard I've messed up so many aswell, mabey one day wel get past this. Thanks again for explaining and I wish you the best on this journey.",Lopsided-Cherry-3188,18maas2

The whole, “I wish I could die of natural causes” thought is me every day. Which is actually an upgrade because for decades I thought about killing myself daily. 

Beyond that, ooooh I feel SO deeply that longing to be free of old memories of hurts. That is SO real. And I’ll bet it is for lots of us here. 

I’m so thankful that I don’t get crushed by them every day like I used to. But those special occasions like birthdays or anniversaries... they bring it all back. 

I don’t have much to offer, other than commiseration and appreciation. I wish I could fix it. But I can’t.

I’m 42 and feel this hard. 

I try to remind myself that healing is a journey and not a destination. 

To me, our childhood psychological injuries are akin to suffering major physical injuries. 
There will be scars probably all our lives, and the chronic pain and other disabilities from the injuries will ebb and flow in intensity.

We will grow stronger and wiser as we age, but that doesn’t take away the fact that we were deeply injured.

Be gentle with yourself, keep seeking professional help, accept support from loved ones and do your best to avoid triggers.

4,I turned 28 yesterday and I hated my birthday for a while. I was always alone with my mom and sister since all the other kids didn't like me. My mom has been doing drugs since I was tiny and I didn't meet my dad until just before my 14th birthday so I really didn't have anything to celebrate. He passed away 6 months ago and now that he's gone my birthdays are meaningless again. Your childhood has a lot of influence as you become an adult and being an adult doesn't make it any less painful. You just have to look ahead.,Vampyre_Lilith,s723ya
5,"I feel this. Birthdays are really difficult because my mom has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and everything was a reflection on her. She had crazy expectations and had these insane expectations on how things would be and how I would behave. Mom would fly off the handle if I didn't meet them and (saying it without saying it) the scars were not just emotional. Perfection or punishment. She reminded me constantly that I was unwanted and she did attempt to abort me. So my birthday is just...depressing. It's a big fat reminder that I'm unwanted at best and should be dead at worst. I won't feed you the stupid ""it gets better"" line, but I do understand you, dude. You're not alone in the shit-storm.",,s723ya

I’ll throw in some irony here and confess that I have a few people who went out of their way to acknowledge my bday but I rejected it (kindly, for lack of a better word). It’s hard accepting birthday wishes and pretending that I’m enjoying the day. Now I feel immense guilt for being such a drag.",jbird35,s723ya

11 months is still very soon. I would stay living separate until you partner is more stable, you are more informed and prepared enough to be on it when she's not, and your daughter is at an age where she can fully comprehend what is happening and/or can make choices on where to stay if things get rough.

If she’s in such a bad state of mind she is doing that then you cannot trust she will be able to pay rent help with food etc. you’re better off alone. I say this as someone with BPD.

I see others mentioning the fact it's too soon to move in and the risk it would be for the safety of your daughter and your relationship with your daughter as well. 

I just wanted to point out, for the best shot at this relationship working long term for you both, I think it's too soon for that reason as well. 

I want to make it clear, your partner is not a bad person and I am not saying that. I have done things I still find it hard to speak about due to the shame I feel, even being so far into recovery my therapist considers me in remission with BPD and only having some BPD thought patterns at times. I just think she has a bit more work to do before you're both in that situation, especially with a kid in the mix. BPD is complex on its own, and cannot truly be medicated, so the complexity of her situation is only a little more, but still needs to be managed properly especially for the emotional and physical safety of a child of course.

0,That can be a symptom of executive function function deficits. In ADHD we call is Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. Since Autism can share some executive function issues with ADHD I wonder if it’s the same but I don’t know as much about Autism. I’ve also wondered if RSD could be a partial cause of BPD.,,11g8j1g
1,"I also feel this and it totally could be apart of other deficits of course. But I feel my intense Long term emotions comes from deeper insecurities and an overall feeling of security within them.

2,"Yes.  It's especially bad right now because I am *once again* bedridden.  That has a significant impact on my mental health, and makes using my DBT skills next to impossible once I've entered a severe episode.  Because of that, I decided to go on a mood stabilizer.  

I've only just started Olanzapine at a 5mg dose, and am finding it's helping.  I *should be* about to enter into a VERY ragey episode (hormonal shifts suck ಠ_ಠ ).  If I don't, the meds have helped.  And for anyone wondering, Olazapine can help with impulsivity (rages for me), and paranoid thoughts, which I have been getting thanks to my asshat (now dead) father ಠ_ಠ  He accused me of faking everything for drugs, and that really badly messed messed with my head.  Now that I'm bedridden, again, my thoughts have started going to ""my husband thinks I'm faking"" or ""my friends don't believe me"", and so on.  I decided to try to break that cycle because a) I myself know better and b) I *deserve* better.  Anyone who accuses me of faking can kiss my ass ¯\_(• ~ •)_/¯   

Anyway, I hope you can get this figured out for yourself, OP.  There is hope❤️  And as a side-note, I'm hoping to get retested this year to see if I'm on the spectrum.  I was tested for stuff when I was 25, but so much has changed that I didn't see A LOT of what I'm seeing now.  Being ASD with my BPD would also explain so much about my parents' treatment of me in my past ಠ_ಠ

3,"I have autism, BPD, bipolar I, ADHD, and anxiety. Before I was sober, I struggled with my moods but they would go away quickly. Now my bad moods last much longer, are much more intense, and much much worse. I'm 30 and I've struggled with depression since I was 5. I've been sober before. I had the worst anhedonia and was not getting out of bed and lost a job during my first episode. I've dealt with breakups and tough situations. My partner cares about me - even if he's kind of distant right now and might break up with me. I have more supportive friends than ever before in my life.

But I've written suicide plans. I've googled and googled and googled methods. I lost my shit when MAID was pushed back. 

I want to end all of this by saying I work tirelessly with my therapist and my psychiatrist, I workout almost every day, I read books to help me get better like I Hate You Don't Leave Me. I journal, I do therapy workbooks, I'm trying to integrate more CBT and DBT when I'm struggling with intense sadness or anger. I'm at the point where today my only bad decision is going to bed early because of anhedonia and not eating dinner because I'm fat.

8,"ok well for starters I hope you read this befause I really need someone to help me work around this 

what do you mean by getting like too broken? its so hard for me to express how I feel, I feel like im not even me and im just spectating this horrible abusive monster take over me, all my love turns to hate, and I want to hurt someone more and more because I love them so much I feel like I need to psychologically entrap them the unhealthy attachment I have becomes mutual, and its terrible, I hate starting all these stupid arguments because of my own deluded self thinking everything has a secret meaning and that people have motives that they don't 

seeing my boyfriends eyes go all gentle and watery after I've said so much vile shit whilst in my head im begging myself to stop, the purest most gentle soul ever has put up with so much of my shit, and I know he's a very tortued and vulnerable person, I just want to be the one to help and nurture him, because it seems no one has really taken care of this boy, he is so loving gentle and kind, you know, he likes to be held and all, every single thing he does I find undeniably adorable, he treats everyone he meets with the upmost respect he possibly can, he avoids conflict at costs, way too generous 

I feel like the only thing I can offer him is protection, because I see people prey on him, I watch it, he's quite an anxious person, the way people talk to him makes me very very angry
I would hate to push him to a point where he cant deal with me anymore, he does so much for me, I know he deserves better

I love very hard and very deeply, I cannot stop staring at him doing the most mundane of things, every little movement, he intrigues me so much, I want to know every single little detail of his life and all his thoughts, if I lose him, It is over for me, I love too hard so hard it brews anger

all I want to do is take care of him, I feel like he's constantly trying not to piss me off, he's a really gentle soul, I feel horrible, I feel like an abuser, I give him so much love its overwhelming how much I love him, but im scared I will lose it in argument one day, I get very violent

if anyone where to hurt him i have many people i can call to have them battered, but how the fuck do i protect him from how much of a horrible person I am, I hate it, i wish I wasn't so scared of being abandoned, thats all that really kicks off my rage, me feeling abandoned or put aside, even if he shows no sign of distance, 1 less hug a day will have me spiraling and tantruming

If I had certainty that he would never leave me, I would stop all these little games, brcause I know its ME who's the problem, he is nothing but kind gentle and does fucking everything for me because im useless at basic tasks like even microwaving a meal,

 I want to give him something in return, I've been so horrible, and whilst I'm being horrible my brain is literally crying stop stop youre hurting him but I cant stop spewing the most horrific shit possible, its so heartbreaking, I am the problem, hes had a hard life as is, the way everyone treats him is horrific,

 I just want to be his one chance at peace and happiness, I want him to think of me as someone safe that he can confind in, I know he hides a lot, I want to nurture him fully, he is too pure of a soul,

 I really hate seeing people pressure him into giving things like fags out, like they can sense he's gentle, very easily pressured person, i feel like I've created a wall because I know he's scared of making me annoyed, he struggles to articulate and verbalise a lot, which is so worrying because I know he bottles up a lot, 

nothing in this world matters more to me than his happiness and content, its all I want, he really did save me, he is my hope my pride and joy, he is so smart and the most caring person I've ever met, anytime someone slightly disrespects him I cant help but daydreaming of curbstomping them dead, 

if I lost him I'd lose me, he is a massive part of me, I've never loved someone so deeply, I can't help but smile when he falls asleep, he looks so peaceful, all his emotions are my emotions, he got a little depressed for a few days and I couldn't stop crying, i cant stand seeing him hurting, but he struggles to verbalise so its so hard to really talk it out with him (he's autistic too) I fear the end before there's even a beginning, I am frightened he will leave, no one could ever top him, I hate myself for starting so many arguments but I cant stop and I hate the aftermath",fjbn9,11g8j1g

0,"Your husband took far more abuse than anyone deserves, and if you aren’t managing your symptoms and still abusing drugs, it isn’t reasonable for you to expect or ask him to stay. Just because you took for granted that he would always stay with you, doesn’t mean he would. You are facing the natural repercussions of treating someone poorly for years, and it is important for you to recognize that in order to have an opportunity to be a difference person in the future and create a new partnership with someone you build a healthy relationship with.

You do not *love* someone that you are abusive toward, who you cause pain to. You are afraid of being alone and starting again. Find strength in yourself to move forward making better choices and giving yourself the opportunity to build a real partnership with someone else in the future. You are “young” enough that you have plenty of life left to make the changes you need to make in order to live well. Meth, cheating, lying to your psychiatrist and harming everyone in your life will not bring any happiness or stability to your life.

When I get bored or feel the need to be impulsive, I open the list and do one of the things.

9,"I'm back. So after my false self started to crack, when I realized I'd gravitated towards toxic, emotionally immature people for most of my life and picked up a lot of toxic patterns, I basically lost all trust in myself, my ability to identify whom I would or wouldn't want in my life, and in my ability to actually make friends with the ones that I would since they, in turn, probably wouldn't want all that toxicity around themselves either. I basically started re-learning from scratch how to parse and understand people, what I would and wouldn't like to see in friends and loved ones, how to judge a person's character, to trust my intuition and feelings about people, how to open up and show my true self to people in a genuine way, how to trust people with knowledge of my most sensitive, delicate, and wounded parts (which I'm extremely protective of since I reconnected with them), and how to actually make friends and maintain relationships, as well as how to overcome my bad habits. I'm far from done but that's basically what I've been working on in the people department in a nutshell.   
As for how to keep *them* safe from *us*, I think it's honesty, trust, and learning how to regulate our emotions better. I can't hide my crazy forever, sooner or later they'll see it and it's much better if they have some idea of what's going on before it happens. People get a lot more stressed the less they know what's happening and why. You don't have to tell everything at once but just a heads up on a volatile temper, if you have one, and on trouble self-regulating is a good place to start once you trust them enough, and if you get really comfortable with them you can even ask them to point it out to you if they feel like you're getting disregulated. It's a complicated dynamic though and it all hinges on trusting them enough; trusting them not to use the things you tell them against you and trusting that they're genuinely coming from a place of care and respect.   
  
I think you're starting from a better place than I did, you have a family, you have a sense of expression, and while it's terrible that you feel the way your painting describes I think you may already have more knowledge of yourself than I had when I broke down. If I may ask, what's behind the asymmetry in the reflection's chest? It's left side seems to go lower than the right and based on my personal experience I think that's a meaningful detail and it got me curious.",tarksend,121pnb3

Lamotrigine is amazing for lifting depression and the best part is you don't really feel medicated, at least in my case. I remember when I first started my mood and energy levels improved almost instantly and I had the same side effect I've sometimes seen reported of viewing life ""from a new perspective"". I felt a lot more centered, and things that would normally set me off didn't bother me as much anymore. I was a lot less irritable.

I have failed nearly a dozen antidepressants and antipsychotics, but lamotrigine is so far the longest medication I've been able to tolerate – I've been on it since last summer. I'm currently on 200mg, and have been for about three months now. I can't recommend it enough.",,19ckfwv

Food is food and it's one of the better things to spend money on, especially while recovering from an ED. one of my biggest steps in recovery was honoring everything I wanted for a little while. It brings back a sense of freedom around food. If your parents are the type to listen when you set a boundary (I know mine SURE AS HELL are NOT so I totally understand if this would be a problem,) I would tell them to stop bothering you about food completely, especially if it's your money that you make.

4,"I struggle with this too. This is not an ad but what really helped is the Rocket Money app. Any other budget or budgeting tool, I never have the discipline to follow.  Rocket  money puts your spending into buckets and compares to months prior. Something about the comparison of spending each month feels like a competition to me. My shopping bucket has decreased and decreased since I started using this app. It’s really satisfying to put the money into savings at larger amounts each month. 

I put notifications on so when I go over a certain bucket, I get notifications. I originally put $500 for shopping, less than my actual shopping the month prior… smh. Now, months later, I intentionally only spend $100 each month on clothes. I still go out to dinner and have a life but other expenses have decreased. I’ve become obsessive but for a positive thing, for once LOL. I hope it lasts but my history says otherwise.

I will say that the one thing I’m doing that I am proud of is no contact.  I know it’s the best. I don’t think I’m blocked on what’s app or email but I haven’t reached out there.  I did start a letter but don’t think I’ll send.  I’m proud of my no contact.  It just hurts

Two platforms where she didn’t block me i blocked her. It is not fair that she can’t get a peaceful life because im stuck with this bpd shit which i know will never let me be happy.

You are right no one else understands, I have stopped talking about it. 

Work and books are the best distraction I have found. Movies help too.

35,"i have had the exact same thing happen to me before. the desperation to make them stay leads to them severing ties permanently. it's an unbelievably awful feeling, i don't think people without this disorder understand the pain that both causes you to act in the way you did (activating behaviors to regain connection) and the pain when they leave. it is never ending, 24/7 rumination. it feels like dying. my thoughts get so violent. i am so sorry you're going through this.

my (ex) best friend, the first true friend i made following my diagnosis and a long bout of social isolation and working, recently ended our friendship after nearly a year of knowing each other. it was very unexpected.

in this situation, he blocked my number me after a text argument, and i freaked out and started spamming him on all platforms and from fake numbers. it's my worst habit, i'm trying to break it but i don't think people understand the hell i go to when i'm in this situation. like i want to bash my head into the wall repeatedly until they talk to me again.

he did eventually unblock me and said he wanted to end the friendship, and although our argument played a role and he may have ended the friendship over that anyway, my response to him blocking me is what really put the nail in the coffin. he and all his friends, including people i met and thought i was becoming friends with too, said i was institutional level crazy. it hurts so bad, i feel like my skin is burning and my insides are rotting.

i am likely going to be starting antipsychotic medication. it's supposed to help with the intrusive thoughts and mood, but it's definitely not a decision i'm taking lightly given the potential side effects. i'm also taking a genetic test to see what my medication compatibility is first. to be honest, the only advice i really have is seeing a *good* psychiatrist.

if you can find a ""holistic"" office or something similar those might be better. i found the place i am going to through my therapy clinics vetted recommendations, and my therapy clinic specializes in trauma/CPTSD, somatic therapy, EMDR, IFS, etc... places like that have a lot more compassion and responsible care for their patients in my opinion. their principles are based in an understanding of the social determinants of health, which i find important.

also, i have personally found that i like psychiatric nurse practitioners better than psychiatrists, but that's probably not true across the board. and young doctors have almost always been better for me than old doctors.",pastelxbones,17f0wvk

I thought she had me blocked. She dumped me on oct 9th. 11 months together. Like I said ive come to realize she is bpd too. Having an episode and I pushed her. 

Idk what to say. It hurts sooo bad. Believe me. I went to the hospital, i was very close to going in patient but I would have lost my job. 

I am just trying to focus on and remember that it is my fear of being abandoned, the dread, the insecurity making me feel this way. NOT love. I loved my ex but love was not why I kept texting her when she said she wanted space. 

Love yourself. Learn to free yourself from the pain of being alone by telling yourself those feelings arent real. They dont have power over you. You stub your toe, it hurts, but its only a fleeting sensation. You dont have to react to it. 

I was having suicidal thoughts for the first time in years two weeks ago. Now im feeling calm and peaceful. I accepted the backwardsness of my feelings and took responsibility for being unwell. Im starting this journey now, with a lot of optimism. I never knew why i was like this but now i do.

I am really old fashioned so just staying a weekend over at his place made me think we're getting into a serious relationship (we we're obviously seeing each other before, like 4 months). I didn't even understand what situationships were before that. For me casual dating ends after several dates and first sex. I guess I am too naive, but it's because I avoided relationships for most of my life.

It took about 6 months to get out of the worst, he was from another country so I was lucky I didn't see him ever again. My family really helped me, they would let me stay at their place so I wouldn't drink myself to death and start spiraling.

Her ex was abusive and he died during a domestic dispute while I was seeing her. I dont believe she loved me. I think we became eachothers fp when she was being abused but after he died it switched back, and she just felt guilty for me. 

So what youre saying about this guy. I dont think my ex loved me and i do think it was mental illness. But Ibalso know i loved her AND was mentally ill. 

Maybe you didnt love him. Maybe it would actually be easier to believe it was just mental illness. 

Mental illness is stronger than love you know. 

She said to me, if you love something let it go. Thats all i can say. I love her and I made her unhappy and stressed. So i dont want to be with her.

I'd say it differs for everyone, especially on the true context of the situation. I was angry for a long time at him, but after that anger subsided, I realized a lot of it was my own actions. That also helped me truly stop being angry with him because he had never actually wronged me. I had been the one who was unkind to him.  


Granted, I don't know your situation either or what led to it. What I do know, is trying to let go of those intensive emotions was super helpful, but it is 100% easier said than done with this disorder... However, if it's something you're willing to try,, To try and find other outlets to get those feelings out, I'd say go for it. But if that's too much right now, that's also okay. This a horrible pain for anyone to deal with, so if you need to allow yourself to feel hurt and grieving and anrgy, allow yourself the patience to do so. It's hard, but your brain is just trying it's best to take care of you, even if it's not always super helpful... <3 You deserve to just feel it all for now.

My suggestion would be to do things that make you feel gratification towards yourself instantly. For me it was my work. But other options are cooking, reading, learning something new.

Find a new FP also helps although i can understand if it seems impossible at this point.

Im still working on doing it lol. I think im riding high on finally knowing what was wrong with me. 


I think the hardest part is what you say about ""giving"". I feel that deeply. It feels so fucked up to give and give. I gave a lot, and it didnt feel acknowledged either. Even criticized for helping. 

But it is a toxic mindset to believe you are owed love because you put the work in. Sometimes you do everything for someome and they still dont love you. Nobody likes this, even the person failing to reciprocate. 

I had an ex that absolutely was in love with me and she tried everything to make me happy. But I actually didn't respect her or find her attractive. What I felt was guilt and obligation. I didnt love her and it resulted in me being abusive.

For now? My only honest advice is to just let those feel out. It feels awful right now, and of course, making it better is what we all want, but it's not something we can make happen easily or quickly. Again, it depends on what's best for everyone else, but for me, at the time, I expressed my emotions in other outlets.

I was so angry that I kicked and broke apart a candle I had bought for him. I typed or wrote out all the things and anger I felt and ripped them or set them on fire. I listened to music or audio that made me feel miserable and just sat in room for hours sometimes.

So yeah i feel that very deeply. The stigma is real. And people just dont understand. They blame you for being immature and whatever but they are assuming your emotions are normal and you just cant handle them. Such bs. Despite how ive acted I have 10 years of coping mechanisms. If the average person got these emotions for a few weeks they would crumble. Yet were the fragile ones. 

I guess it all comes down to that dependency. Trying to make yourself seen or worthy or justified by another person is toxic. If it actually happens, if someone actually saves you, god bless. But most of us aren't going to get that and we need to save ourselves. 

Do you get depressed at the ideaof saving yourself, getting better and healthy, then finding love? I think part of me has wrapped up being saved and saving someone into the concept of love. And the idea of two people sucking alone but excelling together is really romantic to me. Idk i guess its an intense set of expectations. 

Its actually hard for me not to wantbto date a bpd girl again. Because at least for some moments I felt understood. And I felt our pain was similar. 

Incel shit but I always wanted a girl who felt lonley. But its hard to find an attractive girl who feels invisible. 

My ex listened to The Wall and has seen Taxi Driver. 

The hurt from not being acknowledged or heard is really bad. And this person should  / did understand. So i have to wreste with my behavior i guess.

Bless you for being so considerate and thoughtful.

If you are having these thoughts then you aren't fucking up the marriage, but one thing I would love that my partner understood is that I (personally) recharge my energy alone and I (personally) don't need to talk to feel connected, I am more into physical stimuli or touch.

So my advice would be to ask your husband how you could show your appreciation of him being there. If he needs alone time infront of the computer or if its enough for him just to sit in silence with you and hold your hand, then respect it. We (men) are simple creatures.. ❤️❤️",cilest,1bcjnbd

I've given myself some nasty bruises. A few times I would just go off punching my leg. If I'm not in immediate distress, I mainly get urges to cut though, mainly due to body image issues and feeling worthless but with those just indulging in the fantasy  ha been enough thankfully. It got better so slowly that it literally took your post to realise how far I've come, so thank you for that.",Pigeon_Vee,192eb76
6,"When I was younger I used to cut quite frequently, especially during times where I felt everyone hated me and I deserved it. I stopped when I was 16-17, mostly because I was worried my mom would catch on that I was still doing it. I still get urges here and there to it, it was like a really bad addiction for me and still kind of is and I’m 25 now.

Eventually it switched to alcohol when I went to college. I was drunk almost every week, drank on weekdays, etc. it wasn’t looking good. Alcohol and being high were my quite frequent go to’s to self destruct in what I always thought was a safe way. Then when the alcohol and weed were no longer working as well, I added on sex. i didn’t like to feel used but for whatever reason I felt like I needed to feel used, I needed to feel and confirm like I was in fact not worth anything, that I was worthless. There were times where I had risky sexual intercourse with two men the same night on separate occasion. And there were times where I had multiple partners without telling them despite me knowing that wasn’t okay. There were Multiple times where I hurt the men around me because I never considered their feelings and was only ever selfish. I was basically a ticking time bomb of self destruction. At my lowest, I was so numb and depressed I wanted to do anything just to feel anything. 

Now I’m doing a bit better but I still self harm just not in the same ways. Recently I find that I like to dig my nails into my skin as far as I can until I feel pain, then I’ll go further to feel even more pain.

10,"25M, I SH'd a lot in HS with cutting and for the first time in almost a decade I cut recently after just hitting myself or light burns as I viewed that as more acceptable SH as I had people notice scars before and either gave me shit, wouldn't leave me alone about it or told me to cut the other way. I can't remember when I did it exactly, prob end of November? I just see the scars on my thigh. I got 3 cuts in and must've realized what I was doing and stopped at that moment, can't 100% recall, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to cut again basically every day.

Oddly enough, once I got into recovery for substances, and when I've been faced with using vs. cutting, cutting started to seem more reasonable for awhile. 

Now, having a bunch of fresh and deep scars, I give myself permission to have a drink every now and then, or other more mild form of unhealthy coping (when I'm at the point where I can't come otherwise) to try to prevent myself from using meth or cutting.

It must be very hard to need support and not be able to get it from the place you most want it, and that feels instinctively like the place you crave it from most. I’m sure it was hard to hear that he didn’t have the emotional energy for you, but he was trying to convey to you that he was trying to hear you out anyway because he cared.

i don’t think he hates you or will leave you. he told you he didn’t want to get angry with you. that to me shows just how much he cares and understands. he may not have done what you wanted, but he was being compassionate within the boundary he had set.

i say he was compassionate because maybe you can recognise looking back that it wasn’t necessarily very fair or appropriate to send a lot of what you did in the way you did and that some of the things you said were contradictory

i know you just want to be supported, and i feel for you i really do because i know how all-consuming and intense our feelings can be, but i think a lot of us do struggle with boundaries and self-awareness and it’s something we all need to recognise to have healthy relationships. 

intense emotions don’t mean no accountability unfortunately. i’ve learned that one the fucking hard way lol

if you make an effort to show you recognise that how you react to things maybe isn’t serving you both well and you want to work on it, i think you’ll be alright <3

that being said i’m sending you lots of love and support though in what must feel like a really difficult time. i promise you will get through this!

(also maybe it’s worth asking (in writing or in person if you can stay composed) about why you lost your job so you have things to take from it as a learning experience. you are good enough, but sometimes we make mistakes because we’re ruled by unhealthy coping mechanisms that aren’t our fault, but unfortunately are our responsibility.)

So you first make him worry and then you make him feel like shit or maybe even guilty for existing. It’s manipulative and gaslighting.

It’s a really healthy decision for him to distance himself from an unsafe environment and set boundaries,he clearly likes you a lot. But have you ever listened to what he has to say? How you make him feel? You’re a complete victim of the situation.

I know this might be really harsh, but I grew up in a home where I was mentally abused, guilt tripped, manipulated, gaslighted. And this left me with a lot of deeply rooted issues that I’m to this day still trying to untangle. It took me a whole clinic to even realise that my home life was a problem, because I was so used to living unsafely. 

I get that things can be hard, I’ve been in very shitty situations mentally myself, you actually remind me of myself a bit. But throwing you’re frustration at you’re friend is really sick and could drag him down with you.

You got to stop thinking for him, and just ask him what he thinks, how he feels, LISTEN to him. Be open to him about what you feel and why you feel that way, talking really is key, and right now you’re not talking to him!

You can not put everything on one person. I know it might be hard for you but you have to understand that by you disrespecting his boundaries he is going to hate you and he will break up with you. 

I might sound pretty horrible so I’m sorry if it comes across that way, my anger is at my partner I feel like my life is literally falling apart right now because my closest person is nothing but negativity and is soo needy that I just don’t have any attraction but I still take it because I love her. 

It sounds like you do need someone to talk to, and you do need the support that you want, but you must find alternative routes if you want to keep this person in your life, I promise it will only be a good thing to not depend wholly on one person. Use your support networks available to you.

It's like scraping your knee and someone saying, ""I'd really like to grab you a bandaid but your scrape is really grossing me out"".

It really sounds like he’s trying to engage just enough to make it seem like he’s not the bad guy in this situation and spin it to make you the issue. 
And “going quiet” for the whole weekend when you’ve expressed you need support???? 

Idk how the rest of y’all’s relationship goes but from this conversation he does not seem like a supportive partner.

17,"looking at it as an outsider, it seems to me he cares but is also at the point in his own mental health journey that he knows when to take *healthy* breaks to protect both him and the people around him. that's an admirable skill that you want in the people around you, you want the communication skills and emotional regulation that this guy has. I don't think he's leaving, the messages seem to be direct yet gentle which shows to me that he's not trying to lead you on to anything. remember that you can't help someone if you're struggling yourself. if you get burnt out and try to maintain a ""everything is fine"" facade while being someone else's support, it can lead to you snapping at the people around you or becoming resentful. I think that's what he's practicing right now and it's amazing that he can recognize when he needs to take a step back

22,"I think he’s asking why you reached out because your response was I have others to talk to - I totally get your response, the defense and idk I see myself in your shoes… but I guess knowing he’s already said he’s low on biscuits, and then asking for his energy and then saying I have someone to talk to… he’s probably more saying, I needed space, why didn’t you go to those other people already… I don’t think he’s being mean, he’s trying to create boundaries while caring for you. I can totally empathize on both sides. Don’t archive him for long, remember the grey zone. We’re always black and white thinking. I find it so hard in relationships to seek help of others bc I’m basically absorbed by who I’m into… practicing space might feel good eventually… I would take space and at first felt so alone and neglected even when I knew it was healthy, then the next day I’d really enjoy my space.

28,So we've spoken before about checking in and I was asking to see if he was feeling like he could manage some support. Maybe I didn't ask it in the right way but again I am very new to dating someone who has boundaries. I didn't include the whole conversation from the day before where I did ask and actually re checked how he was and what it is that I do that crosses the line. I just didn't know what else to do. Yeah I'm aware that isn't a good enough reason and that I should do better. Its all I think about and yet I don't feel like I'm improving. Its constantly in my head that I am a failure and I cause issues for him. I'm sure he's going to leave for someone else but right then when I posted I just wanted some support and some okay so you did this but here this might make you feel better. I wasn't looking for advice about how I am causing all this shit and how I'm my own worst enemy. I fucking know that okay. And you know what I don't have anyone else to say that to. I have him anf fuck me if I'm about to say hey this ehole situation basically caused me to go off the rails and do so and so.,Imaginary-Attorney-7,188dh6t
29,"He put up boundaries, she overstepped them. No one appreciates that. Someone having feelings doesn't trump boundaries.",heatforcemarker,188dh6t
30,"I didn't like the line ""everytime you make me put up my boundaries it exhausts me"". 

He's allowed to say ""I really can't do this right now"" but I dont think it's okay to say ""stop making me say no"". 

She can't read his mind. The only way for her to know that he can't do it right now is to check in without guilt tripping. Which she did. Unless he said ""I can't deal with things at all this whole week"" and she checked in too early.

Someone can't cross a boundary they don't know is there. A boundary isn't a boundary if it isn't well communicated. She checked to see where he was at and didn't guilt trip him, and he chose to take down his own boundary by saying to tell him anyway. 

Unless he told her a well-defined ""not this whole week"", then checking in is the only way for her to know. 

Or maybe I'm wrong, I'm a little confused as well",feisty-spirit-bear,188dh6t
31,"So for context I go to a+e alot so yeah it was scary but its not like as bad as someone who never goes, I was low on energy and my spoons and I called him like I would have a best friend but she's in oz atm and he was lovely when I called. And the conversation last night he gently explained after I apologised because I knew that I was in such a state when I called and that would worry anyone. 

Today I'm glad I didn't call because I alsmot feel like I needed this. I feel absolutely sick about it but if I can't give him these two days when he's never asked for no contact and he himself is struggling then am I actually a good friend in that regard?",Imaginary-Attorney-7,188dh6t
32,Every person deserves space I think he’s showing care and love while saying I need space. Very healthy actually,SnooEpiphanies5219,188dh6t
33,I honestly don't see anything wrong with his behavior. It seems he has set a boundary in the past that was crossed or close to being crossed multiple times and he was trying to be firm. Everything he said was very honest but still very caring I get him wanting to focus on himself before helping others especially someone with BPD because it is really hard to support others when you feel like shit yourself. I think he was fairly mature about it and to me it felt like the right way to handle the situation. Maybe not the best way to talk to someone with BPD due to all the overthinking and pessimism but it is hard for someone without it to know how to interact with people who do. I would not count this as mistreatment or abuse just brutal honesty and making sure his boundaries are being respected.,CaptainMacAlfie,188dh6t
34,"I see nothing wrong with his behavior. He has conveyed a need in order to protect his own mental health, and both have indicated that OP has stepped into that space and asked for energy that he didn’t have to give on multiple occasions. OP’s FP is conveying openly — with no need to read between lines — how much he cares about OP but how bad of a situation he is himself. 

That is absolutely healthy and correct. 

At the same time he is using gentle language to convey that he cares, and to try to say these things clearly but with softness.

I’m not sure why you feel anyone is entitled to someone else’s energy when they are deeply struggling themselves. That seems significantly toxic.",yobrefas,188dh6t

37,"Therapy is hard! DBT is well worth it tho. A LOT of it focuses on how to deal with your emotions. It would specifically help you handle this situation with your partner (who sounds like he really cares about you but is frustrated that you knew he couldn’t deal and asked him to anyway.. and he’s doing the best he can, just like you are and he’s not blaming you or anything he just needs space).",GargantuanGreenGoats,188dh6t

GIVE is basically validation skills —gentle manner, act interested, validate, and easy manner

41,"What does that last sentence mean?  Sorry, I'm not a native speaker and I don't understand that ending.

I can see that you tried to respect his boundaries, but you may have unintentionally come off as a bit manipulative.  It is better either not to start at all, and if you do, then finish it.  With this baiting, you left him in uncertainty and doubt, as well as yourself.  
Have you already received the support you sought from him from another source?  And you and your boyfriend haven't texted each other since then?  
Maybe it would be better, if you have calmed down, to write to him now that you lost your job, without the unnecessary sauce that left you both hanging.  

Did he want a break from all communication, or just from being your personal support?  Do you also support him in something, or does he only support you?  In the latter case, the relationship would be quite unbalanced and I'm not surprised that he needs a break for a while, it must be quite exhausting and demanding.  In a relationship, both parties sometimes need the support of the other, it does not matter if they are healthy or have a disorder.  One-sided support should only come from professional (healthcare) services, but that's certainly not him...",BoxOk724,188dh6t
42,"I read it as she's checking the boundaries... No one can read minds. If someone says they're busy on Tuesday, that doesn't make it crossing boundaries to check in on Wednesday and see where they're at. Since she left the door open to say that she has other options if he's busy Wednesday(to keep to my current metaphor) so that there isn't pressure to over exert himself, this reads as a check in with no guilt tripping.  Now that he's said he needs the whole weekend, it would be crossing boundaries if she texts him on Saturday. But ""I'm overwhelmed right now"" with no time indicator is basically asking OP to be aware that she needs to check first, which she did. She can't be expected to read his mind to know that he can't today either if he didn't say that, ya know? 

He's totally valid in saying that he can't today, and that he cant the rest of the weekend. But I don't think her checking in when there was no ""not this whole week"" established is wrong.",feisty-spirit-bear,188dh6t

This is literally the first time in our relationship (nearly two years) that he has properly asked for space due to his mental health. I spiralled yesterday and id had a shit week the week before due to being off work with an injury. I knew I'd overstepped yesterday because we chatted and it was okay. I can see myself now as I texted him and I just want to scream. I couldn't get through to anyone else.

49,"Don’t feel bad for reaching out and asking. In the end, you respected his request. I don’t think any harm was done and I don’t think it is something you need to reread or reflect on and feel badly about. Just make sure to honor those boundaries in the future. When you chat again at the end of the weekend, if you feel the desire to apologize keep it very simple and then move on. Because feeling bad, we can over-apologize and then turn that into an emotionally exhausting event. I promise, all will be well. If you feel compelled, you can say something like, “I’m sorry I stepped over that boundary. I reflected on it over the weekend and found other tools to address things.” Then, *move on.* You don’t have to apologize or grovel or feel bad. Let it go, and use this time to try to work through your feelings and relieve some stress. Find something to occupy your mind that keeps you busy and that you enjoy.

I recently discovered [this YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrgOPCrt6PA) featuring a very kind, patient girl who works with grooming dogs with behavior issues. She talks to them as kindly as we all deserve to speak to ourselves and works patiently to try to solve grooming problems. It’s very clever if you handle animals and have interest in pet health and behavior. And, it gives little pieces of advice toward the dogs about treating them with kindness that I think we could all use ourselves. If you need something to keep your mind busy, this might help in the background.

I understand how you feel. Self-soothing and giving ourselves comfort and teaching ourselves to feel “safe” within just ourselves can be really hard, but such valuable tools to learn. Your friend loves you and I think it reflects on what a lovely person you are that the two of you are working together to figure out managing health issues while also communicating with each other. You have a lot of tools and a lot of really great things going on with your character, even though I know you are going through some hard times right now. Hugs!",yobrefas,188dh6t

Write through the tears, speak to her there, say all the things you need to, ask questions in places you feel stuck. Ask yourself what you need that you felt your mom provided. Do you need someone to support you? Ask yourself in what ways you can do that. Do you need her to vent to about how hard things are? Do it there. This is your connection to her.

She helped me realize that what I was feeling was normal for someone with BPD, and every question I had she either had an answer, or helped me come to a conclusion if there was no answer, and helped me feel comfortable with questions that don't have any answers.  Keep trying!  Some psychiatrists don't specialize In BPD, try to find one that does,  I'm in Minneapolis MN very progressive state,  doctors here seem to be better at listening to other states I've lived in, Missouri, South Carolina, those doctors were so ready to prescribe drugs and tell me ""you'll be fine"".  I was never fine, until I started doing the work when I was convinced by my therapist to get psychiatric help. I went into psychiatry very skeptical.  Just keep trying, no one can fix us, but they can help us feel better if we are willing to put in the work.  I know it's hard, but it's satisfying when you get to the point where you can exist without the constant feeling of guilt, and turmoil,  there will always be hard days.

That one seems to work for multiple people I know… and I don’t have BPD but I have major anxiety and was told to do this stuff too when I start to spiral (crying, hyperventilating, thinking of hurting myself to distract my brain)… and luckily I live in a cold climate so I’ll go outside barefoot and put my bare hands in the snow for like 1-3 mins. 

it like shocks your body and gets you out of your brain and it’s miserable lol so it’s like a form of suffering but good for you and your body and brain was recommended to me (and separately my BPD person by their therapist) by professionals lol.

1,"i deal with my emotions a few different ways. 

one is self care. everything from doing my skincare, to brushing my teeth, doing a face mask, washing my hair, doing my makeup etc. but for me, it has to be something a bit time consuming so that i'm sure my emotions have calmed down by the time i've finished.

another is using my brain. i do a quiz sometimes where i list the countries of the world and see how many i can remember. or something more creative like writing or music. just something that takes up most of my focus.

working out usually doesn't help me, but i pole dance, which i love. that helps a lot for me! so maybe if you have a form of working out that you have fun with, that could be helpful.

i put on comforting movies sometimes, or just kids' shows. something funny and innocent and not too sad. 

i have roommates so i don't know how relevant this coping mechanism is, but they're always in the living room, so i try to go out and just watch tv with them sometimes. we don't really talk about emotions, so it's an instant distraction for me, as i have to pull myself together (sort of) and put on a clean shirt before i go and hang out with them. but just deciding that i'm going to pull myself together to watch tv helps. not when i'm at my lowest lows of course, but it's useful when i feel i'm starting to spiral.

this one isn't very productive if you overdo it, but sometimes i just take a nap. in my experience, getting some rest is often what i need. 

this is kind of related to the last one, but just making sure my basic needs are met helps me sometimes. not only because i feel a bit better when i'm well rested and full, but in the time it takes to go drink some water or make myself some food, my emotions have often had enough time to become manageable. 

and i visit my parents sometimes when i'm down. it's the safest, most low-effort place i can go to, while still having a change of scenery. that's really helpful to me.

so real. 

I write it all out on a note on my phone.

I used to focus on having other people help me “you need to stop yelling at me” for example but unfortunately other people can’t always help …and we can’t control the actions and behaviors of others. 
now I’m working on expressing myself and controlling what I can do “when I get yelled at my brain shuts down so I will walk away and/or not respond when this happens” or “when I feel ignored I get angry and I need to take a pause from this interaction to help my brain process” or even a simple “I don’t want to talk anymore right now”. I also work on apologizing and being open and letting a back and forth happen between myself and the person/situation I am anxious about (as long as things remain civil or else I shut down).

What helped me the most is structure in my life. I have to disclose that I am not a self hatred/ self harm bpd type, my aggression and impulsivity is directed outward. I also have aspd, so that checks out. I keep myself in check constantly, I structure my life really detailed, so I do not begin to spiral into bad thoughts. My therapist told me to always check my emotions with a sort of operator color scheme, white is non threatening, yellow is alert, orange is danger spotted and red is attack. My problem always was, that I switched to red too soon or objectively out of nowhere. I recognize myself as a danger to others if I do not keep myself in check, so I try to be as responsible for myself as I can. 

It all comes down to structure in my case, I just review myself and my feelings as objectively as I can and go on from there.

0,"I’m not your teenagers doctor but BPD itself is not something that medication works on.  Comorbidities like depression, bipolar, anxiety, etc can be treated with medication but often people with borderline get really overmedicated because the drugs aren’t impacting the core issue, emotional dysregulation, so they wind up on a constellation of things to treat symptoms.  
Behavioral therapies, CBT and DBT, get at the core issues.  It might make sense to try to get your teen into a DBT program, though they are a lot of work and they might not be ready to put that work in.",PretendCamel3989,17pt3sb
1,I think you can start helping by not accusing her of “wanting to be depressed angry sad etc”. No one “wants” to feel that way.,Sagerwilliams,17pt3sb
2,"I would say, less talk and more do.  From you at least, being the parent.  

Take out the BPD part and you still have a moody teenager who may be depressed or anxious, has no idea who they really are, and def doesn't want to talk to their lame parents.  (Speaking as a lame parent myself, no offense)

Plus, you've got a teenager, whom, in their mind probably thinks a lot like an adult already in some ways.  It's a fine line to tow between the child and the adult because the truth is that when your kids turn 18 and leave the house, they don't have to talk to you any more.  So, it's really important to start to view them less as a child and more like an adult.

If there was someone you thought was really cool and wanted to make them your friend, how would you do it?  Maybe it takes them a while for them to open up with words, but that doesn't matter because you see the special light within them and you want to celebrate that.

Honor who they are.  Focus on the positive.  Make plans for the weekend.  Go out of town.  Do something weird they may be into.  Are they into dance music?  Take them to a club.  Favorite snacks also...esp after school kids get so hungry.  How about 4:00 dinner...mcdonalds or something...break the mold...make them smile <3",,17pt3sb
3,"I avoid my parents too when it comes to my mental health. It feels uncomfortable but also because we never were the kind of family to talk about it. Maybe your child feels that way too? I would give them some space but still show that you care. It’s not easy to accept help in the beginning. You have to find the line between being supportive, empathetic and being a parent and strict. It’s not easy, I can’t imagine since I’m not a parent myself, but first I would give them space and not overwhelm them. Don’t accuse them, don’t be mad, don’t be angry just try to be calm and understanding and show them you’re there for them, whenever they’re ready.",gingerbreadspice00,17pt3sb

5,"Thanks. We do actually talk a lot and we basically never fight. I try to be a good listener, but I don't know what and how much to say. Should I give advice? Should I only listen? When someone is in that condition, what might be the trigger that could offer some hope or motivation?",lunar-explorer,17pt3sb
6,"Im not sure about the advice thing? If I’m in an episode and feeling angry and all sorts of negative emotions I can’t think rational. My brain knows there is a rational part for example I know my boyfriend isn’t cheating on me because I know him but the borderline part tells me all sorts of scenarios how he’s cheating on me. I always call it rational and borderline me. What helps is just knowing it won’t last long and I will feel better after. Trying to stay calm and let the waves overcome me. But that’s nothing I would advice someone who hasn’t really been diagnosed. Everyone has to find their own way, and not being in therapy is very unproductive. 
Triggers could be anything, everyone has their own kind of triggers. If you’re serious about this, try and find out their triggers. Sometimes we don’t even know ourselves until it happens. It sucks but figuring it out is really helpful afterwards. It’s a confusing phase not being diagnosed not knowing anything. I knew it for 5 years before getting properly diagnosed, but in the beginning me and the people around me went trough hell. And so will you. I do appreciate it that you as a parent came on here and tries to understand and find help. If you haven’t done it already how about informing yourself about BPD like everything there is? There is a book it’s called: I hate you, don’t leave me. This might help you and your child. Maybe after you have read it, give it to them to read. It might help them to understand more and reading could be a way …
One more thing: Sometimes I don’t need advice or help or words. I need someone to hold me while I cry and tell me everything’s gonna be okay. I don’t know how to help you get your child into therapy. This has to come from themselves…. An idea would be to try and get them to at least two sessions ? I’m running out of ideas … i hope this was helpful because my texts are always messy and chaotic and full of thoughts.",gingerbreadspice00,17pt3sb

You also can’t really tell your step daughter to ask her therapist about these things, since I think she should be doing therapy however she wants to. She’s an adult. 

I don’t think there’s a quick answer to this, but let her attend therapy and see if more stuff comes up.",Traumatised_Pupper,15lr4e3
5,"It is interesting that they see that, but maybe your step daughter acts that way due to a product of her environmental upbringing instead of acting that way due to a genetic component.

I have a fear of abandonment and rejection with my family. I subconsciously have kept myself as that image my mom helped create and sustain.. as a passive way of trying to gain acceptance and safety (if I look the way they want me to, they’ll be more willing to protect me). Also, my mom put a lot of fear in my mind about how dying it would damage it forever and you could never get naturally smooth hair again.

Always chewed my nails to the point of them being so sore. I stopped that 3 years ago when my ex told me I couldn't grow finger nails and I had to prove I could. Which I'm happy I stopped that habit.

In regards to apperance I've always enjoyed changing my apperance. Especially I have found after a break up. I also on a whim when covid first started within the first month shaved my head bald. It was very unlike me. But I have found since covid started my mental health has gotten much worse. More up and downs. More depression. But I am also seeing when I'm having moments of BPD. So I'm more aware of my emotions which is positive but very diffcult to try to understand the emotions and trying to get a handle on them.

I am also very implusive when it comes to if I get something in my head like buying something, redecorating my home I need to do it or it will play just keep playing in my head till I have what I want to buy. Same way with cleaning, everything needs to be in its place and look a certain way. Though the last 2 years it has been very diffcult to do this with my twin girls. When it was just my son who is 14 now and me I had a very easy doing this. Even the first few years with the girls. But now I struggle keeping my house the way I want it to be and this eats at me big time. I need to be very much in contorl of everything around me.

I’m trying to clean myself up but it’s hard not to turn to something else. I usually only stop partaking in self sabotaging and self harm behaviours when I’m called out and realise it’s hurting others too.

The ""all in for style"" is similar I think. I want obscure band knowledge like you might need complete wardrobes.

Seeking help isn't easy, and as a teen, maybe your parents don't help. Unfortunately it's not easy to advocate or stand up for yourself and get what you need as a child or teen. So if you can talk with them or another adult, it's a good start. But in reality, maybe it won't get you a therapist. So maybe you have to do some work alone - to validate the fact that yes, some of these issues are real and not just ""normal teen"" or school issues. You can take yourself seriously, and push against ideas that you need to deal with it alone or other ways to say you are the problem. You can also keep track of your moods with an app or a journal, and maybe in the future you'll be able to find a professional, maybe school has a counselor or something.

2,"When I get stressed and such, I dissociate a lot. There are different ways one can dissociate, different forms of dissociation. For me, if I was mildly dissociative, I would usually experience depersonalisation and derealization, where I feel like I do not fully exist, the world around me looks fake, I feel fake/not real and the world kinda looks like I’m in a movie or something. When doing tasks it’s like watching myself do things on autopilot. Almost robotic. Disconnected from the world in a way. Hard to explain. I also tend to daydream a lot which is also a form of dissociation. I also tend to “space out” and basically just stare of into space, unblinking, and I will be in a very severe dissociation and may take a few minutes to fully come out of it, almost like a trance. I also dissociate in many other ways but this reply would be too long lol.",Affectionate_Smell48,x7gq7i

4,"It feels like Im the main protagonist in a video game/dream or cartoon. I dont get this ""out of body"" experience others claims I dont see myself externally. I see through my own eyes but Im disconnected from it and its not real. I KNOW its real logically which is why I dont do silly thing. My brain feels tingly and buzzy too. Almost dizzying. Im also not experiencing any emotion other than anxiety. Its not a relaxing feeling most of the time its a very anxiety producing feeling to be severely dissociated. Ive been in an episode for 2 months now and have panic attacks daily from it. I have it every where I go no matter who Im with.",ndoubleuu,x7gq7i
5,"It might be helpful to know that there are different types of dissociation. The two main ones are depersonalization (feeling like you are not real) and derealization (feeling like the world is not real). You have experienced one or both of these feelings at some point in your life. Dissociation is a normal part of the human experience, it just becomes a problem when it’s happening more frequently, more intensely, and for a longer duration than is normal. Also, it can be part of a reaction to a trauma trigger, but it does not have to include anxiety or panic symptoms. 

For me it can be similar to being very tired. Like you pulled an all-nighter kind of tired. The world feels fuzzy. I can see and hear fine, but I’m not really processing things clearly.",ChinchillaToast,x7gq7i
6,"Before I knew what it actually was, I would call it a “weird feeling”. It was hard for me to pinpoint exactly what i’m feeling. Nothing feels real. My body feels like a shell rather than a part of me. Kinda feels like i’m living throwing those VR goggles. Things just don’t seem right and I am not a part of any of it, i’m just an observer. This is a good enough explanation of how it feels sometimes.",mindsanenigma,x7gq7i
7,"I just feel like I'm not conscious or aware of what I am doing and saying.  I am still doing it, but it doesn't feel like I am processing what I am doing at all.

I’ll just be somewhere alone stare into space and all of a sudden four hours go by, or when I’m driving I’ll have a moment of “oh damn, how did I get this far on auto pilot?” 

It doesn’t really matter who I’m with or what I’m doing. If just some little thing crosses my mind I’ll spin. Even if it’s only a mini spin lol",Epileptic_Poncho,x7gq7i
13,"I feel it differently than many here do. 

During my daily dissociative episodes, I become entrenched within vivid daydreams which feel even more real and important than actual life does. It’s hard to break from these lines of thought because it feels like interrupting work with a silly joke. It takes lots of interruptions for me to realize I stopped interacting with the world. My thoughts become an entire new world for me to exist within. There’s plenty of space — it never runs out — and it’s always waiting for me to come back. I developed a disdain for daily needs like eating, bathing and going to work because these pull me away from freedom to dissociate. 

I also have a general constant sensation that my soul or my spiritual mind exists outside of my body, and my physical mind is trapped within my body. So my soul and my brain are trying to come together to make decisions, but they’re doing completely separate things most of the time so the body/mind with no guiding input just goes autopilot. There are times I feel one way but speak and act in a different way, and I cannot make my body/mind catch up to my soul and unify.",,x7gq7i
14,Depends on the moment. Sometimes I completely shut down and stare into space. Sometimes I go into autopilot. On rare occasion I go into what my friends call caged animal mode and you want to stay clear.  When it happens its almost like I'm watching a movie of myself.,Dkfrzr,x7gq7i

17,"I'm sure a lot of other people have already said, but it's definitely like being on autopilot. There's really no thought process, just doing. It feels like you're dragging behind your body, like your mind and thought process is lagging. Most of the time, I also feel like nothing nor myself is real? It makes no damn sense, but I feel like there's really no one outside of myself and even myself doesn't feel like a real person. I have no other way to describe it than nothing feels real. I also feel very stuck in the moment and that there is no future. A friend was trying to talk me through it by talking about good things to look forward to and I really couldn't see them happening. I didn't know what was going to happen when we were done speaking, let alone what was going to happen weeks from then. I felt stuck in that moment and that it would never end.

I frequently look down at my body, or notice my arms and feel like it's just not me.

I forget where I put things, what I did that day. Ill end up in different rooms in my house with no recollection of walking there. I’ll forget where I am and feel like I’m not even alive. When it was really bad Id touch things to make sure their real and ask people of their real. Everything just feels weird like your out of place in the universe. Auto pilot feeling. The more overwhelming the more it happens. Not a good time. In my opinion its my least favorite and most detrimental/life altering part of bpd.",,x7gq7i
26,"Everyone is different. For some it feels like an out of body thing, for others it feels like they’re watching a TV show. For me it always felt like it was in a dollhouse. People looked plasticy and everything felt fake. Since I started meds it hasn’t really happened much.",dciDavid,x7gq7i

29,"As a child I always felt like my life was a movie and I was just acting a part. Or like I would get poured into my body when I woke up every morning, the body was just a vessel. My Self operated beyond the physical world, and my Body just moved around like a puppet within it. Literally like being in someone else’s body, not identifying with how you look or sound, no way to say “this is me”. I remember asking myself “why am I me? How am I me?” Because I felt I primarily existed elsewhere. Before I understood BPD I thought the phenomenon was caused by my high IQ, like maybe I was too close to God and I wasn’t wiped blank upon birth. Like my old soul was shoved in my body but wasn’t zipped up all the way. 

My family thought I was just dramatic. No, 3 year olds aren’t supposed to be contemplating the existence of Self. Something else. Haha.",,x7gq7i
30,"A few ways: 

1.  My memories are of things that happened, but in trauma, my feelings have a very strong tendency towards externalization.  I feel sad/angry/hurt for them - not for me.  It takes a lot of effort to shift my perspective, but over time has gotten easier/ more natural.  

2.   Rather than feeling like a person, I feel like I inhabit costumes.  I am active in the experience and not pretending, but it feels unreal. 

3.  Sometimes I step out of a conversation while it is happening and move into a meta-analysis.  I am not separate - but I am distracted by the additional focus/effort.

Sometimes it happens randomly, sometimes it happens when I’m stressed, sometimes I can even go a couple of days without completely losing touch with reality. But there’s always another episode waiting.

I mean, there will be full on continuous plot development and I can usually remember most of it upon waking. Within the past few years I’ve also developed repeating dream themes — one of them is that I’m late for class but I can’t figure out what any of my classes are or how to get there, another theme is that I have a very important message to relay and nobody believes me and I’m just screaming at everyone desperately trying to get them to understand. I also have repetitive dreams where I am running away from the cops, aliens, demons, huge freaky sci fi monsters. Battling demons in disgusting, scary locations is a normal Wednesday 3 AM for me.

I get upset when my actions don’t match my words, but it’s happening on the inside. Sometimes I can break out of it and say, actually I don’t even believe anything I just said, that was just weird BPD brain vomit. My boyfriend has gotten to the point where he can even recognize it if I’m saying things that I don’t mean when I am disconnected from myself.

I really had no feeling regarding that I was seriously contemplating ending my life because I felt like it was the 'best decision for me.' I was trying to explain that to my friend and the only reason I snapped out of it was because I made him cry. Then I felt immensely guilty and told him I wouldn't.

When that happens, my urges to cut are really strong. But fortunately I'm not one of the stockers cutting open boxes, so I don't have access to any blades at the time. It does help time go faster though. If I start to dissociate at the very start of my shift, for me it feels like 30 to 60 minutes went by and we're already taking a break.

Even if I’m thinking of positive / good / happy things, a stray thought might pop up and tear it all down, leading me into a wormhole of further dissociation. When I’m staring at a wall for hours unable to move or go to bed or do anything, that’s agonizing. The shorter the dissociation, the less it interferes with my life. 

Unless I’m driving. That’s dangerous and critical. Sometimes I get wrapped up in a dissociative state while driving and when I come back, I’m amazed how I drove without consciously registering the road? It’s similar to what it may feel like to people who sleep walk and drive (I’ve heard it’s not too uncommon). I also sleep walk and sleep talk, so I wonder if that somehow makes me more likely to enter deep dissociative states. Just thinking out loud here.

Right after that, there is depression, suicidality prolly, irritability, emotional outburts, fatigue and just the feeling of hopelessnes as nothing is real and your experience was not real yet it did feel like it.

Here’s a fun one for you. I had a dream that my college hometown had a black out. Everything was shut down and people started pouring out of their homes to figure out what happened. We discovered that the entire world was experiencing this. People started groups or like factions that would hunt for food together but they were known to mug people, even kidnap them or take them as sex slaves for reproduction. I had to get to the other side of the city to get my friend who told me he was stuck at his house surrounded by a tent city run by a hostile faction, but it was very difficult getting from place to place without being seen and Chased. Somewhere along my mission I found a safe house where I ate some canned foods and got water and brief medical attention for my feet which were ragged from journey thus far. I walked for days and I swear my brain felt every minute of that.

107,"I’m a 25yo woman. I’m not in DBT but I plan to start soon. I’m high functioning for the symptoms I exhibit, I can mask really well in public, but getting close to literally anyone is so painstaking that I just don’t do it anymore. Working to learn how to. 

When I realized I’m BPD it answered so many questions I had: why can’t I tolerate the smallest slight? Why can’t I show myself to anyone without becoming something different? Why don’t I have opinions on things that objectively should matter to me? Continued trauma and abuse from loved ones throughout my young life made it worse and worse and worse. I didn’t know why though, I didn’t make the connection, part of me thinks I didn’t even have the opportunity to realize my BPD until I had come out of the most recent trauma and had time to live normally for awhile. I was a zombie. I didn’t have the opportunity to know who I was or even react to any situation I was given, it was full blown Stay Alive mode. 


I’m super lucky to have fallen in love with someone who loves me as I am and supports me in continued evolution and healing. The first couple years were hell for us — my partner has cPTSD and severe ADHD so my mild BPD and severe cPTSD didn’t layer well on top, especially after we had been long distance for almost 2 years. Getting over the hump of knowing one another and even being able to hold a regular conversation took years of work. It sounds crazy but we just kept working at it. In the past year (year 4 of our relationship together) we’ve seen more improvement than in the entire time we’ve been together.",,x7gq7i

0,"I attempted suicide a few times when I was a young teen and self harmed a shit ton. Self harm has been on occasion since. Growing up I was pretty promiscuous and have used sex as a coping mechanism. It’s only been recently I kinda realised that though. I’ve been on and off addicted to drugs since a young teen as well, was always a drunk though. I hit 100 days sober from alcohol over a week ago, haven’t had cocaine since then either, and can’t actually remember the last time I had any other drug.

I still get urges to throw my whole life away and go off the rails, I can handle them a lot better now though. I am scared that one day I’ll cave in, but I have resources to use to avoid that, and I’m also staying with family to get my head straight. On Christmas I had a bad drunken episode where I said a lot of fucked up shit and I’ve been determined never to let that happen again. 

The real unfortunate thing about self destruction is that it’s literally seeking out trauma. We find excuses and say it’s the only thing to cope but we’re actively making it worse because we think there’s no other way. Part of me misses that unhealthy and selfish mindset because there was something appealing about the idea of not caring, but it’s never actually fun and there’s no good that comes from it. I’m lucky to be in a position now where I can be aware of this and I can heal. I’m not lucky to have to be in this position, but I am and sometimes people don’t have this realisation until it’s too late. For that, I am grateful to still be here after everything I’ve endured.

Now I rely on close family for serious shit, and not my friends. I’ve broken too many friendships by not understanding obvious boundaries and putting too much on people. While I understand my sense of urgency, it is not fair and not healthy to put something as heavy as that on conditional love. 

That close family is also select. I hadn’t spoken to my mum in 2 years and was staying with my dad to try get better, but he wasn’t in a position to look after me. Now I’m with my mum and her husband and there is a drastic improvement now that I’m out of an unsuitable environment. 

Reminding myself of all the reasons that I am sober daily helps, along with gratitude and mindfulness. It’s been slipping lately so I need to be stricter to myself about it, but it helped the most when I was newly sober. It was a daily reminder that things would get better if I tried and only if I tried. Learning and remembering that my life is worth much more than a moment of vulnerability or chaos has helped a ton too.  I don’t think it’s possible if that realisation hasn’t hit.

This feels kind of long and I apologise if it seems like rambling, I just have a lot to say on the topic I suppose. I may always live with self destructive thoughts but that doesn’t mean I need to listen to them. Nobody else has to either.",badsbee,1c4ovt8

Taking a break and I got more done for me this am than I have in 6 weeks of focusing on them. Lonely- but was lonely when I was with them - in a different way. 

So yeah I understand how you can realign and feel more stable without their distractions, but the companionship I had was comforting even though it was one sided.

More, and more, and more, but it doesn't make any difference. No matter what I do, I don't feel anything. I hurt myself; it doesn't hurt. I buy what I want; I don't want it.

5,"As a typical borderline I feel that I have gone through obsessing over every Hobbie until it no longer even seems to be something I want to participate in. 

From the whole sifting through vinyl records spending thousands on obscure pressings to abandoning the collection for five percent of it's worth to having to buy the next installment of the DC Vertigo comic book until the three boxes full got stolen by a tweeker that broke into my apartment. 

From playing and recording music to breaking the guitar in pieces in a mad fit.

From keeping journals starting at age 8 to tossing those in a rage for a boyfriend who read them and found it acceptable to have me justify everything I have ever said and holding over my head because I wasn't able to communicate myself and tell him to shove it up his narcissistic ass.

I have played card games, collected things, played sports, and traveled. I have tried relocation to cities with a lot more to do and starting things where I am at, all to chase away that numbness and boredom that is chronic with this disorder.

I really enjoy being alone because my mood changes so often, it's nice to just do whatever I want to do whenever I want to do it.

I'm typically a pretty big gamer, but I only play single player games. So, that's always kinda been my default, but about a month ago, or so, it just suddenly felt like the most boring thing ever. So, then I hop on YouTube and just get lost down that rabbit hole for a while. One day I just decided that I wanted to learn everything I could about Custer's Last Stand, because I didn't really know what it was. It was awesome.

But, eventually, that gets boring too. That's where I turned to reading some new comic books, and getting lost there for a while.

I find hobbies that give me something that I need, more rewarding, than ones that are for pure enjoyment. Nothing against those who do hobbies just for fun. It's a me quirk.

1,"I know that it’s probably not going to change how you feel (it definitely won’t) but if he really is in love with this other girl but in a relationship with you, he really can’t be that great can he? Why would he be with you if he was in love with her? Has he done something or said anything that makes this a reality?

You’re letting the insecurities create a whole story on its own without (as far as I know) any evidence that this narrative has any truth to it at all! You have a choice to try and bring yourself back from the edge and not let these feelings dominate you or you could keep telling yourself he’s in love with her and create more doubt and fear until it becomes a real problem.

2,"You don’t have to love yourself but you do have to come to terms that you’re in your body and you are a singular person outside of your boyfriend. 


You seem like you’re very sure your boyfriend is your only reason for living but if that is true you will never be able to sustain any relationship with anyone. If it isn’t for yourself; do the work of finding yourself so others don’t feel they are holding your life for you. 


I suggest doing daily exercises where you: sit for ten minutes feeling your skin boundary (this helps with finding your boundaries as a person, finding your own personhood), journaling: making a clear story of how you got here as a person your history etc, and do daily affirmations and repeat them out loud, and also write activities you enjoy to do and do them more by yourself and build friendships outside of your partnership. I would also suggest learning about BPD from psychotherapists online such as Frank Yeomans on YouTube, he’s helped me understand myself really well. Throw all that love and energy you have towards this person within yourself. You don’t have to like your emotions but even if they feel unbearable they are not. 


No one is going to save you from these feelings. You have to take care of them yourself, and no one can possibly regulate you for you.. I would also suggest having a calm conversation about if this belief your boyfriend is in love with his friend is true. If it is then it’s possibly time for you to choose yourself rather than your boyfriend.",bttrfly99,12g9dp7
3,"You are a passionate, beautiful soul who has a heart bigger than the ocean. You have been hurt so much, you might have done things or behaved in a way that brings you shame or guilt, or maybe someone or multiple people have torn you down one too many times resulting in you not being able to look at yourself without feeling hatred.

Right now, the world must be black and white. This guy sees you differently, and for that, you've given him every drop of love your ocean heart could spare. That's beautiful, but you also need that love too.

I used to be the exact same way. It's so incredibly difficult to even imagine, let alone attempt the long journey to love yourself. It may seem impossible, but it is detrimental to do so. It is the first step to proving everyone wrong, even yourself. 

It's true that our symptoms might be so bad we'd need medication, but that doesn't mean you can't improve further. Life is filled with constant improvement. There will never be a moment or chapter in your life where you can't grow as a person. That being said, life is also just a book with a million chapters. If your boyfriend has feelings for another girl, then maybe this chapter needs to come to a close so the next one can begin. That's the beauty of life, and consider it like this..

Even if he does or doesn't have these feelings, you are feeling immense amounts of pain regardless. It could be love, or it could be the fact that he makes you feel loved and worth it. Do you love him, or are you attached to him and afraid to lose the comfort of his love for you? That was a hard question I've had to ask myself recently.

No relationship will ever be successful unless you can acknowledge that life is worth living for yourself, and that you are worth it. Just by telling yourself daily, whether you believe it or not, that you are worth it. That you are beautiful. That does make a difference. I used to angrily tell myself this whenever I was having breakdowns. It was like I was battling myself, but eventually it didn't feel like a tough battle.

There's no harm in leaning on someone for support in this journey. If you meet someone who makes you feel good, that's totally fine. However, living for someone? As romanticized as that is, it's a dangerous and unstable promise that could be broken, because you will never be sure if they'll stay.
You can live WITH someone. Not literally, what I mean is you can live alongside someone. Live for the moments where life feels like a rainbow, where happiness swells in your chest, and the ache of heartbreak is almost something you are thankful for.
If we didn't have pain, we as humans would feel numb all together. The thrill of happiness would be a constant, to the point that it would just feel normal and we would take it for granted.

Pain is good, because it's followed by joy and THAT is worth living for. Our next bit of joy.


Instead of using substances to cope, I'm gonna offer cliche advice that has saved my life.

Journal. Look at pinterest for venting journal ideas. Scribble. Write all the terrible dark thoughts you get down, and then write down all the things you are grateful for. Small things, like a smell you love, a song you enjoy, an animal you are so happy exists. Maybe write about the seasons, or the weather, or something cute you saw that day.

LOOK for beauty around you. Maybe you live near a forest? Go for a walk, and think about how complex the world is, the universe is. Think about how it all could have began, and how everything coexists together even when we as humans aren't doing much to take care of it. Yes that can be depressing, but acknowledge how despite all that, the world still creates beauty.

Just like how pain can still be conquered by joy. 

Program yourself to appreciate small things first. Listen to music that makes you want to dance. Romanticize your life without the idea of a romantic partner. Romanticize friendships, and Romanticize yourself. 

All of this, I did with hopes that I would find reasons to live without my partner. Now, I've healed myself enough to not completely rely on my partner.

The sad thing is, we broke up before I could get to this headspace. He wants nothing to do with me, and I went through a terrible patch.

But recently, I met this guy. Well actually I've known him for a long time, but we only just connected and realized we are one in the same. He's the guy of my dreams, and he entered my life just as I accomplished achieving self love, enough to feel more confident in myself, and aspire to live for more than just him. We don't live for eachother, but we do live alongside eachother with hope to watch eachother grow and thrive in this beautiful world.

That's what you should be aspiring to have, and I can tell there are a lot of amazing people in this comment section who are willing to help you. Let me know if you'd like to exchange any contact info because I'd really love to help you more. It's such a scary position to be in, but it isn't a battle you can't win.

I'm not sure if you live in an area with a lot of options, but have you ever heard of a platform called Alma? Its what I used to find my therapist (who I like, and isn't perfect but has been willing to adapt to me). You can search via a ton of filters, make free consultation calls with therapists you feel might be helpful. BPD is a filter option and I liked that I could also filter things like non faith based, queer friendly, location, etc. Alma also isn't a subscription service so it's free (I beleive therapists have the fee instead), you just pay for your sessions through alma. If you want to set up sessions with a therapist, you work through that therapist, and you can find local therapists for in person as well, and alma actually will filter out therapists that your insurance won't cover. Ive found it preferable than playing therapist roulette with someone random. It may or may not help you especially depending on where you live but it's maybe something to browse through.

Trying to cut down or stop using the substance but being unable to.
Experiencing intense cravings or urges to use the substance.

Developing withdrawal symptoms when not using the substance.
Spending more time getting and using drugs and recovering from substance use.
Neglecting responsibilities at home, work or school because of substance use.

Therapy helped a lot. NA and rehab were also very helpful. I also choose not to engage with substances that I know will lead me to a bad place, and I don't do things like watch porn or masturbate when I'm bored...if I'm in need of quick relief, sure, but just in that moment and not longer.

In terms of activities, you can either lean into the feelings and do something ""destructive"" but controlled. Eg. Rage into a journal, go for a run and push yourself to the extreme, eat something super spicy. The risk of this is that it could spiral to other areas (eg. Raging to journal gets you works up and then you rage at friend). Or you can try to de-escalate the feelings. Eg.

Medication isn’t for everyone (I think everyone needs to know that), and they had me on a high dose, 250 mg of Lamictal and then 20 mg of Abilify. That combined with my high dose of pain meds, and my neurological meds, which they knew I was on, and I repeatedly brought up, and asked about, triggered tremors that I still have an issue with, years later, after that.

I was lied to by my psychiatrist, and told there was no real counteraction between those meds, and what they knew I was on, which I found out after that situation came up (and I ended up looking it up online) wasn’t true and that there was high counteraction between my pain meds and the Abilify. I wish I could sue, but I don’t know if I’d truly be able to prove it, because it’d ultimately be my word against his. I trusted he knew what he was doing….

I did my due diligence of researching this particular medication when prescribed over a year ago. However, I still didn’t grasp the concept of how dangerous it was to go off of it (never planned to).

In your case, I’d recommend taking maybe a fourth less for a couple days, then another fourth lower, and then again, until you run out.

26,"On one hand, it is wrong for us to regard others as a tool to meet our ""needs.""  We are not entitled to being listened to.  If we want to be listened to, we need to work to make people want to.  But on the other hand, external validation is a treatment performed by professionals.  So is it arguably a special need of those with BPD?  

Nor are we entitled to being understood.  Millions of writers, leaders, advocates know that being understood takes a lot of hardwork, learning, and resilience upon failure. Blaming the audience is the biggest obstacle to being understood. 

My conclusion is only a paid professional or other enthusiastic volunteer should be expected to listen and understand you.

And yes, a professional is always a good idea, but not everyone can afford one. Support groups are also a good idea, just like forum.

My point is that talking can help, but it is one tool to express and try to understand hurt. When we feel like pulling inward and ignoring, that can often mean the hurt is too much to tell anyone else, but there are ways to start by journaling, asking questions of yourself with the never ending ‘Why?’ even if you don’t write it down, or even posting something like this ‘it’s hurts’",Itchybootyholes,xibxsp

doesn't bother me at all wxceotninfeel

really just a sliver of what she's going
through and i just feel like it's a gift almost
when it's like this….

…”Like someone says pizza you think of

drooling? Like we know it but you see
someone walking down the street having
an episode it's one thing, but if she's
there telling me things about me i know

not to be true i can relate because I've
been there, and only we can do that. You
know? That's empathy, right? To
understand another through a shared
experience?  I guess the gift part is 
knowing i can help,
it's a very strong satisfaction to help
others in a meaningful way

you get stuck in the dark and nobody is
there to help and you don't want to reach
out to get help because you just feel like
a burden and nothing to give, so this is a

That was some perve dude that took me home in Texas somewhere outside of Dallas i think….he grabbed me and got beer and whatever and i was taking a shower and he yelled in he was gonna grab a shower then when he came back i caught him trying to be quiet and sneak a peak into the opposite side of the shower curtainz.  I slugged him and he just dropped lol.:.the i filled my backpack with his trinkets and made him give me a few hundred bucks and a ride a few hours down the road while i belittled him…pos but that’s nothing and actually turned out good for me lol..

But so often people woukd pick me up and take care of me and you know, they always meant the best.  They never really understood why i might be there thiugh, always “where are your parents” …to have empathy i think you need to have the experience OR have so many different experiences that you can actually surmise a new one from your others. You know? Like so many mental health symptoms are similar, but i know how many pellle really can’t plug in the lack of control that we have. They don’t really have anything comparable if they are healthy.  I also can’t imagine being a jellyfish. But even someone who has been through real true deep depression can kind of get the lack of control. Like when you snap back and look at the last whatever 20 minutes or few hours and just like how didninso that or what happened kind of feeling is similar between alot of people.  I dated a hypochondriac, i think lol, and i couldn’t understand that because she really seemed more delusional than like the bp/bpd/ptsd/ whatever “family” (is that a thing?  Are they considered like a grouping of some sort?) like she would look at her leg like it was in pain complaining about soenthing and like her eyes wouldn’t be focused, which is what happens when your hallucinating…

Anyway, i got way tf off point there lol, but i think people try and want to, but our brains don’t have room for whole other realities and it seemed like our brains won’t let us be too empathetic if it is unnecessary and inwoukd guess for that reason: it probably takes a far greater amount of information to be empathetic vs sympathetic.  

As we get older people stop caring too. People care about kids , then teenagers burn them out and once your an adult it’s like nobody gives a duck after 30, get into 40’s and 50’a and if your not a success you are a waste because it’s too late to save you.  That’s what it feels like and that’s why people cling to their kids; it’s all they for a lot of time.  I’m always clinging to whatever 20 something girlfriend i can find, but i can see that’s gonna end sooner than later cause all my teeth are going, hairs finally greying, I melt when it gets hit iut Normal stuff.

But i could go on all day with this kind of stuff because i think about psychology, philosophy, and humanity like every second of the day and it’s all so unknown and just a matter of your experiences and perception, education, influences, your mood, the weather, hormones, you know? And then our entire universe is probably a grain of sand so why do we even bother lol.

12,"Hello.

Your subject seems very much serious.
I think that no one on Reddit will be able to give you THE solution.
If someone told you ""do this, do that..."", you should not listen to him.

But, we are able to give you some advices.
My advice is to organize a meeting with your psychiatrist + your parents + you. He will find the perfect words to touch the soul of your parents. Surely.

My last advice, is to keep calm. Whatever your parents saying. Keep your calm. YOU KNOW that driving a car is like having a gun. 
So, maybe you can try to let them talk, without answering to them, because it seems that they don't understand how your brain works AT ALL.

I have a last advice, and this one is VERY POSITIVE 🥳🥳🥳🙂🙂🙂🥳🥳🥳.
Suicide behaviour, suicide thought, all about suicide: it will leave you one day. If you are hardly follow by psychiatrist, psychologist, treatment.... with time (and it can be fast, I mean less than 6 months), you can totally remove these dark ideas from your brain.
Maybe can you try to start the negotiation with your parents? ""Yes mom, yes dad, I also want my driver license, but please wait few months"".

Hope it will help you.
Keep calm, and camp on your decision.

Good luck.",VolcanoWantsCorpse,udwa2a

23,"Have you thought about maybe you are stressed out from being inexperienced, and your mom isn't actually yelling at you, so you perceive it as yelling? She doesnt want you to get hurt, or get a ticket. Think about that next time she ""yells"". Ask yourself ""Am I really being yelled at or is this just how I'm perceiving it? Is it effective to get all worked up and fustrated?""",AcrillixOfficial,udwa2a

25,To be an independent adult most places you need to have a drivers license and be able to drive yourself.  They probably want you to not rely on them for transportation your entire life and to someday be able to live on your own and be self sufficient. I expect my kids to get their licenses at 16 and so far they all have - even my anxious daughter who was afraid to drive at first.  We practiced with her for hours and helped her be more comfortable but we did NOT allow her fear to keep her from driving because we expected her to become an independent adult in the future and anything less was not acceptable.   She is 23 now and drives herself everywhere just fine and loves her car.  Independence is so important.,AnotherStarShining,udwa2a

35,Get help for your issues and don’t use them as an excuse not to learn to drive and be an independent person.  Don’t trap yourself as a way to avoid seeing old friends.  Learn to control your urges to do what you shouldn’t - in therapy - and don’t let that cripple your development as a person.  Don’t be an adult who has to depend on others for everything your entire life.,AnotherStarShining,udwa2a

41,It’s more then just driving anxiety and being a bad driver. It’s that I’m not able to make good decisions and I lack a lot of impulse control. A license is unchecked power to me. If I have access to drugs I’m going to do them whether I think it’s a good idea or not. I haven’t even mentioned the fact that I’m low key stalking someone right now. I have created multiple fake numbers and Snapchats to the point that they had to change their number and If I had a car I know for a fact I would show up places I know they are going to be. I’m going to therapy and I’m trying to work on my impulse control and my suicidal behavior but Right now I’m not in a place where I can handle the responsibilities of a license,Totallyarealhuman21,udwa2a
42,"Stop pushing someone who says, ""I don't want to be able to drive because it will give all of my risk factors  a boost"".

She doesn't want to learn because she's worried she will use it in a manic phase to access drugs, or kill herself/someone else. Some people do not have the mental resources to drive safely. She is not your daughter with the mold anxiety issue, she's a full blown bpd case who already knows that the first split they have they're going to go buy some cocaine and drive off a bridge.",SchmidtyBone,udwa2a

She needs more time to get comfortable with it. My wife was 30 when she learned how to drive, because of those exact reasons. If she's unsafe to drive, why the hell are you pushing her?

0,"Yup. Big time. It's escapism/distraction. You are trying to escape from the uncomfortable feelings that you experience when you are left all alone with nothing to do but to be yourself, dwell on yourself and your life and feel uncomfortable. Trying to fill the void by distracting yourself constantly with sensory stimulation is an attempt to escape from this emptiness/discomfort.   


The restlessness/discomfort/emptiness that you feel is what is causing you to pursue these distractions + constant stimulation and I was the exact same way. Try to get a diagnosis, see a therapist, and work on those core issues and you will be able to overcome this, which is just a symptom of those core traits.",Hypnot1se,10oizcz

2,I call it a spiral but generally what happens is people with BPD have a tendency to spiral searching for that stimulation that they need. The worst time for the spiral is right around 30. And a lot of people with BPD don't make it past the 30th birthday. That seems to be the cut-off point. Knowing that you have that urge now will help you hopefully control it.

I’m in Pennsylvania and there’s a website for the PA state parks with free activities like kayaking, so I like to do those. I like to hike as well. I also started painting, cooking creatively, and doing embroidery. 

I really enjoy learning so I’ve been independently studying before continuing my education. That gives me a lot of structure. Udemy is a good option if there’s anything you want to learn about. Classes are on sale right now. I bought a drawing class. I’m not good at drawing so I thought it would be a good practice in letting myself not be good at something.

Try to have the same routine as you have on weekdays, but slowly. This way, you can relax deservedly and only think about how to fill out the gaps of time where you would have been usually working.

Doing things that you usually don't have time to do during weekdays might be a good start. Studying might also be a good candidate to fill out your time. Check websites like Coursera, Udemy, etc. Give you some time to hang out with yourself, get to know you better. Have you gone to the movies alone? It might surprise you! Call some friends, find a reason to arrange a get together. Look for something at your house that needs to be fixed or improved and do it!
