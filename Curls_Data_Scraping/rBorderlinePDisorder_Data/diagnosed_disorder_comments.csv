0,"It is possible to be stable while being diagnosed. Personally I have a history of suicide attempts, self harm, and hospitalizations but when I was diagnosed with BPD I was a sophomore in college in an honors program with a 3.6 GPA (I’m a junior now). There is something called “quiet bpd” which means we remain calm most of the time and are able to mask many of the symptoms. Just because we are stable doesn’t mean we suffer any less or don’t meet the criteria for a diagnosis.",AdBusy6029,1baslxy

2,I'm only functional when I'm single,basiliskliz,1baslxy
3,"I have a history of suicide attempt, struggles with substance use, and am overall a mess.

But i have a stable job and was even a manager before i stepped down, im also a college student and already have my associates. maybe that makes me functional?

Most people would view me at first glance as ""having it together"". i keep my struggles private.

I am not sure i classify myself as functional, but i suppose in a lot of ways i am. 

I am diagnosed.

I dont think this is a ""one size fits all"" diagnoses, it presents differently in everyone. The way i struggle may different than how you struggle.",MackieJ667,1baslxy
4,"Yes, this is me. I was diagnosed a few weeks ago but have been in DBT for 8 months before that and had gotten A LOT better. A lot of my diagnosis is based on my history, and not the last 6 ish months. I still have all the symptoms, but less severe & often. I had a 2.0 gpa, and was on academic probation because I only had a 60% completion rate for my classes as well as a very volatile relationship. Since I started DBT, I've been getting a 3.0+ every term and completed all courses, and my relationship has been better than ever.",,1baslxy
5,"You can be functional with BPD. The number of criteria you have doesn't quantify how functional you are either. You can have 5/9 criteria (the minimum for diagnosis) and have it so severely that it becomes a serious disability, or you can meet all 9 criteria and function fairly well.

BPD is a spectrum, and each of the criteria can be mild to severe. 

I meet 7 of the 9 criteria and thankfully I'm been largely functional—much more in the last 6 months are a couple of years of therapy and medication.",princefruit,1baslxy
6,"You don’t have to fit all 9 criteria. The official requirement is 5, but even then, if the four you struggle with are severe, you still qualify. At the end of the day though, the diagnostic criteria is for insurance companies which is dumb considering many won’t cover you if you have that diagnosis. When I was first diagnosed, I’ll admit that I was a severe case. I had a history of going in and out of treatment centers/hospitals for self-harm and suicidal ideation. My impulsivity was off the charts and I couldn’t hold down a job to save my life. I also had a severe ED. 

That being said, you don’t have to have a severe case to be diagnosed. A skilled clinician who has worked with you for an extensive amount of time can look at early childhood experiences and your behavior over time to make that assessment. We all present differently and no two people with BPD are alike.",existentialdread0,1baslxy
7,"People like me initially. they find me humorous, honest, intelligent, and emphatic. Not that I believe them. Being good looking (full of long dark blonde hair at 32, good proportions, in shape, with a masculine face and deep green eyes) also helps at first.  Then a barrier between me and then forms. Then I fuck up somewhere. I am unable to mend without worsening the situation, and I become the strange guy who you prefer to quietly leave alone. At that point I hate myself to the nth degree and either close off and impulsively escape, erasing their numbers, or disastrously vent. Fuel to the fuel. It's a disaster.

I just want to be loved. I just want something it's not appropriate for a functioning adult to ask.",,1baslxy

15,CBT therapy really does it dude. I didn’t realize til years later how it completely changed my way of thinking like to the core.

17,"I think this is incorrect at least for me. i’m in my MSc, I had a job before that and got my BSc in Neuroscience so i 100% appeared functional and i’ve been diagnosed by both a psychologist and psychiatrist within the past year. I described my life experiences to them and my reactions within my relationship and was diagnosed. 

I meet all 9 criteria but I’m not currently suicidal or self harming (or engaging in eating disorder behaviours or other impulsivity) so I’m working towards remission but at the time of diagnosis I suffered from all 9. Now it’s mostly crippling fear of abandonment and mood swings and a lot of derealization.",fuckjohnmayer13,1baslxy
18,i would say i was “functional” when i got diagnosed. no history of suicide attempts or hospitalizations (however was recently sober after becoming an alcoholic),beautifulballofchaos,1baslxy
19,"Very functional. I am 34 now, I was diagnosed maybe around 25? I was in graduate school at the time and then I got a full time job in a big city. And I’ve held stable jobs ever since. I even have a spouse and a child. I sometimes get screened for bipolar disorder. 

Marriage has been tough because of my BPD. I have done a lot of crap like threatening divorce just because I was hurt. Lots of fights. Lots of emotions. Needing lots of validation. But I’m working through it. 

I had 1 suicide attempt at 14. I had anger problems in my low 20s, to include punching a hole in my wall. I attended an outpatient 3 times a week program for anger and BPD while I worked a full time job when I was 25. I’ve self harmed several times, crushed a light bulb in my hand once. 

But all of this has been done in the privacy of my home. Nobody would ever know in a million years I have BPD. I suspect if you were to ask my friends about me, they’d say I’m pretty put together. The therapist I see now doesn’t specialize in BPD, so she doesn’t really validate my diagnosis now, but I was diagnosed once and I relate to it so much especially when it comes to issues in my marriage. Like the problems my husband and I have make no sense. He’s an amazing person, I’m a kind and nice person. But we fight a lot and I know that’s on me. But I’m working through it all. We both are. I’m lucky to have someone like him who sticks with me. 

My therapist did tell me apparently that BPD is worse when you’re younger. 

I will say, sometimes I don’t feel like my mental health issues get validated because I am functional. But I know I have pretty severe mental health issues and I hate the idea that I have to pretty much burn my life down to be taken seriously. I appear put together from the outside but behind the curtain, I’m not as functional as I seem. 

My friend told me she has BPD and she’s functional too. She has burned a lot of friendships. But aside from that she’s so personable and does well in her field and holds jobs.",Particular-Hat-4634,1baslxy
20,"I’m sort of functional? I currently DoorDash and do the delivery stuff like that, but there are days I just cannot get out of the house to work at all. I wasn’t diagnosed when I held a job for 9 years (it was with a company that was sort of difficult to lose your job with), just with ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and GAD (I knew I didn’t have GAD because I was only anxious some of the time).",mean_trash_monster,1baslxy
21,"Define functional, but yeah. It was tricky because I knew that I hide my symptoms well enough that if I didn’t go to someone who understood the disorder really well I might not have been diagnosed, and I think I was probably right about that. I have a much more internalized presentation than a lot of people, and I’m pretty good at avoiding my bpd triggers by this point in my life- namely attachments of any kind- so I think it would’ve been missed by most garden variety professionals.",VioletVagaries,1baslxy

23,"I think this is more in line of the “disorder” part and what constitutes “functional”. One can have the disorder and still function in society, but I can’t imagine it would be a good quality of life.",aquizzicalgal,1baslxy
24,"I have quiet BPD, so I look “high functioning”. I have a stable job, I have a friend, and I’m not constantly lashing out at people. All of the symptoms get directed inward for me though. It’s a lot of self-loathing. At one point in my life I met all 9 criteria but was appearing “high functioning”.",Curious_Problem1631,1baslxy
25,"Yes it's possible, I have comorbit OCPD, it just means I always try to keep in controle (maybe it's kind of like quiet BPD). I don't meet every BPD criteria but it's enough to be diagnosed with it. I always had troubles to identify with it, because there are lot's of symptoms that aren't typical in my case. For example I'm not impulsive, I try my best to keep calm (which leads to a lot of situations where inside myself I am just really fucked but you can't see it on the outside, for example my psychiatrist told me last week that I don't seem like someone with my intensity of depression, afterwards I told him that my jaw discus flipped out because I hold my heavy anger inside; another thing is dating, all my datemates had a hard time on getting to know how I feel. I don't act on the mood swings, so even if I am really unstable inside, you'll not see it on how I am acting.) in my example I think I went quiet or developed OCPD characteristics as Trauma coping. My childhood has been really messy and my caregivers where really depressed and holded there emotions inside, parallel to this I was punished for showing intense emotions (either good or bad) in school and when I went inpatient (I have been inpatient in my youth because of Anorexia, my last three therapist said I have Trauma from it). So yeah you can meet the criteria, because how you think and feel can be quite different than how you act. And while you can be more functional in everyday life this doesn't mean you feel better. I think in some cases you can compare it to folks on the autistic spectrum: while masking leads them to be more functional it isn't quite healthy.",Schmulli,1baslxy
26,"i missed a potentially useful initial diagnosis just under two years ago bcs of how “functioning” i was as i was recently graduated and starting a masters, moving into a new uni house, etc. (i ended up having the most traumatic and self destructive summer of my Life) - if i was formally diagnosed then i think it could have potentially gotten me into a safer place before shit hit the fan hahaha

now that i am diagnosed, i definitely dont see myself as “functional” as i was proposed to be, but im slowly getting there! just lots of bumps but i am thankful to have the diagnosis now",loudbarkteethbite,1baslxy
27,"I was mostly stable when diagnosed. My past was filled with failures, suicide attempts, addictions, and unhealthy impulsive behaviors (like sex or shopping). I still was getting very panicky when diagnosed and fighting those impulsive behaviors but when getting diagnosed with BPD they look at the overall history of you and how you currently are, not just the snapshot they see in the moment.",SquirrlyHex,1baslxy
28,"I feel like most people have to be either a current train wreck or have a long history of it to get diagnosed. That's basically the point of the diagnosis. You don't fit in to what society wants you to be, a functioning upstanding citizen, so you get labeled with BPD. Even though it's all predictable trauma responses. Its the new hysteria diagnosis for angry abused women (mostly). 

I was diagnosed at 37. Quiet type. Masters degree. I could hold down professional jobs for a few years, crying in the bathroom and strategically calling out. Until i couldn't and had to quit. Only my partners, closest friends and family saw the meltdowns. I went to therapists but it was always seen as anxiety and depression. Adhd & ODD dx when i was a teenager.I did get a ptsd dx at 28. Grinned and bared it as long as I could, until I couldn't keep the mask up anymore and couldn't function anymore. That's when I finally got diagnosed :)",blacktipwheat,1baslxy

I live in a shitty apartment however I'm saving for a down payment for a mortgage. My car isn't great, but it's been dependable and I've paid it off. Under doctor supervision I have ween off the SSRI I was on. I still struggle and honestly I've been having panic attacks that are mainly just episodes of depersonalization. But I've told 2 people I can trust and I'm going to be able to work on. I have hope and I feel very fortunate. It's been a long road to get to this point. With time, grace, patience and self awareness I feel like there is hope for people like us.",purple-lepoard-lemon,1baslxy
31,"I’m functional. Met all 9 criteria when I started therapy. Currently I’m in a stable relationship for 6+ years now (the man of my dreams tbh), a good job, real friends I can count on.

33,"I’m ‘functional’. Get good grades. I can hold a summer job. I heavily lean to quiet BPD so most of my problems stay internal. I had to bring it up to my therapist to get diagnosed, but I have 7/9 so we read through the criteria and she agreed I had it",hadeshellhound0,1baslxy
34,"My history is a hot mess. My therapist still regularly refers to the old me as a hot mess, verbatim. They officially diagnosed me after patterned years of drug abuse, suicide attempts, self harm, multipls job abandonment situations, reckless behavior, ED... etc at age 21 I believe, especially after bipolar medications all failed and my symptoms persisted. Ultimately, I was the typical case and definitely not functional at diagnosis. However, while my therapist says she considers me mostly recovered, as I'm stable and functional now, she still considers me under the diagnosis and not so much in ""remission"" so to speak as my thought patterns lead to occasional but less intense behavioral problems. I can see that someone considered functional would fit the criteria, given this.",SingleDadSoundcloud,1baslxy
35,"I pretty much meet all 9 criteria. I was functional but not to a high level, I could only manage to work part time which I blamed on being a carer for my mother, but honestly my mental health was a huge reason why. I did get good grades and was good at and completed multiple courses of study. As for friendships and relationships they were few to non existent and often turbulent. But when I was diagnosed (in hospital after presenting to the ED suicidal), I was working 30 hours a week, caring for my chronically ill mum including during a hospital stay and surgery, taking care of a 3 person household, managing my own finances and paying bills etc etc",universe93,1baslxy
36,"Yep. I met all nine criteria when I was first diagnosed in 2005, and again in 2018 when I was having a tough time and ended up back under a psychiatrist. Don't get me wrong, I was a stinking mess. But I'd been working multiple jobs and getting through a tough university course, with a string on semi-long term, very volatile  relationships (5-8 years each). I have no idea how I was functioning, I was in active addiction, and was the picture of bpd - SH, unstable relationships, volatile, suicidal to varying degrees and strings of hospital admissions when needed. I think part of it was that I'm a stubborn fucker and a perfectionist and feel like I've got something to prove. 

Currently, I still meet diagnostic criteria, but probably not all nine I don't think (I'd have to remind myself what they are lol). I try very very hard not to make bpd my main personality trait, I work DBT skills regularly, see therapists regularly when needed, and remember how proud younger me would be to see where I am today. I absolutely have flare ups, and allow myself a certain 'indulgence' into the depths, but I HATE being out of control so have identified those things and just avoid them at all costs. I seek external structure from demanding jobs and  am keen to present a face of stability, even when behind closed doors I'm a self destructive mess. Journaling helps. I rant and hate and love a lot in there, so the outside world never gets to see it.",badgerhoneyy,1baslxy
37,"Yeah, I did a full psych eval for an adhd diagnosis and hit 5/9 bpd. I didn't even know the questions were for anything other than adhd. At the time I was like, no way, but the doctor recommended I read up on it and really think about it, and he was right. I struggle and am frustrated a lot and getting worse I think, but manage to get to work 5 days a week and keep myself fed and clean enough. I am unable to maintain relationships though, and that's been something that over time has been pretty devastating.",cat_turd_burglar,1baslxy

39,"I've (f70) been ""functional"" all of my life as I didn't know what else to do. I knew that my thoughts and actions were a ""little"" off, but I could hide it - mostly. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 64 or 65 yo and coming out of an abusive relationship. It seemed like it was time to get some mental health help to help my life-long depression and anxiety. I also struggle with PTSD. The BPD was just the cherry on top.

I've been doing OK. I say ""fine"" as I have three different tee-shirts with the ""I'm Fine, everything is fine"" variation on them. One of them just says ""I'm fine"" along with a big bloody spot on the side. Lately, I haven't been fine.

At present, I'm not as functional as I was at the end of last year. December 30th is a tough day as that's the anniversary of my mom's death. This year, I was woken up on the 30th with a phone call from my very good friend saying that his wife had passed away during the night. He was what my peer support at the mental health clinic called my ""ride or die"" friend. He took me to doctors appointments and helped with my getting around as I don't drive anymore. (And, my town is glad I don't. I can't see as well as I need to to drive). I'm going to have to move as the apartments where I live have been sold and the new owners have plans for my apartment part of the house. I don't know how I'm gonna move, but I'll figure it out when the time comes.

Anyway, my friend is just broken. They had been married for over 50 years. He adored her. He wasn't able to stay in their house, so one of his kids took him to their place. He's going to stay close to one of his kids, and it's like I'm mourning the end of our friendship.",desertrosebhc,1baslxy
40,"I was fairly functional (in comparison to how I've been in the past, at least) when I was diagnosed. I was going to college, I'd been able to keep some longterm friendships without blowing it all up, I wasn't having public meltdowns, and I wasn't actively suicidal or self-injuring. Internally, I was a mess. My grades were bad, I had trouble holding down a job for more than a few months, I wasn't taking care of myself, and I'd moved onto less noticeable ways of self harming. But I was functioning.

I think I got diagnosed because I was proactive about it. I recognized my symptoms, got to a point where some of my tendencies got concerning, and contacted a specialist specifically to ask about BPD. Most of the time, if you directly bring up a disorder you suspect you have, you'll get brushed off. I'm lucky that the specialist I'd reached out to was receptive. We went through the criteria, went through my history, did some tests, and she agreed that I had BPD.

42,"Tbh I’m very stable now thankfully. I hit most of the criteria but I’m quiet BPD and have learned to cope with stuff when by myself. My life isn’t a series of breakdowns etc, it’s not. I notice when my emotions are starting to take control and learned to slow down and breathe and tell myself the truth of what’s going on, vs letting the emotions rule",ComplaintRepulsive52,1baslxy
43,"So I'm not really sure about getting signed on when you're mostly sane, but the criteria for having been stabilized is being able to maintain a single relationship and being able to work. So if you can get diagnosed with higher functioning than that I think it's a really fun story that insurance no longer gives a f*** when we basically have one artery left pumping blood",_-whisper-_,1baslxy
44,"I was diagnosed and not told until my therapist moved on and another took over my case notes. I normally have 6-9 of the criteria going on at any time, but i hold together pretty well. I’ve had plenty of emotional washouts, relationship turmoil, etc, but haven’t had an actual attempt in more than a decade. It’s been less than a week since last SH but I manage to refrain from bringing blood at this point. No one would ever know. 
I dunno how much is functioning well and how much is masking, but I’ve held down most jobs for more than a year, some for three years when I really liked the company. I have a college degree and good credit. I’ve been a homeowner. Now a mom. See my most recent post for the worst of it, but I’m doing okay, really.

51,"I was initially diagnosed at age 16 (1999) and was a hot mess at that time. Not really functional at all. 



I didn’t really engage with the mental health system again (not my choice - no insurance) until 2013. 



Between 1999 and 2013 I had managed to get my shit together. On my own. Gone to, and graduated, medical school, and started a psychiatry residency. Most importantly, gotten out of my abusive household. And gone low contact with my abuser (mother). 



But, although BPD symptoms had quieted down in that time, depression and anxiety were through the roof. 




In 2013 I started seeing a therapist and also got on meds. 




No provider or therapist I saw, until 2019, diagnosed me with BPD again. 



In 2019 I had a med change and became acutely suicidal. And, all of a sudden, my therapist diagnosed me with BPD. (I would like to add that my psychiatrist and I talked about this extensively at this time and he disagreed with this diagnosis). 



I was still functional. Working long hours as a psychiatrist. Only to go home and cry myself to sleep while wishing I would just die already. And making multiple suicide attempts every day. But functional. 



Once meds got figured out I was no longer suicidal. I left that therapist. 


The therapist I am working with now, for the last year and a half, does not have me diagnosed as BPD. Even though I am once again going through a med change, as we speak, and struggling with SI again (but no attempts this time - yay!). Even with the increase in depression and anxiety, and the SI, I am still going into work each day and functioning well there. At home, well, I mostly sit on the couch and watch tv. 



Long answer and I don’t know if it even answers your question.





I also want to say, as a psychiatrist, as a mental health worker, a big loud FUCK YOU to all of the mental health workers out there that continue to stigmatize this diagnosis.



There’s a reason I fight admitting I have BPD (as you can see from everything I wrote above that is basically one big justification for why I don’t actually have BPD) and it is because every time my unit has a patient with BPD the stuff that is said behind closed doors is so fucking nasty (and, can you believe, it took me a long time to get it to the point where this stuff was said behind CLOSED doors. RNs used to sit in the back room, with the door to the unit wide open, talking shit about these patients. At least now the door is closed.) And I don’t  want ppl to be thinking/talking about me that way. We (the mental health field) need to get our shit together with this. Because right now we really fucking suck.",ECAHunt,1baslxy

I was heavily neglected as a child and as a result am pretty independent and a loner socially. All the red flags went unnoticed or ignored, or I was simply blamed and shamed and shut out. So, I learned to be discreet. No one knew what I had going on under the surface, I didn’t know how to let people know me like that (still don’t). 
I eventually sought help on my own and despite being a generally toxic person, I was putting myself through school and living on my own.

I'm almost 37 now and things have GREATLY mellowed out for me to where my therapist believes my symptoms are in remission. I also have OCD and ADHD, which I still deal with...but I have to consistently put in the work to feel even keeled. It's exhausting sometimes, but I'd rather be consistently trying then consistently feeling doom. Lots of DBT/CBT, exercise/eating healthier has helped tons, getting off social media, and just focusing on what is good for me. A bonus was finding a very loving and supportive partner. I didn't get into my first healthy relationship until my mid 30s, which has also made things very quiet for me. I had a series of bad relationships and made a list of dealbreakers for me that i adhered to when i started dating again, and Im glad i did that. A partner is not a must by any means.... but I know BPD peeps have a hard time with relationships and we tend to dive into anything. Don't settle for anything that you know does not work for you!

Right now, very few therapists even accept Medicare/Medicaid and the ones who do tend to be shitty, which is problematic considering BPD is difficult to treat and requires advanced clinical training.

If you try to find someone who specializes in BPD, they will charge you a fortune and will tell you that they don’t take insurance. If they’re strictly DBT-trained, you have to pay for their individual sessions ($250+) and their group sessions ($100+).",existentialdread0,1baslxy

Since then I've been forced to quit my job to help my family only for that family to kick me out, requiring to me to move across the country in two weeks to somewhere I'm not technically allowed to live in but its my best option right now. Hoping to get mental health support soon (but i live in the US so healthcare be damned for those who can't afford it), and im gonna try to be more aggressively open.

I chalked it up to insecurities surrounding the fact that I'd just been dumped from a rocky 3 1/2 yr relationship. After getting kicked out of a couple treatment centers and a few mental breakdowns (screaming at my team and throwing furniture around the facilities) I still had no idea. I knew I had some rage, but I truly felt righteous in my emotions. I knew I liked sex and boys, but what straight girl doesn't, right? Oblivious to my ways, I kept hooking up with guys or getting crushes on them. Finally, at my 4th treatment center, this girl who was training to be a psychologist accidentally spilled the beans. She blurted out, ""And what have you been working on since your borderline diagnosis?"" My jaw fell to the floor. In retrospect, I think I was in some sort of denial, because upon entry at the first facility, I ripped up the paper that had the ""23 Symptoms of BPD Checklist"" on it and laughed in their face when they urged me to fill it out.

3,"Totally depends on what symptoms you’re struggling with most, on what tips you’d need. 

How old are you? If you’re young, my advice would be steer clear of bad habits. Don’t get led down the path of self medicating for relief, and find alternatives that calm you asap. Figuring out your safe space is imperative, regardless of age. Don’t feel shamed if you need to spend 7 hours on elder scrolls one day to stop you from going over the edge. 


Be honest. With everyone. Even if it’s uncomfortable. Therapy won’t work properly if you aren’t telling them everything. Relationships will suffer if you don’t address issues. Taking time to talk openly and calmly can help with some of the shitty self doubt/self loathing mindsets we so easily find ourselves in. 

Medication does work. There are sooo many medical professionals (especially here in the UK) that say bpd cannot be managed with meds. It’s bullshit. Meds absolutely can help, but finding the right ones can be a perilous journey. I currently take four different medications to keep my mental health issues under control. I will however add, I have lots of other mental health issues that affect me more than bpd does. I do believe that this is something that many of us in this community experience. Bpd almost always comes along with other issues. 


Sleep hygiene and routine is absolutely fucking essential, without a good routine and a safe sleep space, all of the above become impossible. 

Lastly, treat yourself with kindness. You aren’t bpd, you just happen to be a person *with* bpd, and you deserve as much kindness and love as anyone else. You are worthy of self love, and you deserve it, endlessly. 

💕💕💕💕💕💕",jaycakes30,1cfgofl
4,"I would most definitely look into getting an SSRI if you suffer from depression as well as BPD. It took me a few tries to figure out what depression medication worked for me, but I ended up landing on Sertraline. I’m looking into getting on a mood stabilizer as well. Get a psychiatrist and work with them on getting you on medication that’s right for you. No medication works the same for every person, and you may have to cycle through several medications before finding one that works. I went through two different SSRI’s before landing on sertraline and both of them affected me differently. 

DBT and talk therapy are great forms of therapy to look into. Depending upon what kind of BPD you have, CBT could be more harmful than helpful. I know CBT doesn’t work for me at all because I’m so tender hearted and sensitive. It’s a harsher form of therapy, and I don’t do well with that. You can look up BPD symptoms and coping mechanisms online as well. I’ve found this Subreddit and BPD TikTok to be very informative. I also went on a rabbit hole through YouTube watching interviews with a BPD specialist and that helped me a lot. 

The most important thing about maintaining a relationship with BPD is to be completely open about your feelings with your partner. You have to communicate your needs, otherwise they won’t know how to help you. It’s a lot of, “It hurt me when you did this, do you think you can do this instead to help me out?”. 

My BPD has caused far too many arguments between me and my husband over the past 10 years, as I was just recently diagnosed as well. One thing we made sure of was to never go to bed angry. We’ve realized over these years that most of our arguments stem from miscommunication because we’re both very emotional individuals. Try to give your partner the benefit of the doubt, because a lot of the time us BPD folks are reacting to perceived abandonment instead of reality. 

I wish you the best of luck, and if you need anything else, we’re but a post away.",Significant-Beach436,1cfgofl

I can give you a very great tip, don’t leave therapy, it can help you a lot, if you wanna leave do it when you feel comfortable, and if you need it again it’s ok, try leaving you comfort zone, past a few months you be capable of see how far you will be from the start🤠",Technical-Active8780,1cfgofl

Are you doing any trauma work with a psychologist? I’ve just started EMDR for my childhood trauma, and I’ve heard it helps a lot if you can stick it out, but it’s definitely hard work. The intense anger that you’re struggling with is linked to all of this. It’s a response to perceived dangers, even if there aren’t any. I was the same with losing my shit over absolutely nothing, but time really has helped that, and personally for me, using cannabis to relax me does help, but I am not for one second recommending you start using drugs to cope.

2,"He’s incorrect about personality disorders not being able to be diagnosed prior to 26. I suggest finding a new therapist for a second opinion if you are concerned or not vibing with your current provider. I had a therapist who told me I didn’t have BPD, just C-PTSD, but I knew she was wrong. I went to a new therapist who was experienced in PDs, and while she did agree I had it pretty much immediately, she waited over 10 months to officially provide the diagnosis. It’s now been confirmed by a psychiatrist as well as a forensic psychologist. 

It’s honestly also not a label I’d ever actively seek again due to the stigma around it though.

6,"It's not enough to meet the criteria cold, because to become a diagnosis the magnitude of the effect of the problem has to be severe enough in each of the symptoms. Maybe that's why his responses are the way they are. Maybe you meet the criteria for diagnosis but none of it is severe enough to be considered a disorder. While I understand what you're saying and even though it seems like the therapist ignores what you're saying, self diagnosis is a bad practice. About the second part, of not being 26, I'd disagree with. I guess you can get a second opinion from another professional. Just please don't diagnose yourself and keep an open mind that maybe you don't have the disorder but something different.",Ny432,1ao8hrt
7,"I had the same problem with my therapist, it can be about his approach.

I don't know where you live  but in my country therapists cant diagnose, they need to referral you to a psychitrist.

I had two closed friends with bpd and everything clicked so much, I started bringing up in therapy and she always said something that felt a little dismissive but kind at the same time, so it didn't triggered me so much.

One day I had enough and cryied about her ""dismissiveness"" on this specific subject, and she was a little more direct with me and said something like this:

""I'm not here to put you a label in you and throw you in a box, I'm here to understand how you you see the world and help you on things that hurt you, show you ways to deal with society that can help you, but not erase who you are or try to make you like everyone else. I believe personality disorders just have this negative conotation because society has an unjust structure where everything slightly outside of this perfection in our role to keep the machine going is seen as a threat. 

If having this kind of label will bring you peace of mind, I can referral you to a specialist, but aside all that, I fear as soon as you have it you'll go through the simptoms and start acting on symptoms you don't even have yet, or maybe would never develop, just to finally feel like a part of a group. So, what do you think will be better to your healing journey?""

Honestly, I didn't agree with some of the stuff, but I really wasn't ready to deal with the stigma, and was doing well without meds.

Even when I started taking meds, it was with a psychistrist that too didn't believe in labels, and had a simmilar talk to me in my 1st appointment, saying that the diagnose she put down was merely something that could change according to the meds I was needing at the time.

The official diagnose only came because of an ER visit when I was in crisis. (And it did a little problem when I firs tryied to get health insurance trough work)

I don't know if this is better in general, but specifically for me I realised this approach really helped me much more than if it was diagnosed, and just now I first heard about depathologization of life, I'll pretend to read more about it to undesrtand better why it helped me in this time.

But it really is easier knowing there are people with simmilar feelings and struggles, to be able to discuss it and try new ways to deal with stuff.

All this to say: if you feel too dismissed, maybe you can start a new conversation about what is his aproach and if he has other concerns in mind about making diagnoses",nimoniac,1ao8hrt
8,"I’ll be honest as someone diagnosed with BPD. It may not be BPD what you are describing are common traits with ADHD and ASD too and they are often misdiagnosed in women and highly inherited. Also, whilst in some respects he is correct about the brain not being fully developed until 26, they have found in neurodivergent brains this doesn’t happen until much later or even it never reaches full maturity. 

You also don’t want to be stuck with this label unnecessarily. The diagnosis doesn’t actually matter, what matters is that your symptoms are addressed and you find something to help with them regardless of the cause. Most things like personality disorders and other developmental mental disorders actually benefit from the same types of therapy and medication. 

I would consider exploring the possibility of other neurodivergence’s, it does of course depend on how long those symptoms have been in your life as well.",Magurndy,1ao8hrt

You also don't realize that even if you were to be diagnosed, it wouldn't change a thing. You need therapy to develop healthy coping mechanisms to help you go through that. Medications can only come from a psychiatrist and believe me it's not miraculous as just taking a pill everyday and everything is better. You will still not feel normal, just differently. For some people it works but for some it doesn't.

17,"Find a better therapist that doesn't invalidate you. 

I am a therapist. I actually specialize in BPD, and I may sometimes not give a diagnosis right away. But I certainly don't tell my clients that they dont know their own experiences. 

I don't know why a symptom that you describe as troubling to you would ever be labeled as ""normal""  by a competent diagnostician. If it causes you distress and/or impairment, then it isn't ""normal""; It is, by definition, ""disordered"".

Ideally, a diagnostician should observe someone over a period of time before a final diagnosis of a personality disorder is given. However, a provisional diagnosis, based on the person's reported lived experience is appropriate until they can be certain. There are few reasons that a person would try to fake a diagnosis of BPD.

Edit: also, he is wrong about the brain needing to be fully developed. A diagnosis of BPD is appropriate anytime after the age of 18. That is part of the actual diagnostic criteria. 

By saying that your eating disorder is because your parents didn't teach you better. This therapist is actively gaslighting you. In a reverse way, but it still qualifies as gaslighting. He's making you feel like your experience isn't real and preventing you from getting treatment that you need.",hateboresme,1ao8hrt
18,"I would not necessarily worry about getting an official diagnosis, as long as you are managing your symptoms. I was told I had BPD over 20 years ago and although I was glad to have an understanding of what I was experiencing and why, I found myself over identifying with the diagnosis. It became not just something I have, but who I was. It contributed to me feeling worthless and like something was innately wrong with me due to all the reading I did on the condition and the stigma associated with it. My current psychologist admitted that I qualify for the diagnosis but we don’t focus on it. It does help drive the treatment.

My list includes: autism, OCD, PTSD, depression, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, ADHD, catatonic depression, OSDD, and anorexia.

I'm not really sure how my BPD interacts with some of these other diagnoses. I think several of them might have been a misdiagnosis - I've been getting mental health treatment since I was a minor, and minors aren't generally diagnosed with personality disorders because their personality is still developing. 

I think it's good to remember that diagnoses aren't cut and dry the way another medical diagnosis might be. Every disorder listed is a list of symptoms that generally occur together, but they're not concrete things the way something like, say, appendicitis is. The lines between different disorders are blurry - that's part of the reason why the DSM gets updated so often, because the diagnostic criteria is constantly being reworked.",crownemoji,169kwrk

Then once they have the information to be able to identify the symptoms/issues and what they do for them that they can make more progress towards their personal treatment journey.

It is good that you are aware of some of the issues you have been experiencing and I do hope that you can get some answers to your questions.

110,"It is quite interesting to me too. The way it was explained to me from my psych doc was that because of the combo of diagnoses I have that I do have depression as a baseline from both. It is just when both start doing it together that it sends me into a ""super depression"" as he put it. Thats when the psychosis begins and starts getting crazy up in there. But then when my mania episodes hit from the BP II it is leveled out mostly by the MDD trying to bring down but then the BPD swings come and can send me from one extreme to the other over the matter of a week. The best way I describe is like a game of tetris where the pieces will line up just right and things go great but more keep coming anyways. Never know what will come after the next one until just before and your still trying to fix the mess you already got while trying to figure out where the next is going to go. Anxiety as the blocks begin to stack and you start to run out of room. Depression as you know the blocks will never stop coming and it is pointless because it only stops when you lose. The psychosis is bad when it get to the ""nothing matters anyways, it is never going get better until it ends"" kind of thing lol the adhd is jamming to the soundtrack and watching the pretty colors hyperfixating to figure it out or just zoned out and autopilot has sorted the blocks with no real rhyme or reason. 

It is quite confusing to me too and I don't know how else to try and describe it to help understand lol it even confuses the professionals I see sometimes because they don't know which one is feeding into the others. They even tend to contradict one another through the symptoms.

You could have a group of people who were all diagnosed with the same disorder but yet none of them are the same because thats how people are. It is a person to person basis.

The other things like OCD, Bipolar I & II, as well as ADHD and such have been common among these replies. I wonder if there had been a study between the correlation of things like autoimmune diseases and BPD. While there has probably got to be some about the BPD and other mental illnesses. The other mental illnesses tend to overlap in some of the ways that the symptoms present so I can see some potential for misdiagnosis while also being a correct diagnosis and having a correlation with each other.",thraway2004,169kwrk

140,"i am diagnosed both bipolar 2 and bpd (amongst others) and they are two separate diagnoses that require separate treatment. approximately 20% of people with bpd have bipolar and vice versa, and it doesn’t eradicate either diagnosis. bipolar requires mood stabilising and/or antipsychotic medication to stabilise, where bpd tends to need therapy, sometimes alongside meds but usually not the same course as you’d be prescribed for bipolar. there is overlap between the treatment of them - both can benefit from therapy, and to an extent, medication - but they are fundamentally different disorders. bpd is a personality disorder while bipolar is a mood disorder and as such they have both different causes, different treatments, and also different illness trajectories. 10 years post diagnosis, with adequate treatment, around 50% of pwbpd will no longer fit the criteria for bpd; this is not the case for bipolar. if you are CORRECTLY (and emphasis on correctly) diagnosed with bipolar, you will deal with it for the rest of your life, and most people diagnosed will need to be medicated for life. this is because it is a progressive disorder (ie gets worse) - every mood episode that happens to a pwbipolar does tangible damage to the brain that can be seen on a scan, which worsens bipolar symptoms inexorably. as such, it is crucial for medication to be implemented. in contrast, medication for bpd is only provided under specific contexts, and antidepressants may be a more suitable course of action, although this is not always the case. when they co-occur, treatment is more complex, but because of the high rates of comorbidity out there it is fairly well documented. please feel free to ask questions!",theonetruebicon,169kwrk

I definitely agree regarding labels helping/not helping different people. Personally, I feel very validated having a word to encompass my issues, and being able to find communities (like this one) with likeminded people. Diagnoses, or labels, can be very helpful when trying to find specific tools or treatment plans. But that’s ultimately what they’re for, and it definitely can be harmful when people become obsessive over finding the right label rather than focusing on their specific symptoms.

For starters, Bipolar II and MDD can't be diagnosed comorbidly as MDD is actually an exclusionary diagnosis for BP II as outlined in the DSM-V-TR. Additionally, cPTSD isn't officially in the DSM and there's quite a few professionals in the field who are somewhat doubtful that it even exists as its own meaningful nosological diagnosis. And your mood swings, as you've described them, are not really characteristic of BPD:

I really can’t show any emotions outside and I can shut them off for most times but I have episodes when I am complete vulnerable mess. When I fall in love (if you can call this love) in beginning I am obsessed with them and love bomb them and treat them as typically borderlines do with their favourite person, but if they start showing me too much love back it usually turns around and I just use them for validation and my advantage (I recently am really trying not to be in relationships because of that and get my validation in other ways). I am extremely obsessed with myself and self-centred. I noticed that when I am not doing well I show more borderline traits, I have problems with impulsiveness, fear of abandonment, paranoia, self destructive behaviour, aggression and when I am doing well I show more narcissistic traits as in self-absorbance, lack of empathy, grandiosity, manipulation. 
I thought it’s super rare because of what my therapist told me but there is a lot of people in npd subreddit with both, I just feel most rather talk about npd because they think also having bpd makes them weak and vulnerable. To me it’s not like that, I thinks my bpd makes me more human and in some weird way I’m happy that I have both even though it’s hell sometimes

as for the physical - i’m waiting for a total knee replacement, back surgery and a tendon repair in my ankle. i can’t walk without crutches and i’m in constant, chronic pain. i’ve already had 5 knee surgeries and i smashed my collarbone a few years ago which needed 13 revisions. i have a permanent plate and 7 screws holding that together. 

i just got rehoused by the council and now have a secure lifetime tenancy. weirdly, this has been really difficult to accept. i’ve moved around my whole life and never really had a place i called home. 2 divorces and some really bad relationships left me broken. i’m now engaged to a woman and never been more stable. one of my main abusers died last week and that’s thrown me as well. i’m not sleeping despite medication and when i do it’s nightmares all the time. i’m very glad to be in therapy right now.

i don’t think anyone who doesn’t live with BPD can understand what it’s like from the inside. it has such a bad rep for us being manipulative, unstable liars. i describe it as bipolar on speed, with the occasional side-trip into psychotic episodes. not to diminish the experience of anyone with bipolar, obviously. it’s a fucking hard road tho and i never expected my life at 50 to look like it does. mostly i’m shocked that i even made it.",BINGGBONGGBINGGBONGG,169kwrk

The MDD diagnosis has been kept on since 2012 and then later on at 2020 the with psychotic features was added and kept on there. The ADHD and PTSD diagnoses came around the same time (2013) as the original MDD on as well. In 2019 I got diagnosed with BP II at a psych ward (who i still see their NP as my psychiatrist). Next in 2021 was a different hospital and provider who diagnosed me with the OCD. In 2020 ended up going to a long term place who then diagnosed me with BPD. The list just kept building. 

It is honestly me not understanding how my brain if sanction that has caused the miscommunication of how it is coming out. I struggle to articulate properly my thoughts at the time.

In the part you quoted is the bipolar II dragging me to depression episode and during that episode I will experience the mood swings of the BPD which can be strong enough to flip my depressive wave from Bipolar II to the opposite extreme and send me to mania for a bit while the emotions from the bpd swing is gone shortly after the bipolar is still going and keeping me in a mania until I eventually crash again in a depression.

Something that a couple of my past therapists have told me is that there is quite commonly a link between PTSD and BPD. That they have been taught that when they get someone with a personality disorder such as BPD that 9 times out of 10 there will be a PTSD accompaniment and if it is already there on the list of diagnoses that even if it doesn't have the C on it for complex that is more times complex anyways than not but adding the C isn't usually a worry when they already kind of know.

Every single person with it is a little different, and if you can look through the symptoms and identify yours that's huge.

He was like ""Yeah, I kinda thought you might be too.""

5,"The first therapist I saw, we had a little sit down and discussed diagnoses. One of our earliest sessions. I mentioned I had suspected BPD for years. She went through the symptoms with me and I met enough and voila, diagnosed. Not sure why they told you it has to be after months of therapy, but the person I saw was a therapist. Maybe it's different where you are (are you outside of the US?) or maybe more difficult for them if you have Bipolar Disorder. edit: I just realized I had actually talked about my trauma to my therapist beforehand, and she had probably observed me a little (though again it was an early session) before she did diagnoses, so maybe it is true.

Luckily, whenever you can see a therapist in the future, you can find a DBT therapist purposefully and you won't need a diagnosis to get treatment for it. :) And you can buy DBT workbooks (I got mine secondhand and it wasn't used) on Amazon and try to do things yourself in the meantime.",misterreading,195i5vn

All my life I had been having horrible thoughts and doing horrible things, I had googled why I do things the way I do countless times but I never suspected BPD at all. I went in for my first ever psychiatrist visit at 19 and was diagnosed with BPD the same day. 

I would try to talk to the psychiatrist about what was going on with me but he just brushed everything off and started asking the questions in his book, yknow like the “if the patient agrees with 7/10 statements they have ____” and that’s how I was diagnosed.",k9bound,195i5vn

Carefully chose meds. Even though we’ve had to change them a lot. He recommended EMDR, it’s helping but it’s brutal, it’s for cptsd.

I had gone once before to talk about my ex (who I suspected of having BPD). This time I brought up BPD as a possibility for myself. Full interview with the intake clinician got me referred to a psychiatrist. Official diagnosis, then a referral to DBT at the same hospital.

That's the worst thing to do by the way because you'll start noticing things you have googled in your actions amd it might change how you view yourself if that makes sense.

I tried to kill myself after my depression got really bad and my dad had just come back into my life after years too so that was playing on my mind, kinda made me hella sad and obviously our emotions are 10x above stereotypical human beings so that's why I did that I guess.
Then I went into hospital and mental health people came and talked to me about it.
Told me I had it but I couldn't get diagnosed because of age so I had to be kept under observation for a while.
They let me go home after 3 weeks of begging but I have to wait till I'm 18 for an official diagnosis still.

Like oh, I don't have to be angry all the time...

I still had some episodes after DBT, but after meeting the right people and cutting out toxic friends/exes, I'd say it's like night and day. I'm much nicer to people, even my parents, my relationships are all stable, I have a new close friend group with zero drama, a healthy relationship where we don't fight...

You can lessen the symptoms with determination and will. Recognizing triggers and thought patterns will be hard sometimes, but the moment you do have a solid grasp on them, then life and personal relationships seem to be a little bit easier to navigate. I'm sure different things and coping mechanisms work differently with different people. But this is what has helped me begin to unwrap my mind and figure out how to semi tame it.

4,"Hey, welcome to the club! I’m glad you are finding understanding through the diagnosis, but I know this can be a scary and confusing time, too. That is totally normal and understandable. But please try to remember that you're no different than you were before your diagnosis - it doesn't change or define who you are. It's just putting a name and explanation to your symptoms, and it can guide your recovery going forward. BPD is very complex, and there’s a lot of stigma and misinformation out there, so be wary of that, and know that not everything you've heard so far may be true.  
  
One thing I find especially important to stress to the newly diagnosed is that BPD remission is not uncommon. I've been in remission for over 2 years, and I'm far enough in my recovery that I don't just have to cope with my symptoms or spend a lot of conscious effort resisting unhealthy behaviors. I’ve overcome a lot of symptoms. I love myself and love life, and I have close, healthy relationships. I thought I could never get here... but I have, and you can, too.  
  
It's hard for me to break down general advice in writing for everyone here who needs it, so I started a YouTube channel with BPD information and advice as well as other topics that have helped me on my recovery journey. https://www.youtube.com/@sarruhtonin if you're interested.

As someone who is in remission, has fully lost some symptoms, gained self love and identity, maintains stable close relationships, and no longer even feels the presence of that “BPD side,” I fully disagree with the idea that you never recover from it.

I am absolutely happy to be proved wrong though 😁",ImTheToxic01,1ar6l4u
10,"Well, I am definitely still a “highly sensitive person” and have strong emotions, even though they usually don’t fluctuate in extremes like they used to. I’ve always been that way, I don’t think it’s a result of my BPD, and I don’t think it will change. I’ve questioned people on Reddit a few times, and it seems to be the most common “building block” for BPD no matter the subtype. 

I haven’t found anyone yet who hasn’t had especially strong emotions from a young age (even if they had to hide and internalize them), but not all people with emotional sensitivity end up with BPD. Add in invalidation and/or trauma, and it’s more likely. 

SO yeah, I’m not saying that will necessarily go away. But healing core wounds, recovering from BPD, better understanding yourself and others, improving wellness in other ways, etc can all lead to much more positive emotions than negative, and better reactions to and acceptance of the negative. 

This past summer I experienced heartbreak, illness, and the very unexpected and sudden death of my dad who, along with my mom, was my only consistent support and source of love throughout my life. Yet, it was still one of the better summers I’ve had. It’s difficult to explain the true difference internal change can make on our lives, but we can gain MUCH more control over our internal experience than we realize. 

I see the strength of my emotions as more of a gift than a curse these days. I’m grateful I can have such a rich experience of life, care for others, and appreciation for myself. Gratitude is my absolute favorite emotion - getting to feel it so strongly when I lean into it is an absolute blessing.",SarruhTonin,1ar6l4u

0,"Hey, I feel for you, and I'm sorry you've experienced all of this. Congratulations on getting through it all and getting to a more stable place and really working to understand yourself. Even if you're still struggling (which is totally normal), your accomplishments so far deserve a lot of credit, and as long as you keep working, you can keep improving. Recovery isn't linear, but try to show yourself compassion and understanding during any setbacks, look at your overall trend in improvement, and keep moving forward in a positive direction as best you can. 

The shame and guilt we carry from our behaviors, especially before diagnosis/treatment/recovery, can be very difficult to deal with. I've been in remission for over 2 years, and I've worked hard to heal more deeply, but the shame still affects me at times. It's important to also realize THAT'S understandable, and to not add to it with self judgment. I'm glad you at least wrote that final email. It can be really difficult to deal with being cut off from someone like this, even with the betrayal and pain she caused you. It's hard to feel like you don't have ""closure"" - but sometimes closure really is something you have to provide for yourself. It can take a long time. I thought I'd be forever stuck with the feeling of needing honest explanation from some people who hurt me terribly, but the more I've recovered and healed and grown my sense of self, the easier it got to eventually let go of it. 

Especially with the shame surrounding your own thoughts and behaviors, you may (possibly subconsciously) believe it's your fault this happened. In time, I hope you can see that many of their actions are about them and not you, and I hope you can find it in yourself to truly forgive yourself for your reactions and difficulty coping. You don't need them to forgive you to forgive yourself. You don't need them to have understanding and compassion for you to have it yourself. You can provide those things for yourself, and control your actions going forward to live more in alignment with your core self and prevent shame in the future. 

I hope any of this was helpful, and I'm sorry again for your experiences and for the struggles you continue to experience. Things won't always look how they do right now, and you have more control than it may feel over the direction your future takes. Keep going, keep growing. You got this.

I've been cheated on so many times and saw my mom who has BP T. 1 do it to my dad so many times he was just...exhausted in the end. 

Your reaction to everything is in part to your BPD and I'm so, so glad you got into therapy. I'm so sorry you got medically separated from the Navy, but in the end it was likely for the best. People with mental health concerns like ours and other mood disorders, PTSD, schizophrenia, etc are usually not fit to be in the military which is why they test for it. I don't meant to sound mean, but with how negatively things that could be seen in a war, etc could fuck us up FURTHER...yeah, no. They're trying to keep us from going off the deep end. I was supposed to go into the Army and a few years later after not doing so got my Dx of BPD, GAD, and depression.

Also, as much as it hurts unfortunately, you need to try to let her go. I get it. We all have the same mood disorder here. Because our amygdalas are smaller in volume than that of someone without BPD, our emotional regulators are FUCKED and we feel things 100x harder than someone without our disorder and get attached so easily.

You. will. find. someone. else.

In the meantime, I HEAVILY suggest continuing therapy, possibly getting on an antidepressant or antipsychotic, or both (a mood stabilizer too), and working on yourself lovey. There's NOTHING wrong with working on yourself to be your best you in a new relationship. Unfortunately, there's no 'cure' for BPD, but it's manageable. ;-;

8,I’m on the waiting list for a psychologist too. They said 2yrs! I wonder whether you could talk to the docs or psychiatrist about meds for psychosis? When I was in psych hospital recently they took me off citalopram and put me on an antipsychotic and a mood stabiliser with a bit of Valium for bedtime. Still on it all now. Is way better combo for me than the citalopram I was on for 15yrs. But then every one is different i suppose.,Admirable_Candy2025,1b4lc3e

27,And ECG is for your heart. They just put small pads on you and it detects the electrical activity of your heart. It's a very fast test.

After years of sexual abuse I want people to look at my body and be repulsed and leave me alone.

8,"I can relate to this in a big way, but I feel like mine is less... intentional? I just genuinely don't think about eating that much, my body doesn't really tell me that I'm hungry until I'm *starving,* and then I have to make a conscious effort to make myself eat. Some days, however, I'll find myself eating alllllll the things lol, seemingly on autopilot. Those days are much fewer but i guess they're probably the reason I haven't starved to death 😅 Every psychiatrist I've seen has labeled it an ED NOS, but I think it's just a product of barely being fed as a child. My body just adapted 🤷‍♀️

Edit to add that i do see this as a form of self harm though, i *could* be conscious enough to eat like a normal person, but if i wasn't worth feeding as a child I'm DEF not worth feeding now (or so my demented psyche reasons in the moment).",Ok-Pepper7437,1b769v5
9,"ime this is a symptom that is most pragmaticaly handled by overall distress reduction and distress tolerance.  Get the broad strokes going first, that will help a number of smaller things downstream.  

For me it's an ongoing effort to eat rationally; it is often easier in my brain to not eat than figure out what thing to have, and how much, that works with my texture, temperature, requirements on top of the emotional turmoil, severe resulting neausea, etc.  It all seems to be part of dissociation for me.",ferrule_cat,1b769v5
10,"I have ARFID and have experienced it all my life  was always made fun of or put down for being a ""picky"" eater.

As an adult I found out that I'm not a ""picky"" eater I have a ED called ARFID.That alone helped me to feel better about myself but it's still a struggle that I'm limited to very few safe foods and avoide situations that may cause me to be embarrassed because being embarrassed is definitely a trigger for my C-PTSD and BPD outbursts.",,1b769v5

21,"Yes. I was diagnosed with bulimia, but it eventually went away. It became a method of self-harm and punishment; I would overeat, then eat more knowing I would throw up, and then do so as punishment for overeating. It became a problem when I couldn’t keep food down. Along with it was over exercising - I was told I was bulky, my bf at the time criticized what I ate, I was offered to be in a modeling show and had to fit in dresses too small for my healthy weight… I wanted attention and feel accepted, and I did all I could to get there. I’m not surprised that some of us have second diagnoses because expecting us to have rational thinking all the time is just not our reality. My thought process worked at the time and I wasn’t questioned about it until it was too late. In the end it was a symptom of my BPD.",aquizzicalgal,1b769v5
22,"yes definitely it's common. i've been in ED recovery for about 2 years now and i absolutely still relapse (hard), but in general my eating is a lot more regulated and i've started really enjoying eating again. two things really really helped me with my ED: the use of weed (it's recreationally legal in my state in the US) to stimulate my appetite and lower my inhibition helped a lot to get me to eat without feeling terrible during and after. it was never a perfect solution, but definitely kickstarted healthier habits. the second was learning to cook simple and small meals. i started with bare basics like chicken, rice, and a vegetable. i made very small portions to start and only ate that once a day, but starting to experiment with flavors and finding recipes online really helped me combat the anxiety and panic i would get when i was around food. 

also, recovery for me isn't eating 3 square meals a day + snacks. i actually just eat 1 meal a day on average that's about an average portion size. i make sure that it's healthy and balanced and that keeps me at a sustainable and healthy weight.",dusterbee,1b769v5

I still struggle but it’s not as extreme as it was for a while. I don’t binge or restrict really. Tho I do restrict if anything. And I love eating out.

Also, it does make sense that your body and mind would somewhat adapt, like you said. Since you weren’t being fed much when you were growing up, once you did grow up your body just decided it could a lot longer without food.

I was getting so obsessed with how many bowel movements I was having and if I missed a work out day I would go into panic mode. I weighed myself every morning after I used the bathroom to make sure I wasn’t gaining. If I wasn’t able to use the bathroom to clean myself out I’d take laxatives even tho I wasn’t constipated. I maintained my weight but once I got out of high school I started gaining and it killed me. Then I had my first child at age 21. I’m sure you know what all comes with that. That was almost 10 years ago and I’ve lost almost 100 lbs since the birth of my second child in 2021. These past 2-3 years have been nothing but me forcing myself to not eat for as long as I can stand. If I can keep control of what I’m eating and not eating then I feel more confident and all that.

The times that I do give in and eat I swear it makes me want to unalive myself. I try to avoid it as long as I can throughout the day then tell myself it’s okay to finally have dinner. So idk.

and this has fucked everything. i am stuck in a cycle of binging or restricting and i don’t dare weigh myself. its such an awful feeling. if i eat unhealthy foods my stomach is a mess. if i stop doing that i restrict to 600 calories a day. i just cannot fix it.",BINGGBONGGBINGGBONGG,1b769v5

How the hell I made it this long is beyond me. But Honestly nothing else has ever actually made more sense to me. 

After watching and helping my wife find a Bipolar medication that works. I can attest to the concept that the complexity of the brain means that not all meds will work the same in different people. Some may work better or worse in two different people, 

With that all being said, there is no BPD specific medication because of the nature of the disorder. We can manage depression and anxiety, but DBT and CBT seem to be the best vehicle for recovery. What Im really trying to say is from my understanding is that those BPD symptoms you say persist, may never fully go away. But DBT and CBT can help us manage them.

10,"I'm excited for you to get a diagnosis at your age.  I was diagnosed a few months ago,  age 37. I didn't even know about borderline before the diagnosis. 

I too was on anti depressants for 8 years and it didn't really do much about my symptoms.  If my depression was resolved,  my anxiety was through the roof.  If my anxiety was resolved, I was incredibly depressed.  If I had medications to cover both anxiety and depression,  I still felt very unsettled and couldn't figure out what else I needed. 

I have been in therapy on and off for several years, but without this bpd diagnosis, the therapy wasn't helping much.

Bpd diagnosis has been a life changer for me.  Better meds, focused therapy,  trying to implement more self care/ meditation/ grounding/ mindfulness exercises as a daily practice is also helpful.  Though I've got a long way to go. 

I wish I was diagnosed at a younger age,  or at least knew about this disorder earlier.

7,"Ask which symptoms you fit. Compare it to the ADHD symptoms. Ask why they feel major depressive disorders and bpd. 

Learn about bpd it's ok if you have it but ok if you don't will still help to learn and understand it and see if you do feel like it fits. Learning through podcasts can be helpful like on Spotify as a lot of info on Google etc is very negative and by people who don't have bpd or are geared towards family or partners etc. 

Ask why they feel you don't have ADHD. Remember ADHD and bpd are often misdiagnosed as each other or comorbid. As well as autism. 

Ask yourself if your highs and lows are close together or in the span of a day you go from high to low multiple times have very strong emotions etc or just like day to day your moods are so different that's often a body thing but can also be adhd. If they are more like every few days or weeks or months that your mood changes then unlikely to be bpd and more likely to be bipolar or a major depressive disorder. 

Be kind to yourself and don't be afraid to research info and ask for clarification.

It would help to get a second opinion if you can, because some therapists have biases.",SpecialistCream1356,1arkby2
11,The thing about BPD is it can seem like a lot of other things and in my experience it makes it very hard to get a diagnosis. Talk to your therapist and do more research on what BPD actually is because there are a lot of misconceptions. No matter what remember these diagnosis isn’t gonna define you and that the first step in healing is to recognize it. I wish you the best of luck with figuring this out,JaayZYT,1arkby2
12,"It might not be. However, the treatment for the most part is the same. Sometimes you get diagnosed something just because the treatment would be really beneficial, the therapist knows it, but to get insurance to cover it they might put something down on the page. Also, I found that when you don’t fit neatly into a certain box and psychology, they just kind of stick you in the BPD bin. 

Usually, usually if you just say that you feel empty or that you feel like you don’t have a firm grasp of who you are they stick you in the BPD bin. It’s lazy psychology.

With that being said, if you have ADHD, and mood swings, then, DBT, or dialectic, behavioral therapy would be extremely helpful and best way to get that is to be diagnosed with BPD. Reason being is it teaches life, skills, coping skills, and as you work with somebody who can measure them quantitatively , so that there is actual process instead of you just going to a session and ranting. It’s more focused. With ADHD that can be extremely helpful, same with BPD. Normal talk therapy is not very effective, if you’ve been doing talk therapy for a while and it’s not working then that’s another reason why you might end up in the BPD bin. 

I hate to say, but I truly feel feel like the school of psychology is a fucking fucking mess. And it feels like I’m gonna get sorted by that sorting hat at Hogwarts. But people aren’t bins, or groups, or whatever. What we are is people with issues, and we all need ways of working through them. Because fuck a diagnosis.",Responsible-Cell475,1arkby2

14,"Hey, I'm diagnosed bpd but suspect i am inattentive adhd as well, but it's so much messing around and stress to get another diagnosis that I've just kind of given up- do you happen to be female, by any chance? I only ask this because in my experience, and in many people I've spoken to, it's very common for doctors and some therapists, to be sexist towards emotional issues in females; and not truly understand how adhd can display very differently when its not *hyperactive* and within females overall. But, that being said, there are whats known as ""subtypes"" of BPD, which you may relate to more than the 'classic/turbulent' or 'externalised' type of BPD, which generally has more ""obvious"" behaviours exhibited, as your symptoms end up directed outwards, rather than in. I am mainly 'quiet/discouraged ' BPD, which is an internalized version of the same symptoms within BPD. Eg: mood swings, splitting, poor emotional regulation.. I will isolate myself, become detached + distant, dissociate, find it *very* hard to communicate when upset, etc.. definitely recommend you check out the subtypes and see if you relate to any.

If you can, go to an occupational therapist so they can teach you useful coping tools, and see your psychiatrist and psychologist every other month to be sure you keep on track. To me, it’s about meaningful life changes. It can SUCK and be scary. But, it allows you to feel a little more settled in yourself. Try and remind yourself that your diagnosis isn’t a definition and most certainly remind yourself: mind over emotion. Keep track of how you feel throughout the day and it’ll help you feel less lost in all the mood shifts. I wish you the best!

One thing I would recommend is learning everything you can about BPD. One Doctor that I have learned tons from is [Dr. Fox on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DrDanielFox). If you haven't found him already, check him out. I learned coping skills from him before I started therapy, and he has lots of really great videos. 

Also, remember that you matter. Your healing journey isn't going to be easy, but with lots of practice (of coping skills) and hard work, you can get better. <3",TheRealMystrose,194xuvr
5,"Hey, I feel for you, and I'm so so sorry you've struggled so much for so long. Diagnosis can be really scary and confusing for some people, so I'm glad having an answer that makes sense is already bringing you some comfort and relief. Try to remember that you are no different than you were before your diagnosis - it doesn't change or define who you are. It's just putting a name and explanation to your symptoms. And guiding your recovery going forward!

One thing I find especially important to stress for the newly diagnosed is that BPD remission is not uncommon. I've been in remission for 2 years, and am far enough in my recovery that I don't just have to cope with my symptoms or spend a lot of conscious effort resisting unhealthy behaviors. I love myself and love life, and you can get there, too.It's hard for me to break down general advice in writing for everyone here who needs it, so I started a YouTube channel with BPD information and advice as well as other topics that have helped me on my recovery journey. [https://www.youtube.com/@sarruhtonin](https://www.youtube.com/@sarruhtonin) if you're interested.

Especially helpful for you right now might be the ""Understanding BPD"" video that breaks down the symptoms and diagnostic criteria (if you're still not completely clear on that), and ""BPD Advice Part 1"" which is made for people in your position. The BPD remission/recovery video may also be helpful right now. I always want to provide so much information and support and comfort for people who make posts like this on here, but my capacity to do so is limited, which is a big reason I make those videos.

0,"This is not pathetic and there is no reason to feel shame. There are also a lot of factors at play right now which are reasonably contributing to your pain. Here are the things that stand out most:

1. How so I support my spouse with BPD?

2. Is BPD responsible for my spouse’s behavior and does that invalidate my feelings or her responsibility?

3. How do I deal with the sense of betrayal and loss of trust?

1 Your spouse likely needs consistent professional supports to develop new coping skills, and you can simply continue to remind them you do love them and keep the door open to discuss times when they feel insecure.

2 No, while BPD likely contributed to the negative thinking and feelings, it does not invalidate your experience or release them from responsibility for their actions.

3 Time and possibly professional help for yourself. Rebuilding trust takes tremendous effort and it is important to not walk this path alone.",Shado007,1bsiutx
1,"Try reading the book “Loving someone with BPD”. If there is something salvageable in your relationship, I think the book may help you find it.",ElectricalKiwi3007,1bsiutx
2,"I truly feel the love you have for her and the pain you’re going through, as well as your call for help - I’m so sorry you’re in such a difficult situation, difficult for you both. I hope I can help shed some insight based on what you have shared and I have interpreted (hopefully without misinterpretations. Also, reaching out to strangers on here is not pathetic at all and is probably the best and healthiest thing to do. 

First things first, I want to commend you for writing this post and having so much love for your wife, trying to understand the diagnosis as you see her. It is not easy to work past something that was unforgivable to you, but believe me when I say you are incredibly strong and empathetic person for trusting what she’s shared with you as honest.

I do believe she’s being sincere and also probably pushing back a lot of unwanted, unyielding, awful thoughts to stay and work on your forgiveness. 

In my experience as someone with BPD (in a long-lasting relationship), it is essentially instinct to cut and run when we know or believe the other person has seen a “darker shade of us” that we try our best to control. To stay, she is showing me/you how much she loves you and is truly sorry for what she’s done - this is also why she has endured your rightful hurt attitude after finding out, and shows even more how much she wants to fix it. 

I’ve always been so against cheating in a relationship, even after my diagnosis. Yet, here I am, having hurt my SO with overwhelming feelings, thoughts, emotions and impulses that felt out of my control.
For me, after 10+ years getting mental health help, I think I can admit a part of it can also be self-hatred and a way to self-destruct, unfairly testing SOs in the process. If you leave, we have every reason to implode - if you stay, we are faced with feelings that you might not leave (security that confronts/breaks down abandonment issues) and what follows from that is the worst extreme form of guilt for hurting the person you love most.

In terms of helping her, as much as it hurts now (and also I don’t want you to feel responsible for having to stay), staying with her will help her more than you know. 

In terms of dealing with forgiveness - forgiveness doesn’t always come quickly or naturally. If it helps, think of it as a huge learning curve for your relationship, which it already is at this point.
You’re learning (if you’re willing) to forgive the unforgivable because, even with BPD aside, she never meant to hurt you and hates that she did.
She’s learning that some people, especially you, stay and don’t leave. She’s also learning to confront the consequences when it gets out of control.
As well as a learning curve, it’s also a growing opportunity for you both, separately and in your relationship. 

If she’s not already seeing a psychiatrist and/or therapist fairly regularly, I highly recommend doing so. If she’s not on medication, I would also recommend looking into that, especially for the depression and/or anxiety symptoms.
If you’re both willing and able, I also suggest going to see a therapist together if needed. 
It’s not going to be easy, but it can happen - if you truly love someone, you will learn to grow with one another as new challenges come. But challenges will always come, and having someone you have been through the good, the bad, the ugly and unforgiving times with is always safety.

4,"I talk about this from a lived experience and a medical education on Twitter if you're interested. Self harm, exceptionally low self worth and needing external validation leads to promiscuity and cheating. It's complicated because in BPD when people get really close to us it increases the fear of losing them which in turn amplifies all our symptoms (not choices). It's really hard to understand and control any of it even when you know what's going on so I think judging people like me before they are diagnosed can be pretty unfair, especially when you look around at everyone else using their mental health as an valid excuse for the things that happen in their life.",DrSafariBoob,1bsiutx

6,"I strongly recommend reading “I hate you, don’t leave me”. 

It’s a really good resource for understanding bpd from the outside, and if you decide you want to move forward with her, it offers some advice for communication with people with bpd. 

Honestly, she would probably benefit from reading it too. Understanding where certain behaviors come from and why can help with making them feel more manageable. I know it was life-changing for me. 


Beyond that, the best thing you can do is have clear boundaries and support her in her treatment (things like taking her to appointments, helping make sure meds get refilled, learning about coping tools together). 

Also be aware that you can’t “fix” her. How she feels, how she copes, whether or not she does the work are all outside of your control. Putting yourself in a situation where you are responsible for her behavior and emotions is going to backfire for both of you.

8,"Although you spoke your harsh truth, you have a right to react and how you feel about it, regardless of her BPD, and it seems like she also understands that because she handled it all. 

I completely get what you’re saying about believing she’s the one and wanting to go back to how it was before. I believe it can happen, but it takes a lot of work and commitment on both sides, and I think it can happen for you too. 

It’s easy to lump it into it just being the disorder, but it’s important to delve deeper into the underlying memories/coping mechanisms behind it. It can help a lot for both of you to understand the whole picture, like where her strong fear of abandonment came from and things like that. It doesn’t excuse anything but it can help. 

I also know that love makes everyone do crazy things because the emotions are so heightened. You’re definitely not the first person to fall in love so hard and quickly and you won’t be the last. No one else has to understand or be explained your reasonings and feelings.

I don’t believe you’re a fool, I believe you found your person and don’t want to let them go. In a long-term relationship, there are always going to be times when you both need to make a conscious effort to learn and fall in love with your SO over and over again as they grow and change and make mistakes.

12,"Thank you.

Number 1 doesn't seem like enough though. I can offer my love and support but... is that really it? It doesn't seem like very much balm for such a bad wound. She is in therapy now, which I'm glad for, but they went immediately to blood tests and a desire for chemical assistance. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have some fears about what the medication roulette is going to do to her (and by extension me), but it's probably the right call. If she's not manic, she's depressive, and it's really, really severe in a way that I think could only be the result of a chemical imbalance I don't fully understand.

Number 2: I find it difficult to articulate, but basically I simultaneously hold her responsible (she should have talked to me if she thought we were having issues instead of taking rash actions) while also not (If she didn't have BPD this would not have happened). Having spoken to her about it at length, she hates herself and speaking her reasoning out loud causes her to cringe at how stupid and irrational her actions were. A big factor that plays into my forgiveness is that I think she was in true danger of killing herself and was doing anything she could to cling onto this earth. That by itself is not an excuse, but it in conjunction with irrational thinking has made this a different situation in my eyes. 

Number 3 is tough, because I've kept it a complete secret from everyone. I know I can't deal with the social stigma and shame that will be applied to me, and I don't want everyone's attitude to change toward my wife. I've seen how people have spoken about infidelity when the male victim of it is not around, and I literally trust nobody to be kind about it.

15,"I think I would be interested actually. I'd love a link, here or in a PM/DM if possible. 

She has a history of nearly being on track before doing the worst thing she possibly can at the time. I think that this is the latest and most extreme form of that pattern, and she's deeply upset because she really thought she was over that destructive behavior. 

Typically, I understand her quite well. This instance was a baffling shock to me because it didn't seem the least bit rational. Once I stopped being a raging dick and had an even-headed discussion with her about it, I found that she thought it was also irrational. She said that due to us being separated by great distance and communication limited by time difference, that it felt like she was unloved, unsupported, and like I was only keeping her around out of obligation. She said that almost immediately after the infidelity she was able to look at the situation and see that I had loved her and supported her all along.

I found this to be immensely stupid and frustrating, and it actually compounded the anger and the hurt. It was only after some time that I could see that this streak of irrationality was a manifestation of her fears and not a criticism of me. From there it became possible to forgive her (with time. I'm not really there yet, but I don't hate her. I hate what she did). There are certain things outside of her control which made this a very powerful temptation. I believe a stronger person would've been faithful, and I believe that if she knew she had this condition and understood it fully she would've had the tools to handle feeling certain things and recognize how silly it is to think your husband doesn't love you when he's spent the whole time missing you. 

So she made a decision, and it was about the only thing she could do to really hurt me. But I recognize there are factors outside of her control that encourage one to do destructive things, not cause, but encourage. Given her multiple disorders, her traumatizing past, and the love she has shown me before this and the remorse she has felt since-- I think I can extend a pass this one and only time. That's a lot of words to say I know BPD didn't make her do this, but it sure wouldn't have happened if she didn't have BPD if that makes sense.",sad_lobster_39,1bsiutx
16,"I appreciate that perspective, and believe me, before now forgiving something like this would've been unthinkable. I do hold her accountable for failing to communicate and putting herself in a risky situation that could lead to infidelity, and ultimately for the decision she made then. 

Trust me, I was kind of horrible for a while and she was strong to put up with it, despite arguably deserving it. Now that the dust has settled, I have a little more empathy and part of that is because I see her genuine sorrow and self hatred.

I do feel like if anyone I know found out about this, they would think I was a doormat. But on the other hand, I love her enough that if things could be repaired and I could feel the same way about her again, I have to at least try. I don't know how to convince people I'm not a sucker being manipulated, but I know that it is a person's responsibility to take precautions to guard themselves from their own mental illness, and that she did make a decision to cheat even if she was in a bad headspace. 

She made the decision to swear off drinking on her own, and has taken the initiative to make changes. And as much as it would wound me, any other breaches of trust hereafter have to be the last-- I would force myself to leave if she did anything approaching this again. I might love her, but I still have some kind of sense of self respect.",sad_lobster_39,1bsiutx
17,"Thanks, I think I'll see if I can get one or both of us to read it.

To be honest I don't need her fixed. I would be satisfied with her how she is without the cheating and disrespect of boundaries were it not for the way she feels about herself. I can comprehend manic and depressive periods, I get them myself (to a lesser degree, I have ADHD). What is difficult to comprehend is that when she gets low she really has one foot in the grave and it's like death calls out to her. 

Jesus Christ, nobody should have to live like that. 

I think I was holding her together, and she's really hurt me. Now the hatred she feels for herself is tripled. She's very introspective, and pretty intelligent when it comes to why she has certain behaviors. The big problem is that she will do something fucking horrible, like this, and be completely unable to tell me why. Her feelings and thought process will be a mystery to her when trying to recall things. Maybe a book like you've suggested could help her understand herself when it comes to these mystery periods (or maybe it'd help me not pull out my hair at the baffling irrationality of these mistakes during her depressive phases).",sad_lobster_39,1bsiutx
18,"Thank you. And that's really good general relationship advice about having to fall in love with your SO more than once. I don't know that I've ever heard that before, but it's a good thing to read. Maybe more people should hear that kind of thing, even under less severe circumstances. 

I was always aware of her coping mechanisms and traumas. She is constantly examining herself and letting me know about her insights and they're occasionally very fruitful. This is partially because she is in therapy now, and so I think there's certainly hope.",sad_lobster_39,1bsiutx
19,"No, I don't even think she was saying that. She's done a good job owning her decisions most of the time. 

For one thing, she has other issues. The way I understand it is that BPD intensified her loneliness and helped her reach a state of mind where she believed I saw her as a burden and was going to leave her. You'd have to know us to really appreciate how irrational this is, but it's pretty irrational. From there it's a series of events that ended in her feeling suicidal before drinking and making her worst decision yet.

I fully admit I don't know a lot about BPD, but if you read symptom lists or experiences online, you'll see it frequently claimed that people with BPD can be prone to promiscuity and infidelity if untreated. Could that be a harmful stereotype? Yeah. But it also played no small role in the psychologist diagnosing my wife along with the other symptoms.

So is it the sole cause? No, I don't think so. Is it a large factor? I think so. Because if she were to make this decision while totally rational then I'd probably have left. But talking with her, seeing how confused and frustrated she is with her own reasoning, and talking about the states of mind she was in, it seemed clear to me that a few pretty bad things occurred during a massive low spot, while she was weak. Would a different person have been affected the same way? Depends on the person. 

Then again, it's also way easier to minimize her control over herself so I don't feel even worse about it. So I've got some bias. At a fundamental level I don't really understand what it's like to have BPD, even if I do understand what it's like to have a manic or depressive phase.",sad_lobster_39,1bsiutx
20,"I would agree, but I think my position is that borderline personality disorder can cause the conditions which would make it far more likely for someone to cheat. Someone who is stable, and in a good head space is far less likely to cheat than someone who feels very upset, and currently unloved. 

If DBT stands for drug-based therapy, then I believe she is in the process of figuring out which medication she should try first. My understanding is that it is difficult to find the right medication for these sorts of issues without much trial and error. In all honesty, I am afraid of what different medications might do to her, and how it might affect both of us.

I'm not excited for what I understand is the nearly ubiquitous loss of libido and sexual dysfunctions that seem to accompany medications for depression and BPD. What actually makes me very nervous though, is I have no idea how much these medications are likely to change her personality, or if that is even a valid thing to worry about. I do know though, that she feels like committing suicide all the time and often for no reason. I also know that during her low periods she is very unhappy, often for no reason. As much as I am suspicious of drug-based solutions to many problems, I don't think that this is the sort of issue that can be solved without medicine, and I definitely don't believe someone should have to live being unhappy all the time for no reason. 

So worried as I am about the prospect, I would ultimately be happier if we could go through a difficult period and she ends up happy.",sad_lobster_39,1bsiutx

I also want to touch on things I read in other comments about how cheating is unforgivable/a deal-breaker/doesn’t matter the details, and especially what you said about not wanting people to think you’re a doormat.
Not everything is black and white, and no one knows, nor the right to know, the intricacies and whole story of your relationship and love. And it’s none of their business either when it’s something so personal.
I feel people are almost indoctrinated to believe cheating is one of the worst things you can do (I remember seeing statistics where some people believed cheating to be worse than murder) and the be-all-end-all to any relationship, and that you’re weak if you decide to stay with someone after.
However, every story and each person is different and should be taken into account when dealing with any type of betrayal in a relationship. It’s a confrontation of boundaries that causes self-reflection and a reevaluation of your relationship.
You’re not weak if you decide you love someone enough to overcome the pain they caused you (unless they do it again).",vhairiserious,1bsiutx
25,"I use the same name on Twitter, should be really easy to find if not message back here.

I'm taking a break from there at the moment, I get in to trouble with my hyper empathy and it dysregulates me. My point content has LOTS of info though.

Please don't think of her condition as a question of strength, it's more akin to a brain tumour pressing on parts of the brain and causing strange behaviour.

Obviously you care about her and she cares about you. I don't think you should forget that because it is such an excellent foundation to develop compassion from. Nobody chooses to be mentally ill. The weird thing about this condition is the self harm and doing things that hurt us more because we believe we deserve it. You know her, you know she absolutely doesn't deserve anymore harm. She's going to take a long time to work on this and it is only successful with a partner who can have compassion. It's not a conventional relationship but in my opinion that's what makes it even more special. I've been with my partner for over ten years and we still have trouble with my condition because it's so poorly understood and has such terrible support from even healthcare. There's just road blocks at every turn.

If be suspicions about all of this art correct yes there's a trauma foundation but it's layered on top of unmanaged neurodivergence (lots of types, I suspect autism and ADHD the most common but there are absolutely others including plain old brain injury). And in case you aren't looking already, we have the best relationships with other neurodivergent people so the more you understand about your self and your needs, the more support she will feel.

27,"Yes, definitely!! I remember reading a few things that said things like that, including an old married couple who said that that was the trick to staying together - you’re not always going to remain the same person you were when you first met your person and love grows and changes as people do, and to stay with one person, you have to accept they will change and learn to love/fall in love again with that person

It’s also great that she’s getting help and feels she can share it with you, and that you actively listen to what she’s learning so you can also both learn together. If you don’t already, I think it might be beneficial to also look into your own past experiences and how it’s shaped the person you are today. I think this is beneficial for anyone, but in your situation, it might also help to learn how your childhood and experiences compare with one another as that can help create more empathy, understanding and better communication.

30,"To be honest, I do think cheating is about the worst thing you can do to your partner discounting open abuse like domestic violence or something. I'm glad you understand what it takes to put this aside.

 I told her she ruined my life because all I wanted was a wife to love, and she turned our fairytale love into something mundane and transactional, and that now we're like other people. I also told her she made a fool of me, and that I'm just like every other idiot that got high on love and was betrayed. I explained that I was now bitter and disgusted with other people's happiness, and that this was kind of the final straw to make me see nobody respects me or gives a fuck about me. If the only person I love this much can betray me, I really am alone. I said lots of other stuff too, and frankly I'm afraid I've got a screw loose now.

I wish I kept my mouth shut, or waited until I felt halfway sane to convey these feelings to her, because I'm sure it contributed to her feelings of worthlessness and of being a living hand grenade to the people she loves. She knew how I felt already, I'm sure, but me confirming that in a blind rage probably dialed it up intensely. 

I want to be able to look at her and feel warm, and have tears come to my eyes thinking about how much I love her-- that's the way it always was. I'm a little desperate, because that has to return or I'll kind of have a wasted life. I know that sounds dramatic, but I am dead certain I'll never find that connection with anyone else. I spent a lifetime looking for somebody that I can show my true self to, and as far as lovers go she is the only one that ever accepted me fully and had real similarities to me. She's also the only one to ever approach me, and when she asked me to marry her so soon I didn't think she was crazy-- I was elated. 

It's discomforting to think that a lot of it is the result of a mental disorder, and it's saddening to think that anybody reading the above paragraph is likely to see it only as red flags and naivety. How do you convince someone that there was real magic there? That you knew marrying someone after 5 months is normally crazy, but you made an exception? That you know your actions are perceived by outsiders as dumb, but you had a good reason? That you feel stupid that your life is in shambles because you know how it looks, but you aren't a fool. I feel pretty compelled to say that we've been married for years without a problem like this, because that means I was right for a good chunk of time.

2,"Hey! This is normal. It makes you question your entire reality. I went back and evaluated some of my past reactions and behaviors and it’s like “OHHH, RIGHT.” but having been completely oblivious about BPD actually existing. It fucks with your head about the entirety of your past. “Was that a legitimate reaction, or something that was an overreaction because of my BPD?” “Was that person actually a bad person, or did I just split and let my opinions define them?” “Did I actually want to kill myself all of those times that I threatened it, or did I just want someone to give a fuck?” It’s a hard thing to reconcile. Seriously. And it won’t happen overnight. Truuuust me. I can not emphasize this more; **get your ass into DBT.** immediately. Solo and group, if possible. I’m not perfect by ANY stretch. I’m certainly not into remission yet, but MAN, it makes all of the difference in the world. You will learn radical acceptance, which is a pivotal point in DBT. It’s “no more living in a ‘what be should be’ reality. It’s living in a what IS reality.”  So in this case it would be “well, all of those decisions/feelings **happened** and there’s nothing I can do about that now.” And then you get to accept that those things happened, and that you can now move forward with that information and do better. And with mindfulness (another DBT skill), you’ll learn more and more about what “better” looks like and how to get there. And you’ll learn coping skills to help you along the way. I commend you SO MUCH; in a DBT group of 8- there’s only been one man at a time, and often none at all. Men often don’t accept that they have BPD, nor do they seek out a diagnosis. You can do better. And if you do the work, you **will** do better. I believe in you. You’re still so young and have a whole, full, beautiful life in front of you. You got this.",ThenCMacSaid,18m8soy

In this time, I have really learned so much about myself that I didn't know before. As a result, I've grown exponentially. Diagnosis, for me, was my way out, not a life sentence. I often encourage folks who are new to diagnosis to check out some episodes of Eggshell Transformations with Dr. Imi. She holds pwBPD so kindly, it helped me learn how to do a bit of that for myself.

Recently it’s gotten to a point where I’m so insanely emotional that I feel like I just dropped a baby out of my uterus. (NO, there is a 0% I’m pregnant.) I feel like it is being brought on by so much stress in my life and maybe I’m just not handling it well. I’ve never been good with stress. It tends to cause severe depression. It has also caused some pretty manic behaviors as well. It’s gotten a little better on that side because I got sober from drinking.",FuckThisManicLife,zptkp8

I feel like this makes more sense since once you’ve somewhat tackled the issues behind it all it could help understand yourself and your emotions/symptoms better instead of just trying to dampen them.

0,"Yes, for me it was research research and more research that really helped me. Another thing I did when I got diagnosed is I wrote my life out from the beginning and then I wrote it backwards from the current moment in time. Both of those perspectives helped me figure out what behaviors and triggers I need to keep an eye out for. I know there’s not a lot of literature on BPD, but there has been lots of recommendations for podcasts and things like that on this sub. Know that this diagnosis may be a part of you but it doesn’t define you. Best of luck",No_Glass_1094,zmwh88
1,"Mindfulness, really, but coming from the ADHD and bipolar 2 treatment perspectives you should have some experience with that already.

I wasn't suggested BPD until i was already in my 30s, after a term of military service and a lifetime of coping skills I'd picked up from the various therapists I'd seen while trying to figure out what my deal is. At this stage for me it is about applying those techniques to smooth the sharper edges, identified through therapy and communicating with those close to me, to improve my quality of life overall.

Welcome to the group, I'm sorry, and good luck.",iThatIsMe,zmwh88
2,"I don't know if this would help you but it helped me a bit, but you could try watching movies that have portrayals of people with BPD and see how they act and see if your actions in the past resonate/are similar to those. I was diagnosed when I was 17 and went untreated for the past 9 years and it really fucked with a lot of my personal relationships and over the summer it was recommended to me to find and watch movies where a main character was portrayed as having BPD or hinting at it. 

It helped me put things into perspective about not only my past actions but how they did affect others in my life. I will definitely say read reviews of the movies because there are some major hit or miss portrayals of BPD but there's one with Anne Hathaway in it that hit me hard and originally I tried watching it with my SO but we had to stop because the actions of her character brought back really bad memories of a really dark time when I didn't feel in control at all and we just had to take a break and I later watched the entirety of it on my own. It was a weird feeling though I will say because I resonated with her character because of how she was treated by her family but also of the self destructive behaviors she exhibited were some of the same I had in the past and I just pushed those memories down and away instead of confronting them.",minervas_ghost,zmwh88
3,"What was their determining factor for BPD instead of bipolar? 

Also 20% of us have both

Advice. Just because we have the same disorder doesn’t make us the same. You can’t take the shit people spew personally. People group us together. These are people without the disorder and also people WITH the disorder.

You CAN ride out the wave of uncomfortable feelings like: suicidal thoughts, emptiness, shame (if those are something you experience).

Relationships may make symptoms feel worse. 

You don’t have to tell anyone about your disorder. Not saying you should hide it but I believe not everyone needs to know everything about us.

Someone said mindfulness already! Yes

I avoid content that says we all do xyz. Or BPD loved ones sub I avoid 

Dr. Fox on YouTube is very helpful. I also share my experiences on my channel you can find on my sub profile.

I hope this helps ♥️",Sweetsourgonesassy,zmwh88
4,"Hi! I got diagnosed maybe 8 months ago? And it’s the best thing to have ever happened! Every thing in my life made sense and suddenly I know how to handle situations that I always struggled with. I’ts going to be a long message but I just want to tell you everything because I’m just so happy that there is more of us out there fighting to best we can be! 

So I’ll start from I approached it since my diagnosis. 

So basically after I processed and did a little internet reading on BPD, I just got down a busy with my treatment. DBT once a fortnight, Journaling when I can’t see my therapist and DBT entries every night. I use an app “DBT coach” so I can send reports to my therapist and we can review my emotions and talk about it. Understand that you just never truly learnt how cope with emotions and that there are better ways to manage it. So you need to be proactive with your treatment plan as there are downs and ups. The downs can be tough but really hone in on those skills you learnt and just push through, eventually it becomes second nature. 

Find a good therapist and listen to them. I have learnt so much from mine, she is a god send. In the beginning she mainly used CBT because I just had a lot on my chest and I just cried a lot, but we slowly transitioned to DBT. Now, I try to write down any questions I have like what to do when I feel xyz. I don’t use it as a session to talk it out but I ask, what do I do the next time it happens and we talk through it and I practice it. 

Everyone has weaknesses and strengths, for me my self image was so bad I took anything that went wrong and blamed it on myself. There’s just a bunch of things you are gonna struggle with and just know we are on a learning journey. We are going to do/may have done the wrong things but we are here now. You will also find things that call us abusers, that we are evil, crazy, toxic and just a bunch of things. IT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU. You may have done that in the past but you are in therapy now, and as long as you are willing to change you can push through. 

The first time I heard/saw us being called that I spiralled. I wanted to die, I did not think I could do it and that I’m always going to be like that. I wanted to quit therapy and just give up because of the stigma. Why make the effort to change when people are always going to think that. Just remember we are going to have ups and downs, we are also learning. Write it out, take a break and talk to someone. 

We are learning and we are going to get to better. Give yourself a break, accepting these things are gonna happen and we are gonna learn from it and do better. If you have a friend who you deem is a healthy friend, ask them if it was appropriate or lean on them.I disclosed my diagnosis to my friend early and pretty much told them hey this is what’s happening, I’m going to mess up but just know I’m learning. Feel free to calmly tell me what is happening so we can have an open dialogue. 

I like to think we are just babies trying to learn how to handle emotions and so approach it with an open mind and be curious, ask questions! 

You can find books online but ALWAYS read reviews before you buy. Find reviews from people with BPD. There are some books that can be quite insensitive, one such example is “I hate you don’t leave me” which although I haven’t read, I was really close to buying because the title summed up my life. Going deeper, the reviews sounded very harsh on people with BPD treating us like we were burdens. I think it was written more for people who have been hurt due to our symptoms and want comfort rather than for us to learn and grow. Had I read this, perhaps I would have spiralled down and I think we need to avoid that at our weakest. Know you limits and triggers!! It’ll help so much until you can learn to deal with it. 

I also got this book called Borderline personality Disorder workbook by Daniel Fox for just an extra tool. I’m half way through it and I think it’s just such a useful tool to do when you want to work on yourself. 

I also like to look up notable people that the public think have BPD. It just makes me feel better that there are people out there doing so well in life and I can do that too. I have suspicions on Princess Diana and Billie Eilish having BPD and it makes me feel better because they are such loved icons which means we can be loved too. 

I wish you the best of luck. My diagnosis was the best thing to ever happen and I hope you find that too xx",Zedaawg,zmwh88

Talk therapy works well for me.  Being able to say my goals and actually do it helps me maintain some consistency. Plus, they watch my own patterns and suggest stuff I don’t notice.

People with BPD + psychosis most often experience psychotic episodes only when under extreme stress. After the stress passes, people typically understand that what they experienced wasn't real. 

You do sound like you're under heavy stress, so this absolutely can be bpd-related. However, if you hear voices consistently, or have always felt that your grandmother is attempting to harm you, you might also be experiencing another disorder alongside bpd.

Either way, please do take care of yourself, lean on your support system if that's available, and try to seek professional help if you aren't already.

Number 1 is get a psychiatrist, build up that trust so you can completely honest with them. If you can’t be honest they can’t help you properly. Medication, some are for it, some are against it. I think my meds do me a world of good. I don’t think I could tolerate myself without my meds. 

Therapy. Find you a therapist, it may take a few tries. I’m on my 5th one, so far he is the best that I have ever had. Don’t settle for anyone that oversteps boundaries, that is professional and a good match for you. You need to trust this person. 

Diagnosed, it’s a hard pill to swallow. I never heard of bpd until I was told I had it. I researched its, I’m more aware of my symptoms and my moods. Only because I have bpd doesn’t mean I’m not responsible for my actions. Some will deny it for a while but eventually you will have to admit it’s not going away. 

With the right attitude, psychiatrist and therapist you can make bpd manageable. It’s a lot of hard work with a lot of emotions.

When properly managed, the prognosis for BPD is actually incredibly good. It will take time and hardship to get there, but with a diagnosis comes the opportunity for more targeted care that can help you to feeling better.

I know it's scary. But diagnosis is a step forward, not a step back. I'm glad you're here, and I hope you heal.

Good education resources are Dr. Fox on YouTube and Dr. Ramani's MedLine interviews on YouTube. Both are actual doctors and personality disorder experts who cite from modern research.

After MHPEA and the ACA, insurance is going to cover most intensive outpatient DBT groups with a BPD Dx. They don’t technically have to but have to have parity between mental health and physical health as well as baseline to the “alternative benefit plan” in expanded ACA states. That’s a little complicated but basically it wouldn’t make sense to exclude intensive outpatient DBT services. You’ll probably have a copay and it’s hard to find quality care. But the “we don’t pay for that” is largely done away with. Certain insurances might require prior authorization - “does the patient have BPD?” Is likely the first interqual question.

Most people in the country with insurance who need it still cannot get it and that's a fact.  I was talking to the clinicians about it just today.

I mean just google it.  It's that simple.

The reason is is that it is actually quite expensive to do the real model.  I mean just ask google AI.  Things have gotten better, but no where near where they should be.

You literally cannot get DBT at all unless you attempt or have an eating disorder PERIOD.  Even then depending on where you live, probably not.  This may be news for you, but many BPD do not self harm or have many attempts as they get older.  It really sucks for those of us who fall through the cracks.

It's hard to get better before you can understand what's going on with yourself. Just try to remember that you are no different than you were before your diagnosis - it doesn't change or define who you are. It's just putting a name and explanation to your symptoms. And guiding your recovery going forward!

A better life is definitely possible. I've been in remission for 2 years, and am far enough in my recovery that I don't just have to cope with my symptoms or spend a lot of conscious effort resisting unhealthy behaviors. I love myself and love life, and you can get there, too. 

It's hard for me to break down general advice in writing for everyone here who needs it, so I started a YouTube channel with BPD information and advice as well as other topics that have helped me on my recovery journey. [https://www.youtube.com/@sarruhtonin](https://www.youtube.com/@sarruhtonin) if you're interested.

Especially helpful for you right now would be the ""Understanding BPD"" video that breaks down the symptoms and diagnostic criteria, and ""BPD Advice Part 1"" which is made for people in your position.

Be wary of misinformation, because there is a LOT even within these subreddits. And do your best to believe that you can get better - growth is very difficult if you don't. Best of luck with everything.",SarruhTonin,1820w5o
1,"I just did too and I am a 44 year old woman. I went full blown obsessed into trying to figure out why I was actively trying to destroy my marriage. Uncontrollably. And succeeded in destroying 2 previous marriages and an engagement and also every relationship since my very first boyfriend in elementary school. 

The rabbit hole I went down took 3 years and wrong diagnoses which led to pointless , head banging on a wall, frustration and more pain. 

As they stated above^ this is a beginning to understand. I feel validated. Make sure you get support in any way possible. If my husband wasn’t also so grateful for some answers, I don’t know where I’d be. His understanding has been invaluable. But for some , it can be a best friend, a parent, and if none of those, a good therapist that understands BPD. Whoever diagnosed you can help point you there. 

Also, since this has been suspected , I’ve been shown a few coping skills from DBT - while I wait on a wait list to start the actual program. But for splitting, dissociating and spiraling down, I found the A.C.C.E.P.T. Tip Very helpful. Each letter has options for regulating. Because not just one will work. 

Good luck. I was pointed out the positives last night, about having BPD. For me at least, I love really hard, I have extreme amounts of empathy, can read a mood in someone a mile away which can be helpful, and also I chased after answers, unlike my entire toxic family who buried their head in the sand and just thinks “this is me. Deal with it. “While running around hurtful and untreated. So, we’re cycle breakers. And that is a great thing 🙏🏻",Psych-obsessed,1820w5o
2,"The best advice I received was also the simplest:

You are not your diagnosis. Try to not label yourself or become obsessed with terminology. You are still the person you always have been just with some new insight into the way your brain works. 

The rest is all up to you and how you decide to go about your treatment. Personally, I stopped therapy after a few months of continuously being told to practice mindfulness. I do see a psychiatrist who has helped me develop a medication regimen that most Primary Care physicians, PAs, and NPs view as quite exemplary. 

There is no right or wrong way to go about your own, individual treatment. I’ve never considered a work book to be the best method for any form of education but there are several that are highly recommended. 

For the time being, do your best to allow yourself to not spiral or disassociate or split, and try to focus on the fact that you are present in the space which you are in at any given time. You are aware of where you are, the day and time, your name, age, anything that helps you to remain grounded in the here and now. 

Lastly, don’t forget to BREATHE.",MrKBC,1820w5o
3,"My favorite way to go about BPD recovery is ""treat the symptoms, not the illness."" Learn why you have the feelings and express the behavior that you do, get to understand your thought patterns and triggers. Really really REALLY get to know yourself, through curiosity and compassion rather than judgment. Example: instead of ""oh my god I said something so mean, I'm stupid and terrible"" ask yourself ""why did I feel the need to do that? What's going on in my head rn? Do I need to step away or can I apologize and move on?"" etc.

Other commenters have put down GREAT advice. This is just my extra two cents. ♥️ Best of luck. We CAN recover from this.",witchcrows,1820w5o

5,"listen to podcasts. just devour them. Focus on the ones by clinicians and doctors. Just listen to all of them first, to understand yourself a bit. Then reflect. Then listen to podcasts by people who are dealing with it. Also, learn about CPTSD, trauma responses, nervous systems, and especially attachment theory (specifically disorganised). Learn about it before judging yourself or letting anyone else judge you. Learn about it before you learn *from* it.

1,"Just tell your psychiatrist that you want to be evaluated for a personality disorder and (if you don’t have a therapist) ask if there is a therapist at the office/in network who would be available to do the evaluation. Mention what other people have said about emotional regulation as reasoning.

another option is to voluntarily go into a psychiatric hospital where they’ll evaluate you, this one can be tricky because of anxiety, payment, etc but, it can work alongside of therapy in these programs. i left an inpatient setting two almost three weeks ago, i went in with my bpd diagnosis and came out with my ptsd diagnosis. a change of meds and poof ptsd nightmares gone for the most part. fingers crossed. it allowed me to learn more about myself.",rambleeer,17t5qhk

6,"# This goes without saying, but I'm gonna say it anyway: although reading other people's experiences can give you an idea if you experience similar symptoms, the only one that can diagnose you is a mental health professional.

Now that I got the obvious out of the way, I'm gonna list the 9 symptoms used for diagnosis and explain how I **personally** experience them (I am diagnosed btw):

&#x200B;

* Fear of abandonment (this is kinda the ""mandatory"" one): This can be felt in many ways, but I usually notice it if it's an absurd situation. Let me give you an example: **I had a friend temporarily stay with me for about two months for work. Fate would have it that some close friends of his lived 5 minutes away from me, so he would often visit them. Whenever he left to visit them it would cause me to feel like the world is ending because he abandoned me even though I knew he was coming back (as I have said, absurd situations). What I would like to add to this is that sometimes out of this fear of abandonment I proceed the abandon people first, basically sabotaging the relationship; I think this is a defense mechanism playing into the idea that if I abandon them first, they can't abandon me (this all happens in the subconscious, I'm not aware of it until much later).**
* Unstable relationships: **this one is kind of self-explanatory**
* Unclear or shifting self-image: **so I have no direction in life, I don't know what I want. Furthermore, I tend to mimic people's personalities.**
* Impulsive, self-destructive behaviors: **Drugs (pretty much anything I can get my hands on), binge eating, immediately spending the little money I have (usually on drugs and food XD), making very rash decisions, quitting jobs, the works**
* Self-harm: **I don't cut myself or any other ""direct"" self-harm, but I guess you can count drugs and junk food here (if I'm being honest, it's a wonder I haven't had a heart attack until now). Other than that, suicidal ideation**
* Extreme emotional swings (also kind of a main symptom): **This is a ""fun"" one. It either happens at random or there can be little triggers that completely change your mood (like that situation with my friend). Not much more to say about it, one moment you're happy, 10 minutes later you are suicidal, 10 more minutes later you can be happy again and any emotion in-between. What I would like to add here is that me and probably everyone with BPD have amplified emotions that last longer and overlap each other.**
* Chronic feelings of emptiness: **I just feel physical pain in the chest when I get very lonely, it sucks**
* Explosive anger: **self-explanatory, but I thankfully don't experience this**
* Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality (dissociating): **I don't experience this much except when having a boring conversation with someone; I go into my own world and suddenly I realize that I haven't payed attention at all to the conversation.**

&#x200B;

* Splitting (this one is not a symptom that is used for diagnosis, but it's worth mentioning): **Basically, people with BPD tend to have a hard time bringing together the good qualities with the bad ones which results in a very black and white thinking; we either love something (persons included) and we can only see the good qualities or we hate/strongly dislike something seeing only the bad qualities. The ""best"" part is that we can do a 180 and go from loving something/someone to hating it/them. I personally think this creates a very hard time when it comes to romantic relationships (imagine that all of the sudden you despise the person that you loved yesterday) and when it comes to workplaces (suddenly I hate my job so much that I quit).**

&#x200B;

Those are the agreed upon symptoms; for a BPD diagnosis you need to have 5 or more, but there are people that just have some BPD traits while not having BPD (almost like every mental illness, it's a spectrum). Even people that have the same symptoms can experience them differently.

Despite all the arguably sad things I have written until now, I find that having BPD also comes with some small advantages (when life gives you lemons, am I right?:

* **Since emotions are amplified, having good ones feels awesome. Love is infatuating, being happy about something is exhilarating, learning things (curiosity) is forever captivating and so on.**
* **Having to experience so much emotions almost constantly makes us very emphatic which helps us connect with people on a deeper level forming strong bonds despite our tendency to sabotage relationships.**
* **People with BPD also tend to be quite creative since, you know, feelings make for good art (although I'm still waiting on this one, I can't even draw a stick figure XD)**
* **And my favorite one (which I guess it's part of the first and second ones), I can't even put into words how much I love music, for me it is the brightest light in an otherwise grim world. No matter how down I am, how anxious or whatever, music is my lifebuoy in an ocean of emotions. Not to mention the validation I get from sharing a song to someone and that someone liking it as much as I do.**

So, all in all, this BPD is nasty business, but it is what it is. The other good news is that it's not the end of the world. There is even a therapy method (DBT) designed especially for BPD and, from my understanding, with time it can ""rewire"" a BPD brain to function more normally; although, I'm not gonna lie, it most likely takes time, dedication and money.

I know I probably overshared by writing this book of a comment, but hey I felt like it and if there's a chance it helped you or anyone reading it in any way, I'll take that chance.

I really hope you're not finding yourself in what I have described and even if you do, it can be like that classic situation when something hurts, we search for the symptoms on WebMD and at the end conclude it's cancer when in fact it's something mundane XD.

So yeah, whatever it's going on with you, I really hope it's just a temporary rough patch in life and I have faith in you that you'll recover. I wish you and everyone else that might read this a wonderful day.

Self-sabotaging interpersonal relationships (good and bad ones), negative interpersonal relationships (toxic ones basically), self-harm (this includes ED), severe & inconsistent mood swings (multiple times a day, can change over the slightest thing). Delusional thinking. Paranoia. BPD is a spectrum for sure, so instead of outbursts of rage, I internalize it. Beat on myself. The extreme emptiness. Overwhelming emotions, lack of emotional regulation. I also dissociate way more - to the point of having psychotic symptoms. So, like tactile, auditory and visual hallucinations though only when change happens (new job, moving, new classes, etc). Black or white thinking. Unstable sense of self. I used to be worse tbh. I used to have an FP or become attached quickly to people or manipulate people for my own gain. Learning morals really helped with that last one. 

I recommend reading I Hate You - Don’t Leave Me by Jerold J Kreisman (the newest edition). It’s helped me a lot. Very informative, supportive research and honestly it’s given me a lot of hope despite how rough the book can be sometimes. Lots of examples too.",-chicana-,tt5tqw
30,"My therapist just sort of “diagnosed” me as having traits of BPD. 

I do have the fear of abandonment, I have struggled with sense of self in the past (not really an issue these days), I do have unstable romantic and familial relationships (totally chill with friends…), I have the intense mood swings, and I do have impulsive behavior.

However. The self harm/suicide and the anger are both not a thing for me at all. Also the idolizing/devaluation of a person is something that I have done for sure, but it is something I worked hard on in my last relationship, and also is more of a conscious process for me these days so she doesn’t categorize me as having that symptom really.

It was very scary for me to hear a “diagnosis” because I have a person in my life who I suspect has BPD and she just is such a difficult and cruel person - so hearing the diagnosis made me terrified that I was like her.

But my therapist assured me that is IS spectrum, and she didn’t say to me “you have BPD”, but she said that she has noticed “traits” of BPD.

After doing some research I think that I have something called “quiet BPD” - which you can find info about on a YouTube channel from Dr. Ramani, the woman who does a lot of research on narcissism. She has great videos on both of those personality disorders.

I think getting the “diagnosis” has been really helpful. Because after learning a lot about the disorder I’m finding that I have struggled with many of the ‘traits’ in the past and have worked through them sort of one-by-one, but to have this umbrella of what all these issues fall under gives me and my therapist a path out of the woods. 

I’m excited to take this diagnosis in stride and tackle my issues head on! But the driving problem that led me to seek therapy was:

- struggling to get my work done (only working when I was “in the mood”, Aka dysregulated emotions …. I just thought I had adhd!
And 
- intense/unstable relationship: I just got out of a short relationship where I felt insanely attached to the person, and I was having major struggles with my thoughts. I couldn’t tell if what I was feeling was real or not. I would feel intensely attached, and was having fits of jealousy and extreme panic at losing him, but I also knew he wasn’t doing anything to trigger such strong emotions - so I wouldn’t tell him or blame him. but I was just so trapped in anxiety and wasn’t able to see what was happening at all. We broke up because he felt so bad that it was so hard for me to deal with a relationship and he said I need someone who could give me more one on one time to help me feel safe.

I was certainly on the brink of “losing myself” in that relationship too. I was clinging on for dear life. And I knew that the relationship length didn’t warrant that type of attachment…. Soooo therapy!

I’ve always known I struggled with self esteem and strong emotions and relational problems, but I didn’t really realize that they were all connected. I think it’s most important for you to seek out a mental health professional who can guide you through whatever you are going through - you never know what you are dealing with until you have a professional diagnose you.",Astrnougat,tt5tqw

Yes my boyfriend have BPD and some kind of “depression” but not hard and abandonment issues. And borderline, and he’s on period where he’s trying to stop using weed, he’s addicted but here’s 5 days whitout it and I’m proud of him.

Soo, it’s my 5th day that I’m battling my mind, fingers, fears, mind, heart, because I wanna text him soo bad and call him but I know it’s not a great time because of all that currently cause he’s in (I don’t know how to explain) but 2nd day of his bad behavior (mostly bad words about like he doesn’t deserve someone like me, I deserve better then this stupid guy that I don’t understand him etc) it feels like mood swings. Then I couldn’t keep anymore and call his best friend Ana and I just burst in tears like a baby and I explain all that to her and she’s like “oooohhhh thaattt” don’t worry and I’m like what 🥲🥲 she explain that it’s not first time he’s trying to stop smoking weed and he’s not in a situation where he need time and space to keep his clear and keep his stuff at one place like he need a couple of days maybe week or two but he’ll be fine soon, then said okay I understand I’ll give him as much as he need but I just hope that this is not the end because I love him and I care about him and I don’t want to lose this guy, like literally I’ve cried like a baby and throw up 5 times in one day 😄 and okay, last night he texted me like nothing happen but still messages looks neutral and whitout any emotions like it’s not him, so I overthinking as usual because I’m Virgo and my mind never stop running and I call her again and told her what he texted me and she said to me yes that’s his usual talking when he’s in this mood now. 

And yes, after all, even before like a week and a half I was spending nights and night reading about BPD, abandonment issues, depressions and stuff that’s bothering him and now. 

I just wish and hope that he is aware that I’m here for him even though we’re like 85km from each other 😒😞 I just hope he knows that I will never leave him and I will wait months so he can come back better 😊

And thanks for your comment and sharing your thoughts, 

Believe me, someone who really truly loves you and you’re the only one to him/she, they will never leave you behind, or anywhere in any situation you’re into.

When I was 4, my dad left my mom and mec she was single parent, I had to quit school to get my first ever job with 17 because she get sick and couldn’t do anything, I feed her and take care of her, she died 2 years ago in car crash. 

I still have feeling of her palm on my left shoulder as she asked me to hug her before she leave. 

She was beaten up by her ex boyfriend back in 2008 when I was a kid and I watched and hear everything, her face wasn’t the same. I was soo angry at this guy because of what he did to my
Mom, I couldn’t do anything because I was a kid. 

I know that I have anger issues, abandonment issues because we use to live everywhere, changed schools and friends in young age where in that age the children is still playing with toy cars and guns, I was living from door to door. 

Didn’t have childhood, anger, abandonment, some kind of easy depression, constantly feeling of sadness, ‘medium level’, emptiness, sometimes I’m scared of changes even though I know they bring better. 

My boyfriend tell me that my control over all that is extraordinary, his words, he tell me that he’s spoiled 😄 he couldn’t take that all, but everytime he start about his childhood trauma and stuff, I just hug him tight and I just want him to feel safe around me and in my arms because I’m soooooooooo soo protective over people I love and care about. 

At the end, I have high feelings for empathy, compassion, I can put myself in other’s people perspective/feelings because I have that something I don’t  know what.

I do love my boyfriend and I would never think about hurting he’s feelings and brake his heart. He had enough relationships and every single one ended that they leave him and hit his feelings or cheat on him.  He even hesitated about us beche think he wasn’t ready yet to enter in relationship but he told me that he just go with he’s feelings and we’re together for 4 months and he’s friends mom  and (his brother 26M) told me I am one of the normal and someone
Who actually care about him and I’m in great relation with his parents and his brother and I am the only one who did get along with them and I’m proud of it because his family and their permission about the relationship it means everything to me. 

I will never leave my boyfriend just because of his BPD and easy level of depression.  I didn’t have childhood and I wasn’t loved one and I was sleeping everywhere and I know that means abandonment.  He got abandonment issues as I have and I would never leave him even if I have to fight with BPD, I am a fighter and I don’t quit easy, i am loyal to my boyfriend’s heart and feelings and emotions. I don’t have heart to leave him and I don’t want to.

Some other option would be to see if your school has a counselor and if it does, go for it.

but now I am completely infatuated with it... I have gotten better about constantly researching about it.. 

I'm at the point right now that I have a disorder that has affected every area of my life, my entire life. I am not a victim, but still this was not of my cause.. There is no cure (as of yet) but only remission due to DBT Therapy and CBT and a few other therapies (One that I would NEVER try is Shock Therapy)

5,"I was misdiagnosed for 12 years. I knew that what was going on with me was more than depression and anxiety, and I knew that my temporary bipolar diagnosis was wrong. BPD was less understood then, and mine is more of the quiet type and I didn't have overt childhood trauma, so even though I felt like my symptoms matched the DSM, therapists told me I didn't have it, and I believed them. I read ""I Hate You, Don't Leave Me"" (older edition) and it made me confident I didn't have it. 

  
But I was still determined to figure out my diagnosis, and BPD kept coming back up in my research. I had stayed away from relationships for a while to keep my symptoms at bay, and after starting to work with a new therapist, I got into a new relationship and my symptoms flooded back. I found this subreddit. I got a better idea of the different ways BPD can be formed and expressed - nuances those doctors and resources didn't understand. I talked to my new therapist about it, we went over the symptoms, and we agreed that I finally had an answer. 

  
SO - my diagnosis was a relief. I had already been working hard to understand myself and improve my symptoms for years, and having an accurate diagnosis validated what I was experiencing. 

  
I've now been in remission for over 2 years, and I've gone much further than just accepting/managing symptoms and learning to control my behaviors. I've found my core identity, and I align with it more than ever. I've lost some symptoms completely. My patterns of thinking have changed. I still have many challenges, but I love myself and my life in a way that I previously thought would never be possible. 

Explaining how I got there is the hard part - it's taken so many different areas of understanding and improving. But I WANT to help others with my experience and knowledge, so I've made a YouTube channel where I discuss BPD as well as other topics on mental health, wellness, and self improvement that have contributed to my overall recovery.

22,"I was diagnosed in 2008 at a relatively late age, 37. I had been struggling and miserable, sometimes suicidal, for years and years before my diagnosis. I didn't understand what was wrong with me and since the internet was not the first thing I went to in the 1990's and 2000's, I couldn't find anything that matched my symptoms. My moods were crazy, but I was never manic, so bipolar was out. I had these black rages, I would feel like I wasn't a real person when out in public, I felt like I was a cartoon or something, that I was on the outside of this bubble where ""normal"" people were. When I started self-harming and ending up in the psych ward, I was finally diagnosed. When I researched what BPD was, and I saw that it was a PERSONALITY disorder, I just went bananas. I felt like I was lower than the scum of the earth and since I had a PERSONALITY  disorder,  I was going to be good at it. This started a 2-year cycle of self-harm, terrible alcohol abuse, rages that I wouldn't even attempt to control, and horrible crying jags that would end as soon as they began. Every single person and situation in my life became solidly black or white, any gray I was able to see before being diagnosed went right out the window. My behavior scared my kids to death. I was also prescribed a litany of meds from antidepressants to anti-psychotics and nothing helped, I just was lucky enough to experience every negative side effect there is.

After 2 years, I was homeless, my family had washed their hands, my kids were living with family, my boyfriend wanted nothing to do with me, I was all scarred up, I was exhausted, terrified, confused, and filled with guilt and shame and fear. After probably my 18th hospitalization in an 18 month period, I was dropped off with no shoes or coat in February (I was wearing what I had on when the police and ambulance came for me) by a medicab at a doctor's office (psychiatric and therapy).

 I finally was assigned to a therapist who took the time to get to know ME, not just my diagnosis, and with very VERY hard work, I came out the other side. My therapist was a perfect fit for me, she was compassionate and kind, but she did NOT accept bullshit from me. She was infinitely patient with me, and she cried with me when I described some of my trauma and cheered with me when I had a breakthrough or reached one of my goals. 

She also REFUSED to let me wallow. We worked through a lot of my trauma and feelings etc, but after we had worked through it together, she made me use the tools we worked on to reframe my perception and be able to move on. She was such a blessing to me. She taught me that while BPD is a pretty serious thing to deal with, it is NOT MY IDENTITY.  And having BPD did not give me an excuse to be an asshole, or to treat others with disrespect, or to not TRY. I sincerely believe that if I had not been assigned as her patient, I wouldn't be here right now. She helped me accept myself for myself and helped me realize that although I have a pretty unique brain that occasionally doesn’t cooperate and a serious diagnosis, I need to be vigilant about keeping my reactions and behavior based on reality. She also helped me accept that I am smart, funny,  kind, empathetic, all kinds of great things, not just an angry, insecure worm. I am also capable of loving and deserving of love, as well.

I can mentally identify what’s going on when I have episodes, start getting suspicious of people, splitting, etc. I can’t control the splitting, but I manage it when it comes. The impulses are difficult as well but that’s my next symptom to try and wrestle to the ground because I still do crazy shit to myself (I’m self destructive BPD) and would like to stop and give my loved ones a break lol.",Melancholymischief,18y8fyh
24,"It upset me at first, because (like a lot of us) I grew up in a household with a borderline parent. I blamed the parent (correctly) for a lot of trauma, and I blamed the disorder for the parent's behavior.

So in that moment I became the monster I had grown to hate. 

Learning about BPD helped me let go of that and separate treated BPD from the real monster: willfully untreated BPD. 

I also connected BPD to some other learning about the tribal societies in which we lived for nearly all of human history. Many of the components of BPD are pre-programmed responses to situations humans faced in tribes but not today. 

The basic idea is that trauma causes us to constantly look for evidence that we are soon to be excluded from our family/tribe and left to die - and that it's our own fault. With every social interaction, we are trying to save our own lives... something that would have been possible to do for a short time in tribal society, but that is far too stressful to do for the long periods of time we BPD people do now.

When I feel ultra-intense feelings, I can stop and remind myself that I'm not in tribal times. I can pause and remind myself that, even if someone leaves my life or I'm permanently excluded from a group, I'm going to survive and be ok. It helps tremendously that I am away from the triggering people and situations now, so I'm not being constantly led back into BPD crisis.

THOSE 10 years were somewhat succesful but mostly just hella messssyyyyy. I had known that my explosive extreme reactions were abnormal but honestly had always perceived them as “they were asking for it” as I truly felt I had to be pushed really hard to lash out (externally in front of an audience, looking back this was neither true or accurate so go figure). But after awhile at 32, I became pregnant during a small window of sobriety (involuntary as my plugs went MIA). Fast forward to a whirlwind of a pregnancy and delivery and first 4 months of literal everyday splitting on anyone and everyone, I finally understood maybe it was me, and the extent of how hard I split and on my baby and my dogs of 6-10 years from puppies too.. it just scared me and was like every time I exploded all I was seeing was my own reflection for the first time in my life.. it was me… ) . I actually stumbled on a random Facebook comment where a girl was like “im irritated over something else entirely but my boyfriend just said something stupid and now I’m trying to not fulfill the urge to pick a fight and leave him” and someone else asked you wouldn’t by chance have bpd would you? And OG was like sure do.. and they laughed about it… aaaaand I never felt so seen with someone else’s honesty about that whole dynamic. I looked it up, and took a test, and it came back highly likely. So I retook it, and severe likelihood. I think I ended up taking every risk quiz for all disorders that night, and none came back with the high likelihood consistently like bpd. Buuuut I didn’t like the description of it. And said it’s probably just adhd and post pardum and my oscillating hashimotos and hyperthyroidism (this had been my excuse 3 years prior when I WAS UNHINGED and acted like a hormonal teenager on steroids and had the physical symptoms of puberty again too, I started my period again after 3 years of none.. ) anyways, brought it up to my therapist who was hesitant to lean that way. She felt I was too ‘self aware’. I wasn’t I had just been doing obsessive research on it in the meantime and started to take the veil off myself for the first time. It really was the most uncomfortable yet somewhat relieving experience at the same time. We just kept on without mention of diagnosis and she started seeing my symptoms live and center, in real time, and started pointing them out at end of sessions. It was humbling. 

I’m still perpetually confused on how much is me and how much is normal or other factors. I’m constantly questioning and reflecting on my life now. Sometimes that really sucks and I hate it. But most days, I take a step back and realize this is part of the process. Something I’ve missed and overlooked for 30 years prior, and it’s surreal but I feel I’m heading somewhere new and am hopeful. I feel it took a weight of being unlovable off my shoulders, it validated me in a way while invalidating my responses which is .. fair. 

Funny enough, I’ve had a few interactions recently with people from back in high school and one of those specific embarrassed the fuck out of me as I was talking my shit but stumbled right into the realization of the incident being my first big “split” on someone outside my direct inner family circle or friends, first big ‘no hiding this shit’ split.. which predated when I felt my first big public rager took place. I had effectively misremembered the order of things until called out and uhhh.. then all the flashes of times BEFORE that came flooding in. I cried that night because .. yep I’ve been doing this shit , for the whole time, and COULD NOT SEE IT. And I’m NOT stupid. I can see right through most people. Except me.",Teeneyybit,18y8fyh

Best advice is to get off social media when triggered, learn to speak nicely to yourself and be more positive. Self sabotaging behaviours are what’s easiest but they just prolong symptoms of bpd.

I also discovered this all on my own. The doctors really hesitated with talking about PDs with me. Every time I talked about it everyone was surprised and avoided the topic and just said well maybe. Or that's serious. Well those are just categories. But no one wanted to treat it seriously. But now things make so much more sense

In fact I only got diagnosed because I threw a chair at an ex in a Starbucks and had a very public mental breakdown, so this was a last resort before checking myself into a facility. 

Don’t get me wrong, it’s been 8 long years of trial and error, mistakes and learning. I still struggle with my symptoms sometimes. But knowing why these things happen, and taking the fault away from me being “broken” and instead just being different took the pressure off.

52,"I think over the years I’ve experience several phases of BPD. Some being the extreme, yes, abusive type behaviors- although not to give myself an excuse but more so grace, each time I had entered into that phase I was facing some extremely heavy traumas that flipped my whole world and they weren’t just perceived. I also spent quite a bit of this last decade in more or less being quiet bpd. Hence why I said I had some success in life in general, but like with other, what goes up must eventually come down if you’re ignorant to your mental health. 

Now recently after having my baby, and I was splitting almost daily on everyone, one person was the sole recipient of all that rage. My partner. He is also undiagnosed but most likely either BPD or NPD, for real. So we can fan each others flames a lot. Been together for 12 years, and it was just an immense amount of stress for the both of us. It was really when MY dog I’ve raised since a wee puppy and is currently 6 and the GENTLEST SWEETEST dog ever grunted at my baby for grabbing her ear, which she has always hated, I immediately when into mama bear on steroids and within minutes I had not an ounce of attachment or love for my dog. And that’s what really got me. I knew that was NOT a normal response and something was wrong, as it also was not not normal ish for me… you understand? I just never had it directed to an ‘innocent’ like an animal that’s done nothing wrong, or a baby for being a baby… 

After really finally looking at my past thru the lense of the diagnosis… I had to really humble myself. Because, I absolutely was abusive towards my loved ones at times, mentally, physically sometimes even, and most definitely verbally. 

Funny thing is I almost kinda gloated on the fact that no one would ‘survive’ an argument with me if they finally pushed me over the edge to get drawn into one, nor could anyone out manipulate me (truly I grew up with 4 parents, each of which exhibiting a different form of parental abuse and/or neglect each one dealing with some letter combo of PD and addictions). Most often, I avoid direct confrontation. I’ve always known deep down that it’s part fear, but stemming from fear of abandonment because I learned from the best, and I AM RUTHLESS when I lose my temper and I know all the fucked up techniques and have picked up all the cues knowing where the weak spots are. And it has been true, it only takes me one time to lose my cool on someone and they’ve seen enough to not wanna fuck with it anymore. This tamed me a lot, which brought on the quiet bpd I think. This splitting was still there, they just came out differently.. until those pregnancy hormones were attempting to level out. With thyroid disfunction I was a HOT HOT mess. 

My partner has been put thru the ringer. That I will admit. I’m sorry for your history with someone that resembled a me. Especially during the time when I truly wasn’t seeing it, I can only imagine how that would feel on the receiving end. I do often involve my partner in my ‘revelations’ or intentions going forward, am super open to him about progress made for this exact reason. Validation is important. It’s always been so for me, to an extreme. I’ve always tried to operate on a system of not expecting more than I’m myself capable of and giving back. I’ve always felt during splits I become like .. like I hulk into a form of me that is .. it’s me but I’m not necessarily in control of it at that point. And it’s destructive to all. Me them all surrounding and involved. I’m working and making very good progress in suppressing the hulk, but so far have started just exhibiting new or old disasterous impulsiveness that I have to try to reel in before they get out of hand now.

0,"I had a meltdown at work and was taken to the hospital, ended up in the psych ward for 3 weeks. There wasn't any therapy available there, they just medicated us and left us to pace around. Eventually I was called into the psychiatrists office to do a safety plan for discharge, just going over my history and living situation. The meeting felt very casual, around half an hour, and it started with the doctor thinking I was someone else entirely. 

I didn't realize I was diagnosed with BPD during that stay until much later, when I was trying to arrange an appointment with a new caseworker. When I gave them permission to check my health background they said they don't treat people with cluster-B disorders, and I was confused because I was looking for help with occupational therapy due to autism and managing early symptoms of psychosis. So it totally blindsided me, I wasn't even told I had it - I had to seek out DBT resources on my own anyways, so I don't think a diagnosis is beneficial for receiving care - if anything, it's a detriment because the stigma towards BPD within the medical field brands you as a hypochondriac by default, it feels impossible to be taken seriously by doctors and it's frightening when your health is deteriorating and you need help and you're labelled as a malingerer.

I don't deny that I struggle with the symptoms of BPD - maybe less now that I used to, but I'm recovering. However - if there was one thing I could erase from my medical history, it would be my BPD diagnosis. It's been nothing but trouble.

The thing is, the diagnosis doesn't change anything, except now you know how to go about managing your symptoms better. You've already been dealing with it, you just now have an explanation and a whole new world of treatment options. 

You will be okay. Behind this diagnosis, and the disorder itself, you are still you. You have been given the vital,  initial piece of information that will set you on the necessary path towards overcoming struggles, ones which I imagine you have already been grappling for some time. 

It is still scary, I understand that. Try not to let accounts from random internet strangers poison your mind. I've read that, in some cases, BPD can even be treated to the point where individuals eventually no longer meet the criteria for diagnosis.

It's a neuropsychological disorder, most often with a big dose of trauma. And never let yourself forget: though it's not curable, it's treatable. Extremely so.

It is considered by many to be an archaic diagnosis - the mental health field is moving away from classifying personalities as “disordered” and more toward thinking of the constellation of symptoms that make up BPD to instead be adaptive responses. That being said, many people find a lot of validation in the BPD diagnosis - it depends on the individual. The criteria that form BPD can be seen as one side of a coin, the other being a sensitivity, a vulnerability that can be a superpower if directed in that way. It’s just a collection of traits that many people share which the American psychiatric association chose to label BPD. Through things like mindfulness, therapy (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy was created specifically for BPD), recognizing your strengths, clarifying your values, one may find they eventually no longer meet criteria for BPD.

I was misdiagnosed for 12 years and did find the answer to be helpful, despite the stigma. It's hard to get better before you can understand what's going on with yourself. Just try to remember that you are no different than you were before your diagnosis - it doesn't change or define who you are. It's just putting a name and explanation to your symptoms. And guiding your recovery going forward!

I completely understand your concerns about the diagnosis as far as treatment goes. But fortunately, I do think more therapists are starting to better understand BPD, and if one were to turn you away because of the diagnosis, it's probably better you don't work with them anyway. I think finding a good therapist in general can be very difficult, but they are certainly out there. 

  
One thing I find especially important to stress for the newly diagnosed is that BPD remission is not uncommon. I've been in remission for 2 years, and am far enough in my recovery that I don't just have to cope with my symptoms or spend a lot of conscious effort resisting unhealthy behaviors. I love myself and love life, and you can get there, too.

  
It's hard for me to break down general advice in writing for everyone here who needs it, so I started a YouTube channel with BPD information and advice as well as other topics that have helped me on my recovery journey. https://www.youtube.com/@sarruhtonin if you're interested.

  
Especially helpful for you right now might be the ""Understanding BPD"" video that breaks down the symptoms and diagnostic criteria (if you're still not completely clear on that), and ""BPD Advice Part 1"" which is made for people in your position. The BPD remission/recovery video may also be helpful right now.

6,"Always keep working at it, working on yourself. It can be debilitating at times (and those times can stretch on for what seems like forever, that’s ok) but everything you do for yourself pays off. Whether it’s physically taking care of yourself, pursuing education or career goals, therapy, spirituality, anything. INVEST IN YOURSELF. 

You matter, you matter so much. I encourage you to be on your own team and strive to love yourself. We can fall victim to a mentality/false reality that makes us believe we are unloveable and alone. Just a quick browse of this sub will show you lots of examples of that. We feel things intensely and it can be a curse and a gift (in that order). But you will always have yourself, and you are worthy and deserve love. The outside world is not the litmus test of your worth, our way of being is strange to others, often even to ourselves. But feeling things intensely is not wrong or doomed, not knowing what to do with those feelings is what causes the majority of our hurt. 

Therapy can be very hard for people like us. There is still a stigma around the diagnosis, and finding a therapist thats a good fit is often a challenge. But even if you don’t find the perfect therapist, or even one that you really trust: try to learn a little each time. Try to take away a skill from each session. Sometimes just being heard is so important and healing in it’s own way. We can get isolated because we feel so deeply and feel so hard and it can be so urgent that most people aren’t equipped to handle that. Most aren’t. Pick your inner circle wisely. Sometimes to fill the loneliness we allow ourselves to be mistreated. Please try to remember you are worthy of respect and love and kindness. What isn’t ok for someone without BPD, isn’t okay for us either. Our minds can be funny, slippery things. 

It’s not easy but it’s not impossible. But it’s okay if it feels impossible. Sometimes… the best thing we can do is wait.",christmas-horse,w9id74

55,"1. You are not bad, you are not wrong, you are not broken. You are a human.
2. Get curious about yourself. Sure you can learn about the diagnosis but what is more helpful is to learn about yourself. Become the expert on YOU. Become aware of your patterns, your behaviors, and most importantly your narratives (awareness does not = judgement). 
3. Understand your triggers and your limits—this means learning about your subjective units of distress (SUDs) and figuring out how to regulate them when you feel you are in a crisis. I personally like TIPP skill for this (submerging my face in ice water repeatedly when I am crying and feel like I’m going insane, or intense exercise when I am super angry)
4. It’s not all your fault. Things happened to you, some that were out of your control, and these events shaped how you view the world. Ok, so some of your coping mechanisms are maladaptive and they no longer serve you at this stage of your life? Cool, you can work on them. 
5. Literally every human being meets criteria for something in the DSM. Don’t beat yourself up. You have amazing qualities that no one else has. 
6. Above all, you are worthy, you are enough, and you are lovable :):):) now say that to yourself 

❤️

Edit: Lastly, sharing the DBT skills that really help me: 
-Check The Facts (everyone in the world needs to do more of this. We often confuse feelings for facts)
-Opposite Action (especially useful when angry, if the anger is NOT justified then do the opposite action of what you have the urge to do. If anger is justified, you can problem solve)
-Willing Hands (in tough times, turn your palms facing up, it’s uncomfortable but it works) 
-Radical Acceptance (the hardest skill IMO)

Now I can read about it and other peoples experiences without wanting to burst into tears and cry about my experiences lol.

DBT helped me so much, I have better coping skills for when I'm triggered and I definitely handle my emotions better. I'm sure it will be the same for you! And I hope you get a new FP (I know it doesn't work that way, but you deserve better than someone abandoning you all the time)",,w9id74

0,"I have BPD. I worked very hard for 5 years and now I'm in remission (which is the closest we can get to being cured). Here's some tips to help you get here. 

- Do as much therapy as possible (DBT & Person centered as a combination is really good) 
- Learn the DBT skills in therapy and apply them every day
- Stay out of romantic relationships until you get a good amount of therapy under your belt (they are a huge source of triggers and will distract you from working on yourself) 
- Try not to engage in ""FP"" relationships. They are extremely unhealthy and damaging for everyone involved
- Do things that boost your self esteem every day (meditation, journaling, exercise, developing skills etc) 
- Pick your friends carefully and stick with people that care about you
- Stay away from drugs and alcohol. They are a recipe for disaster and will ruin your life 
- Learn to respect others boundaries and try apply healthy boundaries to your life
- Drop people from your life that aren't good for you
- Learn mindfulness and meditation (it's a huge help)",,188o50g

2,"If you can make yoga or some kind of mindfulness practice part of your daily routine now, you will be better off than most of us in ten years. You will save yourself from the secondary physical symptoms of BPD. Unmanaged BPD means that your nervous system is constantly overstimulated, your stress hormones are through the roof, and this results in people with BPD getting heart disease and having heart attacks at a much higher rate than those without the disorder. The longer you keep your nervous system relatively stable, the easier it becomes to maintain. Many pwBPD report that symptoms generally get less severe with age, and I can testify to that. I'm 39 and doing better than ever.",BeePeeDee_fam,188o50g

2,"Honestly there’s a high chance none of them will know what it is. The only person I’ve told who knew it exists beforehand has a degree in psychology, and he still had to ask me to explain it to him cause he wasn’t exactly sure what it was. 

This’ll make it easier as you can tell them what it is to you and how it impacts you. You could set up boundaries like ‘I just want to let you know I have BPD. *explain if asked*. It also means sometimes I get really angry and have a hard time controlling it, so it would really help me if I can say I need space for a bit and you give me that space until I come to you? I don’t want to accidentally snap at you’. I had a conversation like this with my mom and she was receptive to giving space when needed. Make sure to set boundaries like this before the situation happens so you’re prepared

You also don’t have to tell anyone as it’s none of their business. I normally tell romantic partners as a sort of warning/curtesy as it tends to impact my relationships, but otherwise it gets brought up when it gets brought up.

The biggest thing is to not be ashamed of it. Now that you know, it’ll make it easier to recognize the feelings, behavior, and patterns so you can start to heal and get better control. I hope all goes well for you!",eris_entropy213,1bvxw81

BPD is about Emotional Regulation.  Please order this book by *Imi Lo - Emotional Sensitivity and Intensity - How to Manage Intense Emotions as a Highly Sensitive person*   Amazon has it.  I couldnt believe how incredibly it described me!  


It speaks a lot of everything we go through and why.  There are reflections at the end of each chapter so you can be aware of your individual unique and special traits and how to manage them. It enables you, like a training course - to KNOW yourself and to help yourself.


I am on a waiting list for STEPPS program at the Mental Health & Addictions Center.  That stands for *Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving*


My clinic does not call it Borderline - its so vague - they only term it Emotional Intensity Disorder or Difficulty.

3,"When I got my diagnosis I was relieved that there was a name for what I have, it made me feel less crazy. It’s still a big diagnosis to be labelled with, so I spiralled as-well because help was difficult to get (Where I’m from, there’s a no help rule on institutionalisation and most medications). It’s a diagnosis that can’t be cured but you can learn to live with it, treat the symptoms and manage the mood-swings as-well as the other things that belong to BPD.

I know it might sound cheesy or something, but when I finally did find a clinic that was willing to help me, that wasn’t associated with normal mantel health care, they really tough me a lot. Finding people that think the same or have gone through the same as you and talking to them really is key. Also don’t forget that BPD is something you get from childhood trauma, ask them to treat that too. This is something that I didn’t do, because I didn’t think there was anything traumatic, turned out it was just really normal form me to be abused by most people. I didn’t realise it was bad and didn’t talk about it for a long time, so I didn’t get help for it for over 10 years. Trauma can be very subconscious, BPD stems from trauma, you weren’t able to develop a personality due to this as a child.

Relieving to have a name to put to it, but the awareness that comes with having a diagnosis while simultaneously experiencing the behaviors…much less relieving. I felt that spiral as well. Nothing is “normal”, per se, but I think that is a perfectly ok response. BPD has a bad rap. And sitting with yourself and thinking “i have a personality disorder?” I think one of the problems is it sounds so severe. I try to think of it in funny acronyms. I try to remember that BPD does not make you a monster. That was the first clear feeling I felt. It does not make you a monster. I promise.

And that feeling of looking back on your childhood and it all making sense…the peace but sadness for your inner child. Felt 100%. You are not alone. Welcome to the family. You are not a monster, you just feel deeply. Sending so many positive vibes out to you.",anyalaPewPewGod69,17khgpu

Its not the end of the world, its just getting started because now your behaviors make sense, and you will get to know yourself more, and more, and it can feel like so fucking much sometimes, and patterns you wanted to leave in the past will probably repeat themselves, because changing takes time, and if you fall, the right thing to do is to pull yourself up and learn from your mistakes, so they do not repeat themselves again, I know it sounds like a total turn off, hard work am I right, but damn is it worth it, and I have learned and continue to learn so much with each day, there can be bad days but also good ones, and you learn to appreciate both with time


A person who learns to control their bpd, is a mighty one, believe me

18,"Hello! 👋 

Don’t feel alone, it seems like you’re in pretty good company here. 

Just last week my therapist told me she believes that I have BPD in addition to my previous diagnoses of Bipolar, OCD, and PTSD. I was absolutely taken aback and freaked out. It seems likely that my mother has NPD, and my brain immediately focused on the “personality disorder” part and decided that it meant that I’m like her (my abuser) and I felt an incredible sadness and fear for a few days after. There was a bittersweetness to it for me as well, though, because I knew there were things that weren’t explained by my other issues. (Not only mood episodes, but big emotional changes in the middle of the mood episodes making it hard to know where I actually was with anything or why, constantly being very easily triggered and having that drastically change my perception of things around me, etc). 

After a few days of grieving and feeling mostly terrible about it I reached out on the bipolar sub because I know that these two diagnoses are often comorbid, and people really helped put it into perspective for me. One person said “all borderline means is that people hurt you.” So it’s okay to be upset that people hurt you/angry with what happened in the past, but it’s not our fault that people hurt us so badly that we developed this illness - so we shouldn’t be upset with ourselves. We’ve done nothing wrong and we are surviving and trying to get better! That counts for so much ❤️ my wife told me I’m the same person I was before I was told about borderline, and it doesn’t make me any different in her eyes and shouldn’t make me any different in mine, either. 

I hope that helps a little. Take care, OP! (Hugs)",meglandwellmusic,17khgpu

- BPD can present very differently in different people. I have had 3 bpd friends in life and all of us were super different with how our symptoms manifested.

- Chronic emptiness is a common trait of BPD, but no, you are likely not going to feel this way forever. And even if your emptiness remains long term, treatment for BPD including learning skills that you can do to cope with those feelings so that said emptiness isn't pervasive in your life. A lot of people (sadly including some doctors) talk about BPD being incurable like it's a death sentence. It's not. BPD isn't curable because it's got genetic and neurological aspects to it.

In short, people with Borderline Personality Disorder struggle with emotional regulation and feel all of their emotions dialed up to the extreme. The mental pain caused by extreme emotions leads to acting out in a variety of ways, in desperate sometimes frantic attempts to end the pain. These behaviors are often self destructive and also harmful to the other people in their lives. 

PwBPD also tend to struggle with identity and don’t have a stable self image, making it hard for them to have healthy relationships and function in their daily lives. 

There’s a looooot more to it than that but that’s the gist. 

There’s a huge stigma against pwBPD, so when you go googling, be careful about where you’re getting your information from. Even healthcare providers hold a lot of bias against BPD, some outright refusing to work with BPD patients at all. But there are people who can and will help.

The most common treatment for BPD is Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). [Here are some free DBT resources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1873fcq/free_dbt_resources/?share_id=ldmliWpgaC8g73t8pYy19&utm_name=ioscss) It can be overwhelming to start out without any guidance, but maybe it will help you.",Insomniached,1b1vnfi
0,"“Favourite person”.. basically means we develop an unhealthy relationship with these people. We may become too obsessed and clingy, letting every little thing they do impact us. 

It is with our FPs that we tend to show our BPD traits the most severely. We fear rejection from our FPs A LOT, and it causes problems. For example: a lot of FPs tend to be romantic partners. Our fear of rejection may cause us to have anxiety around cheating. This can lead to the development of an obsession about them cheating.. which presents itself as delusional thinking. For example, I’ve been so scared of my partner cheating that I sometimes tune into certain innocent things he does and try to rationalize it as evidence towards the theory of him cheating. 

Another common thing with FPs is ditching them quickly (after a usually imagined rejection). Do you ever find yourself ending relationships with people abruptly? Going on blocking sprees? Leaving the people in your life asking “wait, why do they suddenly hate me?”

The goal for us is basically to not have an FP! But because that is extremely difficult, we must work towards creating boundaries with our FP so we aren’t so emotionally vulnerable with them.",largecucumber,te47ty

In addition to defining it, he describes the different relational patterns that can occur with your FP and the ways you can help cultivate a healthier way of relating to others.

My FP (Who I'm in love with and she says she's in love with me)

Recently had a mental breakdown, she has her own mental health issues. and she got so bad that she's ended up moving back home over 800miles away and doesn't want to talk to anyone at the moment. 

Her breakdown caused my BDP to get really bad to the point I've had to start taking medication. 

The worst part is she started to move stuff into my place for us to eventually be together when she was ready to eventually move in. Know I have no idea when I will eventually talk to her again or even see her as the only time I can go see her is when I'm on holiday from work. Next time I'm off work is in June. 

I don't even know if she will be recovered by then from what she is going through. It sucks because I miss her and can't stop thinking about her but don't want to messaged her as she doesn't want to talk to anyone.",NousevaAngel,te47ty

I started being more aware of my emotions and try to take a minute to decide if it’s how I feel or if it’s my BPD, if the intensity is warranted, and if I should really follow through the choice I want to make or if I should hold off until I’m in a better place. I’m not sure how to make it better with medication nor have I tried DBT, but I have noticed that learning to understand the feelings helps navigate and make situations easier to deal with.

As well as an anxiety disorder 😤 In the end I paid for one to one DBT sessions with a therapist. It cost me £60 an hour and I went once a week. It’s changed my life! I still struggle, but having that support really got me out of that difficult patch. You’re going to be okay 👍",Donthurtme321,15mvjvg
1,"Hey!

So I get you. Of course having bpd, been there done that.

I don't know if it is good or not, but I recently released a book on bpd.

Maybe you can read and review it?

It's called You Are Not Alone With BPD: A Story Anthology of Borderline Personality Disorder.

It's still not available as a kindle though, but if you still want it, I can give you a free copy!

If it helps you, great. If it doesn't, I will help you find another book that does.

I am borderlinepikachu on discord if you want to talk to me.

I hope I didn't come off as salesy haha.

I genuinely want to help you navigate bpd, and if you have any questions, you can ask me anytime.

When I first got to know about bpd, I remained suicidal every day for a week.

So you are strong to weather this storm with your head held high!",,15mvjvg

3,"Hi everyone, asking for your opinion. I am dating my bf for about 7 months now. I used to study psychology though i didnt practice it. However, i can read psychological patterns of people. It was a whirlwind romance for sure. I would call my self empathatic/empath whatever people label it these days but God shown me the real him since the beginning. I dont particularly have addiction but turns out he does. He smokes, he drinks and he used to do drugs. Then because of his status (divorce with one kid, i am never married) i tried to break it off with him many times because the thought of dealing with his status is just too hard. I do overthink a lot, have commitment issues and pretty much an avoidant. So there were a lot of anger issues, breaking stuff, yelling, throwing things but never hitting me, emotional abuse, some stories kept changing, substance abuse, self harm when i tried to say things out loud. I thought he was a narc.

I suffered from depression 2 years ago but after this I got PTSD because of him. I am someone whos not used to violence, any kinda abuse (traumatic childhood sure). He lost his mom, his kid lives with his ex, his dad (acc to him) used to beat him and his relationship with his brother is not so well. Everytime he devalued/split on me, he would apologize the next day or at least show remorse/shame/guilt so i thought to myself 'he couldnt be a narc'. Then i got to the conclusion hes got BPD (please forgive me if i somehow way out of line for diagnosing him). He told me implicitly that 'it makes sense now'. He went to the doctor afte his divorced and his doctors seems to prescribe him with drugs and it scares him now that he might get addicted to drugs. I think the doctor misdiagnosed him because he didnt tell the whole story and he told me that he didnt agree with the doctors thats why he stopped. 

A couple of weeks ago i just couldnt take it anymore when he called me names in front of his friend after some drinks. I triedddddd to understand it comes from his illness but it hurts me so much (ive never been called things because i know i never did anything to deserve this)
Then he started opening up to his boss whose wife is bipolar and that he wants to go to this chinese medical guy with his psuedoscience with aromatherapy. Sure i believe certain smell would make his mind peaceful. Ive spend the last month or two reading journals upon journals and DBT was the way to go. I had hope that despite all the traumas he's got, he still got hope. 99 percent remission rate 2 years after DBT. But no matter how much im trying to convince him (minding my words, reading his mood) he doesnt wanna go. Everytime he split/devalued/discarded me he always said he wants to get better, he might wanna go to rehab, we should go to couple counselling together, etc but he never follows through.

I know i couldnt tolerate his abuse anymore for the next 'episode'. He's in denial. He's full of shame, low self esteem and fear that he might get labelled as 'crazy' to most people but its the only way out of his own hell...i feel shame when my doctor wrote down depression as my diagnose everytime i went to the ER so i could only imagine him getting BPD label on his patient file. 

Maybe if i leave him for good, he would finally realise that he should love himself before he could love someone?? 

I always told him stop with the self hate, dont think you are stupid cause youre not. Whatever happened in his childhood were never his fault but he needs to take responsibility now for what hes done after hes an adult. I told him there should be two voices in his head. When the hating one is loud, making the loving one louder. I know this because i suffered from depression and it was hell. I knew i needed help and completely surrender to whatever God sent me as help. I practice compassion, mindfullness, gratitude, i took vitamins and refused anti depressant and just when i got my life back in track, i met him..

Any thoughts on how to proceed? I think i will stop talking about therapy from now on. I am kinda done 'helping' him see, he needs to see it for himself and want to help himself.",Xyrius_Bleck,15mvjvg

I’ve been referred to a psychologist which I think will be the DBT. I’m glad to hear you found this helpful and sorry you ended up having to go private or face having no support for two years. It’s good to hear from someone who’s a bit further on in the journey that is doing better. 
I think I will have to go down the NHS route - I was made redundant about a year ago and suddenly all these great relationships I had with my colleagues were pulled out from under me and came to a sudden end. Since then I’ve been spiralling and not able to work so I can’t afford private help. I’m hoping once I get some support I can get back to work, I miss having a job so much!

0,"Sorry man, learning can be really difficult. The stigma is rough, and having your personality labelled as ""disordered"" just like... I don't know how to describe it, it just hurts. Like it feels like you're being told you don't have a mental health problem, your personality just sucks.

If it makes you feel any better about it, BPD recovery is rough, but it's one of the personality disorders with the highest rates of remission. It's been nicknamed ""the good prognosis diagnosis"" because of how high the rates of recovery are. [One study found a 90% remission rate,](https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2014/04/10/borderline-personality-disorder-the-good-prognosis-diagnosis/) and people who recover usually stay in recovery.

Take it easy. Learning about it can be the hardest step, and it sounds like you're understandably going through it. But you're also right when you say that you now know what to treat. My own experience was that I was in the mental health system starting around 14, got diagnosed with something different by every mental health provider I saw, and never got any better with around 7 years of therapy. I spent all of my middle + high school years as a suicidal wreck who barely scraped through school. Then when I was 21(?), I got the BPD diagnosis. I started dialectical behavioral therapy for it and it affected me unlike any therapy I had tried before. It's crazy but I actually started seeing results!!!! And by time I completed the program, a majority of my issues with anxiety & depression were almost totally gone. I've been out of DBT for a few years and I'm not 100% cured, but it's nothing I can't manage.

Sometimes it's just all about treating the right problem. Good luck, I hope things go well for you.",crownemoji,17k8m2j

This is going to sound odd but congrats on getting a diagnosis! For me this was the key to finally getting the right treatment. I still struggle and I still go through rough patches but I’m so much better now. 

As for advice: put in the work. Make sure you find a therapist and therapy type that fits you and then work hard at it. BPD is no picnic and it’s going to take a lot of effort and relearning simple things.

You can have any life you want right now because you are young and there is time to change. You can have a happy life and it can be within your control if you allow your thoughts permission for it. 

I've seen others who went the opposite and that's a life of chaos and misery. Up to you. Don't let your country or environment consume you. That's the easiest thing to feel and believe because you are young and limited in travel. Set goals for yourself that will make small changes.

3,"Reading this very much reminded me of myself at your age. 

The bright side to an early diagnosis is that your brain is still a lot more malleable in this stage of your life. My tip, and something that helped me immensely, is that you take advantage of that. 

How you go about it depends on you as a person, so I can’t give you a lot of concrete tips. It sounds like you have access to some form of therapy since you’ve been prescribed meds in the past. So, work with your therapist/psychiatrist, don’t lose hope, and keep in mind that your cards for recovery/remission are looking good. I know it sounds paradoxical to hear because of all the suffering BPD brings, but this is basically what my psychiatrist told me at the time and it’s made a world’s difference.

7,"I was misdiagnosed with Bipolar II after getting out of the mental hospital, but I knew something wasn’t right and I confided in a close friend who also has BPD about me potentially having it, and he told me I should watch some videos.

 I watched a video by Anthony Padilla, who is a really famous YouTuber, where he interviewed people with BPD, and any insecurities or upset that I felt about having BPD was lightened significantly after watching the video. It was very relatable and made me feel seen, and I immediately went to my psychiatrist and got a BPD diagnosis.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MkY7P5gtGww

I think letting her know that BPD doesn’t make you a bad person, and that you can heal is what is the best. I remember my first post-diagnosis depression, and that’s why informational videos were the best. There’s another YouTuber who dedicated his channel to people with BPD and he’s absolutely fantastic and very positive, and reminds you that you can heal, so she should definitely watch him too. His name is Dr. Daniel Fox.

https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC932vfOwTbFni3GRrvVA6IQ

It will take a bit of time before she accepts her diagnosis, so just try to build her up and make her feel good about herself and remind her she’s a great person. I think sharing these videos with her is a great start because she won’t feel as lost. It’s been a little over a year since I got my diagnosis, and I’ve completely accepted it and am doing a lot better now, but it took baby steps! Good luck! Hope she feels better soon.",,16oqebk
8,"I have bpd, and I've been diagnosed for years, and my little sister recently got diagnosed as well, and I just told her it doesn't make her who she is even though it feels that way sometimes.

I had the hardest time when I was first diagnosed because it felt like a death sentence and honestly I was super surprised I even hit 30 years old, but therapy helps so so much. I've done DBT and now I'm doing EMDR to work on my trauma. I'm sure there are some people who can manage without therapy, but in my case I couldn't. 

I think what's the hardest part about accepting it is the stigma. You can Google it and find so many articles about people with bpd being ""crazy"" or ""abusive"", and while some people may be, that's not specifically a bpd trait. 

I've also found that it helps to separate myself from it. Like I have my ""bpd thoughts/brain"" vs ""actual me"". It has helped with my sense of identity and realizing that my disorder doesn't define me. 

And if she's not ready to get help at the moment, that's fine too. You can't force anyone to get better, and it's not uncommon to want to. Because there's not a magic cure all medication for it, a lot of recovery is therapy and work, and some people take a while to be even willing to do that.


Edit: Just wanted to add, your support would mean a lot, because, at least for myself there was a lot of shame with learning about my diagnosis, and even after being diagnosed for years there are times that I'm just ashamed at my symptoms, or THOUGHTS, which like, you can't control your thoughts, just your reactions to them. I spent years trying to keep myself from thinking because I thought that was the ""broken"" part. But it's the reacting to the thoughts and feelings, and learning how to do it in a healthy way that doesn't make me feel guilty or ashamed",psychxticrose,16oqebk

13,"It is amazing that you want to be so supportive and be there for her! And I agree with everything everyone else is saying. The best advice I can give from personal experience is just be patient and listen, the worst things my mom and later stepmom would tell me is to ""stop being so dramatic"" and ""to get over it"" because I had a hard time understanding and controlling my emotions and even explaining why I felt them and this was years before my diagnosis. 

A suggestion from my bf that helped him understand me a lot more was he did a lot of research and first learned about the different sub-types accidentally from a book by Christine Lawson called Understanding The Borderline Mother who lists the sub-types as: 

The Waif  ""learned that submissive behavior was the most adaptive response to an oppressive environment."" She also ""sees herself as an incompetent failure, and is overly dependent on the approval of others.""

The Hermit is ""a perfectionist, a worrier, and . . . an insomniac. . . Hermit mothers suffer from persistent fantasies of harm coming to themselves or others, and tend to attribute hostile intentions to others.""

Queen mothers ""compete with their children for time, attention, love, and money."" And ""The dramatic and sometimes hysterical behavior of the Queen mother can terrify her children.""

And finally, Witch mothers can be ""bitter, demanding, sarcastic, and cruel,"" and ""Witch mothers know what to say to hurt or scare their children, and use humiliation and degradation to punish them.""

I've also seen BPD sub typed as clusters A/B/C or as the 4 types: discouraged, impulsive, petulant, and self-destructive. Personally due to past experiences having them classified the way Lawson does it resonates with me and helped me discover that more than likely my mom has BPD too with the Witch sub-type while I fall mainly under Waif with some aspects of Hermit. That's my personal take, as like with others saying BPD is still controversial and there is a lot of misinformation spread about it. Especially because reading over the other 4 types I've felt like I've been in all four of those states at one point in the past and that the waif/hermit/queen/witch shouldn't be limited to just moms with BPD.

Another suggestion is we would, after I felt a little more in control and could sit down and try to work on having conversations and trying to express my feelings into words (it's still difficult for me to do most days but it's progress) is we would look for movies that had accurate representations of people with BPD. His favorite was Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, mine that I ended up having to watch by myself (things got to real for him to keep watching) is Rachel getting Married with Anne Hathaway depicting a woman with BPD fresh out of rehab as she tries to attend her sisters wedding. The way her family treated her is very reminiscent of how my family reacted to me and would treat me, except the sister part I had 2 extremely supportive older brothers who were great support before I met my BF.

That movie might be an emotional trigger for you and your husband bc it is a very heavy movie and I would not suggest her watching these because it might hinder her instead of help during this time but it might help you both understand her perspective a little.

Learning and dealing with BPD is about understanding why you feel as you do, what can trigger you and then with support changing those behaviours that cause so much pain.

You’re not gonna want to do it, it’s going to feel tedious but it is necessary. Do not waste the years I wasted by not going to a DBT skills group/individual therapy. You need both.

Within 18 months of joining a DBT skills group, 80% of people no longer meet criteria.

It’s not a death sentence, but you need to do something about it. The freedom I feel now compared to when I was actively BPD is incredible and I worked very hard to get to where I am. Message me if I can be of any assistance.",tpavy,16ewh9n
0,"It sounds like he has become your favorite person. I'm not sure if you know what that means in a BPD scenario, but basically, we latch on (it just happens) to someone and our whole world revolves around them and we look to them for emotional regulation, advice and our identity sometimes. Our mood depends on theirs and we feel like we're gonna die if they don't answer our text right away. 

This is very common and there is a lot online about it. I'll share [this video with you](https://youtu.be/DViNoaLh4jQ?si=ZjTvW_s8-09Nw9nk), I share it with everyone who has a problem with favorite person. If you choose to watch it, make sure you watch the whole thing, it all ties in.

It is scary, but you know, if you both have a discussion about this, and you are aware of what is happening, that's a good thing. You can have some boundaries in order to keep things healthy and work on abandonment issues, so you are not so dependent on him and the other way around.

I actually had a healthy friendship with my last FP. They learned all about what it means to be a FP and understood. So, we had really good boundaries and there were very few episodes that happened. I've been working hard on myself and have gotten to the point where they are no longer FP, but more like a close friend. I don't rely on a hello every day and I don't feel like they are going to abandon me.

0,"It really does feel better once everything makes sense. Because now you know how you should and can handle it.

I was told I have bipolar for 10 years straight. While I still do... It was the undetected BPD that made me feel like an imposter because although I do have the bipolar mood swings, they'd be disrupted by BPD mood swings. I go back and forth randomly while the core shitty mood from bipolar remains. They constantly clash and make things worse.

This gave me imposter syndrome feelings which made me confused and angry feeling like I'm messed up but unsure in what sense.  I didn't know what's happening or how to help myself because I was certain the bipolar diagnosis was wrong. Because I didn't have consistent 4 day minimum criteria for a mood swing. But now that I know it's BPD clashing with it, it all makes sense.

I finally made peace that I have both. I feel much better knowing what's going on and that I'm not an imposter. Just unfortunate enough to have both.

1,"I am happy for you. I felt the same relief when I was finally diagnosed. But let me tell you something. I asked this exact question to my therapist yesterday: why did it take so long for me to get an actual diagnosis? And her reply was that the mental health laws in my country (Argentina), are always about the patient and in detriment of the professional opinion.

Now, it sounded harsh, but she elaborated. Last session I kept hearing: NO! NO! From the background and she said there was a patient on the other room with another therapist.

This week I asked her about that and she said it was a young man that needed to be hospitalized because he was in a psychotic outbreak and he didn’t want to go. His parents were there. They spent hours trying to convince him to go (by law, the patients can opt out, even if they are not in their right minds). 

Thats’s why she told me now they are more weary and need more time to diagnose and give meds (I also have bipolar), than what it used to be, IDK, 40, 50 years ago.

The beautiful thing now is that you can begin seeking the right treatment and work forward in a way that will be healthy for you. While there isn’t a specific chemical irregularity associated with BPD that does not mean that medicinal intervention in the right way should be ignored if it’s needed to maintain an even keel in the beginning or potentially in perpetuity as well. There is also a less frequently talked about possibility of c-BPD which is regularly missed because of the difficulty of separating BPD from other mental health problems.

0,"Hi! Mental health provider here. 

Many clinicians are hesitant to diagnose their patients with BPD, as it can create barriers to accessing treatment with insurance companies, as traditionally psychiatric medicine has viewed those living with BPD as “untreatable,” meaning they won’t pay for inpatient mental health stays, outpatient services, medication, etc. That’s why we usually code those with borderline personality disorder or other like disorders as “Major Depressive Disorder- Unspecified.”

There is also a certain stigma that BPD tends to bring (hopefully this is changing), and some providers may suspect that their patient is borderline or has borderline traits, but will not disclose this to their patients as they are afraid to rupture the therapeutic relationship. Additionally, sometimes there is the concern that clients may over identify with a diagnosis, and providers like to encourage their patients to view themselves as a whole person rather than a list of diagnostic criteria. 

Also it is important to note that a psychiatrist job is to provide medication management. Borderline personality disorder is not treated by medication, it is only treated by DBT and intensive outpatient therapy. Thus, your doctor will likely only address your depressive symptoms via psychotropics, as that is what a psychiatrist is trained to do as they are medical doctors. In order to be diagnosed with BPD finally, you would better be served by seeing a psychologist who does that type of personality testing. 

Lastly, It is likely that your provider does not think it would be helpful for you to have this diagnosis is part of your chart/treatment plan for the above reasons, or maybe they truly do not think you meet criteria. But if you think that they are missing something you can always get a second opinion. 

Hope this has provided some insight.",amposa,zqs3mc

Later I noticed in my insurance records that a doctor I had seen in my twenties diagnosed me as borderline without ever telling me.

7,"Getting a diagnosis isn’t the golden ticket you may think it is. As others have said once diagnosed it’s harder to get care later down the line. It also leaves you no different. 

Your symptoms are your symptoms- a diagnosis doesn’t change them. 

Many of the symptoms of BPD are such that they are experienced by the majority of people in adolescence at some point in time just to a lesser degree. Potentially that is why clinicians are weary to diagnose?

Nonetheless, ask yourself why you want the diagnosis. 

What do you think it will bring for you? 

Will it alleviate your symptoms?

He mentioned something like ‘explosive disorder’ (can’t remember the exact name) and then said borderline. Once he confirmed what my therapist thought, the next step was finding DBT group.

I pretty much had no real self awareness for years and my paranoia was confused with psychosis without a known history of trauma. If I didn’t do all the things I did that lead to this diagnosis, I’d still be believing I have schizophrenia like iv been repeatedly told to accept these past few years.

You can change up your medical providers. There are some providers that straight up don’t “believe” in BPD - so if you’re with one of those, you’re not going to get the diagnosis. I would look for a new provider and specifically mention in your initial appointment that you’re concerned this is BPD or C-PTSD (which BPD can frequently be confused with, there is a lot of crossover between the two.)

They always just say, “that’s another symptom of BPD, don’t worry about it.”

It’s frustrating because say if someone goes through psychosis or dissociation/memory loss, a mental health professional will just blow it off as another symptom of BPD instead of getting that person help. Or when you tell them about the abusive behavior from others you’ve endured, professionals have always sided with the person I told them about because according them them, the people I complained about were just lashing out after having to deal with my “bpd behavior.” Everything about me and my personality getting labeled as “bpd behavior” really pisses me off.

41,"I was assessed for a personality disorder in 2019 as well but they didn’t understand my symptoms properly and diagnosed me with schizophrenia because I was convinced I had it after being convinced by my psychotherapist to accept the diagnosis and it didn’t help that I didn’t talk about my issues properly. I start DBT in the new year. BPD makes a lot more sense than schizophrenia at least and my really good psychiatrist who suspected I had a trauma disorder rather than a psychotic illness explained it very well. My mental health team are great as well, I’m from the uk and hopefully I can work to improve, I have a friend with BPD as well and she’s further in treatment so she’s a really good help but also one of the people that made me look inwards and realise that I may have something similar",,zqs3mc
42,"Mostly because meds are imported and private docs are costing fair, but somehow a lot due to the low income of nation itself. 
So, an average salary in my country is 800$/month. Average rent is around 400$/mnth. A private doc is around 100$/consultation and meds vary, but almost all the time are around 40-60$/per pack",lihothree,zqs3mc
43,"It was an assessment, originally for adhd but actually my gyno strongly pushed me to start the process because my anxiety and depression are so severe. So for me I had to schedule the assessment, do a virtual interview, complete a super long (400+questions) questionnaire and have a couple of people close to me complete one as well, and then go in for testing which took a few hours. After that I had a virtual follow up interview/review. I then had to wait for my actual results which took around four months? (It was supposed to be six weeks.) with insurance it was around 50 dollars per meeting, with insurance the whole thing would have been around 2500 dollars. The ptsd and bpd were the only things I wasn’t expecting to see on there.",Schmurderschmittens,zqs3mc

5,"Yes, I have BPD and have social anxiety that stems from severe OCD and related disorders.  I cannot drink or use substances due to my OCD and phobias so I can’t relate to that part, but I totally understand the isolation and anxiety that comes with all this. 

I’ve been in therapy and we’re doing Exposure Response Prevention. The process is SO hard. I’m exhausted. But my therapist told me that it gets way worse before it gets better so I’m trying to be patient. I’m really hoping it’ll help me so I can play an active role in my own life and build a community again. 

The only way out really is through when it comes to anxiety. I think the most important thing I’m learning is that I have to take teeny tiny steps toward the goal rather than trying to go straight from isolation to actually being social again. I have measurable mini-goals. So for social anxiety that might look like going to the store and just going in for 5 minutes instead of waiting in the car for my husband. Or walking past someone I know if I see them in public, instead of making a beeline for a different aisle to avoid saying hi. Then once I can do those without anxiety, I move on to something a little longer/more involved. 

I do also take meds, but they’re not a primary treatment for any of my disorders. They are just supposed to take the edge off so I can be receptive to therapy.",undergroundtornado,13yy09w

2,"Okay. Context: I have been with my partner K for going on 9 years. She is diagnosed BPD and has a whole collection of traumas, as most adults do, that impact several of the situations that we end up in. 

But here is what I have learned in the nearly a decade of being with her:

-Emotional validation is a tricky situation. On one hand, making her feel safe, loved, and irreplaceable is important to a stable relationship. On the other hand, over doing it and making that validation a constant stream means that when it isn't available for some reason (start a new job that doesn't allow for messaging throughout the day, travel, dealing with personal mental health issues, etc) then the doubt and emotional spiral can really set in. Finding a balance is crucial. Some things I have done:
Establish some routines that are easy to keep and reasonable to maintain. We have a Goodnight routine that I can message to her when I am winding down if I am not at home. She may not be going to sleep, but she knows I am thinking of and loving her when I am wrapping up my day.
Find some symbolic representations. A stuffed animal, a piece of jewelry, something that they can point at and say represents your affection.

-Trust is going to be weird for a while and you may need to do the emotional labor of figuring out where your boundaries are in two phases. The first phase is where you want your boundaries to be and the second is your hard limit. I say this because people with BPD sometimes struggle with emotional regulation which can lead to some rash decision making. Understanding that, while the decision was rash and ill-considered, it made sense to them in the moment may help with forgiveness. But, and this is important, you are entitled to your own personal needs. This is why I recommend having comfort zone boundaries and hard line, end of the relationship boundaries. Oh! And communicate these realities. They don't know what they don't know.

-Like every relationship, there will be fights/arguments. These are normal and natural and, if you haven't dated exclusively BPD people, it will be a wild ride. Not to generalize, but in my specific case (which from what I've read and heard from others is pretty representative) if the disagreement involve really any emotional ""stuff"" it will almost certainly get emotionally out of hand. So, here is some advice:
If you have something you want to discuss that could get heated, summarize the topic, tell the person with BPD what you want to talk about and schedule the discussion for later. This gives them a chance to sit with the subject, think about it, develop words to describe what they are feeling so that communication can take place. Now. All of those steps will take time to develop. Most people just, figuratively, drop the world on people with BPD by suddenly trying discuss problems. 
If at all possible, try to schedule ""check in"" times. These are opportunities to discuss boundaries and other relationship needs that may not be getting the attention they deserve. Keep in mind, this door swings both ways and both parties need to keep each other's needs at the forefront. This takes practice. It takes work.

-Our dating situation is not what society would describe as standard. We are polyamorous, and for those not familiar with the term, it is a non-monogamous relationship dynamic whereby ALL parties involved are free to date and engage in meaningful romantic and/or sexual relationships as they choose. This creates several new pitfalls, but also comes with some opportunities. The polyamorous community demands a certain level of emotional maturity to really engage with it. You will frequently hear that someone needs to ""do their own emotional labor"" rather than expecting a partner to do it for them. This applies to men, usually, but that expectation is crucial to helping my partner see that she has to do the work. 
The fact that she can freely engage with new partners that may fulfill parts some of her needs set that I do not has been very liberating for her, however, mistakes were made and boundaries were crossed, hence why I mentioned above that you really need the two sets. Even if you are not in a polyamorous relationship, the person with BPD should be engaging in friendship relationships to help spread the emotional load and make sure that they have opportunities to find people who can fulfill emotional and social needs that their romantic partner may not. 
Do not be the only person in their life. It is dangerous to both peoples emotional well-being.

BPD gets a really bad reputation out there in the online world. It is also wildly inappropriately used as a label to slap on any ""crazy"" partner. Many times the person saying shit like ""I dated this one crazy bitch with BPD. This is some of the CRAZY shit she did..."" don't realize that they were equally responsible for the circumstances. Men, in particular (in the US, anyway, I won't generalize the whole world), have a tendency to ignore their own hand in ramping up an emotional situation. It doesn't help that many of the men I have encountered saying things like that were, at minimum, borderline abusive and almost certainly overbearing and controlling. These things do not make a safe and loving relationship.

That all said, I am sure I could keep typing away at this, but I have other things to do today...

3,"Just understand and accept that the mood will be all over the place. Have patience, but also don’t be afraid to say when a line has been crossed. I really appreciate how my boyfriend tells me when I’m being unreasonable.. he approaches me gently and doesn’t speak down to me.  We both sit there like “is this the BPD?”... he has respect for the disorder, which is huge.

Boundaries will be important. Learn to maintain separate routines because your partner may otherwise become too dependant. Encourage your partner to explore their unique interests, instead of adapting to yours. 

Your partner will need reassurance.. not constant reassurance, as that’s unhealthy, but remember to remind them that you love them and you’re not going anywhere. These things are a given, and most people don’t need to hear them over and over, but someone with BPD needs that regular reassurance that everything is ok... the BPD mind works its hardest to convince its person that things are not ok! This mainly comes our famous “fear of abandonment” that we struggle to control. 

And just know that you are loved very deeply. That’s one thing about BPD: we care HARD. Your BPD partner would literally go to the moon and back for you.. so be sure cherish the love and show your appreciation.",,vkag9y

Setting boundaries is very important for you because our need for attention and love can be overwhelming. Validating our feelings and fear doesn’t mean you need to cater to us all the time.

It’s ok if you need space to self care, and it’s ok to enforce that boundary. 

Personally, the way my SO and I deal with that is he tells me that he needs space and he’ll be back in 2-3 hours however much time he needs. If by the time the 2 hours are up, he’s still not coming back he sends me a text to tell me how much longer it’ll take. It’s not ideal for me but it helps somewhat.",one_nerdybunny,vkag9y

15,"About rage episode:
List together the trigger of said episode (on a quiet time, not in the middle or right after lol).
Avoiding trigger is one of the best way to not end up in endless fights.
It's hard to get out of the ""angry loop"" for everyone but especially for people with BPD, because we tend to overfixate on things that hurt us, hence it's even more complicated for us to let go and move on.

About people in general (not only people with BPD or any other mental illness/disorder):
Don't try to ""fix"" them on your own. If they are reluctant to face their own issues, if they don't show ANY signs of wanting to get better, if they pull you down, find a way to stop the relationship. Staying with them won't help you or them. It will make things worse for both of you.
Just to be clear here, I'm not talking about someone who would go on a very intense depressive episode, like we can all experience. Nor I am suggesting that we should give up on people at the first meltdown.
I'm referring here to people who will NEVER accept any form of treatment or help, whatever the context is. People who are in denial of their own mental illness/disorders, and of their toxic behaviours. People who need professional help rather than a relationship, this, for their own sake.

Don't assume they'll be ""cured"" by you or for you. You can, of course, play a major role in their mental health growth, but it should not revolve exclusively around you.",pinkielie,vkag9y
16,"1.) Be patient but never let ANYONE cross your boundaries. If someone with BPD crosses your boundaries, don’t be afraid to communicate to them what they did wrong. Sometime we know, and we feel guilty but we think it’s not worth bringing up. At least that’s how I used to feel. Many of us are also bad at confrontation so that makes us horrible at communicating boundaries. If it triggers them, do what you need to make yourself calm down, and try to find ways to desvélate both moods. If things get bad, WALKING AWAY IS ALWAYS AN OPTION. 

2.) When we’re venting, just listen. A lot of us have feelings that are so strong, we think others cannot usually comprehend. Guilt, emptiness, and grief are big ones for me. 

3.) honestly is the best policy. I hate when people lie to me, it hurts more than the truth. This isn’t permission to be a brutally honest jerk, just don’t lie about important things. Or little things, bc that’s dumb. 

Most importantly, PUT YOURSELF ABOVE ALL. This is your life, and nobody will know you more that you know yourself. Practice mindfulness and don’t be afraid to hold yourself to the same standards that you hold others. Don’t be afraid to leave an unsafe relationship. It’s not your job to teach people to be good.",SnooBananas3793,vkag9y

18,"What I’ve discovered helps me (the one who has BPD) and my husband, it’s taken a longgggg time:

- if I’m having a mood swing and him noticing my shift in moods in simply asking “you doing ok?” Or “how are you feeling?” Helps a lot. Instead of attacking back when I’m wigging out (I know it’s hard, we’re human) “why are you acting like a bitch now?” Or even a sarcastic comment “who stole your lunch money?” Mmmm.. nope absolutely not. Doesn’t help anything.

- reassurance. even after almost 12 years together hearing “I’m not going anywhere” or “WE are gonna get through this TOGETHER” works wonders. It’s the best thing he could ever say to me. I’m finally starting to believe it because I’ve put him through hell and he’s still here. 

- letting me just fucking cry. I cry for no gd reason all the time. Most of the time, I can’t put into words why I’m crying, so gestures like just holding me or my hand and reassuring me he’s there to listen if I need but not continuing to press the issue. 

- holding me accountable. From impulsive behaviors, to medicine to therapy. Calling me out on it in a non condescending but caring way. 

My post is a mess so sorry for that but it’s real life. You’re going to just have to see what works for the 2 of you. These are just what works for US and they may not work for others.

Don't take everything they say, particularly dramatic things,  too seriously. In the moment they may mean it, or rather they think they mean it, but it often fades and we calm down enough to regret the extreme emotion. 

Allow for an open door, make sure they feel free to leave, for some reason that can make them feel safe enough to stay. 

No bullsh!t with emotions. If they want to know the truth, be honest. We can be very forgiving if we just know what's up if we think we smell something off.

A lot of the time narcissistic abuse has scarred us into being oddly needy sometimes and there may be occasional moments of extreme fear where we need strong reassurance like a bullet wound needs a hospital. It can be hard to manage on our own so well placed reassurance of love is amazingly helpful and helps quiet things back to reasonable levels pretty fast.",WindowApprehensive12,vkag9y

This allows you to protect yourself emotionally, show your parter you value their emotional capability to participate in a resolution, and eliminates any ambiguity about the potential that you are abandoning them when you remove yourself from the conflict.

My sister has BPD. And while I don’t live with her, this has been my whole life. I didn’t figure out this solution until recently and holy! It has been a game changer. My sister will make up scenarios in her head, get super insecure about anything and everything, then projects and places blame on anyone and everyone because they don’t meet her unrealistic expectations or whatever scenario that was in her head. 

The thing is is that they are definitely entitled to their emotions (validate), but it’s how they express it and deal with it that’s immature. It’s not okay for them to treat others poorly based on how they feel (set the boundary). You’re not in charge of their feelings. They are. 

After you set the boundary, tell them that you’ll continue the conversation when they are ready to communicate like a mature adult. [Cuz I’m gonna assume they’re outburst is very childlike]. 
They might still make jabs at you and try to open wounds, but you have to keep strong and shut it down. You cannot give in cuz that won’t help anyone. Don’t get caught up in the loop of you trying to get them to see your side cuz it’s never gonna happen. 

(Example: “You’re feelings are completely valid, but you cannot treat me this way. I will hear you out and be your safe space, but I will not be your punching bag. I love you and I’ll talk to you when you’re ready).  Or something along those lines. 

***unless you actually did something to hurt them, then that’s entirely different story.

Something that doesn't bother them can irritate someone else to the core. And that's ok. Facing a same situation, people won't all feel and react the same way.
So if their partner is mad about something that's seems completely fine to them, they should try to understand their feelings, by asking questions for example :
Can you describe me how you feel?
Why do you feel this way?
Was is because of XX that you got angry/sad/frustrated?

And they should rephrase to make sure they completely understood it.
This exchange should be enough for them to understand and validate their's SO feelings, without having to lie.

This applies with anyone, wether they have BPD or not. This is also a great tool for parents that want to help kids to understand, communicate and regulate their emotions.

We need each other. The problem is when it's always the same person providing that support, it becomes a codependent relationship. If there are multiple close friends or family members that a person can rely on, it's much healthier and pretty normal to be honest.

I recommend asking if they are able to get a bipartisan opinion (such as their colleague).

My therapists' answer to asking if I had bipolarism was, ""You might have a little of both, but I believe borderline personality disorder is the stronger of the two.""

So in the end, I looked into borderline personality disorder myself and had to agree with her diagnoses! The resonance I had with black and white thinking (""All **or** nothing""/""Good **or** Bad""), ""efforts to avoid real or perceived abandonment, such as plunging headfirst into relationships—or ending them just as quickly..."" and a ""...pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family, friends, and loved ones...""

Within the past year I was finally diagnosed with BPD and it made so much sense! The black and white, FP stuff, abandonment, wild emotional regulation issues, constant SI/ HI at times.

Also they said I don’t quite fit the criteria for bipolar as my manic and depression episodes flip flop too frequently, most bipolar episodes are weeks or sometimes longer. I’m manic for 2-4 days, depression for a week or so then back and forth with sporadic gaps of feeling “okay”.

I’m embracing this as I don’t want to be on medication anyway/ anymore and doing the best I can with counseling and DBT.
The best thing I’ve heard about being bipolar that really resonates with me was a comedian I saw who is bipolar, Shane Maus (amazing stuff about drugs, science, etc, highly recommended!)

12,"Bipolar disorder is defined by alternating periods of depression and mania that can last from days to months. Unlike borderline personality disorder, the mood swings of bipolar disorder are not triggered by interpersonal conflicts, last for days to weeks or months rather than minutes to hours, and episodes are, by definition, accompanied by changes in sleep, energy, speech, and thinking. 

The big difference between Bipolar and BPD is the severity of symptoms and why the occur and if they occur often or for longer periods of time. 

Another big difference is: are the symptoms brought about by triggers ie someone else’s behavior or life events that gives us a perception we don’t like or want to face or is it just following a timeline. bipolar disorder episodes aren’t brought about by interpersonal conflict. 

TLDR: So I’d say the biggest difference is if the symptoms present themselves out of interpersonal conflict or if they are just long lasting episodes",MindingMyOwn2021,16o2afe

My diagnosis date was almost 4 years ago now, on my 23rd birthday. It gets a lot better if you put in the work with a DBT therapist and medication that works for you. Shopping around for both of these things will be essential- so many therapists do not want to work with us, but many out there do (I am a therapist who does well working with adults with BPD and gladly welcome clients with that dx).

Starting this chapter is the hardest part, take advantage of the recovery frenzy if you get it early on. Learning and getting to where you actually want to use DBT skills is really hard, but it’ll be worth it when over time your lows and high start to even out.

They still come- I’m having a really low low right now, probably the most devastating I’ve had since the episode leading to my seeking therapy and being diagnosed. But the actual damage being done during this episode is lower than I would have thought possible 4 years ago. I never thought I would get to a place where I would survive what I’m going through now.

0,"It took my best friend ten years of gently bringing up the possibility every so often with me for me to accept it.  He never pushed it, he only brought it up when we were talking about my mental health and struggles.  It's a hard diagnosis to come to terms with, it's one of the most, if not the most, stigmatized mental illnesses so of course it's hard to accept it.  A lot of the things people think about it are untrue but the only times you hear references to BPD in media is to refer to the worst person imaginable.  He would bring it up, I would be like oh yeah, that makes sense and then I would reject the idea the next day and kind of forget that he had even brought it up.  

All this to say, maybe bring it up but accept a no if she doesn't want to talk about it.  Setting healthy boundaries is something you can do regardless of her mental health or diagnosis status.  A boundary is for you, not for her, just stay firm on what you can and can't do.  Set a time limit at the beginning of the phone call and then stick to it.

I‘ve been in healthcare for years planning to specialize in psychiatry and combining professional and personal experience, I don’t even want to work in the field anymore I don’t think. It’s not only so contextual, but because of that at times it’s like it feels like everything is completely made up and off-track on top of that. I personally have shifted into thinking about mental health mainly in terms of trauma/CPTSD. And that most of the frameworks like borderline, OCD etc. are mostly constructs to explain certain symptoms that ultimately have manifested due to trauma/CPTSD. 

I’m only formally diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Autism Spectrum. However, if I was actively in therapy years ago I’m sure they would’ve labeled me BPD or bipolar with my behaviors at the time. The caveat is that I am an AFAB with a genetic hormone disorder which affects both my body’s ability to adapt to stress (think anxiety and overstimulation) and my male sex hormones (think inclined towards hostility, body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria, and PMDD). This is another reason I’m so weary of diagnoses/anyone identifying with them so much because if I never did my own research and closely linked all those things to my mental health, it would’ve never been connected (because it never was!!!!).

There are modalities to help with BPD (like EMDR/DBT) and medications to treat bipolar. You're on the right path.

I had a therapist who I saw for maybe 2 months mention something to me about BPD but I stopped seeing her without taking her comment that seriously. I was around 22, that was back in 2000 so there was limited info on bpd anyway. I read there was 'no treatment', so I did nothing about it. 

At 28, after a breakdown, I got a psychiatrist who almost immediately misdiagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder and I was put on meds. A year later, I got a new (wonderful) psychiatrist who rediagnosed me as MDD w/ psychotic features, GAD, ptsd (recent) and possible 'bi-polar type unknown'. Meds were changed a number of times, I had no reaction to any mood stabilizers. Through talking to that psychiatrist, especially about extreme moods, anger and my total lack of manic episodes, the bi-polar idea was dropped. 

At some point w/in the next couple of years, he came to the conclusion it was BPD, but we had already been satisfied with the MDD diagnosis, so it wasn't like we were trying to diagnosis me with anything else. It just became apparent after a while. I was around 32? So it was maybe 2011-ish? I'm unsure. 

When I was 38, I tried to get CBT for a separate issue. I said nothing about any of my diagnoses, just did the initial screening appt. The woman angrily 'diagnosed' me after just 45 min.

22,"Sure, I can elaborate. The bullshit I’m talking about can’t really be mistaken for boundaries….quite the opposite actually, it’s me submitting to my abandonment fear and trying to stop others from putting them up. Which, ironically, ends up fulfilling the prophecy of them leaving. It’s a vicious cycle. 

Sometimes I could be cruel and manipulative in those crisis moments. A long-winded email or text message explaining how much they were hurting me and how they should feel terrible about it. Etc etc. just very Machiavellian and completely opposite how I act when I’m feeling safe. This surprises and confuses the other person, maybe even traumatizes them on some level because this part of me is really not visible until I get triggered.

So at this point, one of two things can happen:

1. They stay. I go back to “normal.” The relationship continues. I remain blissfully unaware of how shitty I acted and the other person is too afraid to set boundaries. Horrible, horrible situation. I kept someone in that situation for three years, it was my first real relationship (19yo?) and I had no idea how sick I was.

2. They run like hell, and cut all contact with you, and you never see them again. This just happened to me and a really, really good friend of mine when she tried to set boundaries. I fucked up big time. I still cry when I think about her and the last time we saw each other, riding ferries around New York harbor.

Obviously neither are good situations. The one that just occurred shook me to my core and I realized I had not been diligent in practicing DBT. So I moved across the country to do a 40-hour full time partial hospitalization program and I’m not leaving until I am “fluent.”

I don’t expect perfection from myself, but I do expect a full understanding of others’ boundaries and why they are put up. It’s literally my full time job right now.

However, I tested too well on the cognitive scales that most people with ADHD do poorly in.",uncomfortablefairy,13xfoaz
22,"So I feel like psychiatrists, at least in the UK but I expect in most countries where bpd is frequently diagnosed, diagnose women with bpd where men with the same symptoms get adhd and autism diagnoses, particularly when you have past trauma, even more so if they just find you difficult and unlikeable (not saying that's how they found you but when I worked in mental health that's how the staff talked about patients).  

If you don't feel like it fits you could look to get a second opinion potentially? I have a bpd diagnosis and I think I have either adhd as well or instead of. I have chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosed and I'm convinced there's a link with adhd. But it'll only ever be bpd on my notes now, I've given up dealing with those people!",,13xfoaz

I felt really dismissed at the end of the meeting too as he literally went “you dont have adhd, you have BP, ill send a letter to your gp, bye” and like didnt explain anything to me at all 😭 maybe im expecting too much tbh.",StayCee089,13xfoaz

I do also feel that my psychiatrist was so focused on my past trauma that he barely listened to me about my struggles in general day to day with task avoidance and struggling to get anything done etc. So i feel a second opinion would be best, but would also feel happy if I got the same diagnosis again I think as at least its something and either way its a step forward to getting healthier",StayCee089,13xfoaz

0,"32 here! Diagnosed BPD (quiet/petulant), with comorbid anxiety, major depressive, and suspected aspergers/high functioning autism (by my therapist, I am still researching this and deciding if testing is something worth it for me)

There are several models that categorize bpd into different subtypes. I'll be talking about the most popular model: Discouraged/Petulant/Self-Destructive/Impulsive. Discouraged is commonly referred to as Quiet BPD.

A good source on this is the BPD Workbook by Daniel Fox. It's where I learned about the subtypes (and much more about me BPD.) The sites *verywell health.com* and *choosingtherapy.com* have what I consider to be well done articles on the subtypes. They are medically reviewed and well sourced!

For me, understanding my subtypes really helped me frame the core symptoms I was struggling with. I didn't understand why I am so angry and pessimistic. I didn't understand why I wasn't like the ""bpd posterchild"". It just gave a lot of context about myself, and learning about them helped introduce me to ways I can communicate about my BPD to loved ones. I'm a big fan of the concept of subtypes as a whole. BPD is super varied and the subtypes easily communicate that in an easy to ilunderstand way.",princefruit,1b2n9j2

[This video about the 4 types of BPD](https://youtu.be/kNi9bEeFOQU?si=YcC39AR2Byk7AYur) is really good, but there are many out there. I hope it answers your questions. 

I would also recommend [Dr. Daniel Fox's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DrDanielFox). He is licensed and is an expert in the area of personality disorders. He has many very good videos about our symptoms, how to manage and cope and understand them. I learned how to cope with some of my symptoms before I even started therapy.

Along with BPD, I am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (schizophrenia with a mood disorder), Major depression disorder and PTSD. 

As far as your sensory problems go. I'm very sensitive to noise and very tiny little things trigger me and set off frustration, anger and [sometimes rage](https://youtu.be/FQsA9WjQZ0k?si=M-6xiBLmwllmLQeo). Rage is very common with BPD.

I stay around because of my cat. I love him to bits and know he'll miss me if I was gone. Maybe getting a pet is a good idea. If you don't trust yourself with an animal, try a plant. I know having something else living depending on me helps.

Nevertheless, only a professional would be able to make sense of the complicated nuances of your experience and find not just a label but rather the truth about your experience so you can make more informed decisions from there.

2.) yes it’s possibly to have comorbidity or more than one condition at the time. It’s absolutely possible for you to have both BPD and Bipolar. There are various subtypes of Bipolar so you might wanna read up on them (type 1, type 2)

My only guess as to why is maybe she thought I’d take it poorly. I told her I did my own research and thought I had it. She asked if I wanted to go through the DSM diagnostics in the book.

13,"I felt complete relief when I was diagnosed. Simply because I felt so much so that my experience was going to break psychology. Of course the symptomology is awful on paper; hört, BPD diagnosis really showed me why I love the way that I do. Why I only see things as right or wrong morally(no grey), feel so deeply and passionately, and so on. 

I finally realized why my love was so tender yet instinctively black and white. 

I already knew my bad qualities BEFORE I was diagnosed. That’s what our paranoia and hyper vigilance make us think about anyways. Our disorder entails pointing out every flaw we have. I didn’t know WHY I had the qualities but I knew I had them already. 

So instead, hearing my diagnoses allowed me to find the good in all of that bad. I can’t say I’m better. I mean I study psych, have been in therapy since I was nine(I’m now 23), participate in rigorous CBT(not quite to the point of DBT) and STILL am not right in the head. 

But part of the beginning of my healing journey was realizing WHY I feel so deeply and WHY I will love harder than any other NT or non-BPD client. And that’s special. 

Yes, we were so neglected of love that we cannot help but spew our love into one person like we wish was done to us. 

I hope this helps but here’s so qualities I found from my BPD that I love about myself(slowly still)

-I know when someone is being abused now. Because I was abused. I know what to see and who to care for. I’m present. 

-I love so hard that it’s suffocating(FP). I literally want to flood my loves with pure un adulterated passionate love. And not just love love but also the love you can have for anyone if someone just tried like me(aka BPD)Because no one did that for me. 

-I can speak up now. I know how to advocate for the people like me. I will speak out to anyone. And fight for what I know. Because they never caught for me. They never spoke out 

-I will never let someone tell me again that I am a liar. I spent my entire disorder being paranoid that they were right and my memories were-are wrong. Now I know a nine year old can’t make up that shit. 

-I am so passionate. I delve into whatever and whoever I feel for. I can unconditionally love anyone because I was never loved. And show them the love. Tell them every day. And watch them feel it. 

-although people take ^ that passion for granted, I am someone I now know will help anyone. Because I know what it feels like to need 

-I understand. I have never been in a situation where I couldn’t see what that person meant. Because I have been so traumatized to see fake reality, that I use to justify the other side. See what they see. Now I see what I see but can have conversation on WHERE they’re coming from. And not how they can bring me there

I really hope this helps. It’s just my experience with my life, studies, and overall continuous thought. 

One day you’ll say it enough times that you’ll believe it.

I still have meltdowns and a majorly skewed viewpoint, but I’ve learned mostly how harness the amazing power of our hypersensitivity and use to my advantage instead of SUPER destructive ways. I even started going back to school after dropping out 10 years ago, and I’m going to be a first responder for psychiatric emergencies. I’ve had plenty, I know compassion vs. control can do wonders… thanks BPD!

I love you, and getting back on your feet is hard, but I was such a garbage person for so long, and now I know how to care for others because of how much care I needed, so I KNOW you can do it. I know it.

It’s hard and it’s lonely and I have ended up in hospital twice because I could t stand the thought of living like this anymore.

It can and will be used against you in a court of law one day if anything ever happens to you. (I got assaulted at my job; my social media history is fair game for trial.) The internet is forever.

5,"As someone who was diagnosed a little under a year ago: **don’t tell anyone**. The only person you should talk to about it is your therapist, and maybe your partner if you have one. A few reasons for this:

• Your diagnosis should not definitively change the way you treat others or the ways they treat you

• Keeping your diagnosis to yourself makes it easier to keep yourself accountable and remain responsible for your actions

• When explaining why you did or said something that negatively affected you or someone else, instead of just throwing the BPD sticker on it, you have to actually face the real reasoning, root cause, and the consequences of those words or actions.

If I had kept my diagnosis between myself and my therapist, and learned to manage it on my own, I would have made much fewer rash decisions, owned up to many more mistakes, and retained a lot more friendships.

You will have this urge to share it, because a lot of us have a tendency to overshare, but trust me, it’s for the best. If someone specifically asks if you have it, don’t lie about it, but don’t go around telling everyone.",Pengdacorn,sfty37

I usually only talk about stuff like that when it comes up naturally in conversation or when I feel that it’s appropriate to mention in a situation. I’ve even treated my sexuality the same way—once I started to figure out my sexuality, I didn’t just let everyone know about it. But if someone asks or if we’re on the topic, I’ll talk about it. 

I consider myself a mental health awareness activist so I’ve made many posts on my personal social media accounts about many things related to mental health. I’m sure I’ve mentioned somewhere one time or another that I have BPD, but it was along with the post so it seemed like a casual point I made rather than an announcement surrounding my BPD.

25,"I’ve been open about my BP diagnosis, and in general, I work hard on my Fb to make mental health issues normalized. BPD Awareness Month also corresponds with Mental Health Awareness Month and both commenced a couple weeks after my BPD diagnosis this last spring. So I made a statement about how I would make at least one post a day about BPD and other mental health issues. So many informational posts but also silly memes, etc, to try to get the feel across. 

I didn’t make that about me, really, and I had a lot of people open up in comments and messages through the month about how helpful it was to see the ‘big’ psychiatric disorders (or really any of them) be talked about without judgment and with the purpose of providing info. I made a few comments here and there about myself, so I’ve never been secretive about it; but it wasn’t until earlier this month that I made a big post (sort of a ‘it’s a new year here is what’s happening in my shitstorm of my life —breakup, grad school failure, bad mixed BP episode, etc—but I’m grateful for it’ post) where I explicitly stated I was diagnosed with BPD and the diagnosis makes the world make much more sense to me. 

I received so much support in general. I mean, yeah, there’s always someone who will be crappy about it, but that reflects more on them. Most people want to support the person they know and love or who they are even only mildly acquainted with but think is cool/smart/good coworker/has a neat kid/fill in the blank, etc. And when they find out that you have BPD, it makes BPD a little more knowable and not so scary and all the crap the stigma says.

I can understand telling parents and possibly a very close best friend and yes children IF they are adults as it could be very helpful for them to understand a parents past behaviours..all in person of course not on social media. 
However if your children are young I really don't see the benefit of telling them you have been diagnosed with a personality disorder, especially one as stigmatized as BPD. What good would come from telling children such a thing? I mean it is hard enough for other adults to understand let alone children. It will just confuse and scare them when they inevitably get online and start looking it up and seeing how others talk about us. You can communicate that you are getting help for your feelings (if they are very young) or if they are older just telling them you are in therapy.

I went to the hospital once for help and when the intake for psych found out my diagnosis they were incredibly dismissive and made me feel stupid for being there.  I'm getting my psychology degree and every time BPD is brought up it's 100% negative or fearful, we're painted as manipulative codependent and impulsive.

(My employer, my school, my daughter (she’s too young, but I will when she’s a bit older) or her father (we’re not together)). 

When I feel comfortable enough to tell a friend or someone I’m dating I first ask them what they know about BPD so that I can start where their understanding begins and I can fill in the gaps of understanding.

This is generally the video I direct newly diagnosed people and their loved ones to. 

A lot of times, I'll explain being borderline as the inability to feel 2 things at once. I can either be mad or I can love you. I can be scared, or I can be empathetic. 

I've been in therapy for a while and no longer struggle soothing myself and accepting what is going on, even when I'm triggered. Not to say I don't have bad days, but they are once a month vs. every day, and I recover from them much faster. It's possible for her to find more peace within herself, which will help in day to day life. For you, you know what that entails and that you alone wont be able to help her, it will also be difficult for you because you will need to set boundaries and keep them, while still being kind. You will probably need therapy as well. Everyone should have an uninvolved 3rd party to help them navigate the difficulties of a relationship with someone who struggles like we do. Your relationship is 9 years old, so having a label now changes nothing except that you have a starting point to grow.",Chikasha,17lfayf
2,"i used to be pretty difficult. i’ll throw things away because i’m scared but deep down i desperately want them to care. just straight up tell her you’re here for her, want things to work and that your arms will always be open. explain to her that you’re a house, she can knock on windows, climb in the doors and they will always be open she just needs to put in the effort. if she loves you, i promise you she’ll appreciate it. don’t force her to come back, and don’t get too clingy but admit that your open and ready for her. you remind me a lot of someone i know. we leave when we love, and love when we leave. it’s not your fault or hers. if you need help i’m here and you can reach out whenever. we all stand together and i hope you guys can work things out. thank you for being so effortful and hardworking.",tearyeyedprettybones,17lfayf

We read a lot of books and went to couples therapy and her condition is relatively mild i suppose. 90% of the time we are just a happy non-toxic couple. I can handle her getting angry out of the blue and be over sensitive at times, just this breaking up and giving up on the relationship gives me a hard time.

She sent me a very long and thoughtful text about how she is not worth my effort and almost begged me to just move on. Really breaks my heart not only because I hurt, but because she is so blind about what an amazing person she is and how much she gave me over the years.
I respondend by making clear that I am responsible for my own decision, that we take a few days to let things cool off and me to think about our relationship and what I think is best for me and my future.
In all honesty I dont really consider breaking up because I know what makes her think like that.",AlexPant666,17lfayf
8,"It is a little bit of both because if it is like my wife she will be passionate about ‘living alone forever’ and then at the same time want to go have fun with me and will act like something never happened. In fact she’ll forget half of the hyper manipulative mean shit she says maybe more than half but of course remembers whatever I say. I think cooling off is good, and theres a pro in the hot make up sex she always wants to have which is also part of the mind fuck because that can happen after her being standoffish. 

I didn’t figure this out until about 10 years in as well, and it has gotten easier but still the same shit too. I learn to recognize the lines she uses and I ask for an immediate cease fire. I call out that it is her condition which pisses her off and she has good comebacks, but insist that naming the issue and addressing it is why we learn about what bpd is in the first place.",coconutstatic,17lfayf
9,"Be patient, we are all different so I can't really give you advice specifically for her.

10,"if i was honest i’ve done the same, and each of them actually went through with cheating and/or leaving. even the last person i was seeing, i told him i was sorry ( because of my health and bpd obviously) and he just asked “ why are you sorry?”

i told him just because i was 

he never came back. 

even if we beg, apologize, we are too much , too little, and not enough all at once. 

just know that i think you’re doing a great job. i wish, i had met someone so effortful too. she may be blind to your efforts now, but we see you. eventually maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but eventually she’ll see it. and the good thing is you’ll know you’ve tried your best.

Reassurance will go along way and I think even if she doesn’t want to talk at the moment, she will appreciate knowing that she has you and you aren’t judging her diagnosis and she will possible feel less threatened. It’s pretty common for people like us to have a fight with our partner and in our shame and guilt, just think, I shouldn’t be with anyone or in a relationship at all.

It’s nice to have that. It helps calm you down quite a bit. I’m pretty sure she isn’t going to give up a 9 year relationship with you. She is likely just feeling overwhelmed, problematic, and scared.",MindingMyOwn2021,17lfayf
17,Yes a lot of similarities with us. 90% of the time we have a beautiful relationship. And most of the times I figured out a way to deal with her episodes.

My impulsivity & substance abuse!! Makes so much more sense with my diagnosis. 

My mood swings were so not normal & the diagnosis has helped me to be a little more patient with myself & understanding that my brain processes information & feelings differently. 

My “jump to suicidal ideation” was for sure due to my BPD. If I feel any feeling other than joy my brain goes straight to die-mode. Especially in regards to my relationships - I can go over the edge quickly.

- Crying over literally anything until I was like 13/14 (this was basically when I started to sh to not let out my emotions this way) to the point where I‘d annoy people. Before I was just sometimes crying out of nothing (I guess this is like the mini-version of the fuckload of stress feeling)
- Just not talking to people for no appearant reason as a kid
- Constant feeling of not being able to keep up
- Not remembering like anything about my childhood except rooms for some reason (and things like car crashes) which is extra weird because I‘m really good at 3d thinking
- Not interacting with friends anymore out of nothing; before I‘d do this I‘d idolize one of them
- Living life by the principle: when it get‘s too much, I‘ll just end it (I think this started around 10 years)

I had out of body dissociated a few times growing up and not until my BPD diagnosis did I know wtf that was. I just remembered sitting and talking to my mom and then my brain went 'who is this lady, who am I? I feel so funny' and then eventually it would go away.

42,"I remember being really frustrated in therapy when I was younger because they wanted me to keep going over things that had happened. I'd thought about those things loads already. It didn't help me manage the emotions I experienced when things happened now.

I ended up a ""functioning"" alcoholic from maybe 20-26, the worst of it over the last few years. Trauma really stacked onto trauma. I reached a point that I was having so many panic attacks and flashbacks that I couldn't be present in my relationship. When I quit drinking, I realized just how low my distress tolerance had gotten and really started processing everything I'd been pushing down.

Revisiting therapy to learn skills for tolerating discomfort and big emotions really helped. When I had the tools to handle it and allowed myself to feel ""bad"", I was able to explore more specific ways that my past influenced the present. Notice things about my childhood caregivers that explained a lot, ask more questions, try to unlearn things. I was always pretty self-aware but it was a new level. 

Stuff doesn't really boil over anymore because I'm not so afraid of the memories sneaking up on me. I wasn't having flashbacks to my childhood and stuff anyway, but revisiting that made the more recent trauma stop knocking me off my feet. It was all a continual crisis cycle.",OkayButHowDoI,tiwx3d

Luckily, by now I‘ve pretty much unfucked it and know how to live with it, even without going to weekly therapy or something. I recommend you to learn more about bpd as you will be able to vaguely know what you‘re about to do when this or that happens and what you have to do in order for it to not happen as bad as it probably would do if it surprised you.

1,"Panic attacks over perceived threat/fear of abandonment!! This is exactly how I describe it too. It’s not the typical definition of a panic attack (at least not for me) but I am PANICKING!!! The intense urge to do something ANYTHING even if it’s burning the entire thing to the ground, I can’t seem to control it. I haven’t been in a relationship for awhile but looking back at things, at those moments where I felt like I had to do something, anything, what I would end up doing is running away. I realize now that I could have explained to my partner that I get these kind of panic attacks where my fight or flight takes over and does anything to get me out of the situation because that is basically what is happening to us. If I would have explained to him that I just needed to leave for like 10 minutes and I would be back and able to have a rational discussion I think he would have understood and we could have had a much more successful relationship. Not all partners are going to be that understanding however. Try talking to your partner and setting up a plan of action ahead of time. Maybe have a code word to let your partner know when you were starting to panic. Have a designated spot where you can go for 10 minutes or so to get out of the situation and regain composure. Do some physical activity if able, something as simple as jumping jacks or pacing, can help get all that adrenaline somewhere to go.",flamingobingoerin,157su2c

I am also in a relationship where I've felt everything you expressed above. Being in a relationship with BPD is soooooo hard. Like so hard. So I 100% know where you're coming from. Another thing I really struggle with is comparing myself to others around me in my life. Like my sister, friends, whoever. I'm constantly comparing & wondering how amazing it must be to live life day to day w/o bpd. Anywho -- I hope just the fact that people & I can relate to you brings you some kind of warmth.

6,"I just want to start by saying that ALL of your feelings are totally, 100% valid - however, the internet has a way of making us out to be evil monsters who can never recover when actually, with the correct support, work and time, BPD can stop being a problem (unlike most other disorders). I've been with my partner for 12 years now and he met me pre-diagnosis when everything was extremely severe (severe self-harm, alcoholic, constant suicide attempts, etc) and now we're engaged and have a wonderful young daughter because I'm in a place where most would never know I have it. It's tough, and there's still doubts and insecurities but me and my partner have developed communication unlike any other couple we know (and has been told to us by every professional I've worked with). You are at the very start of a long hard journey, try to be kind to yourself. Try to build communication (we have code-words like ""I'm feeling fragile"" when things feel too much but I can't talk yet, I sign BSL for help or leave in situations I'm struggling in so I don't need to be verbal, etc), get support from people and professionals who you connect with and be compassionate with yourself. If you don't connect with the idea of being kind to an inner child, how about connecting to an old version of yourself or my favourite ""I wouldn't talk to a friend the way I talk to myself"". You can get through this, it's not a short or easy road but it's so worth it.

Yeah so even before the diag, i was immediately having panic. first time he visited me and we were at ashow, i went in the mosh pit super aggressively because essentially a girl triggered me hard. And it happens a lot - i tried this, i mean sometimes forexample on the way to a show i start to feel the anxiety, i tell him, he holds me and we breathe together and for example that whole show was great, we had drinks after with the band and all good. but sometimes its like it catches you before you have a chance to say anything, the fear takes over and last time it was so severe we just walked through the busy city, i couldnt look at anyone, eventually im covering my eyes so to see people, my whole body is on fire, im crying. it keeps escalating and i collapse on the street crying. the longest most traumatic journey home.  
sometimes there is no sleep after either because im so shocked at what i felt, im so aware its all my head though. im fearing something and then if he looks at someone its this kind of 'i knew it'  in my brain, and ill think about this moment or this girl for weeks or months. it can stop me sleeping, i started sometimes trying to be like people i knew he found attractive. fuck. its so unbelievably exhausting. sorry rant again.

i think the comparing is a great lesson. because i already know when im fearing my partner looking or desiring others, i know its because actually i look at others like theyre stars... and i can not assume he sees the way i see and learning that it doesnt mean a  threat to me is... well its a challenge but the diagnosis already helps somehow

0,"6 months sober is a huge accomplishment!! I got sober in December 2020 and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done for my mental health.

I’ve found it helpful to personify my inner critic, too. The best thing I heard early on is that when you tell on your disease you take away its power. I find that helpful because then it feels like I’m not telling on myself and my bad or shameful thoughts. It’s just the latest stupid thing Jack had to say. Self harm is really common with this diagnosis. 

Other people’s comments can effect my mood. But therapy and medication have done wonders to give me long periods of stability. It sounds like you’re just at the beginning of treatment now. DBT is the gold standard of BPD therapy. I’m on medication because I have a bipolar diagnosis as well. BPD on its own doesn’t necessarily require medication.

My therapist used to tell me to sit with my feelings and allow me to feel where they felt in my body, that way I wouldn’t impulsively jump the gun when I felt a certain way.

0,"BPD is a very strange diagnostic process to go through. 

I had glaringly obvious warning signs of it throughout my entire childhood that got ignored, and my symptoms worsened as I got into my early teens. I'd try and express my concerns to therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists; all of them typically had completely different opinions and/or just didn't really care. When I finally got the courage to ask one of my former doctors about BPD for the first time, it got shrugged off because I was still a minor at the time, even though I was actively in one of the worst episodes of my life. Even now, I have had verbal confirmation, but it is not on my medical record for various reasons. 

It's overdiagnosed but underdiagnosed at the same time. Some doctors throw it at every ""unstable woman"" they meet within 15 minutes, others refuse to even act like BPD is a real diagnosis. Not to mention the amount of stigma and misinformation. It's confusing and discouraging, but what I can tell you is this:

You do not need to be diagnosed with BPD to undergo the recommended methods of therapy, if that is something you wish to pursue (DBT, EMDR, mentalization) or to empathize with people who have it. People put way too much of an emphasis on having a few words scribbled down by a doctor. Some people can't afford a full on psych eval. Some people can't afford a therapist or psychologist to begin with. Some people don't want a diagnosis on paper for one reason or another; some doctors won't even give them. Some doctors just fucking suck. There's a million multifaceted arguments about it and the debate is stupid. If you experience the symptoms, regardless of how ""official"" the diagnosis is or isn't, you deserve to be able to learn how to cope with them. Your self-awareness is a good thing either way.",dogwithab1rd,146vczq

There may be unintended consequences. For instance, is this something you would want to tell your potential employer in a job interview? Probably not. 

Apologies are more meaningful when they are personal. “I’m sorry to everyone I ever hurt” is about you feeling less bad not about them feeling like you are genuinely sorry. You might be, but this should be case by case. Just as apologies in a 12 step program are meant to be done through individual letters or even face to face. 

It may feel cathartic to do this, but like I said earlier, while it’s good that it just “clicked” with your diagnosis, it’s also a very misunderstood diagnosis and won’t necessarily elicit the response that you want.

And then the admitting you’ve been a handful-you don’t owe anyone an explanation for who you are. Apologize for specific wrongs sure but changed behavior is the best way to apologize for your more difficult times. 
I say this as a 46 year old with 2 divorces under my belt. And many more failed relationships including one with my daughter.

I also made the mistake of oversharing some suicidal thoughts with workmates, saying I wanted to OD on pills, as a “joke”. I left that job soon after but just thinking about what they might’ve thought about me makes me cringe. To my defense I was really unwell and miserable, and stupid, and not even young cause I was in my early thirties, so I should’ve known better. Now I only tell really close people about my mental health issues and it’s been a lot less stressful. But I understand where you’re coming from. Sometimes you feel ashamed of what you’ve done and you just want people to understand that you didn’t want to mistreat them on purpose, but as people have said here, it’s better to do it in private and once you’ve already worked on yourself. If it’s too many people it might take you a while, but it’ll be better in the long run and you’ll avoid been stigmatized by people who were not part of your wrongdoings.

Never allow yourself to use your diagnosis as an excuse, but only as an explanation. 
Then, never offer that explanation without establishing some real results in addressing your issues.

I want to apologize for the ways in which I've hurt you over the years, and I want to say that I 100% own each of them, and expect nothing from you in return, especially until I can demonstrate to you that I've made progress. With my diagnosis, I finally have actionable resources and knowledge to be better. I hope to have a chance to do so with you, but I understand if it's already too late. 

I'm sorry. Hope to talk to you soon, best wishes.""


It's a bit long-winded, but that's the idea. Don't bullshit someone because you want an easy and quick relief from the pain you've caused them, only to end up delaying it to down the road when you do it again. 
If you're ACTUALLY sorry, you'll prove it. 

Not by feeling sorry for yourself, not by telling them you're sorry and that you'll never do it again, not by buying them things, or love-bombing them, none of that. 

I've suffered heavy, heavy losses over the years because of this disease. But I never felt a single lasting ounce of healing until I started holding myself accountable and forced myself to actually BE better, instead of just telling people I was.",Ramstetter,12fggli

13,"I've been aware of my bpd for 20+ yrs and told maybe 8 people. The stigma was much worse back then so I kept it secret and just got used to keeping that quiet. What I do is explain aspects/traits of my bpd with people without actually mentioning the word 'borderline' or saying I was diagnosed. No one has ever asked me, 'Are you describing bpd?' If they did guess, I still have control & can choose how much more I feel I can tell them. 

So I'm pretty open with friends, boyfriends, etc. about my mental health/emotional issues, I just don't stick the bpd label on myself. One reason is  whatever 'sub-type' I have doesn't even match the main existing ones, I'm a combination of a few. There are some 'popular' symptoms/traits I 100% do *not* have. Even someone fully understanding & fairly educated might really misunderstand what I have vs. someone else with BPD. 

One thing I feel compelled to warn you about if you decide to make a social media post- all it takes is just *one* person repeating that to someone they know & you've lost control over who finds out. Next thing you know, some person who bullied you in school finds out. A friend of a friend might hear about it and warn everyone they know never to date you because BPD causes huge relationship problems, you know what I'm saying? 

The internet is overloaded with misinformation about BPD. Whoever hears you have it & googles the diagnosis will absolutely encounter some pretty bad, completely untrue info that's still being claimed even by 'professionals'. Just really think this through & be prepared if you decide to post.",Piconaught,12fggli
14,"DBT is great 😁.  Me personally, I don't think I'd frame it as an apology or an explanation. My FB is basically re-posts of different diagnoses and resources for the community.

But in this case I think you're feeling guilt over something that was out of your control.",,12fggli
15,"Absolutely not. I got a bpd diagnosis by a psychiatrist who asked me about ten questions then decided that yep, I have it. Except when I started really looking into it, I just couldn't relate, I realized that my ongoing trauma and the specifics of the abuse I went through, along with isolating myself on purpose so my family would be less hurt when I took my life, really looked similar to it. 

Bpd? Nope. 

However, a few members of my family clung to that diagnosis and definitely treated me different. I'm treated almost as though I'm dumb and need advice. No, what I need is a person to respect my boundaries when I set them. Now I'm treated like I'll fly off the handle at any given moment, when for me, it's usually a decade's worth of trapped stress, losing jobs, places to live, on and on. Given the majority of the past decade has been spent dealing with trauma mostly on my own, it just wore me down.

At any rate, I'm curious how you knew it was BPD, cause it took me 13 years (while in the mental healthcare system and actively seeking all sorts of help) to finally figure it out myself - that was almost 3 years ago.

23,"I'd had issues as far back as I can remember. I started hiding it when I was a little kid because I knew my behavior was 'unacceptable' somehow. I seriously started to wonder what it was when I maybe 12. At 14 I went to a couple ERs for 'episodes', I begged my mom for therapy but she said ""No, it's a phase"", I knew it was lifelong since I had always felt that way but I didn't know what it was. Then I got constantly depressed for years on top of it. I actively searched through mental health books, nothing ever matched. 
 
When I was around 22 (in 2000) I had a friend who had been through inpatient in a couple psych hospitals for her own problems. She was one of the only people I knew then with *very* similar issues as mine. (She never met her father, I last saw mine when I was 5 so I knew ""abandonment"" must be related.) She came out with a bpd diagnosis one time, told me & I wanted to see if it matched my life. I looked it up online, was *shocked* it described all the weird problems I was having. It was the first time I had ever read anything close that matched. I had heard of it before but thought it was something totally different. 

Pretty much everything online said there was no cure, prognosis was very poor, 'no known treatment', all depressing/hopeless. I read all that & decided there was no point in trying to get help (I couldn't get my sh*t together anyway to get help since I was always so depressed). I decided to ignore that 'bpd' existed because it was too upsetting to see the negative things written. I just went on being a fck up & kept trying to fix it myself some other way. 

I got so much worse, at 25, tried seeing a couple therapists (this was in NYC). 2 said they believed it was BPD but they weren't able to help with that, I gave up going to therapy. At 27, I had a breakdown w/ severe psychosis that lasted over a year. A friend took me to enroll in outpatient psych treatment, I didn't mention BPD to anyone, I was misdiagnosed schizoaffective because of the psychosis and put on meds. 

I got a better psychiatrist who rediagnosed me with bi-polar 'type unknown', then switched it to Major Depression w/ psychotic features, anxiety/panic & OCD. After a year or 2, said he believed it was BPD. I admitted to him I figured it was already. So I was around 30 for the official diagnosis- but I told him to please NOT write that anywhere. I saw that psychiatrist for another 5 yrs, we didn't exactly discuss too many emotional issues so it wasn't 'therapy', just psychiatry & managing symptoms, meds, etc.. 

I got a *lot* better by 38, was doing great, tried to get CBT therapy for a phobia & some anxiety. I didn't mention the BPD because I wasnt there for that. I got asked to leave after the 45 min assessment appt because I 'obviously' have BPD and I 'needed far more help than they can provide'. I was pretty angry about that. That was 8 yrs ago.  

(So diagnosed 15 yrs ago, 'suggested' 20 yrs ago by 2 therapists, self diagnosis a few years before that)",Piconaught,12fggli

I've been struggling for 20 years and always felt it was deeper than depression/anxiety. Now I have that confirmation and it's uncomfortable. 


The one thing I keep trying to remind myself is, I was being incorrectly treated for ⅔ of my life and that is why nothing has helped.

1,"I think it's normal to be in a bit of a state of shock. I'm in the UK, so our health care is a bit different to yours, but when I was diagnosed, I wasn't expecting a diagnosis. I was already seeing a psychiatric nurse who thought that maybe I needed some input from a psychiatrist just to see if there was any medication that could help me cope a little better. In the appointment, there was the psychiatrist and the nurse. The psychiatrist told me that I have bpd. Was definitely not expecting a diagnosis as it was my first appointment with him, and neither was the psychiatric nurse. At the end of the appointment, the nurse took me into another room and explained that you don't usually get a diagnosis so quickly and was I OK with it. Honestly, I was in shock for quite a while. I kept it to myself for ages and couldn't get my head around it, but it does get easier after a while, and it doesn't feel as weird.",,12i0429

0,"Do yourself a huge favor, and promise yourself not to read those random articles about BPD, many of them are steeped in stigma and will cause you some pain. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about symptoms you may experience to the best of my ability, but specifics would be easier. 

When it comes to basic advice, always remember, mental illness is NOT YOUR FAULT, but it IS your responsibility, despite how cruel that statement is, you have to remember it. Even with that being said, being borderline does not mean you cannot have a good or happy life. The journey of living with BPD can be a difficult one, but always remember that you've already made it through 100% of everything you've been through this far, and you not only can keep going, you will. Because you deserve to live a life that you love and despite bpd that is possible. And you have to remember that. 

It's not a bad day. It's not a bad life. It's not a bad person. It's all just practice for tomorrow and you will grow and grow and grow. It will be okay, even when it's not, and you are strong despite the fact that you deserved to instead be safe. BPD is not a death sentence, it's not a curse, and you are worth every ounce of effort.

An important note:
Therapist's cannot cure you. 
They equip you with the tools and knowledge to do the work. You have to put those tools into use or healing isn't possible. It might be a combination of DBT and medication,  or just dbt, or something else that helps you.

I think just giving yourself love, grace, and compassion is first. Then taking little steps in ways that seem right for you. For me, it was finding a therapist that really vibed with me.

4,"Omg. I’m so sorry. Please advocate for yourself. I had to do this with ADHD. And if you can, please find a new psychiatrist. 

But: Conflicting diagnosis imo can be important especially with BPD. Find a new psychiatrist who isn’t a hack and get a second opinion from there. It’s a lifer, you want to be sure about it. BPD is often overdiagnosed and if the diagnosis ISN’T true you don’t want to be doing specialized therapy that isn’t beneficial. Not that I don’t believe you because I’m also “high-functioning” (which is a phrase I don’t believe in but that’s for another day) but I always want people with a new diagnosis to get it double checked so they get the help they need. 

My experience with conflicting diagnosis is with my ADHD. I was in the psych ward towards the end of my 1st year of college and the psychiatrist started asking me questions relating to it. Then accused me of saying what I want him to hear because I am in college. I was so confused because why ask then? And college was almost over what is medication gonna do for me now?? Thankfully my family doctor is amazing and heard me out. I have a new psychiatrist I am meeting with where I will ask for formal ADHD testing so I no longer have to argue about it. Because I’m capable of sitting still professionals in my life have written me off in regards to ADHD. But look at my lips! They’re picked to shit and all scabbed! And my nails are bitten off! Tell me that’s sitting still! And I cannot get started on tasks and I can’t focus on things even if I want to and ugh.

He definitely appears to be east or south Asian. Also I may have exaggerated how long I've seen him.. I found the lady psychiatrist in 2018, she left later that year and I saw him late 2018, and then I quit in 2020, and I went back to him early this year. Before that, I had a psychiatrist from 2011-2013 and also went off cold turkey. That was the first psychiatrist I ever had. Sooo maybe not as extensive of a relationship with me. 

I'm mostly looking for help navigating my current relationship, I have a lot of anger outbursts on a regular basis, and have definitely split on various men I idealized growing up, and basically avoided good relationships with nice people due to abandonment issues & insecurity.  I struggle because I basically present as a sweet docile person, everyone always tells me I'm so sweet or quiet or whatever, meanwhile having no idea how I screamed at my mom on a regular basis when I lived with her or can't handle minor day to day stuff with my boyfriend, slamming doors all the time, so angry over what basically appears like nothing. 

I just don't act out in sessions and generally trust medical professionals and feel frustrated not being able to explain what's going on because I shut down or am too embarrassed. I had my boyfriend just make a list because I figured it would be more apparent and honest coming from his perspective. My therapist said it really helped give her insight into me. I guess I just come off as overly sweet and compliant and yet have anger issues that I mostly mask, so I feel frustrated trying to explain the disconnect to anyone. And I can't get help for this if everyone thinks I just have depression and I'm harmless. I don't want to push everyone away and end up alone. It also gets so bad with my reckless driving, esp if I'm in an abusive relationship and off medications. But people just don't believe me because I don't appear to be crazy or something when I talk to them. 

But yeah recently my therapist has seemed to discover that I have a lot of problems regarding anger, how it's not seen as acceptable in my family, how I also witnessed it as a kid. And yeah the most self harm I've ever done is like hitting myself on the legs, in the head a few times, scratching my face or pulling at my hair. Usually it's just pinching myself when I'm mad but I never draw blood. I've never tried to delete but thought about it various times, never anything specific or plans I guess.

So I looked it up and it does seem to fit.  Very much imploding rather than exploding.  Yes I still explode, but more on my favorite people and it is usually after I've put many boundries down or I am highly triggered and I've mentioned it and I just go off on my favorite people.    Out in public I could have someone be the most rude ever and I'd take it.  I'd go to my favorite person, and if they didn't react or they seemed to disrespect my point of view, I'll snap.   I'll cry.  Eventually I feel super shitty and wonder is it my brain that is not normal and is common courtesy and respect not something someone should stand up for..I was adopted and one of childhood traumas, is being very overlooked and treated like a client or another attorney to two older attorney parents.. who had to make every conversation something they had to win.. so I was already very pushed down and shown that feelings are not to be shown.. Just deal with it and don't talk about it. ",DiamondLady420,186bm1h

5,❤️ So glad that you have found a source for therapy- & are able to work on it. 🙏🏼❤️ Thank you for your reply & thank you for the offer to chat.

6,"Ok- Thank You for the clarification of status of Quiet BPD across professionals. It’s such a shame because from what I have read, speaking for myself, it literally describes my struggles to a T, and it is so very debilitating. I’m sorry you’re struggling too- & I appreciate you not only replying, but also offering to chat 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 Thank you, buuuuut here I go feeling like I’m pushing people away: my head is so squirrelly at the moment with my mental struggles & anxiety over my struggles outside my head in the “Real World” lol, I’m afraid it would be tedious torture to have a real convo- Typical me: Ask for assistance & then push it away. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 But truly- ❤️ Thank you for your helpful reply & wonderfully kind offer to chat. ❤️ Who knows- If I get out of my own way, I might take you up on the chat!

9,"❤️ I hate that you get what it feels like to have this rage boiling inside of you- also fully aware how it developed, but being so formative at the time the “cement” of your brain development was already being laid, so now as an adult you “know” you shouldn’t blow up and you 💯💯💯💯💯 don’t want to, and you know you wouldn’t if your past hadn’t been the way it was forming this reaction inside of you….. I’m sorry you understand this…. It’s crazy how we get programmed to implode on ourselves or, like you say, when we can’t take it anymore and all that pressure inside has to go somewhere, at the slightest hint of non-support I, like you would release ALL of my tension on my loved ones. It’s just so difficult living with this. ❤️ I’m glad it seems that you have been able to make, and see some improvements. ❤️ That’s so great. All the best ❤️",No_Remote_5240,186bm1h

11,"I think it's partially because professionals want things to nearly fit into boxes, and the variances and complexities of BPD don't do that very well lol 

No pressure. I get that, I'm not great with reaching out to people myself, and accepting support is a completely separate challenge. The offer is there, whether you utilize it or not. :) take care <3",Nykai9385,186bm1h

Very well written by the way.    I also am sorry you are dealing with all of this.  I hope you receive all the true and healthy love and respect!! 


I have had almost two decades of therapy before I was diagnosed. My current therapist is happily pleased at everything I know and practice to try and become BPD free maybe one day.. that is a hope.  I will always be different and always need coping skills but hopefully one day, the implosion and explosions, are much less reactive.  ",DiamondLady420,186bm1h

0,"BPD is more destructive than depression. Same family, but a little more toxic - ESPECIALLY with drugs and alcohol. We’re like a powder keg with substances and sexual outbursts. So just know that day one - it could save your life.. and your marriage.

Stop relying on your feelings.. they’ve gotten you here… not that mental illness is our fault. We’re just.. ‘sensitive’. (It CAN be your superpower).

Lastly, grow your grace… for yourself (especially) and for those around you.

Good luck and God speed.",,10baz8q

1,"People have pointed this out, but it's worth noting that subtypes are not official diagnoses. There several models of subtypes, though the popular one is the 4 subtyoe model of Discouraged (Quiet/High Functioning), Petulant, Self-destructive, and Impulsive. You can have one or more subtypes, and your subtype(s) can change based on life circumstances.

I have equal scoring in the Quiet and Petulant subtypes.

The biggest challenges for me is that (1) My brain is at war 24/7, 365, and never stops, (2) I don't always know how to get that energy out of my system and avoid a breakdown, and (3) it can be very difficult to express to others that I am feeling the exact same emotions as any other person with bpd, when others can't see it. On the outside, I'm calm, collected, and unbiased. I can be blunt, but I can usually get through social situations with seeming ease.

But the inside, I have NO fucking idea what I'm doing, I'm confused, I'm anxious, I hate everyone who speaks to me, I lash out at myself because I will not lash out at them. I am obsessively, aggressively imagining how I want to to hurt myself, having imagined arguments with people and myself, thinking gibberish, experiencing every emotion. It's like a bomb is constantly going of, but within the shell of the bomb. That's what my head is like. I often will give myself headaches or nausea just because there's so much of this chaos with no outlet.",princefruit,1azb5up
2,"Quiet BPD is not a recognized diagnosis I don't think. 

It's just a collection of symptoms people use to describe their BPD.",Low-Implement-1637,1azb5up

5,Yeah. Nobody hates me more than I hate me! :),mamad702,1azb5up
6,It’s honestly very hard to get help. I’m very high functioning and trick myself into thinking I’m well bc outward facets of my life are going well. Meanwhile internally I feel like literally death and ecstasy (depending on the situation). I don’t explode on people and get so quiet that people often tell me I’m awkward as fuck. Just got out of a relationship bc they didn’t feel comfortable with me being quiet all the time bc I was constantly either self regulating from triggers or spazzing out on myself.,MaliciousMunch,1azb5up
7,"For me, outwardly, I seem calm, together practical and organised but that’s very different to how I feel internally.

I can be my own worst enemy, finding fault everywhere. Because I have become great at suppressing my emotions, only those who truly know me recognise when I struggle.

Because I’m able to be extremely practical and logical, it’s emotions I find hard. I hold a stressful job and study at same time. It makes getting support mental health support via the NHS is impossible and private support can be difficult to access for various reasons 

Also, most of the time, my mind is going 200 miles a hour, thinking about so many different things, all the possible consequences or options, that it can be difficult to focus or concentrate at times which can lead to overload and nothing getting done. 

I come across as introvert or a loner - when I really want friends/connection but scared of being hurt. Getting better with that. However, a big challenge for me, I can end up being in overwhelmed either socially or emotionally and need space or end up disconnecting in some way in attempt to cope.

People don’t recognise that I have a temper,  believe that nothing phases me, but it’s more about control because if I didn’t, I would really explode. Then I can go into this cycle of being angry, almost exploding, then hating myself, so I make excuses for others and make myself feel worse about me and choose poor coping strategies. 

Creating this people pleasing personality which the world sees but doesn’t reflect my personality. 

I have started break that cycle but it has taken work / effort and still have a way to go.",Possible_Laugh_9139,1azb5up

12,"I'm high functioning BPD. High stressful job and busy life. I haven't told anyone about my diagnosis but I get all the same symptoms as BPD but instead inwardly focus my rage and sadness. I find it hard because I will sometimes explode and when I do its disastrous and people are normally shocked.

My job gives me high stress levels and I tend to split and do all types of things there so it's very important to me that my coworkers understand where I'm coming from and understand that I'm trying but sometimes I get a little bit much and it's important to know that I may say or do some things that they might view as a serious overreaction or that may hurt feelings but that I'll always apologize later when I'm calm and have had time to process the situation logically, if the situation calls for it, and until then not to take it personally. I've been doing pretty well recently and one of my friend's who's a manager there lets me know if I need to simmer down or when I'm doing good at keeping a good attitude throughout the day which makes everything much easier for me and most of them tend to be pretty understanding and I have a good working relationship with them otherwise.

I completely understand wanting to express it to your close friends and family maybe but immediately cutting off friendships because of an apparent assumption is really limiting. Those with BPD struggle to understand their diagnosis so how can you expect someone who may never have had exposure with it make an educated decision about what they should do if someone said they have BPD. Think self sabotage in relationships or setting yourself up for failure when wanting to make friends.

0,"Okay, I have a lot of thoughts on this topic. I understand that its frustrating that there is some gatekeeping going on about whether or not you can say that you have BPD.  If that is a label that you feel you identify with then maybe your therapist should follow your lead on that. The reason that psychologists are hesitant about diagnosing teenagers with BPD or any personality disorder is because your personality is still forming in your teens. In my opinion, having some borderline traits is a pretty normal part of being a teenager (e.g. emotional reactivity, volatile relationships, unstable sense of identity). The process of discovering who you are, learning to manage emotions, and figuring out interpersonal difficulties can continue into your early 20s. Personality disorders are meant to capture deeply engrained persistent problematic patterns of behavior. When you are young, there is still some natural adjustment happening so nothing is that deeply engrained. Also, there's a decent portion of people with bpd who get diagnosed in their late teens/early 20s who won't meet criteria for BPD 10 years later, with or without treatment.

I think we should have a separate diagnostic category for teens with borderline features like we do for other personality disorders, so that there is a label for what you are experiencing, but it can be reassessed in adulthood.",ChinchillaToast,tab0mb
1,"I think an important thing to remember is that, really, a diagnosis serves as a way to guide treatment, not as an identity marker. If you are able to access treatment for BPD as a minor, then the actual label isn’t as important. I totally understand why you would want an official diagnosis, but BPD stigma is real and having that on your medical record can be an issue. Like others have pointed out, the reason it’s recommended that it’s not diagnosed in adolescence is because some of the behaviors can overlap with what is “normal” (not that that makes it any less painful or difficult to deal with). 

Hopefully you can get treatment now and then by the time you are old enough to get diagnosed you won’t meet the criteria anymore.",meggiec4,tab0mb
2,"I’m not sure how it works where you live, but I was able to access DBT when I was a minor and without a diagnosis! It was very frustrating that they never explained WHY I got that specific therapy though — I had suspected I had BPD for several years but it was only when I got to college that a psychiatrist mentioned it to me. It’s really frustrating that I could have had a label to help me process and understand myself, and begun working towards healing much earlier, if they had just *said it to me*. It would have saved me a lot of confusion and pain in my late teens/early twenties ://",p0meranian,tab0mb
3,"Your brain hasn't fully developed. Primarily key connections between the hippocampus and DLpfc and others responsible for emotion regulation, compartmentalize etc. BPD usually develops in childhood but the diagnostic criteria is archaic and overlapping so they like to wait.  While it's nice to know why we are the way we are, an official diagnosis isn't going to change anything. BPD is ultimately terminal by today's standards of treatment or lack there of. Symptom management and psychotherapy with or without meds is all you can do. That being said. If you do indeed have this curse, find the silver lining. It's there if you look for it. You can't see the stars without darkness",ChickendantZZZ,tab0mb
4,"I’m not sure where you live but for me getting diagnosed at 15 made everything hell for me. It’s hell even still. There’s negative stigma behind Bpd and a lot of psychiatrists and therapists won’t work with people with Bpd. They see it on my medical chart and seem to run after they see it. I think in your case she is just trying to make sure that your symptoms don’t change or anything before you’re 18, Bpd can be misdiagnosed. I know people that got diagnosed with Bpd then found out it was actually OCD or autism. It’s also the fact that alot of teens only think they have Bpd because of social media ( not that that’s your case) but it seems it’s harder to get diagnosed with that now in some areas because of that too.",YeIFeelLikeFishNarc,tab0mb
5,"my therapist said something to me that aided a lot in my treatment - it’s not about collecting labels and diagnoses like pokémon, but rather treating the symptoms. you may have bpd-like symptoms that may qualify you for having borderline, but why try to “treat” the disorder on its own when you can just focus on bettering yourself through treating your symptoms? check out the dbt and bpd workbooks. they’re really helpful and you don’t need to have bpd to benefit from them!",eyesonrecovery,tab0mb
6,"I think it’s okay for a therapist or psychiatrist to say around age 17 that you *possibly* have early signs of a personality disorder. But only if they have been seeing you for at least a year (because diagnosing personality disorders requires seeing a certain pattern in the persons behavior over time).

Any earlier than 17 though I think is a bit early because a lot of struggles teens go through may have some similarities to symptoms of a personality disorder. Not to mention, being diagnosed with a personality disorder could be a lot for a young person to cope with and try to understand. 

In my opinion BPD is already so stigmatized and often misdiagnosed that we don’t need to be adding in any more factors (like diagnosing at too young of an age) that could make misdiagnosis or perpetuation of stigma any more likely. 

As long as the therapist informs the client of what DBT is and how it could be helpful, deciding to wait to label their symptoms doesn’t hinder their ability to receive treatment. Giving the diagnosis could actually do more harm than good in my opinion. Any good therapist would tell you that you need to focus on treating the symptoms with or without a name for the symptoms anyways. It’s not ideal but I think it’s the best option.",sadgirlflowers,tab0mb

8,"A lot of clinicians are reluctant to diagnose bpd because the stigma is so intense. Personally I think the answer to that is to increase awareness and education so that people are less ignorant about the disorder, not to be afraid to diagnose it. 

That said it’s valid that a qualified professional would want to wait until the brain has developed further to pin you with such a serious diagnosis, since a lot of normal adolescent stuff has a fair amount of parallels with bpd. As long as you’re doing the work the official diagnosis is more of a technicality, try not to hang your hat on that aspect of it and just focus on treatment.",BeautifulAndrogyne,tab0mb

16,"I was always diagnosed with cPTSD and growing up a little has made me speculate maybe untreated/unaddressed/suppressed/the emotional reaction to the trauma causes BPD to develope. 

Like had X not happened I would not have learned Y behavior. Or if X hadn't happened I wouldn't have this Y hardwired into my brain.

I truly believe if my brother had gotten the Psychological help he needed when we were younger that I'd be normal and my mother and I would have a good relationship and bond. However that's not how it happened and I have a permanent bad taste in my mouth for my mother for the things she let happen when I was little >> she also responded and continues to respond in horribly disgusting ways when I mention her failures. 

HOWEVER, if when I got my cPTSD diagnosis I began to work on radical forgiveness and take steps towards being peaceful I may have fixed that relationship with my mom in a way both of us could agree with >> but I took that diagnosis and felt like ""why the fuck did she let him fuck me up to this point of permanent damage?"" 

Sometimes we hear a diagnosis and respond in alllllllll different kinds of ways, i wish I had the goals I have for myself NOW when I had first started ""working"" on my ptsd because I was resentful for a long time which I think resulted in my BPD.

17,"I study child psychology and this is because it’s unwise to diagnose a personality disorder when personality is still developing.

Regardless anyone of any age can still recieve help and guidance for their issues though, but also not having a distinct diagnosis doesn't mean your problems and struggles are less valid, or that you can't benefit from therapy and so on. 

I think a lot of people forget the whole point of diagnosis isn't to declare you with some kind of ailment like a badge to collect.

32,To address your specific situation though—yeah that sounds very frustrating. I can’t say whether or not I agree with her because I don’t know her specific reason for waiting to diagnose you. If it does sound like she views people with BPD as being violent and aggressive it sounds like you may want to find someone else. I don’t think you are being sensitive at all.

34,"Another thing to consider is that its probably best not to have a diagnosis on BPD in your medical record. Actually, you really really don't want any documentation with that diagnosis on it that will stick around in your records and your therapist probably knows this.  There is soooo much bias and stereotyping about the disorder. Some therapists will not treat people with BPD because they think they are difficult and annoying patients, and if a medical doctor sees it they might assume you are exaggerating your symptoms and take you less seriously.  

The C-PTSD thing is interesting because some people argue that BPD and C-PTSD are the same disorder, or that C-PTSD is a subtype of BPD. Diagnoses are just the way psychologists label groups of symptoms that they notice seem to occur together frequently. It's not an exact science and ultimately each person has a unique set of symptoms with a unique set of causes and we try to fit them into a category so we can get some guidance on what might help and help them connect with others with similar experiences.",ChinchillaToast,tab0mb

But that's simply not true, you deserve help and understanding and treatment, even if in the end it's not bpd. What you are going through is valid. Try to accept that your therapist doesn't want to annoy you with not diagnosing you, they are trying their best as well. Maybe you can ask them what they have in mind for your treatment.

1,Did they direct you or give you a referral for therapies? As DBT will most likely be your go to treatment since medications only do so much for managing BPD. When I was released after outpatient many moons ago I was able to get into DBT groups and therapy sooner than later. It took me 2 years of repeating the DBT process but I would suggest researching and asking doctors for referrals if you can to help you start your emotion regulation journey. I know it's painful at first but with time and acceptance and effort as well you can learn to manage the things that seem unmanageable at first. I can testify to this. Best wishes.,,zkajuc

3,"I’m glad you’ve finally received the correct diagnosis, this is the first step to receiving proper treatment and feeling better!

Paranoia is a common symptom of BPD, particularly during periods of stress. Hyper vigilance, which is very similar to what you’re describing, is also common in both BPD and PTSD (I’ve also been diagnosed with C-PTSD, and many of the symptoms overlap). If you have a history of trauma from your childhood/adolescence (most people with BPD do), this might be what’s contributing to this symptom as well.

The second symptom you’ve mentioned is dissociation, which is also another common BPD symptom, which like paranoia, also appears more often in times of stress. This is one of my most disruptive symptoms, personally. I began detaching from my surroundings to cope with the traumatic experiences from my formative years, and this usually manifests in the form of highly elaborate daydreams. 

I’d recommend checking out r/MaladaptiveDreaming, a subreddit dedicated to obsessive daydreaming. There are many causes,  with BPD being one strongly linked to the phenomenon, and there are ways to help minimise the disruption it can cause in your daily life and productivity.",mars3127,l16bux

8,"One of the markers for BPD is ""**Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality**"". You could also consider the first thing as a part of hyper vigilance. Always in a state of being ready to react.

I have felt extreme paranoia at times. My paranoia was more in terms of constantly interpreting the appearance of certain things as important symbolism. Example: Noticing snails, black cats, or certain numbers on the clock somehow became very important to me and felt like either a blessing or an omen. Lyrics to familiar songs took on strange meaning or even double meaning. The appearance of common things became messages and I would often have auditory hallucinations. This was during the height of an emotional crisis while undergoing a life changing event, so I am not sure if it can be considered a true piece of my BPD diagnosis.

The second part you describe could be ""Maladaptive daydreaming"" or be related to the ""Fantasy prone personality"" trait. Beware that maladaptive daydreaming is not officially recognized diagnostic material. Without meaning to gatekeep or minimize, I find that a lot of the discussions about it is done in an overly competitive, comparative, and disingenuous manner.

Congratulations on your diagnosis. I feel its an important step in getting proper treatment.

One thing that really helped me when coming to terms with my diagnosis was reading ""Stop walking on eggshells"". It lays out a lot of various examples of what some BPD symptoms can look like. I would imagine that not all of them will apply to you. At least for me, not all of the extreme examples applied. One example would be that I never had an issue with theft or breaking the law.

0,"Hey, I was in similar shoes not that long ago and can relate to the feeling. It’s important for you to know that BPD is not “who” you are but rather something you’re experiencing. Reading through the subreddits and online material can feel condemning at times as well. The truth is everyone here is as beautiful, worthy, and lovable as anyone else despite our BPD. Instead of feeling complete negativity try and highlight some good things like hey I got an answer and therefore I now have a focus on affected areas in my life in which I can focus on when I’m feeling the motivation for self care/self love. If you can garner the focus meditation is a great thing to pick up and is a tool that can be used anywhere for any amount of time - meditations that focus on putting your attention on breathe can help stop intrusive thoughts and help you ground yourself in moments you are feeling triggered and also has a host of other heath benefits. In the west here we put a lot of religious dogma on meditation but its’ rather not religious at all but moreover focusing on oneself and being present with what is “Now” rather then anchored in thought and emotion of the past or anxiety of the future.

There are books you can read, and exercises you can try on your own. Don't believe everything you read about people with BPD though. You are still an individual and should not let someone's diagnosis define who you are or what you are capable of achieving.

As for the DBT, I’m prepared to do anything at this stage to be the best version I can be, I owe it to myself and the people around me so Im ready to put in the work, im just worried about the timeframe before actually starting it but we’ll get there! Thanks again! ☺️",TiredMiss_,xlvibj
0,"""fp"" stands for favourite person, this term used in BPD is not a typical 'favourite person' like a best friend, an fp is an extreme emotional attachment you can get towards someone, this person can be a friend, family member, partner etc and we have little control over who becomes our fp. unfortunately this is extremely debilitating for both us with bpd and the fp because it can turn toxic and become extremely unbearable due to our emotional stability being completely dependent on one person",lilitthcore,zf3jl5
1,"""splitting"" refers to black and white thinking, this can also be described as idolisation and devaluation and is very common in BPD. this can look like: feeling intense love towards someone and then suddenly (often due to being triggered) to instant hate, anger, bitterness or completely nothing etc this can happen extremely quickly, last from minutes to years and can go back and forth :')",lilitthcore,zf3jl5
2,"The best thing you can do for yourself if educate yourself and get into talk therapy and DBT.

I learned a TON from [Dr. Fox on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DrDanielFox). He's got videos for everything you need to know about BPD and he also teaches ways to cope with your symptoms too. I learned coping skills from him before I even started therapy.

Recovery Mum has a wonderful video on Favorite Person and how it relates to our fear of abandonment. After watching [this video](https://youtu.be/DViNoaLh4jQ) 2yrs ago, I haven't had an obsessive relationship. You will 100% benefit from watching and check out her channel too, she has lots of good stuff there. It's nice to hear from someone who has BPD.

If you are experiencing any other type of mental illness along with BPD, definitely see a doctor on going on some medications. But that alone won’t help. DBT is found to be very helpful for people with BPD, but you have to do it with individual therapy. Recovery is gonna be lots of work, but you’ve already gone through the hard part. Good luck OP.

Learn as much as you can about this condition - knowledge is power, after all - and things will start making a lot of sense. For me, personally, a lot of my behaviours pre-BPD awareness frustrated the shit out of me because I couldn't understand why I did it. After doing my research and learning about BPD, I could find explanations for a lot of the behaviours, and that brought me a lot of comfort and awareness to even possibly prevent it.

4,"I'm in DBT right now and have done a bit of CBT in the past. CBT is about changing your thought processes and patterns, so it's helpful to break thoughts of rumination etc (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). DBT focuses on skills to help you regulate your emotions when you're in a heightened state. It also has other modules aimed to help you learn how to recognise your emotions and to regulate them on a daily basis. Since BPD is typically a condition which manifests as an inability to regulate emotions, DBT teaches us the skills to manage the intensity and frequency of these ""big"" emotions so that we can react to distressful situations more effectively (e.g.: instead of screaming your head off when someone triggers you, using skills to bring your emotions down more quickly so you don't make the situation worse). I'm only about 8 weeks into my 20 week course. It can be really difficult to implement the skills but nothing good comes easy. We are all here because we are used to thinking and being a certain way for our entire lives - nothing is gonna change overnight. 

Also, although there is no medication to treat BPD, it's considered one of the most ""treatable"" PDs. There are lots of examples of people who have learned to manage the symptoms and gone on to no longer fit the diagnostic criteria. Of course, some of the traits are always gonna be with you for the rest of your life but, at the end of the day, NONE of the traits are unique amongst humankind. We just feel them more accutely/intensely due to the way our brains are. Don't let anyone trick you into thinking that the emotions you feel is wrong or abnormal. That's bullshit.",,y626uo

Get your ducks in a row, therapy wise.  Get into a program if at all possible.  Get a therapist who specifically works with BPD.

11,"For me at least, the FP is a recipient of strong people pleasing feelings and actions if that makes sense?  You really really like them, like an addiction.  Certain qualities they possess or certain things they like really appeal to you, and the idea slowly (or quickly) morphs into you placing them on a pedestal.  This can go on for a short amount of time or an extended period, but almost always ends with them doing or saying something that causes a split and before you know it, you're done placing them on a pedestal and you replace that with devaluation.  I also believe (for me its the case sometimes) but a ""FP"" can also be abstract, like some kind of hobby that currently you cannot stop or a substance that you particularly enjoy.

My opinion about your relationship with your on-and-off fiancé is that he may not be your FP, and perhaps he may be the correct answer to some open ended questions for you.  What I mean is this:  Sometimes internally we realize our lives our unstable because of our disorder and we are seeking stability in almost any form.  Additionally there should be an epiphany on your end that sometimes, more often than not, what we fantasize as ""love"" is actually obsession and true love is considerably more vanilla than what we want it to be.  

You are probably truly in love with your fiancé, but there's something that seems ""boring"" (I'm not trying to be insensitive here, apologies if it seems that way) for you, so you keep him around for stability, but you are seeking that ""perfect"" partner who will reciprocate the extremely intense feelings.  After 36 years of being alive, I've personally found this to be true even for me, but maturation and getting older, along with really studying ""normals"" has shown me that how I'm going about trying to find someone is inherently incorrect and unsustainable, and stability is what I should be looking for in a partner.

Your fiancé is probably worth tying the knot and settling down with.  I don't know you personally (I'm sure you're very cool, though :D) but I can say with certainty much internal healing comes from being with a healthy person.  Such is the case with my and my wife, who I've been with for 18 years now.

I apologize if it seems to invasive, I got diagnosed at 23,
Turned 24 8 m/o later….",Plastic-Elephant-900,175tptd
14,"Hiyo not invasive at all!  Sorry for the wall of words.

I was diagnosed at 29 and I'm 36 now.  I've been in therapy since I've been diagnosed and while I do not meet any formal criteria for remission, I've made really strong steps to recovery.  My generation was never mental health focused and unfortunately I had to go for my first psych eval while in crisis from a stressful work environment.  

It was the first time I learned about BPD and I hit every single one of the criteria.  A full 100% lol but it made sense to me.  I'm pretty sure my parents have NPD, one is an alcoholic, I've had two emergency open heart surgeries, am a first generation immigrant, then my parents divorced...yeah you get it we all start out baptized in fire right?

I do think my diagnosis kick started my recovery because it answered some open ended shit I've had issues with since a child.  My therapist is great and together we worked on a few key things:  

1) Others unless they also have BPD are incapable of understanding what we go through.  This helped me not hold people overly accountable and ultimately helped with my villainous devaluation of some poor person that doesn't deserve it because they said hello in the wrong tone. 

2) Our version of ""love"" is a bit sick and obsessive, to the point of crazy grandeur.  By realizing this I am less prone to idealizing people and somehow that cured my FP tendencies.  I think I will still appreciate someone's abilities, but I don't just outright worship anyone anymore.  This idea also very importantly works as the inverse, where you apply FP type love to yourself and you realize that's crazy and there's no way you can start to respect yourself by giving yourself crazy high standards you'll never realistically (or instantaneously) meet.  

3) People are capable of actions while not being aware of the consequences.  This helped me get over my F'd up parents and allowed me to view them more as people, which was a big part of my maturation as a person.

As far as the abandonment issues and my related behaviors:  I personally think that it's a sick manifestation of a superpower I don't want and I'll always deal with it.  It's that whole thing about being in tune with others and a speed of light mind that imagines all the what ifs of a situation.  We fear heavily, but if you know your mind will go in that direction then you can get ahead of it and curb it a bit.  I know what actions are a bit crazy and what actions are more normal, and after weighing things in my mind I can choose the non-crazy society friendly option, which is what people usually want.

Sorry for the essay again, best to you and your journey friend",FlipMick,175tptd
15,"Hi, no need to apologize for giving me an essay, you were just answering my questions with intention to help me and you did! 

Sorry, to hear that you had to go through such a difficult time prior to your diagnosis. I think a lot of us can relate in the sense where a crisis led to a psych eval, at least I can. It’s difficult because I honestly think what we go through everyone does, we are just more sensitive in the sense where situations, triggers, issues are magnified x 10 and people naturally grow stronger and we have to put in harder work to build that shield.

Hmm, is formal remission a thing? You need to proud of your steps forward because that is what is going to keep you going and I think being stuck in black and white thinking doesn’t allow us to see small improvement, so that in itself it’s a huge part of managing and gaining self-control, so congrats on the commitment to stick with it and live out a purposeful life. You are still young, and can accomplish anything! 29 was not old, it is better late then never, like most our older parents didn’t have the chance to heal. 

In terms of the following you mentioned:

1. So being more compassionate towards others rather than assuming people know what we feel or what’s going on in our minds and have the emotional intelligence skills to approach the situation without being harmful? 

2. I don’t think I have accepted that our idea of love is sick and obsessive, however, I can observe looking back at moments where the distress due to attachment created out of control behaviors that seem to still come up if in a romantic relationship but odd enough that it appears more in unhealthy ones and healthy ones I seem to just not want to stay in it or just “don’t fall in love” or something seems to be missing in what I want in that person…. Can you describe how you would apply FP type of love to yourself and I guess what would you identify as the FP (obsessive love we feel for an FP) is it that we have unrealistic expectations of the person? 

3. Very true, it may also help to realize that if they didn’t have the skills to manage and heal their demons, how can they do the same for you and that does not disqualify the hurt and pain caused and you still have to choose to forgive for you… a book radical acceptance by Tara brach, really really helped me with this and I need to read it again ….. I think it’s so helpful to heal any past hurt in relationships and to forgive ourselves for issues the illness caused because at the end of the day it may be our responsibility to get control and change but it still is the same thing as if we are a sick puppy that needs to go to the vet to see what it has in order to start taking the proper route to recovery, so give yourself grace!!! 

4. Hmm, I haven’t heard the perspective of a manifestation of a supper power!? Yea - in the moment though of that strong strong feeling which is as if my whole body is on fire and in order to cool it down I need to know now if the thoughts are true or if your leaving .. sometimes it’s so much easier to be alone, but I do struggle with “oh ok next person that wants to try, let’s see if this works” and it’s two extremes - either toxic because it triggers or to kind, in a way to feminine because I have very masculine qualities cause of trauma and need someone to overpower my masculinity to be feminine myself but then it is in a way where it’s to much because it triggers …. 

Now I need to apologize for overwriting and maybe oversharing !!!! I did however, want to give my support through your struggles, and take the time to acknowledge the hard work you seem to be doing in therapy. I am grateful that you have taken the time to help me and the community, truly.",Plastic-Elephant-900,175tptd
16,"Hi friend.  You write well so reading this was easy for me and you don't have to worry about over writing or sharing!  Luckily we are somewhat organized in this discussion so I'll just go by numbers again :)

1. You are on point.  Sometimes we are so enmeshed in our struggle that we in turn project onto others and assume they are functioning on the same level as us; they are not.  Much like a teacher has to have patience with kids(not exactly but it's more of an example), we have to have patience with others who have not had the same circumstances and genetics and experiences to just throw our whole situation at them and assume they will ""get it.""  In a way we \*should be\* dropping our overly high standards and accepting most have \*average to mediocre\* sensing abilities.  Additionally we have to be aware of something called the Fundamental Attribution Error, where if someone does something to us we deem ""bad"" and automatically assume they are bad people because of a bad choice they made.  For example, someone cuts you off on the road while in a car in some asshole move, we typically don't assume they just made a single bad choice at that moment, but in fact they are bad people all around.  This is incorrect and adopting this viewpoint somewhat lessens our ""I'm a constant victim"" mentality.  My example of driving can be extrapolated to other situations, like when someone says something to you that appears insensitive, when in fact we have no idea how their day is going and what they said to you was just something in line with their really bad day.
2. The whole FP thing is quite interesting to me because I think we are trying to create something out of them that ""fits"" with our personality.  I truly believe BPD tends to happen with a NPD in close proximity during our formative years, and funny enough when we become adults I think we try to recreate some kind of relationship that gives us comfort.  If you think about it, a successful FP (albeit fucked up) is one who lavishes in the attention and embraces our ""love"" to reciprocate what we give them.  WTF are we doing?  Trying to create a NPD, that's what!  So unhealthy for everyone lol.  At least that's what I believe.

There is a point in our lives where we realize that we'vebeen living for other people and their attention/affection, but internally we realize our healthy selves requires self love and self respect, and we cannot always live for other people.  It is at this point we try to apply our sick type love to ourselves, but we basically have nothing to emulate except the FP type pedestal lifting.  Suddenly we expect ourselves to be amazing and we want to be what a FP is to ourselves.  This is unsustainable unfortunately and a perfect way to discourage yourself/disappoint yourself because of grandiosity and unrealistic expectations.  Funny enough this really helped me realize how fucked up it is for us to even have a FP, because most of the time they will never be what we unrealistically want.  I'm sure they also feel our lack of love immediately when we see they aren't absolutely perfect and thus split on them, and that's pretty shitty for someone to experience.

3.  I'll have to check that book out.  I remember radical acceptance as one of my DBT exercises and it is helpful.  It's doubly so if you actually have something you need to radically accept lol.

4.  I do firmly believe we with BPD have a superpower we don't want, or was not successfully utilized.  Sometimes I feel like I was expected to build a mansion with my life (metaphor), but I was only given the materials for a lean-to shed, all the while someone was repeatedly pulling the proverbial rug from under my feet over and over again.  I would have gotten so much further with my life if I had certain things and I was raised in another way, but oh well.  C'est la vie; Que sera, sera.

Also, I feel what you are saying about the feminine/masculine roles.  I wonder if it's the young you being intuitive to the point where you were seeing what was lacking at home and you morphed into what was needed?  That's how I feel sometimes.  Sorry if I'm wrong here.

Anyway, great discussion.  Best to you

Edit: a few words",FlipMick,175tptd
0,"Idk if my definition is correct but I believe splitting to be a defense mechanism that fires when someone feels attacked, losing control of a situation, etc.. that looks from the outside like an absolutely insane overreaction (this is why usually when someone is splitting they will say crazy shit and shit they don't really mean once they calm down and the meltdown is over.)

It took a while but I started to appreciate the new beginning where I am mindful and more comfortable with myself. Looking back on the past , I was able to identify when I was the source of the problem in conflicts. That permitted me to release a lot of anger and to mend relationships. Not by making excuses but by being honest. I strongly advise getting as much information you can get from trustworthy sources to understand what the illness is. It is the best tool you can have. Start with the book I Hate You , Don’t Leave Me. 

I often see people talking about relationships. I would like to share that real relationships are possible. You just need to work on yourself. I married my high school sweetheart. I have many problems but BPD made me into someone who can easily relate emotionally. A great skill for being a good husband. I also always tried to better myself. Someone who loves you will love the effort you do to contain your emotions. 

Most of all , be mindful , be humble and be compassionate towards others and yourself.",patrick_oneil,d2apgs
1,"We can be monsters sometimes, but not always. There's also phases and there are people still in an aggressive phase, I had one as well and I still have a lot of hatred because of my lack of wellbeing. But there's also people who aren't aggressive. You've basically been a victim of a stereotype.",,d2apgs
2,"It's easy to get caught up in the minutiae of having a diagnosis. It's almost as if you have discovered a track that you've been riding on, but you thought you were driving a car. You thought you were in control, and you thought that you were you. It's one of the things I struggled with when I received my own personal diagnosis.

Keep in mind that you are still you - you aren't your diagnosis, nor is your condition your identity. You *are* in control, as the diagnosis is just a collection of statistical data collected about others who share similar traits, circumstance, and/or experiences. As I see it, diagnoses are only important for three reasons:

1. To gather, observe, and research data
2. To communicate large amounts of information quickly
3. To more effectively designate treatment methods

Any other reason bears no efficacy. It is not helpful for patients to ruminate on past experiences or symptoms. It is not helpful to stigmatize conditions and generalize outcomes. This is why many therapists and counsellors choose to not divulge diagnoses if it is not necessary - it may be fuel for the fire that is the issue at hand, and will not serve proper treatment. Try not to let your diagnosis rob you of your autonomy. You've just defined your enemy now, and with a face to the threat, you are better equipped to fight.

Others have had experiences with people with a similar diagnosis to your own, and they may choose to scapegoat the condition rather than allow the individual the responsibility they deserve. People make mistakes, and some people are awful by nature, but do not allow others to blame you for their experiences with which you have no responsibility. Do not inherit the accountability for their experiences.\* They may be projecting and generalizing, and you will have to learn to resist the urge to believe them. You are you, and you are only responsible for your own actions and experiences.

Here is one of the things that helped me with recovery - genetic heritability isn't nearly as influential as environmental heritability. What this means is that most of the time, while we may have certain genetic predispositions, we inherited traits more from circumstance than from our genes. You are more than a statistic or generalization - you are an individual who inherited circumstances which led you here. Others' experiences do not define *your* experience, just as much as yours don't invalidate theirs. We are all out here experiencing life differently, and there's nothing wrong with that.

3,"No, honey, you're not. It's just a diagnosis. It doesn't define you. Borderline is also a behavioral disorder, and YOU control your behavior. I was bad for awhile esp in my mid 20's to early 30's. I thought I'd lose all of my relationships for always. Being on the right meds and getting into therapy really helped me. I also think self-awareness - that comes with age - helped me. I realized that though I can behave badly, I'm not a bad person.",,d2apgs
4,"It’s uncomfortable and upsetting at first when you finally have a name to the behaviors and thoughts you exhibited. It’s especially angering because YOU did not ask for this vile present that your parent(s) or other adult wrapped with bright paper and a big shiny bow. It’s something we were given without our knowledge or consent. After the anger comes the depression over the fact that you WISH you had a normal childhood like others. 

When starting therapy you will want to run from it and hide because it’s painfully uncomfortable and scary to go through at first. It’s a tough road to be on. 

But you must not run from it. It’s a part of you forever and always but it doesn’t mean you can’t be happy and function in life in a normal fashion.",Angel_ofthe_Odd,d2apgs
5,"I was diagnosed maybe a year or two ago (lord knows I’m terrible with timelines) and it was so hard for me to come to grips with at first. I constantly found myself googling it and re-reading the description and symptoms. I felt like something was just horribly wrong with me. It almost made me more miserable than I was just blindly wandering around in the dark, not knowing what was wrong with me. 

But slowly, with the help of therapy, I found myself able to recognize these toxic behaviors from BPD and start to step back and think through them. It didn’t happen in a day or a week or a month. But gradually I just realized I was able to find little thought tricks (like making lists of things i can control or do now/things i can handle later/things outside of my control, having to prove my own negative thoughts to myself with concrete evidence, doing timelines or maps to figure out why I felt the way I did, etc.) and I found that through learning to control the negative side of BPD, I could hone the POSITIVE side of BPD. 

And yes, there’s absolutely a positive side. The random deep happiness, love, empathy. The ability to care unconditionally. 

Not only are you not a monster, but you have the ability to use this “disorder” to make yourself an amazing, thoughtful, and happy person bc truly not many people get to feel as deeply as someone with BPD (which I guess is a gift and a curse). I hope that doesn’t sound corny or whatever. But I always wished that someone had told me back then that I could feel and cope the way I do now so I would have spent a lot less time feeling sorry for myself and a lot more time working on myself earlier. 

Good luck, OP. And I truly wish for you that you are able to use this information to find your own sense of happiness and that you can know that this feeling now will pass over time.",cruzorlose,d2apgs
6,No don’t be. I felt the shame and embarrassment of it as well when I was diagnosed. That part is the illness though. People hate the disorder because of the stigma. Bpd is certainly no picnic to have and it causes a lot of harm to oneself and others but management is key. Once you know you have it you can focus on trying to manage the episodes through awareness and therapy. Good luck.🍀,RainbowGoth89,d2apgs
7,"When I was diagnosed, I felt liberated. I finally had words to describe the craziness in my life and a roadmap to make it better. Just remember, *you are not your diagnosis*. There are a lot of different ways to meet the criteria, and a lot of them most likely do not apply to you.

Maybe some of those bad perceptions do describe things you do, and if so, this is an opportunity to start looking at those things and making it better. It's also likely that there are some stereotypical BPD things that aren't you at at all. Don't let your diagnosis dictate who you are.",,d2apgs
8,"Anyone who dares to judge your entire character based on a single mental illness is ignorant and not worth your time. You might come across people in your life who use your diagnosis against you; blame you for something that happened, even if you never caused it; they may try to invalidate you, say “You’re only like this because you have BPD.” But they’re wrong. Everyone is the way they are for different reasons. BPD does *not* define *who you are*.

I go about my life without telling anyone I have BPD. Only people who know are very close to me, and would never say anything out of place, or even use BPD as a fact against me. I think they forget most of the time anyway. But I purposely keep to myself when it comes to my mental illness, because first, everyone has something, whether it be a personality disorder, anxiety disorder, arthritis, alcoholism, cancer, autism, even just daily anxiety, everyone has something. 

People are judgmental. Not everyone, but personality disorders are very hard to understand. They are very complex disorders that form when we are very young children, and tend to come out as life moves us forward. So people may group together Narcissistic PD and Antisocial with BPD, because they simply are not well educated about the matter. And the stereotypes for ASPD and NPD are far worse than BPD. We get treated all the same.

Stay away from unhealthy people. Anyone who doesn’t want them in your life because you have BPD can suck a fuck. You deserve validation and you deserve love just like anyone else.",flowrpot,d2apgs

10,"You didn't do this to yourself. You have no accountability in your diagnosis.  Type 1 diabetic patients don't ask if they should feel like monsters. However you are responsible for your diagnosis.

This means you owe yourself some things to help yourself. Similar to diabetic patients are responsible for their own care and management.

Define your responsibilities to yourself.  I'll give you a couple simple ones.

You are responsible for being as functional as possible.  You're responsible for seeking treatment as necessary. Completing and being present for the treatment.  Just like a diabetic if you fail to manage your illness there are consequences.

I'd argue that your price of failure is much higher than most diabetics. However the condition exists on a spectrum.

I will get these like dry pains up through my back. My skin all over gets dry. I know it's abnormal but doctors have been no help. I have PCOS but I don't think this can be normal even for PCOS. My body and my mind just struggle to get through these few days, but it's also like I've been going through this for so long that I can sort of take a step back and know that I have to watch what I say and do. Also, with women, BPD symptoms commonly become greatly reduced in the late 30's/early 40's. I've noticed this.

So I eventually found out wtf was wrong with me and in the process realized two things about self diagnosing.   
First no shrink wants you bypassing their hustle so they will not accept your diagnosis until they make you go through the discovery rituals as well and they get paid.  
    
This being true, they have a lock on meds and meds being the only way to successfully treat the condition,  
( don't care Reddit, it is and the meds do a shit job of it, so successful is relative) ( Also, Cannabis is a miracle .....just mentioning it)   
they have to be on board with the diagnosis.   
This is true regardless of where you are.   
Two  The positives...  
it can settle your mind and help you know what you are facing.   
It can stop you from suicide because you have an explanation and can stop things like, ""Maybe I'm possessed ?""or ""Do I have  a curse on me?"".   


Also it is not difficult. It is following the criteria and thinking logically and TRUTHFULLY comparing what you know to be true about yourself, to what is written.   
People of 'Average Intelligence' (me) and ability can make that comparison and if they are honest gain some insight into their condition.   
Maybe they are wrong but wrong mental diagnosis is like a wrong shoe size you notice it eventually.   
Then it's back to comparisons. It can help and given the state of health insurance and the costs of mental health services  it might be the only option. Good luck and may you find out with minimal pain.",,1553f7u

You are his supportive gf you are not his doctor. His recovery is his responsibility. I think it’s great he has someone kind like yourself in the corner.

Ive had my diagnosis for 12 years now, so over the years, ive learnt a lot about the disorder, but I've never sat and done proper research, because I know what it is, I deal with it daily.

Look for support groups in your area. NAMI should have groups for you as well as for family/partners/etc. 

I know that for me a big root of this was trauma/CPTSD, so getting into trauma informed care and then eventually EMDR was a huge help. I think that internal family systems and attachment therapy can be really useful for diagnoses like this.

If you are having trouble finding a therapist, check out the psychology today therapist finder. It will let you filter for insurance, modalities (types of therapy), gender of therapist, etc. I was able to find someone that specialized in religious trauma syndrome that uses EMDR, IFS, and attachment therapy, which is exactly what i need and magically she even takes Medicaid.

I learnt earlier on to not disclose my diagnosis 
Maybe going forward avoid disclosing it to protect yourself 

As for what the way forward is, different people take different paths but generally it looks like this

1. Accepting and internalising the diagnosis 
This means learning to distinguish between  a normal and healthy reaction vs a bpd reaction

2. Identifying unhealthy coping mechanisms and working in them

3. Learning new healthy coping mechanisms 

4. Identifying triggers
Getting rid of triggers where possible
Erecting a plan to deal with triggers you can't get rid of

5. Learning about BPD

Also consider getting the DBT workbook by Dr Fox for example but there are others 

Also read book, listen to podcasts, seminars, lecturers about bpd.

Read academic studies about recovery and remission so you can see that it's not the end of the world 

Remember that mental health is on a spectrum  so learn as much as you can so you're better equipped to draft a game plan that works best for you

stopped going for a while, PTSD was bad in the 7th grade and since then I've bounced between therapy and psychiatry offices. by 16 I was still having PTSD symptoms, was s.a., found myself in an abusive relationship (with a Nazi which is a whole thing I need unpack in therapy) with my first major relationship, had a shoplifting phase, self harmed frequently since 5th grade, suicide attempts, and my parents were incredibly abusive both mentally and medically(I'm disabled) 

at 16 I had a breakdown after my then boyfriend had hit me so hard my glasses fell off and made me throw up to prove a point, his mom recommended to my mom an office and got diagnosed. I'm just now going to a very nice office at 20 trying to sort out my trauma because I'm becoming a shitty person in my relationships for the first time when my bpd has been ""quiet"" type bpd for all my life up until 2 months ago

edit: I read your question more carefully and my only take away was that I felt that I had to hit rock bottom before I got tested for anything because it didn't seem like I was experiencing something other than PTSD/related depression and anxiety",acid_xx_aj,vim2uj

4,"It was after my most fatal attempt of committing suicide. I was in the ICU for 3 days, unconscious and unstable. Once I “survived”, I got transferred to a mental hospital for 2 weeks. After that, I was forced-fully taken by my family to a treatment center (a town like place in the middle of nowhere in NY). 

My family was convinced that I had BPD easily as the suicide attempts and most other bad things I repeated in my life by age 19 made them angry and confused back then. 

Some psychiatrists they got in touch with suspected that I had BPD. The treatment center people were already “so assured” that I had BPD even before seeing me just to convince my family to get me there. They put so much fear into them that this is something extremely important to “deal with” asap ORELSE…

The entire thing as the way I got diagnosed (more like claimed) with it is chaotic and beyond disturbing. Those 9 months I spent in that treatment center hell hole, never knowing when I’d be out, is still one of my biggest traumas in my entire life.

BUT yeah… I have BPD :) for sure. Because I am assured of it myself. Not because several cliche and cash lover psychiatrists diagnosed me with it. There isn’t really a test or legitimate way of diagnosing it though, fyi.",Xaquel,vim2uj
5,"I always knew there was something ""off"" about me and so did my parents. I had OCD traits growing up so I often assumed my erratic behaviour and toxic relationships, fears, etc. were somehow related to that. 

So as a young adult, I met with a psychiatrist to get an official diagnosis for OCD. We went into my OCD traits and then talked more about my relationships, feelings, behaviour, trauma, etc. For hours. I was candid about a lot of things I've done that wouldn't be considered healthy or normal or maybe even unsettling. After everything he asked me, ""have you ever heard of Borderline Personality Disorder?""

My diagnosis came as a shock to my parents. I was never abused as a child, I had a healthy and normal upbringing. In fact, I am very close with my family. It was concluded my BPD is most likely attributed to severe bullying I was subjected to during adolescence as well as trauma from sexual assault.

I would speak to a psychiatrist. BPD is often misdiagnosed as Bipolar Disorder and vice versa. They have many similar traits but the treatments can be vastly different.

I also wanna note -- you do not require an official diagnosis to try DBT practices independently. If you cannot access a psychiatrist any time soon, it's still okay to utilize techniques developed for BPD traits you may have and want to work on. Wishing you the best. ❤️",,vim2uj
6,"I was a student when I had a depressive episode. We had free counselling for students at the university so I contacted them for some help. After the first interview they already suspected I had more than ""regular"" depression and anxiety so they sent me to the psychiatry clinic of the university (I went to medical school). The psychiatrist prescribed me antidepressants (which was totally uneffective for me) and sent me to the clinic's psychologist for Psychological Diagnostic Testing and I got diagnosed there with BPD. It was all free till this point (we have free healthcare, I live in Europe) Then they advised me to look for a therapist specializing in treating clients with BPD. I did that and I have session with her every week since, it's quite pricey, but it's worth it.

9,"Edit: sorry I didn’t pay attention to the part where you said you don’t have the resources for a therapist. I mean a therapist who you’d pay for therapy sessions isn’t able to diagnose you anyway… you can’t really hire a psychiatrist I don’t think? Sorry I can’t give more advice ahah. But I do want to stress that it’s important to see a professional. BPD is a highly complex disorder which you honestly can’t self diagnose at all. Before I was diagnosed with BPD I believed I had bipolar and schizophrenia as I fit the diagnostic criteria etc etc. I didn’t go around saying I had it but during my episode that got me admitted into the psych ward I thought they’d diagnose me with bipolar and I believed that the schizophrenia was pretty self explanatory. Nope turned out to be BPD ahah. But this stuff really only can be diagnosed by the right professional. On paper symptoms with different causes can sound the same. It takes a professional to be able to know the difference.



I think it depends on what country ur in in terms of how to access the support available but bottom line is you need to see a psychiatrist. Personally I was diagnosed whilst I was in a psych ward so unfortunately I can’t really give out that much advice about what it’s like seeking out the diagnosis. Probably a referral from your gp/primary care doctor to the mental health team is the way to go but I’m not sure about what the waiting list would look like.",Secret1348,vim2uj
10,"You are not going to like this answer.

Borderline Personality Disorder is not considered a ""trending illness"" by insurance companies, so most insurances do not cover treatment. If a therapist diagnoses you with BPD, they know you will most likely be stuck with the bill. So therapists do not like to diagnose BPD.

THIS is one of the many reasons why Psychology as a business is disgusting.

Also, BPD is the most stigmatized illness on the list of mental illnesses and almost all patients google their conditions. Therapists know this and, to further protect you, they avoid a BPD diagnoses at any cost. 

Short answer: BPD requires at least 5 of the 9 traits.

1- Fear of abandonment. 
2- Unstable relationships.
3- Unclear or shifting self-image. 
4- Impulsive, self-destructive behaviors. 
5- Self-harm and/or suicide
6- Extreme emotional swings.
7- Chronic feelings of emptiness.
8- Explosive anger.
9- Feeling suspicious, paranoid, or out of touch with reality.

The treatment is Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, BUT Borderline is not a stand-alone condition. It is mostly accompanied by Co-Dependency and PTSD. 

Too many people mistake the ""obsessiveness"" in relationships and the upset in relationships caused by Co-Dependency for BPD, and the treatments for both are very different. 

BPD is JUST the Highly Sensitive Person/Empath who can't BEAR to harm people they love AND the BPD person is convinced they are Toxic.

Mix that with Co-Dependency and throw in some triggers... it's a recipe for emotional chaos. BUT is VERY manageable once you know which way to go :) 

You'll need both CBT and DBT, but focusing more on the Co-Dependency and PTSD goes a LONG way to help the BPD. Start there and hit me up if you want to know more.",OperationImagination,vim2uj

There are tools to help even without diagnosis but I’d say it would be harder alone. Without a group and 1/1 to talk it through with x ask for a second opinion. Get all of your research together and put your point across. If it falls on deaf ears, ask for a second opinion.

I don't have the tools to prevent those times yet but I can at least acknowledge them and do my best to listen to my body. 

My relationship is extremely rocky. Not sure what's in store for the future. We are doing family therapy and recently learned that his attachment style is avoidant. We've been together almost 8 years. I've mostly felt like we are just roommates who are raising kids together. It's been extremely unhealthy. Now that I'm finally dealing with this and trying to heal and do what's best for my children it's especially difficult because we are not on the same page. I highly recommend working through your stuff first but obviously it doesn't always work that way. A partner with a secure attachment I feel like is crucial. I feel very alone in this journey. I'm learning to put myself first and love myself. Still not there but it takes time. 

One step at a time. There is soo much to learn and address. Be kind and give yourself grace. Don't apologize! That's literally what this is for. 😊

However I've had good days since and thought that it doesn't fit me at all. That nothing bad has ever happened to me. That next time I see my psychologist I'll tell her this is crazy, that I'm ""normal"" and she's wrong. I know none of these things are likely to happen. I'll probably have a panic attack and be filled with emptiness again within the next few weeks..and be flooded with the feeling I have BPD again. 

Anyhow, I deal with my ability to disconnect from those feelings by journalling. Everytime my mood changes I write it down (therapist recommended). I also just put how I'm doing, so I can look back and see that this past week I have felt euphoric for 4 hours one day and depressed and empty the next. I try to write down when I think I'm splitting. I've been listening to Back from the Borderline Podcast and reading the Body Keeps the Score. Keep track of what you relate too. When something good happens it's easy to be flooded with confidence and a feeling that I am amazing and don't have borderline. That's just my experience.

1,"Hello and welcome! My therapist and I actually went to the Mayo Clinic article about BPD and went through the symptoms together when he suspected I had BPD. I had been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and Bipolar until we found out it was most likely BPD.

If I remember correctly, you must meet 5 out of 9 criteria to be diagnosed with BPD. When I was recently diagnosed my symptoms included:

Fear of abandonment, a pattern of unstable relationships, rapid change in identity/image, disassociation, impulsive/risky behavior, suicidal threats and behavior, mood swings, emptiness, and intense/inappropriate emotions.

I will say the experiences folks have with BPD is a large spectrum. I would say my BPD is much more of a ""classic"" BPD where others may experience what is called ""quiet"" BPD. If you look quiet BPD you should find results to explain what I mean.

Sending good vibes your way, hope your next appointment goes well. :)",,tgejoc
2,"Well being diagnosed with BPD just made a lot of sense to me when it happened. It hits people differently I guess but I wouldn’t say anxiety and depression are the only aspects. BPD is like being unhinged in a way. Very very small things can set you off in an instant I find. You don’t really care about someone’s faults if you like them. You’ll intentionally sabotage your own relationships without actually noticing what’s happening. You can’t get close to people because they’ll enviably hurt you and spread rumours about you. There are times where your in “the moment” and spend recklessly, takes risks you usually wouldn’t, and all around just be elevated I guess. I mean fingers crossed you’re dealing with something else less damaging, but even if you do have BPD fear not we can live normal lives. As long as you can harness that positive energy and work on your episodes when they inevitably happen it’s pretty quite manageable. There will be people that you make mistakes with and probably won’t want to talk to you again, but you’ll find a great group of support that understand how sometimes you don’t mean what you say! Hope it all works out for you, and don’t worry if you do have BPD because I think it’s something not to be ashamed of!",youngbizman,tgejoc

I have started seeing the imbalance with in some relationships and have confronted this imbalance. I haven’t been belligerent. 
The ruminating is an issue. I have an aggressive response on occasion but only on occasion has it been explosive. A few times a group of fellows picked a fight with me and that didn’t go well. It wasn’t like an explosion but a seething nastiness with deliberate intent to damage them. It wasn’t too bad. I still regulated. Betrayal and gossip is a trigger. I don’t know.

7,"I am not ashamed of the diagnosis. Just curious. Because I medical professional approaches me with their hypothesis doesn’t mean I always embrace it.  So I’m investigating what the degrees of BPD are. I don’t fit into the extreme descriptions I have read. 
I have many friendships but many have fallen apart these last 6 years. I have challenged their worth and the inequality of balance between the give and take with in the relationship. I don’t care that I have lost the ones I have. I have limited my interaction because I fear that imbalance and the resulting pain. The rumours are a new worry. But that is because they have come out of the woodwork and been placed right in front of me. I was enraged with the betrayal. 
My description of me is my resilient pool keeps leaking. I keep patching the holes and others keep poking through and that source of strength flows out. I have different reactions to events when that happened. I internalize a lot but sometime the fight trigger flays about and it can be destructive as it confronts that source of my discomfort. It’s a big injustice monster.  
I don’t fear being alone. I am alone alot. Loneliness can happen when there are people around. It when loneliness pokes through the resilient pool that I feel frantic. Then I obsess and ruminate about a million questions and their billion solutions. Even find myself talking in an imaginary conversation. I really like masks. Don’t seem as crazy in the outside world.

Official treatment is trauma therapy, cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, and maybe a little medication to help take the edge off. Anyone who meets any of the diagnostic criteria can and should do this. It isn't limited to the label. 

Or, you can post with a tag and be part of the cool kids club all over social media. I think there's even a specific BPD sub just for folks who have the official diagnosis and all they do all day is complain about people outside the club pretending to be in the club.",,11ap4ic
3,"I can understand the sentiment of the therapist. When I was teaching, my students would use diagnoses as excuses and I would tell them it didn’t matter what the issue was - we still have to learn to cope. (Not minimizing the diagnosis, just trying to help them work through it). Same thing here, as some others have commented. Heal the trauma, not the label. 

HOWEVER. I am in a similar boat with my adhd and one thing I’ve learned is that without a diagnosis, I can’t medication for that specific issue. So, we are looking at getting it. 

I also understand the desire to feel like you fit somewhere.  Labels can be freeing when not used as stumbling blocks. 

But…why do you say you don’t want to get better? From my point of view, that is using a diagnosis as not a stumbling block, but another brick in a wall you are building to prevent healing. I’m really sorry you don’t feel that desire right now. Remember, though, that you might not always feel that way. Does the therapist know this? I would probably say something similar to you if I was the therapist and did (but to be fair, I’d still help you find the answers you were looking for).

0,I think it’s super tricky. The way I understand BPD is that I was genetically predisposed to the disorder and the traumas of my childhood just turned the BPD switches in my brain to “on” but the tricky part is that those “on” switches can’t be turned to off. They’ve become dimmers and sometimes I can manage to dim the symptoms to the lowest setting and sometimes I have to focus exclusively on the switch that’s going haywire,subbbgrl,119nhwc

0,"There is no universal advice. My wife has been diagnosed a few years, but it was a long decade of troubles before we understood *why.*

Like you, just knowing that there’s a cause - putting a name to it - really does help with remaining supportive with my wife when she’s at her worst. 

But long before that I had developed some strategies that seem to have worked well to manage episodes. And mostly, it’s about de-escalation where possible (not much), but more about a lack of escalation on your part. 

When having an episode, she’s experiencing a storm of emotions. She needs a rock to cling to during that storm. You must be that rock. At least for us, that does the bulk of the work.

If you can let go of ego - and know that the things your wife says are not “her” - you can avoid having an emotional reaction in the moment that will escalate, rather than de-escalate the situation. Even if it does hurt, talk about it later. Not in the moment. 

I think this works really well not just in the moment but also in supporting long term treatment. BPD seems to be inherently due to neglect or abandonment, and those with BPD will often wind up pushing people away - if the other party has been pushed away, then the other party can’t leave *them*.  It’s called “splitting”, and it’s very much a “you can’t quit, you’re *fired*” line of thinking. 

She likely - whether she knows it or not - wound up where she is with BPD because of others in her life abandoning or neglecting her in some way - and often coupled with trauma of some kind. By being that rock in her storm, giving her nothing but unconditional love, never taking offence at her words, never giving her reason to think you’d leave - you can show through your actions that you will *never* abandon or neglect her. 

And one day, after she’s shown it time and time again, and maybe a few more times….and once more for good luck - she will start truly believing that her rock is stable and safe enough to build a life upon.

Be her rock. It’s not always easy. But it works.",neanderthalman,yxsb8h
1,"Tim,

Opposite of what ""Neanderthalman"" here has stated or advocated for I think it is also of equal (if not more) importance to put yourself first in this equation. Recognizing first and foremost that this isnt anything that you had a hand in creating or causing and that you are therefore by no means required to or responsible for solving it. Before you were married you did not know that she had or that she was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, not even she herself knew. 

You have a choice! It isnt required of you to have to constantly bend over backwards or turn the other cheek while your wife constantly loses her sh-t with you BPD or not her behavior is still not ok, especially if she is not aware of or willing to acknowledge it for what it is and seek appropriate treatment, (although it sounds like in your instance she is maybe hence the diagnosis.) Even with that being said or with that being the case please remember that ""you are never required to keep others warm by lighting yourself on fire."" You are every bit as worthy of health and happiness even if that means not agreeing to having to constantly be the ""rock"" in this woman's storm (which is really no one's responsibility but hers and hers alone.) -",Hot-Ship-8623,yxsb8h
2,"It would be great if you could educate youself about the disorder. Read a book. There are lots of books for the family members of the sick person. You could also go to therapy sessions with her - maybe the therapist can make you understand the sickness better and maybe he can help you with your challenges. If you really feel bad about it, maybe go to an external therapist (not the one your wife is at)

Keep in mind, that your wife is probably trying very hard to make things work out. Keep in mind, that you should keep your personal boundaries, for your wellbeing. It does no good, if you feel really bad and put all your energy into helping your wife. You can help her, whilst also setting boundaries. Find boundaries/ a middle ground. That will help her too, because as a borderliner, you often times cannot 'see' the middleground.",EntertainmentKey5301,yxsb8h

0,"Mine asked me as soon as I sat down, how do I feel, how's my family situation, any history or diagnoses. I study psychology and have a degree, so I told him I believed I had BPD and wanted to be properly assessed. He asked me about emotional reactions, relationships, self harm, and had me open up to him. 

Within 10 minutes I was gushing about everything, I ended up crying and telling him all of my paranoia and fear, telling him everything I could. If I remember correctly I told him ""I feel always so exaughsed, paranoid that everyone is going to hate me, leave me, or hurt me. I feel like there's paranoid bees in my brain and I can't get them to shut up!"" I remember that because idk what made me say I have bees in my brain but it certainly feels that way.

 Took 20 minutes or less and I left with a diagnosis of boarderline personality and PTSD, and pretty high doses of lamotrigine and seraquell, and an appointment card to see a DMT therapist for recovery. 

All in all, it felt soooo good to take down my walls and get help, knowing he can help me. Anxiety went away very quickly because I knew I needed help. Once I opened up I felt liberated, it was very quick. And a skilled psychiatrist will know exactly what to ask and how to handle your anxiety. Trust them. When I did, I felt so good, I felt heard, I felt understood, and I felt I'm gonna get better. And I slowly am!

Tips: be VERY VERY honest, take your masks off, that psychiatrist is your life line and needs to know EVERYTHING. it's gonna feel very emotional but you have to let them see behind your masks it's VERY important to tell them the truth about everything you feel! Anything you hide from yourself and others, they need to know. Don't be afraid of them, don't hide, you need their help. It's hard to get past the feeling of them rejecting you as a person if you have BPD but you MUST fight that, you MUST be honest ENTIRELY. BPD can be misdiagnosed as alot of things and you can have BPD traits yet have a different diagnosis. Medication and type of therapy is decided based on what you say to them so they need to know the blatant truth in order to find a correct diagnosis.

Soon after my sibling took me to Psychiatrist as she thought it could be a brain issue and they're more qualified to treat it, 1 hour in and I got diagnosed with moderate depression and got medications; as I told before I was afraid of meds because I thought I'd overdose myself. Infact most of those thoughts came from different sub reddits; it was really unhelpful and sometimes reddit causes more trouble than good. My Psychiatrist did refer me to a different psychologist; same time my current psychologist threw me off for a whole month and told me to just deal with my issues out of the blue. I finally broke down before my final year exams and decided to give the new psychologist a shot, my sibling told me to be completely honest and straightforward since it would really help me even if they're horrible and adviced me a lot.

2-3 sessions in, he gave me some questionnaires and gave emergency sessions since I was in a really extreme state; got diagnosed with BPD and I had some answers. I never knew something like this existed, I was aware of bipolar disorders and more of psychiatry disorders, but personality disorders were new to me and it all made sense. It was really hard to bear through all of it but over time I finally came into terms with it and realized everyone in my life just made me feel horrible about my existence when it wasn't my fault. My psychologist is well versed in BPD and most of his patients had them, so I was in good hands. Overall, I dropped out of college for an year and tried to survive, 6 months in I saw a lot of changes and was one of his patients who did very well. It's been an year and a half since I got diagnosed and I've even stopped medications and reduced the visits; I finally can handle my life with BPD to a certain extent and also go to regular sessions so I can learn more about how to deal with life in general.

Honestly, after all this I've gotten a positive perspective of BPD, even though it's painful and sometimes makes no sense I'm glad I didn't give up, unlearning my past behaviour takes a lot of time but it's very rewarding; after 22 years I finally started being genuinely happy for the first time after all this trauma and I'm thankful for it. I don't care if people think I wasted an year of my life, I do not wish to correct them either.

I've now had uncountable appointments with him since then, he went by past medical records to which show a history of BPD traits. Since I've been seeing him so long its 100% a complete diagnosis. Some psychiatrists will tell you first what they believe you have, the 20 minutes appointment, then test their theory of the diagnosis in the next few total visits. 

For example I received a COMPLETED diagnosis in March 2021 by then I had had several appointments with him and the therapist, got paperwork, and they're currently still slowly upping my medicine to find the sweet spot dose. Some patients are way easier than others due to intensity of symptoms and mannerisms, the fact that I took my ""mask"" off and came clean like I did made the first appointment significantly easier for him to spot all of the symptoms.

So if it's not genetics and you know that your trauma(s) come from your dad, then yes it's probably his fault. But I'm not sure if resenting someone for your whole life and blaming them for every aspects of your life is very healthy. I know I have troubles not doing it, so I'm not trying to patronize you here. I guess one day I just figured that what happened to me sucks and it made me who I am, but hating people just drains so much energy from me.

12,"So I’ve been through a lot of trauma as a kid but I’ve never had any diagnosis. As an adult, I’ve always maintained healthy relships, very logical, and Im quite successful at work. However, I feel that the only reason why I didn’t end up having any disorders is cz I kinda learned at a young age to practice this so called mindfulness. And yes, perhaps without being taught about it. I just remember as a kid crying in tears alone at home talking to myself to box my thoughts. I’d quietly do my pros and cons of what is happening in my life and categorize those that I can control and those I cannot. If someone else brought it on me (beating me up, my mom abandoning me for days, family not having any food at home), then I’d talk myself out of self-pitying and just find a solution (laugh it off with my bruises and draw on them, seek friends out when my mom would leave me, and ask others for food when hungry). This happened weekly cz my mom was very unstable. I tried to justify every bad event in my life and only took responsibility for things that I caused. Idk if it’s the same as mindfulness but I strive off of logic right now. When people bother or hurt me, I turn to my logic. When something happens to me (like not having tuition money or a car accident), I turn to problem solving. Maybe it’s why I barely cry. I’ve learned that it was pointless. I’d consider what I did a practice of mindfulness. But I could be wrong. After all, it’s just my own experience that I am using to conclude all these thoughts anyways.

14,See when I read stories like this & I feel bad for even admitting my issues cause my childhood can't even be compared to this. But it's quite obvious I have BPD when I read the symptom list it's like a blueprint of my life. My best friend who I no longer am in contact with would constantly belittle any problem in my life & say I was a baby or a princess & always compared our lives. My counselor has to constantly say just because ur trauma isn't as bad as someone else's doesn't mean it isn't trauma. But I just feel so dumb when I think about my last compared to others.,spngal,93p100

But I dunno I feel like he doesn't accept me... I think I'm gonna answer to him, writing this made my eyes tear a little.

16,"So I think your best friend is just not informed about the topic. Before my wife and I found out that she has BP, she didn’t make sense to me either. Funny cz she was also a baby and a princess so I truly had the same thoughts as your bff. I always told my wife that she complained too much or she didn’t try hard enough or she just wasn’t disciplined. However, as soon as we heard of the diagnosis and I read up like A LOT on it, I slowly began to see where she was coming from. That she just wasn’t acting like a kid - her emotional maturity didn’t fully develop so she simply DID have the EQ of a kid. That opened my eyes and made a bit more compassionate. I still don’t know if I can deal with my partner for the rest of our lives. But for now, I’m trying to understand her symptoms instead of just reacting to it. 

I hope your best friend turns around and find more information before judging. ",,93p100
17,Wow well I'm glad talking about it helped u. I haven't told my dad about my diagnosis cause I know I won't be able to stop myself from freaking out on him. My dad hurt me & continues to & he seems to have an inability to apologize. He just points it all back at me & says I'm a whore & hard to love. But maybe if he had been a good dad & showed me love I wouldn't have looked for it with men. ,spngal,93p100
18,"No shes actually gotten much worse. We dont speak & I was just diagnosed last Tuesday so she has no idea I have this. The way she is she would probably say its BS. She literally LITERALLY thinks she has had the worst life of anyone. She thinks her life was never meant to be happy. I look at it as everyone is on their own path & we all handle things differently. I've always been very soft hearted I don't think my EQ is immature I think I'm just soft hearted & sensitive. I couldn't watch anything even remotely scary as a kid... for example the tree from pocahontas scared me, & jafar from Aladdin. & idk just always been just so so sensitive to everything around me. & I still am to this day honestly I can't watch any movies that are like torture at all cause the scenes stay in my mind & i feel pain in my body where the character would be feeling it. Idk I guess most new agey people would say I'm an empath but idk lol",spngal,93p100
19,"Only you know your dad and your relationship with him. Maybe telling him would make him understand more why you act the way that you do. My dad doesn't believe me and thinks the doctors are wrong, but he's a psychologist and has a strong ego. So he's sure that I'm not, even if technically you can't diagnose your own daughter. Anyway, that's just for me, maybe your dad will be more understanding. Maybe if you tell him, he's gonna look at himself and realise the wrong he did to you? I don't know, some people act very mean someday, someone points out what they did and they just realise it.",,93p100
20,"My wife is the same! She’s gets extremely frightened of any scary movies. She would even have nightmares! She can’t handle haunted houses and a lot of things scare her. One time she can’t sleep so I showed her this ASMR YouTube video that had a girl whispering calming sentences to you. As soon as she heard, she freaked out. Like serious freak out so I had to hug her tight. 
Good riddance to your best fiend. I can’t stand people who compare their sufferings. Trauma is trauma. You’re better off without her anyways. ",,93p100

22,"Agreed. That is not even 1% of the issues we had in our friendship. I am not that extreme I can handle scary movies I just cannot watch torture stuff like saw or anything like that. I love the conjuring & insidious just have to watch during the day. I would say I think i have mild BPD cause i recognize when i do crap & dont allow myself to do it. Like my bf upset me & I felt like he might leave so I started to shut off but I recognized it & didnt allow myself to do it. Tbh other people on here seem to have it much worse than me. That's why I say now that I get myself I feel like I can control myself better. But others say their diagnosis leads them to make excuses but I dont see it that way at all. I dont want to be labeled as ""crazy"" & my bf has dealt with 2 past gfs with bi polar so I just want to be as normal as possible for him.",spngal,93p100

24,That's scary. I would hate to see a marriage fail but I know its tiring when things feel uneven effort-wise. That is what I never want to be to my bf is a burden or someone who makes it all about her. He had a tragic loss & trauma at a young age so he needs me to be there for him sometimes too.

I love her so much but if things don’t get better with words she throw at me or how she guilt-trips me or emotionally blackmail me or project her frustrations in life at me or tells me I don’t care and I’m selfish only to come back and apologize profusely and then do it all over again, I will belong to the high divorce statistics.

30,That's very very sad to me. I hope & pray she can work things out.,spngal,93p100
31,But some people see it as they already gotcha so why bother. I hope that isn't her attitude. Have u expressed how dire things really are or is this all within yourself that ur considering divorce.

IMO, if he didn’t take out his wallet, I’d just end up paying cz it’s such an awkward position to be in! All she had to tell him is “hey you’re gonna get driven around tomorrow but make sure you bring money okay”. Then it would’ve been all done right? But ya, no. ",,93p100

As with all mental health, it helps a lot to have emotional support. Now, everybody with bpd are different, but from my own experience, it helps to talk about difficult situations and difficult behaviour, in order to get to the root of the issue.  

What I ask from my partner is to give me reality checks, and help me to recognize when the crazy comes on, so I can stop myself. 

Medication is not an answer for me, though it has helped me through some difficult periods. 

I feel I have come a long way, just by working on myself and getting feedback from my partner. It is hard work, but it can get better.

1,"I can recommend you both the book borderline personality disorder for dummies. It's written in clear language what bpd is with examples but also has some info about how to deal with it. It's gonna be a though ride but do never forget you are not her therapist, you are her partner. And have boundaries, without you will get/be lost. 

I have bpd and depression. I do have medication, anti depressant and without I would be dead or in a really bad place. I've tried without two years ago (because even at 50 my stupid bpd mind thinks it knows better then my own mind) and it was not a succes, it almost ruined my life.
And if you continue, see if you can find  a group somewhere, on the web or live, of people who are living / dealing with bpd partners/children so you can talk, get maybe some guidelines 

But don't you ever stay in the relationship because she tried or threaten to kill herself. You are worth more than being manipulated in a relationship that can be toxic. But that's something for the future, I hope it will not come that far but I also know we (bpd) are hard to handle, we have a problem living with ourself let alone how someone else could live with or like us. 

But there are also positive sides. We are quite funny, playful (a lot of us still feel 16 (me) or 18 even when we are ""old""), loyal, spontaneous, and we show our emotions (positive and negative). And most of us are animal/nature lovers.

6,"Is awesome you’re coming here to get advice before you proceed, that’s really responsible.

However, I advise you to take some time to think about this. This sounds like a really codependent relationship based in a trauma bond. You broke up with her for a reason, and a diagnosis alone isn’t going to change things. It may explain it, but it will still be a chaotic rollercoaster. DBT is the “gold standard” of treatment along with individual sessions, and this will probably be a life long journey for her, with both periods of advancement and recession to be expected. There are no drugs for the treatment of BPD, however drugs can treat co morbid illnesses like depression, bipolar or anxiety.

I don’t know your partner, but I can say this: when my partners have given me what I want after destructive (to myself or others), it validates the behavior. There’s a very fine line between enabling and supporting. It’s not to say she necessarily intentionally used this as a manipulation tactic, because our emotions run so incredibly high, especially under threat of being left.

There is a lot of great reward to being in a relationship with someone who has BPD. Its going to be filled with fierce passion, love and commitment but also a ton of work, get your own support. Seriously, get your own therapist. You will really benefit from this. And if you can, even if it’s only monthly, get a couples therapist. It’s nice to have a safe space of a backboard together.

I think it’s most important to hold her accountable, she’s gotta grow and learn. The more this behavior is tolerated and rewarded, the less likely she is to become more self sufficient. Firm, but kindly stated boundaries are going to be critical. We’ve already demolished one big boundary with this refusal to accept the breakup, so you’ve got to make it clear this can not continue to happen.

All in, you are responsible for yourself only. Remember that, only she can save herself. The first step of recovery is a diagnosis and a desire to start learning, then healing!

The only problem with writing it down the way you did is that it hurts us, it is already very difficult for us to say we have bpd because of the enormous stigma that comes with it and I think everyone would be better of if ghat stigma would be gone. If you write about it, please write about your experience, write it from your point of view. Not like you did now, as if it is common knowledge. Maybe one of the ""problems"" with bpd is that everyone who has it reacts different. You can't easily compare us to each other. Indeed there are guidelines, we can get therapy, there are medications to take the edge of things and to mellow us a bit but it doesn't work for all of us. And many times bpd goes hand in hand wit another illness like depression. And if depression is not treated well bpd gets worse.

Also, bpd can be passed on from parent to child just like depression but a lot of people with bpd developed bpd as a coping mechanism from when they were children in an either toxic upbringing or got traumatic experience(s). Bpd served a purpose back then and it worked well, the only problem is that it doesn't work well when you are reaching adulthood. It starts to backfire.

25,"I came here to agree with your response!

I study psychology,  have BPD and am in therapy receiving dbt (and CBT for GAD) and I can wholehearetedly agree that pills were detrimental to my recovery. 

Having done a lot of research I found many papers that support the notion that medication for bpd can actually be dangerous and can causes a greater risk for suicide. Plus the fact that BPD is 'manageable' with time, effort, accpetance and dedication. That said, the one time it is seen as beneficial, is when someone is so low and in such a bad headspace that medicating them will give them the strength to seek and attend therapy and then for their therapist to help them develop enough skills to safely ween off of the medication.

But most importantly every person is unique in their own strengths and weaknesses and there is no 'one size fits all' solution. What works for one, may not work for another. 

Suggesting that a relationship is only really feasible if medicated is unrealistic.  My last relationship ended when I was on my highest dose of medication.  I was overweight,  i was miserable and I just kept waiting for stronger meds to save me. My current relationship started with no medication and whilst in therapy (still am in therapy) and has remained that way for coming up to two years now.

30,">medication is often not effective and the best course with the most data to support living a normal life is dbt

Those are both true, and medication is generally shown to be less effective for pwBPD, for example antidepressants are more effective for treating major depression than improving depressive symptoms for someone with BPD. Further it's shown that adding DBT (or other valid treatment, and there are a few) is often key to progress, or enhancing medication approaches.

I see a lot of people with very dark outlooks on BPD on this sub, and it is quite a shame. I have only my own experience, but as I know I have come a long way, I know other people can do the same. 

Not to brag or anything, but I doubt most people with BPD has fucked up and been as fucked up as me, so if I can go from being basically ferrel, to becoming a productive member of society, I am sure that others can do the same.",SmackMyCakeUp,kpir0c

We can be fun to be around, we are spontaneous and all but unfortunately we are also quite spontaneous on the emotional and angry spectrum. And me, as a person with bpd, am still amazed there are men and women strong enough to stay with us. Because it is a battle and it can be a lot of walking on eggshells but as long as they don't go under and still have their own life they can manage.

And I do agree with the fact you can be born with it, it happened to me, family full with depressions, bpd, bi polar, etc. So easy choice for me, no children cause I don't want them to be like me or the youth I had. But there are a big part of bpd who develop it during their first 10 years and I also believe there are a lot of (specifically women) who are diagnosed with bpd but have ptsd instead.

0,"I'd try Buddha and the Borderline. It's written by the woman who created DBT therapy, which targets BPD. It doesn't have some grandiose happy ending, she's a work in progress through and through and that doesn't change, but she finds acceptance with herself. 
It does have a lot of mention of drugs and unsafe behaviors. I have quiet bpd so while these parts didn't resonate with me, a lot of her emotional states did. 

The more I've been in groups, reddit, etc for bpd, the more I understand that everyone is so, so different. I've been in a relationship for 11 years. I don't exhibit reckless behavior, but I do struggle with my emotions and outbursts, but only in times of stress. I'm on medication (lamictal) and I've been through dbt therapy, and I'm in cbt, and then I'm going into ptsd therapy (sounds like you don't need the latter).

Good journey for us 🥂",aluap_mia,w7ay8i
3,"I (24f) can completely empathize. I share a kindle library with my mom, and a couple weeks after telling my parents about my diagnosis, I noticed a book appear in my kindle library: “Stop Walking on Eggshells.” It’s similar to the book you were recommended. My blood ran cold, and I wondered, “Does my mom feel like she’s walking on egg shells around me?!” I felt like it was my duty to read the book to better understand ways I could be hurting people. It ended up not really being about me but another family member, but reading the book was still very painful. 

Some books are DEFINITELY intended for people who have been hurt by people with BPD, not the person with BPD themselves, and they can be very difficult and painful to read. It was highly irresponsible of your psychiatrist to recommend that book to you. Yet some online content for loved ones of BPD is problematic in a different way.

For me, I have BPD—but someone in my family also has it and has been very emotionally abusive as a result. I’m convinced I developed BPD in reaction to this person. So for me, I have been on both sides—the perpetrator taking a romantic partner on a wild ride and the victim who was gaslit and turned into an emotional punching bag.

The book you read may not apply to you very well, but it applies to some people with BPD. And people who have been deeply hurt by those with BPD deserve to get the validation they need to begin to heal. It is a reality that our disorder has a big potential to hurt others. AND—information intended for victims is not very helpful to someone with BPD. 

1: BPD is VERY TREATABLE. DBT therapy was developed especially for BPD. You can buy a workbook and start teaching DBT skills to yourself. Very effective.
2: Check out the book Running on Empty: Overcoming Childhood Emotional Neglect. It gives a framework for how a child with a loving, happy family and good childhood can still end up with trauma as an adult. I like you have a loving and happy family, and this book helped me open my eyes to how I ended up with BPD regardless. Highly highly recommend! 
3: You absolutely can develop beautiful and amazing romantic relationships. I would recommend the book How to Avoid Falling in Love with a Jerk. It’s chock full of evidence based tips to find someone compatible who is emotionally healthy. It covers common unhealthy dynamics, why we sometimes are attracted to people that are bad for us, red flags, and green flags to look out for as well. It’s FASCINATING and EXTREMELY practical and useful. 
4: To get a rock solid understanding of how to have healthy relationships, check out John Gottman’s 7 Principles. He’s the world’s foremost relationship researcher. He doesn’t just study unhappy couples but happy ones. He has identified 7 principles that ALL happy couples keep. Reading his books helped me to understand better how to be a good partner and what to look for in a partner as well.",PlatypusDouble2331,w7ay8i
4,"Well I definitely don’t want to read that book!

What is helping me in my current stage is a quiet space where I can truly reflect on myself and things I need to work on.

I’d say meditation and other calming activities can help too. BPD is lacking control of emotions so learning to better control emotions is a good place to start.

I’ve also learned BPD is very different for everyone. Until I came to Reddit; I didn’t know BPD was literally in direct comparison to some other awful personality disorders and I don’t feel like an awful monster like I’ve seen some people say… 

It’s been hard to see for sure but I’m not going to read into it because we are who we make ourselves into be! I want to be a kind and loving human who constantly works on myself to be the best me I can be! Will I fail sometimes? Absolutely. That isn’t due to my personality but because I am human.

1,"I was misdiagnosed for 18 years. At 15 my symptoms started and the first psychiatrist my parents took me to diagnosed me (unbeknownst to me) as borderline, but told my parents that I “was too young & didn’t fit the mould”. I never knew this discussion happened. I left there that day diagnosed as bipolar. I was on a myriad of different medications over the next 18 years (more than 20 kinds) but mostly Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Abilify.  I never truly spent much time in therapy asbit was though that my cause was chemical so I was always just put on medication. Anyway, my life has not been entirely horrific but it’s very sad to admit that my dreams & goals were never reached, I could never finish anything I started and the manic episodes over the years were bad but the depression was all consuming. Looking back they weren’t manic episodes just breakdowns and highs from substance abuse. When I was 30 I had been unemployed for 6 years & at rock bottom. I asked my parents to help me with assisted suicide, the emptiness I had every day was just too much. I didn’t want to die but I didn’t want to live either. Anyway so soon after I end up in a new psychiatric hospital (one I hadn’t been to yet) and I was admitted for 3 weeks and placed with a psychiatrist that apparently was the pro in female mental health especially bpd. I was diagnosed that day after a few hours and i was placed on the correct meds for the first time in my life and also started behavioral therapy the next day. It’s now 6 years later & I’ve almost completely outgrown BPD. It used to be a death sentence back in the day when i was 15 (probably why that doc didn’t want to “go” with a bpd diagnosis). I have a great job and a flourishing career, I’m happy, I can look after myself. Only thing I still really struggle with is my emotion regulation & interpersonal relationships but I am still healing. I still see my psychiatrist and psychologist and they are always so proud of me. I am on Lithium, Dopaquel & Trazadone. There is hope!!! Make sure you get to the right doc and don’t let them put you on SSRIs. Therapy is extremely important! Try suggesting Lithium, it was a game changer for me.",PurnimaTitha,u1ztco
2,"while the label is very helpful in knowing where to begin things like behavior modification or therapy, the medications are tricky, not one size fits all, and often used off label. so I wouldn't worry that you'd been diagnosed without being informed or anything. i'd assume they just heard you describe your symptoms and tried to best alleviate them according to their knowledge of current medications, or prescribed it based on your reaction to another medication.",,u1ztco
3,"exactly!! i agree wholeheartedly; i’ve heard a few people diagnosed with BPD say they don’t understand why “everyone is in such a rush to get diagnosed” and “they must want a label, i hate labels” like okay that’s all fine and dandy but i’ve spent so many years suffering and being told by my parents that im overreacting, being irrational etc. but at the same time they will say there’s nothing wrong with me. i have been told by my high school guidance counselor to stop coming to her office because i took up too much of her time and she couldn’t do anything for me after a certain point. when i was in high school, i missed so many days because of various reasons, but all of them boiled down to having extreme emotional meltdowns i could not control. so many days i left school early because an abusive ex would break up with me in the middle of the day, and since i cannot handle the fear of abandonment, i would start crying and would not be able to stop. anyways, i 100% agree with you, now that i actually know what is wrong & it doesn’t sound farfetched, it is freeing in a way! you don’t have to reply to this, i got confusing and rambly, thank you for reading my post & commenting!",jessedarko,u1ztco
4,"Oh wow I feel exactly like this! And please don't worry about rambling <3 You're fine, if I'm speaking I talk really fast and really constantly lol.

I had a really dark homelife, part of that was they controlled what therapy I could and couldn't do (it's complicated but they didn't want me talking about certain things) so I ended up with a worthless diag and new core traumas about being hospitalized. So for *decades* everything I did seek out centered around drug addiction, even though I could just stop getting high for years and not care. 

My current diagnosis is CPTSD, BPD, and DID. For years I dealt with nasty symptoms of all that mixed together, but with no idea of what was happening to me! ""I am batsh** insane"" was the *best* answer I had. 

I did everything wrong, because I never understood what I was actually dealing with. I shut alters out, tried to just suppress and sublimate ALL of my feelings to be someone's Perfect gf, and I stayed in close contact with some of my worst abusers. None of that ended well *at all*.

I think it's fine to not want a label, but to me that's not really what a diagnosis is. It's more a snapshot of where I'm at right now than some defining thing like what color my eyes are. I'll always be a DID system, but I could go the rest of my life with no new amnesia, which symptomatically is more like OSDD. Allegedly meds and DBT therapy can help me mitigate BPD symptoms until the diag has to be re-evaluated, so the diagnosis itself may be removed (I wouldn't use the word 'cured' as much as 'asymptomatic'). And so on. So to me it's more like ""these are the symptoms you currently experience"" and therefore ""these are specific things to treat"".

It's like, I wasted so much of my life being crazy, having episodes, making dumb choices (ESPECIALLY about partners), that now I feel like I could have avoided. That's why the diag is so important to me, I don't want to lose any more years.

Medications seem to be hit or miss depending on the patient. But some with extreme BPD have a dopamine deficiency. I was prescribed a stimulant which actually slowed me down and made me less impulsive. Because it was supplying dopamine already. I have been on Aripiprazole to help with impulse control but I have not noticed much of a change. Weekly therapy, medication, a positive “I’m not going to let BPD own me” approach did wonders for me.

But since then (2018-ish) I’ve started to  see some of the things I do and now I know the why behind my actions, which has allowed me to give myself a little more grace. I’m trying hard to shift my thinking from berating myself to thinking what I would say to someone who was feeling how I was. The reality is it would break my heart to hear someone say some of the things I say about/to myself. So I guess what I’m trying to say is even though it sucks knowing you have BPD, being aware and starting to learn about it and yourself has really helped me start the healing process. Whatever decision is for you, I wish you the best in your journey.",Complete_Medium_3906,155ornv

5,"I feel better knowing but maybe only because I already hate myself so much that it doesn't really make anything worse. And gives me a basis for treatment because therapy has always felt wildly ineffective for me besides naming what's wrong with me and my other diagnoses. Also because I sort of found out before my therapist did, through my own research, because I haven't had just one good stable therapist for 10 years now. So no one has gotten to know me that well. So I had a sort of self-informed warning and it wasn't sprung on me by someone who has been studying me for weeks/months/years. I would think that aspect could be pretty triggering for a person with borderline. 

Tbf I have had moments recently though where it really weighed heavy on me, I guess more statistically knowing about various ways my life could end up going knowing I meet the criteria for this thing. 

Maybe something about the proof that I'm so fucked up makes me feel powerful? Or like special because I've been so neglected by every important adult in my life and it's proof that I was actually neglected. Because neglect is so subtle looking in from the outside à it's easy to dismiss it if you're not informed about its effects.",soipunchdallthebzzrs,155ornv

3,"I came across both BPD and complex ptsd some point last summer. I got into therapy and told her I had one of these, and she needed to figure out which one it was. She diagnosed me with only cptsd. A few months later my husband tried to abandon me for an entire month, and I know all my symptoms were extremely noticeable. She dropped me shortly later and started giving me names of psychiatrist, so I knew something was up. 

I started googling BPD even more, and found a videos by Dr. Fox and Dr. Ramani on YouTube. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=to5qRLRSS7g&t=168s  my mother, husband (husband came back a month later the night I retained a lawyer actually), and I all watched this video and said I meet all 9. I asked my PCP to refer me to a psychiatrist, and she did. My husband and I went to my first appointment and told her we felt with certainty I had BPD. We went through all 9 of the criteria and what behaviors and stuff lead us to believe it. And we were right. 

It’s interesting because I went back to Pinterest in my saved quotes, and 8 years ago I was pinning stuff about BPD having no idea what it was but recognizing myself in those quotes.",wovenriddles,p7j1su

When I was in the hospital the team there said it was likely, and then when I entered an IOP the team there said I met the criteria. From there they got me into a DBT IOP program, and dbt is supposed to be some of the best treatment you can get for BPD. If you feel like you have BPD, then I'm sure DBT will be relevant to you (even if eventually a doctor doesnt think you have it). Ask your doctor or therapists if there are any local DBT groups. There are individual therapists who are licensed in DBT too. I have friends who are in longer term DBT group therapy. I hope there are some options in your area! Do some relentless digging.

I had always heard that I was bipolar but didn't know/get diagnosed with/about this personality disorder until my 30s.

0,"The easiest solution I can think of is to start with treatment for CPTSD, which will help with the major emotional dysregulation, while not containing the perceived blame of a BPD diagnosis.

A person with BPD has essentially had their emotions gaslit their entire lives.  From the subjective point of view, of a person with BPD, the conclusions that they are reaching make sense because their nervous system and brain are working together to form a conclusion, even if it is not correct. So to directly contradict their point of view will feel like gaslighting to them. To make this even more confusing often people who have BPD have legitimately been Gaslit and taken advantage of in the past by being deceived or otherwise betrayed.


I unfortunately can’t offer more than suggesting to her that she may have CPTSD, because she probably does, and if she is able to better manage her emotions with your validation, she may be able to get to the point of not immediately jumping to blame. 

This is also a common tip, but talk to her about your feelings and needs when she is not dysregulated. You are your own person and can only support so much, and it is entirely valid for you to set boundaries in the relationship. But start very small and be consistent in your validation of her but solid in your own personal boundaries in what behavior you will, and will not accept.

I hope that helps",dookiehat,1648e61

My husband didn't do half the work it appears you have done which is a credit to you and a concern. I hear from your message how hard it's been, I suspect you may be carrying a lot of trauma that will also have to be addressed if you want to get a ""normal"" relationship.

Even though it was nice for a moment to know that I wasn't crazy, that there are other people who think the way I do and that it's a thing that I can put a name to and hopefully treat. I was sad.

I have to live with the repercussions of other people's decisions for the rest of my life.

My thinking is better now, easier for sure. You asked another commenter how they learn to accept themselves and whilst I can't speak for them, I can say that it takes time. I've learnt to forgive myself for my past actions, esp when I was undiagnosed. Did you know that we tend to be more creative? and bold? and empathetic?

A way my therapist described it was like I wore my emotions like a coat (on the outside where it was extra senstive to other peoples emotions) meaning I just was sensitive. This helped but I still struggle with this negative view of BPD.

I don't have a close relationship with my psychiatrist which is why my therapist helped me to start getting evaluated. I basically walked through the same list with my psychiatrist and she had me do a few questionnaires for bipolar and borderline symptoms.",gsofa93,nts9z2

But, we can fix it.   It's not easy and takes time but, we can make life worth living.

My life fell apart 2 years ago.  Wife left me, lost my house, lost every friend o ever had.  

Much like everyone here I thought my life was over and I tried to end it...

Somehow I didn't die. 

Fast forward 2 years, I've been doing DBT phsycotherapy for over a year and I'm on mood stabilizers and I'm a different person.

In a good way.

I'm able to deal with life now, still is hard but we can arm ourselves with the right tools to make us lead better lives.

We (bpd) are amazing people,smart, creative,  loving, empathetic,  loyal.   We are like super heroes.

1,"Hey I’ve just been referred to adult mental health services for a formal diagnosis. It took me 18 months to access therapy for anxiety. Are you currently working? My GP advised me to go through my companies Employee Assistance Programme as it’s quicker. Have you looked at psychiatrists on the BACP website? Some are £30-£40 an hour, I’m not too sure of your financial situation. There are also charities offering services. I’m not too sure if turning point operates in your area",,rsvajf
2,"Congrats! You already had a problem, you just didn’t know what it was. 

Now you know. The enemy has a name now. You have to name it before you can tame it. So many of us spend years (or decades) mis-diagnosed, and getting the wrong treatments as a result. Trust me, this is a positive development. 

You have a long path ahead. Take your time to cry, get mad an generally pout. Seriously. When that’s out of your system start building your strength again and start thinking strategy. 

Definitely take the meds they prescribe you. That’s a very key part of getting this under control. Whatever you hangups are…hang them up. They won’t help you here. 

DBT therapy is a game changer, and you can find lots of information about it for free. 

In time you’ll become stronger, wiser, more compassionate. Probably more than the non-BPD people you know. Look up Kintsugi, this is a therapeutic concept for me. 

Good luck!",chad4life,rsvajf

I'm an introvert with high IQ and BPD, I feel alone almost all the time in my life. But I need to remind myself that it is just feeling. Even if it is a strong one.

Some of my best advice as someone who lives a functional life:

Make sure life around you is stable as you can make it. As soon as life gets chaotic it’s easy to throw more chaos in. I keep a slightly loose routine which lets me have fun but keeps my life structured.

You have a life and a standard for happiness do not compromise it for an FP

Dont kill your self today you can do that tomorrow.

Don’t make this personality disorder your whole identity. Life if normal for me. I have my normal. I don’t walk around like something is always wrong with me. I learned my behavior and how my mind works and I act accordingly. I never bring my BPD up in conversation because I don’t need to.

You can go above and beyond expectations but not to infinity and beyond. Don’t constantly pour love into people that pour nothing into you. It is very useful to recognize when your obsessing.

You’re not a monster or an abuser. You a person who’s perspective cant be understood.

Update: just another I thought of. If you can catch yourself splitting do it and take steps back and try to logically convince yourself of what is actually going on. Taking a step back has saved a lot of relationships with friends that I was ready to burn the bridge with.",captintummywummy,uq28q1
1,"Thank you for your words. 

One question though, what does FP mean in this situation?

Also, I will say, it’d be hard for me to want to make borderline my whole identity, given that I have many other comorbidities 😅 So hey, guess that keeps me from doing so, as a positive. 
Honestly, I don’t think I could let it define my identity even without those things. Maybe I’ve used it to analyze my social/relationship obsessions (since as an ADHDer I have hyper-fixations and with Autism comes special interests, you kinda learn the differences in yourself over time) and one of the many reasons why I’m struggling to figure out what I want with my relationship life, but I know it’s not the sole reason for those things nor what will define those areas in my life for me forever. 

I kinda wanna follow my own advice I have for my older sister, since she used to be getting treatment for her BPD and comorbidities after she first was hospitalized and tried to kill herself, but she stubbornly stopped, getting off all medication and not seeing professionals (she started seeing a therapist again for a few years after our mother planted the idea in her head to make her feel like it was her own, but then she stopped again). And whilst she’s caused a good deal of hurt for the family, I recognize that she’s hurting herself most of all by not trying to work on it in healthy ways and just push through without help. And I wished she’d get the help she needs, not necessarily for others, but for herself. 
So that’s why I made sure to secure myself a therapist and psychiatrist, even got approved for moderate to severe care, since I had only been at mild to moderate before. I’ve been open minded about medications as well, willing to get back on antidepressants if need be, even though it’s one of the last things I wanted. (My psych decided not to though, just in case I have a bipolar disorder and the antidepressant triggers mania)
With all my mental health issues, I try not to use them as scapegoats to get me out of my biggest mistakes and screw up with the idea of “it explains, but does not excuse.”

With the “don’t kill yourself today” line, it actually reminds me of my first tattoo and it’s meaning: “you can make it through another day.” It was based off something I said to myself during a day of grieving where I told myself “just make it through the day,” since I had a long day, do it was me telling myself “you can cry all you like when you get home, but just make it until you get there.”
I’ve always been a really big masker, and so often my issues fell through the cracks and went unnoticed. I’ve got the bad habit of internalizing and isolating myself rather than yelling and starting fights. The moment I recognize I’m angry and feeling hostile, I disengage and separate myself, but then it festers inside and turns to resentment. I probably learned to do that due to my sister being the opposite, always yelling and screaming at us.",TheDerangedRoyalFae,uq28q1

""My husband says that's likely how life feels dull relative to my extreme highs I experience""
Honestly, it is. BUT if you get the mood stabilizers and sit with them for awhile you can still feel. I'm going down on mine now.

Medication, DBT, and a truama informed DBT personal therapist helped a lot. I really think the mix saved my life. I hit rock bottom 2 years ago and it took awhile to dig out.

Fine baseline first, meds are a good help with that. Remember that they take time, its a slow journey with them. Don't randomly stop them without calling your doctor first.

Talking to people with similar struggles (Like this sub and my DBT group) helped me so much. You arent alone, there are people who get it, and there is help out there.",Dream_Thembo,14g3a3q
1,"It's great to hear that you have found healthcare workers who are dedicated to helping you and that medication like prazosin is making a positive impact on you. 
As for mood stabilizers, it's important to remember that everyone's experience with medication is different and finding the right combination of treatments can take time. If you are hesitant to try mood stabilizers, you can talk to your doctor about other options such as therapy or natural remedies like exercise and meditation that may help with mood stabilization. 
It's great that deleting social media from your phone has had a positive impact on you and your mental health. Keep exploring different ways to distract yourself from posting slutty pics or having mixed conversations online with people, and instead focus on activities that make you feel good about yourself, like reading a book or taking a walk outside. 
In terms of resources for someone newly diagnosed, I would recommend looking into support groups or online forums where you can connect with others who share similar experiences. You can also reach out to your healthcare workers for recommendations on resources that may be helpful for you. 
If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Take care and remember to be gentle with yourself.",Thefoodiemaniac,14g3a3q

I talked to a psychiatrist about it early this year, and she almost immediately diagnosed me with BPD without even talking to me for more than a single 45 minute session :/ I do match up with the criteria for BPD, but I also feel like it was a misdiagnosis sometimes because of how quickly she decided I definitely had it🥲

I just wish it hadn't taken so long! 😓😂",,o2zbpv
2,"Hi 🙋🏻‍♀️ can we be friends lol
I too just got diagnosed with BPD, also OCD on top of adhd, major depressive disorder, and ptsd.
It's so overwhelming and relieving all at once to know.
I start therapy mid July. And Effexor XR tmrw. What is your treatment plan?",darielmac,o2zbpv
3,I hope this journey goes well for you 💕,darielmac,o2zbpv
4,"I also just got diagnosed, and i totally feel you. Before i got the diagnose i kinda knew, but suddenly it was just a reality. I felt both happy, hopeful, frustrated and scared at the same time. And i am still processing. But i just try to remind myself that i am not my diagnosis, it is for sure a part of me, as it is a part of my defense mechanism, but i am also so Much more. And so are you! My therapist keeps saying that the great thing about the diagnosis is that they now know which therapy can help me, and that is definetly a good thing.

I wish you the best of luck, BPD is a picture of how much some of us has had to fight through our life, and we are fucking doing it, we are kinda superhumans! Welcome to the sub.",Hellomineturtlehello,o2zbpv
5,Yes that’s definitely true. Thank you for your kind words! I’ve been reading through all of the posts on here and I finally even feel like I’m surrounded by people who too go through these awful feelings sometimes but are also really great people and that gives me hope. I hope you’re having a good day and thank you again,Colourful_mind722,o2zbpv
6,Lol right! It’s like we’ve been going through it all this time and finally there’s an answer! It’s going to take some time to process I’m sure but hey we’re both getting the hep and support we’d needed who knows how long. I just always hope it’ll be better fast but I mean who knows what’s tomorrow 😅lol,Colourful_mind722,o2zbpv
7,"Omg yesss I love friends! ❤️LoL 
Wow it’s incredible to know that it’s not just me. Its not a good thing bc this feeling SUCKS buttcheeks.. but it definitely is reassuring and idk makes it like we’re all good friends! I was on effexor once for a while and got the WORST rash all over but it was really helpful because I used to go swimming with my current FP back when we were only Bestfriends lol but I’m going to keep ok the search for an in person therapist and I started taking Lamotragine yesterday so we’ll see how that works! So far my chest has felt so good! I hope you start getting so good relief soon too 😌",Colourful_mind722,o2zbpv
8,it's no problem! whenever i'm feeling down i always scroll to reply to people i can relate to because i know it feels nice to feel like you're not alone; especially with this disorder because you don't really understand fully unless you have it. it's just so complex. have a great day :),Tension_Fair,o2zbpv
9,Exactly! It’s so complex you can’t put what you need sometimes into words that other people even understand. It’s truly nice to feel understood for even just a moment. :),Colourful_mind722,o2zbpv

0,"From what you have written, you sound pretty textbook BPD to me.",ElectricalKiwi3007,1bi2q6c
1,I don’t really know what it means so I’m curious about it. My psychiatrist said I certainly do have bpd traits but it’s too early for her to tell if I actually have it or if it’s something else,Plastic-Inside-8535,1bi2q6c
0,"Write down thoughts, actions, ideas, that you're concerned about and write down the corresponding bpd signifiersthat you feel apply. Bring those to your doctor and say i feel these things may be negatively impacting my daily life, can we do some assessments and talk about if i may be on the spectrum of bpd?",Fickle-Addendum9576,1chzh37
1,You can look at the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD) to help get a better idea. There’s free PDFs online. “The Mood Center” has a good PDF w/ scoring at the bottom. But I would honestly just go in to a psychiatrist or therapist and state that you are concerned you may have symptoms of BPD and you weren’t sure how to get evaluated. They will then evaluate. You don’t have to go into all the details up front as they’ll ask about psych hx and what not.,aperyu-1,1chzh37
2,"Yeah, that’s probably what I’ll do",bitchcraftmra,1chzh37
3,I guess I’m just nervous because I’ve always been dismissed my whole life when I show concerns about my mental health. I have a big wound around peoples perceptions of it. My feelings are gonna be so hurt if they don’t hear me out,bitchcraftmra,1chzh37
4,"I think you have a perfectly reasonable concern. However, I have found many psychs to be quite helpful and understanding. There are some bad eggs, but you then seek the next one till you find the right fit. It's like medications, trial and error is the name of the game. I really do wish you best of luck though!!",aperyu-1,1chzh37
5,"I had a bad experience with a psych professional where they refused to take me off Prozac when it was literally making me fantasize about my death in detail everyday, immediately dismissed me when I talked about my sleep paralysis, refused to and refused to asses my anxiety when I later got diagnosed with off the scales social anxiety. Like, I didn’t even hangout with anyone. Maybe once a quarter. Would show up early to class so I didn’t have to walk in the hallway when there were other people in it. Etc. Then I had a psych that refused to hear my pleas about my help for my eating disorder. Similar thing to the social anxiety, although much less severe. I used a lot of laxatives and made myself throw up a handful of times, starved myself, later started binging, etc. Then later got diagnosed with OSFED ironically after my eating disorder died down a lottt. I’ve had bad experiences with therapists, too. It makes me so scared to express myself. I am gonna try to not let myself that stop me, though",bitchcraftmra,1chzh37
0,"Borderline Personality Disorder Demystified by Robert O. Friedel

Explains the disorder very well and has a few case studies you can read about how its affected others",WinterWolf3098,gt0092
1,"i cant remember the author but i read “sometimes i act crazy” when i was about 15, and had just been diagnosed. you can probably get dbt workbooks from your therapist as well. sending love & light your way!",jazzabellee,gt0092
2,[deleted],,gt0092
3,"Look for a DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) group in your area and enroll. And get a good therapist.

I can't suggest any books, but when you do searches on the topic take information only from legitimate scientific publications, including NAMI, NIMH, Psychology Today, etc. It may seem crazy, but I also like to look at research studies on BPD. There is some interesting information in those.

I hope you're doing well. When I was diagnosed last year I sure wasn't.",,gt0092
4,Learning DBT and getting a good therapist you can work with are the first things I recommend,hatesusernames29,gt0092
5,"i’m currently reading I hate you, don’t leave me. it’s one of the books a new friend on discord for bpd has sent me. just started reading it and i cried on some parts because i feel like i found my home on that book.",kingsville010,gt0092
6,"“The Green DBT book” I’m sure somebody else here will know what I am referring to and give the proper name, also BPD is often a broad thing so there are books out there not related specifically to BPD that can help depending on the situation 

Everyone’s situation is different, part of it is discovering and works for you, I would not necessarily recommend what ive done, nor would i know if it would be applicable and possible

A book that I really liked is one called “Hard to Love understanding and overcoming Male BPD” obviously that book might be of no use to you depending on a very intrinsic factor 

I don’t like it when advice is given, that worked or helped somebody, they fail to realize that the strategy they recommended only worked for them due to there luck, circumstances, and natural aptitude

I’ve tried DBT i think it could be useful and have gained from it but, i have had a lot of trouble finding and using it properly

I wouldn’t want anyone trying to give up because they feel they’ve tried DBT and it doesn’t work for them, one of the things I do like about it, is it has different components so it might be useful to focus on one.",JuliustheWise,gt0092
7,Thank you! I’ll look it up,DeLain1,gt0092
8,Thank you! I’ll check it out,DeLain1,gt0092
9,I didn’t know they had group therapy’s for this. I’m definitely interested in that. I’ve been in solo therapy for a couple years so that part is already going well. Thank you for the advice!,DeLain1,gt0092
10,I’ve been in therapy for a couple years so that’s going good. I’m looking into DBT as well. Thank you for the advice!,DeLain1,gt0092
11,"I started this one and a DBT workbook awhile ago but haven’t finished yet. I still recommend them tho. I’m currently reading “the body keeps the score” by Bessel van der Kolk and it has me crying at times just like “I hate you, don’t leave me” had me doing. They both hit home. The one by van der Kolk doesn’t focus on bpd but it’s mentioned. But its focus is trauma. 

It’s reassuring that this information is out there.",,gt0092
12,"I’ve seen that one too, I think I’ll check it out. Thank you!",DeLain1,gt0092
13,"Tbf, it's the only book I could find on BPD at my book store so there could be better ones out there but it really helped me. Especially the part about it actually being a treatable disorder that a majority of people can be cured from (or at least treated to the point that they no longer have enough of the characteristics to 'qualify' for it)",WinterWolf3098,gt0092
14,"You're welcome. I would also recommend that you get an app to track your emotions. I've used eMoods and Daylio is also very popular. 

After using these for awhile you begin to see patterns in the data, which will help you make informed decisions on what adjustments you need to make. In DBT Groups they use paper forms that are more detailed, but I find the apps are much easier to use than the diary cards they give you.",,gt0092
15,"Best thing you can do is stay in therapy, be honest and open with your therapist about everything (or find a new one if needed) and have a desire to get better. It’s possible but takes a lot of time and can’t be rushed. I’m sorry to hear you have these issues but glad you have a correct diagnosis and can use that to help improve your treatment.",canoe4you,gt0092
