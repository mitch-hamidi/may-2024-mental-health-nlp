4,Do you want to go? Will you be able to keep your housing/job etc? Sometimes I wish I could do inpatient but I don't have the $ or support to keep my apartment and jobs and I really don't want to lose them. So I've done IOP & twice weekly individual therapy.,blacktipwheat,1c9j6iy
5,"i really wanted to, but i simply cant support myself and disability is unreliable due to a screwed up system. i am trying to do IOP, places near me are 3x a week, 3 hours each. maybe look into that option, and they can assess you and give you a letter for FMLA. then you are protected at your job for those 3 days you take off, or all the days until you come back. IOP is anywhere ;like 4-6 weeks i think. unsure. but that is my route right now and as anxious as i am about supporting myself.. at least i have some PTO saved up and \*IN CASE\* of anything, I can always work while on FMLA. you just cant be forced to work. it has to be voluntary. if my job called me like 'you must come in'.. nahhhh they are breaking rules of my FMLA. but if i suggest i want to come in or i am ready to work, then that is allowed.",hanielnewastral,1c9j6iy

0,"That‚Äôs exactly the opposite of what DBT is about‚Ä¶It‚Äôs about being mindful, and it especially pointed out wise mind =/= rational mind‚Ä¶And DBT is accepting yourself as well as your emotions, and changing your behavior at the same time,  that‚Äôs where the  ‚Äúdialectical‚Äù part comes from. It‚Äôs about how to use better techniques (less destructive to yourself, more efficient to get what you want and no harm to other people‚Äôs boundaries) to express your feelings, instead of deny them. That‚Äôs why this method is very effective to pwBPD because it helps you to accept yourself, not always trying to change you.

1,"The problem is that for us there is no amount of external comforting that is *enough.* 

People who care about us usually don't ""push us toward therapy"" until there is nothing they can think of to say or do that will make us feel better.  Yeah, they're not perfect, but healthy people don't set perfection as a prior condition of personal growth and improvement, and neither should we.  

We got a raw deal, but we have to work with what we've got.  And no one says to take everyone out there at the total face value of their words when their actions are contradictory.  That's a strawman argument, though it is frustratingly common to encounter that type of inconsistency.  

""In all things moderation.""  That's a major goal for us to strive toward rather than the black and white thinking that doesn't serve us.",,zskr16
2,"Imho (NAD) you either a) had sub par facilitators that weren't familiar enough with DBT nor practiced it enough or b) you haven't quite grasped the concepts yet, which is hard to do! (I likend it to my T like a cult. You're asking me to go against everything I've ever known or believed. She thought that was a great metaphor) I've done and am currently doing 12mth DBT and only NOW (as a millennial) have I been able to be able to actually open up and do DBT properly and commit and be truthful. It's fucking hard and it hurts and you'll be processing a lot of trauma, it's a given. BPD is a developmental disorder basically. I have a great individual T though, and that's really important because they're the ones who are supposed to model what a healthy interpersonal relationship is like. That comes with all the transference and hurt and memories. But if you're straight up (even about the stigma with BPD, I've spoken in length to my T about this and the medical field) 

Something that helped me has been watching [Marsha Linehans presentations at Universities](https://youtu.be/JMUk0TBWASc) <-- (I know it's long but i ragout suggest giving it a watch)  etc about DBT. You really get a chance to see why it built that way and HOW it's meant to be run properly. 

This is going to sound so conceited, but it's kind of part of dbt I guess, but there's gotta be a lot of self awareness to happen and pride to drop in order for DBT to actually work. You have to ""give it up"". Up, is your maladaptive coping mechanisms that you had to form as a young child in order to survive. And address what's underneath that then asked to bear the brunt of the intense emotions? Fucked right? Yep, it is. It's fucked what you're care givers did it did not do to you. 
I'd also advise to do a little of your own searching of key words or acronyms on YT. It can explain things do much better and trust me it'll get some 'of shit' moments go off (self aware)

So I'm saying, I think it's almost guaranteed to either drop out of or absorb nothing because sometimes (in not saying this is your case) but we can be too ""unwell"" to be able to 'see the grey' and challenge your schemas

Look into Mindfulness from a Buddhist way (I know we hate the word but) and how that is related to other...things that can make you self aware and mindful. 
Try it again if you can buy with a different team. I can't empathise enough the importance of your individual therapeutic relationship

3,"People without this pain abandon me and expect me to get better, when they just inflict another scar and cause irreparable damage that makes life so much worse.

4,"I remember feeling like that a lot during the early days of therapy, and sometimes I still do, especially while my emotions are strong. Idk what your therapists are like, but mine weren't just in it for the transaction. They took this job to help first, make money second. Community is certainly another part of healing, my friends have helped me a lot, but I needed to have some therapy work done to help me set boundaries and pick better friends first. 

My therapy was never about fitting in, but about making sense of myself and others. Yeah, this society deserves a lot of distrust, but there are good people to be found. I learned how to find them, and how to treat them well. I learned how to differentiate between untrustworthy people and my own paranoia (the difference was palpable once I understood it).

Of course, everyone needs _some_ validation from other people. We need love from others. But some things need to come from the inside. Like when I'm being paranoid, no one else can calm me down in that state. I need to do it myself. 

This is just my experience though, I can't really say what the issue is for you. You might just have crappy therapists. It happens all too often. Or maybe you're just misreading the lessons, or they're bad at bringing them across. Or maybe DBT really just isn't for you! I hope you find out what's going wrong.",EpitaFelis,zskr16

6,"Wow. The hypocrisy of people/society that you describe does my head in in almost every interaction I have with another person.

Tell me it‚Äôs ok to express myself, share my feelings, that we all have ‚Äúmeltdowns‚Äù from time to time, then call me crazy & to get help when I express even the mildest of ‚Äòunpleasant‚Äô emotions/feelings (eg, anger, frustration, sadness).

8,"I feel like a lot of your post is centered around relying on others to do their part in society, and to be good humans. The matter of the fact is though, we just can't do that. We'll be always continually disappointed for multiple reasons, but the biggest two being that humans are inherently flawed and many with BPD have outrageous expectations for others. I've had many not great therapists and a few good ones. The best one I've ever had though pointed out to me a lot of my more nasty feelings towards people in general stemmed from my having such high expectations and standards for people who had already proven time and again they were flawed and that they absolutely weren't going to change anytime soon.

My SO told me once that he dislikes going out in public because people tend to be just overall kind of terrible. He pointed out that when you go out in public, each individual person is basically agreeing to an unspoken contract that you'll comport yourself with basic decency, which doesn't include blocking off a grocery store aisle to chit chat with some neighbor you saw in the store, controlling screaming children instead of ignoring them and being on your phone, not swiping a parking spot and nearly causing an accident, not driving like a lunatic because you're busy playing Candy Crush while driving etc etc. But from my therapy I've learned a lot, and the biggest lesson that gave me peace was acknowledging, understanding, and accepting that we can't control anyone or anything but ourselves. That's all. We can't make anyone else be a better person any more than we can force gravity to stop exerting itself on us, or grow a marshmallow tree, or win the lottery 100 times in a row. But we can be better people our own selves, and that's where you'll find your peace.

Expecting others to do what's right, that in and of itself is a self fulfilling prophecy of pain and heartache. With your musical analogies, that's like having only knowledge of being a fan of music and then walking around and telling each musician how to play their instrument. You have knowledge of how to listen to and appreciate music; you do not have the knowledge of how to make any of this music. Therefore, expecting music to be good, and then it not being good, well you as the music fan needs to simply go and find some other music, rather than tell the musicians what to do. How can you expect others to accept you for you if you refuse to accept that they're just being them? If you don't like the way others act, you simply need to find and associate with new people. If you like how absolutely no one acts... Well maybe it's time for a mirror and some self reflection.",UnbreakableJess,zskr16
9,"I'm coming to the ""radical acceptance"" that we're just supposed to put on a show and pretend everything is okay and that we're in a good mood so that it doesn't negatively effect the people around us.  This is ""recovery"".  For most regular people, they hide their shit all the time, so they expect us to do the same.

It's clear that the people in my life only care insofar as it doesn't inconvenience them, or remind them that they could be part of the reason I am who I am (my parents).

Being raised by narcissists, I've realized that all of my behaviors (even the well intentioned ones) are overwhelming and strange for other people.

I have a child, so it is my duty to stay on this Earth for her.  She is my driving force, and the only reason I'm able to bear the constant day-in and day-out pain I deal with.  Mentally, emotionally, and physically living trapped in a broken life, and actually mentally ill.

That's the worst part, is realizing you're acting crazy.",owwwwwo,zskr16
10,DBT NEVER worked for me and felt like quack. I don't think it's the end all be all treatment for BPD personally. Im actually worse now after doing IOP which was all DBT. I was going towards being better for a bit and have hit all 9criteria again because people have shown me their true colours this year and Ive been told all year that im just the problem in everything because I over communicate and not neurodivergency being forced into a 50hr work week and an overstimulating society. Its just all me,ndoubleuu,zskr16
11,"I agree with you on a broad sociological level. What helps, though, is understanding why some things are the norm. Like for instance, the rules about politeness *sometimes* serve to help avoid misunderstandings or offense to people who may have different experiences to you, and that is what makes them helpful. Because if you do them, and it comes from a place of caring for others feelings and well-being instead of just conformity, it makes more sense and is communal in it's own way. 

But not all social rules are kind or caring like this and some of them truly are about competition, individualism, cruelty, capitalism, etc. I know there's a lot of people who believe that intent doesn't matter, and i understand what they mean in that good intentions cannot erase the tangible effects of hurt or mistakes. However, the spirit with which a social rule is followed, or the intention, can really change how it is applied, why it is applied, and it can help things make a little more sense to those of us who have a very different experience to other people. 

I used to feel just like you did until i became aware of how some social rules help keep people safe, or make them feel less pressured, more included, etc. Then it made sense to practice how to be that way to try to be better and kinder to others, which motivated me to learn how to do that. If i have to change the way i express myself and it's hard for me, but it helps me be kinder, more accommodating, or more fair, it's worth it to me. 

But some rules really do crush authenticity, i totally agree. We have to be more accommodating to the world than it is to us, because of patriarchy and how community and external validation and communication is undervalued. It is no just.",,zskr16

14,"Only DBT therapist I had wasn't the best and I keep getting fucked over by psychiatrists because I have so many cormorbities. I can't just treat BPD and it makes it hard. I just had the weirdest hospital experience ever. I was put on lithum by one doctor then a week later completely taken off it upon discharge and put on fluoxitine. Which doesn't work for me induces mania but they didn't believe me. Literally one 20mg pill my anxiety felt better but I haven't slept in 4 days since leaving hospital. Hallucinations and my body felt paralysed when taking it. I can't see another doctor until we're done moving. I literally threw them out immediately because it made me feel like I was on crack. I've never taken crack I've had MDMA but not even anything illegal fucks me up as badly as antidepressants. That I literally gave it one day and I'm on the verge of mania and psychosis and my body is still dealing with being fucked around by medications. Lithum was actually helping me with mood stabilisation. Mood and emotions are not exactly the same. What I find astounding is two doctors who spent a lot of time with me agreed use coping skills for bpd and we'll treat bipolar with medications. Then some other asshole I saw for 20 minuets decides I don't have bipolar and fucks me over. Because they believe the cormorbities are just a really bad case of bpd. This has happened to me so many times where I was in active mania, not sleeping ruining my life, hallucinating and I was told I just needed therapy.

16,"I totally get where you are coming from, society tells us one thing, the expectation is completely different and makes you doubt yourself more.

With BPD for me, it took a long time to realise how I choose to think, worry, hurt was due how I was hurt by those who should love me. So constantly doubting myself, not believing in myself and what others actions said was completely the opposite, someone saying they love you but their actions showed they didn‚Äôt really care.

I have tried DBT but it wasn‚Äôt for me, have always struggled with mindfulness, etc as it only makes me angry.

Spent so many years trying the therapies where professionals stated this was the best option, counselling, doing over the past. CBT which at one point sent me into a nerves breakdown because the person I was seeing wasn‚Äôt listening to me. Then say you need to fail at this before we try something else, seriously didn‚Äôt understand how failure felt to me.

Getting professional saying you need to stop meds but that would make me dependent on them and I would never face this issue. When asked if I don‚Äôt take them, will they pay my living costs, etc as I still have function and work, which they couldn‚Äôt answer. 

Then when I would refuse certain therapies because I knew they wouldn‚Äôt help, being labelled as difficult and not wanting help, as if I wanted to feel in so much pain for a lifetime.

I did find NLP that was the right approach for me and has helped me to address stow issues to some degree and those it could helped me to process those emotions in the best way for me whatever that looks like.

I have gotten to a place in my life where for the most part, I feel so of comfortable with myself and know how put in boundaries with people for may hurt me. I don‚Äôt just look at what people say, but what their actions say.

I know my life doesn‚Äôt look like others but what I have built works for me. I don‚Äôt feel the need to confirm to normal standards or expectations and try to consider if people or situations is really get for me and go from there",Possible_Laugh_9139,zskr16
17,"bpd symptoms are caused in large part by trauma, usually adverse childhood experiences, and systemic issues under capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy.

the symptoms that i have *make sense* because of the experiences that i have had in life. my desperation for external validation and acceptance is because my mother was emotionally abusive and i was severely bullied by my peers. i was out as a lesbian at a young age in a rural conservative town. you can guess how that went for me.

i am NOT codependent. i have spent MOST of my life completely and utterly ALONE. i don't have support from my family in the same capacity that most of my peers do. i have been socially ostracized my whole life. it is NOT wrong for me to desire support and connection.

it has been shown that when people with bpd are able to enter healthy, consistent relationships that it improves symptoms and helps people get into remission. you're right, humans are social creatures and we are supposed to connect with each other emotionally. the society we live in actively discourages that. our culture encourages hyperindependence and ghosting.

unfortunately, the entire mental health system is fucked. i don't even believe in personality disorders, but bpd is the only language people understand. my personality isn't disordered, i have responded to the trauma i have been through in a way that MAKES SENSE. anyone in my shoes would have done the same. i had to learn how to fight to survive. i didn't have a choice. and yeah, these behaviors have fucked up a lot of my adult relationships and i have actively been working on changing that in therapy and my symptoms have lessened quite a bit.

i am lucky to have finally found a good therapist after seeing 4 different ones over the course of a year. but you know what has helped my symptoms the most? becoming stable financially, no longer worrying about if i'm gonna be able to afford my rent or my next meal. even having money to do things that are fun. not working 40-60 hours a week. having a flexible, hybrid job that treats me well and coworkers who i actually get along with. not being in relationships with people who *make me feel fucking crazy* and forming relationships with people who make me feel welcome, wanted, and accepted.

anyway, who the fuck is maslow and why is he so needy? mental health is never an excuse. you don't own anyone anything. pull yourself up by your bootstraps. you're just not trying hard enough to get better. /sarcasm",pastelxbones,zskr16
18,"I‚Äôve had DBT for over a year and I truly don‚Äôt see it that way. In theory, yes. But in practice it‚Äôs about doing what‚Äôs convenient to others in order to get what you want. It‚Äôs not really helpful if your symptoms don‚Äôt really affect outside people. I‚Äôm fervently against it because of that. It‚Äôs not centred around the person with BPD. It‚Äôs centred around your existence within a group.",yikkoe,zskr16
19,"There are some emotions to accept, but others to not. In anger we find an externalization of inner pain and accepting that it‚Äôs ok to be angry is accepting it is ok to not figure out what the pain causing the anger is. Just as exercising requires pain to grow muscles, growing emotionally/mentally requires accepting pain and in finding ways to lessen the pain (such as by accepting anger, living through comfort, etc) as well as pointing externally who is to blame for the pain, we deprive ourselves.

Life is constantly changing. We should be constantly growing, but in accepting ourselves in our current state we dissuade from growth: in telling ourselves to manage the pain rather than face it and find the healing within we cannot get better.",OnceNotLost,zskr16
20,"Comforting is not the same as support, that is the issue. 

I like to think of life as music: there are notes and rests, but you take a step back and you can see patterns in the notes. You take another step back and you can see the patterns are constantly changing, things are constantly being new to continue the progression without going crazy at the stagnancy. When we seek comfort we seek the familiar, we go back to a previous melody, but that is not growth. If every melody was constantly shifting then it would be madness so the familiar is necessary, but so is switching between past melodies and new ones. The issue is that people help us be comforted but do not help continue our progression because that is hard. Any change is hard, nothing changes without an external force and for our minds the external force is pain. It is necessary, but sometimes overwhelming, and that‚Äôs when we need support. Not when we are comforted but when we are changing.

Our society preaches laziness: what is easy. People try to support us through comfort, but that does not help us heal. Our pain is there, and no amount of turning away from it helps us heal. The only true way to support is through feeling pain with the person hurting: which means speaking harsh truths but showing that we hurt in saying them. Because people tend to say harsh truths in a way that is above us rather than with us it becomes meaningless as long as a distance is maintained between the speaker and listener.

When we need support we cannot handle our pain alone, but how we have been taught to support is not by shouldering pain together but by trying to distract from pain.

As for the strawman you mentioned, if you look at our society‚Äôs focus on politeness over directness you can see what I mean. In people neglecting harsh truths they say certain things but do not act that way, they act how they truly feel. That‚Äôs all I meant, not that people are actively lying but because they are taught directness is bad.",OnceNotLost,zskr16
21,"actually, as someone who was deprived of practically all external comforting as a child, there is an amount as an adult that is enough. it's just that i literally did not feel safe at home or at school for the first 18 years of my life, and i faced bullying and abuse from peers, teachers, my mom, and other adults. for reference i was an out lesbian in a rural conservative town.

developing a ""diverse portfolio"" of a support system of different people who provide external support and comfort has been one of the most beneficial things in my recovery. there were people in my life who made me feel like i was crazy, that i was too needy and asking for too much. but no, the things i need *make sense* given my background. and developing relationships with people who support me and accept me for who i am instead of making me feel like a piece of shit has made a world of a difference.

external support is not only a valid way to help people with bpd, but the data show that developing healthy, consistent relationships can help reduce symptoms. we need to get past this hyperindividualism capitalist brainrot.",pastelxbones,zskr16
22,"I think you misunderstand what I meant. I have been told by several people that my own philosophy is similar to Buddhism, interestingly enough. I do not say to neglect our emotions or continue our coping mechanisms, it is important to stop trying to avoid pain and accept it is there. When I say that ‚Äúin pain is growth‚Äù I mean that pain is the external force on our brains that facilitates a change. Nothing changes without an outside force, and for humans that force is pain. We can either try to avoid it, say it is bad, cope with it, etc. Or face it head-on and see the lessons it is teaching us to grow. Our coping mechanisms prevent healing, so I do not value them

Life is music. Everything must constantly be shifting for us to be happy, each aspect of every note has to be shifting and in holding onto one we require the others to become more extreme to find the same value. If we neglect volume changes then the tempo better change,  playing one note becomes unbearable, etc. 

We should not be taught how to manage pain, but to see how the pain is trying to help us grow. In pointing out pain externally via anger or laying blame we neglect ourselves. We lose the ability to heal if we tell ourselves the pain is not on us. We cannot control our pasts, we cannot control the events that cause trauma, but we can control holding onto it and our culture of validation and normalization of holding onto pain means we cannot grow stronger because of it.

I have healed immensely and for the first time in my life experience happiness, but it was not from the hundreds of hours of therapy I went to. That was when I was at my worst, in fact. In leaning on a therapist I neglected my ability to lean on myself, to be an individual. A therapist should be focused on helping us find ourselves, not helping us rely on them. I went through immense pain but found healing when I accepted my own power: in the understanding I am different than my past and I have learned the lessons of it.

It is only in self empowerment that we heal, but that self empowerment can never come from the external‚Äîincluding a therapist. We must find it within ourselves, and that only happens when we accept pain, fault, and blame for our previous actions. We accept how much doing xyz hurt us and don‚Äôt try to think to figure out how to blame something outside of us so that we may understand our own roles and that we are hurting ourselves, and using that pain to motivate stopping whatever we are doing. When we lay the role of understanding externally, like on a therapist or the lessons taught to us, we neglect the internal",OnceNotLost,zskr16

Pain is internal, the cause is irrelevant because the wound only exists in us so the healing can only stem from accepting our own strength.

That did not come from the hundreds of hours of therapy, though, as that therapy was a cycle of pain/management. There is no way to grow if we rely on thinking, only on feeling. We have to recognize how our actions make us feel and stop thinking how they make others feel. We have to focus on guilt, on what we believe is good/bad and not what others believe. Our thoughts are subjective, they are external. They stem from lessons taught by our peers and those we trust/respect, they have their place but that place is not in warping the only objective aspect of us, our emotions. I do not mean anger or pleasure, but sadness and joy and pain etc. By seeing what actions give us happiness and what actions hurt us we can develop our own sense of self, but on relying on the external to decide what is right or wrong we can never grow ourselves.

Pain can facilitate growth if accepted fully and not pointed externally.

Why do we want to fit into a society that normalizes hatred? People are not genuine and will judge you for being so, but if you recognize their judgment stems from their own pain/hatred it does not need to affect you. 

That being said, I *always* make a distinction between emotions and desire/hatred. Anger/hatred is not an emotion, it is a warping of emotion. Rather than focus on stopping our Pain we should focus on stopping our hatred.

What do I mean? Well, our other emotions can coexist. We can be sad and happy with things that are bittersweet. Hatred, though, warps our emotions rather than coexist. Humor becomes mockery, a breaking down of others rather than a change of perspective. Love becomes lust, dehumanization of ourselves or others in the name of pleasure. The joy of creation becomes the pleasure of destruction‚Äîjust as breaking a glass vase someone put effort into can give us pleasure while creating that glass vase brings us pride. One is long lasting, the other is an immediate validation. Desire is an immediate validation. Drugs, sex, destruction, they all feel so good in the moment but we constantly need more. It is okay to experience it sometimes, but when it becomes a crutch and an excuse not to change and experience joy then it becomes bad.",OnceNotLost,zskr16
34,"It is difficult. It‚Äôs not their fault, because they were raised to be that way. It‚Äôs not their parents fault, because so were they. Assigning blame is useless since no one is truly to blame. The only thing we can do is change ourselves.

Hatred rules society. Rather than bond over creating things and our interests we‚Äôve begun to bond over common enemies and superficial aspects of ourselves and have deemed that okay. Life is constantly flowing so something must change, but since our society is one of consumption the change does not stem from growth, so it instead leads to hatred. People mock others and that gives a momentary feeling of superiority, a sort of immediate gratification.

Since we value ‚Äúpolite‚Äù so much, we begin to see direct as bad. The only times people actually point out negatives is when they are angry, so people respond to having a negative pointed out with anger. Anger begets anger. 

If you try to call them out angrily *they will never listen*. It is incredibly difficult to see the fault in ourselves. Anger gives pleasure to the person being angry, and if we feel someone is getting pleasure from our shortcomings we fight back instinctively.

With the politeness focus, we are taught to seek external validation in everything. rather than speak our thoughts, we warp our thoughts to get the correct response from someone else. We need others to like our thoughts (if we like them) and the very aspect of speaking begins to be about external validation, because they also struggle with self-validation, though they may say we do. Their words mean nothing.

People speak empty words constantly, in speaking we make up for a lack of acting. We build our reality around the words we speak, but if we aren‚Äôt genuine we are building a reality of confusion and pain. Mental illness festers as, rather than act upon our words to make our reality real, we begin to struggle more and more as it clashes with itself, and that causes more and more pain so people divert it somewhere. Either through self hatred or anger‚Äîwe see the rise of extremism as the pain increases.

The only way to be happy is to recognize the hatred in those around us and know that the hatred is not who they are. Before we can do that, though, we must recognize and separate the hatred within ourselves.

Hatred is a manipulation, literally. Nobody can force you to you feel joy, nobody can force you to feel sadness (though they can hit upon your own insecurities, that is internal) but they can certainly force you to hate. They can make you hate certain things through bad experiences or fear or the like. Hatred stems from the external, it is internal pain being associated with the external, and since we are pointing it externally we cannot heal from it. Hatred has to be let go of in order to be able to heal, but that does not happen with the help of those still hateful.

Do not let people convince you that you are a victim. Even if that means finding what you did wrong (of course, I do not speak of child abuse) because we rarely, rarely didn‚Äôt play some sort of role in our own pain‚Äîalbeit indirectly. We could have at least done something to get out of the situation before it got to the point of abuse, we just needed strength.

36,"You misunderstand my goal. It‚Äôs difficult because I have posted in places talking about changing society , but the way to do that is not by changing others. I focus on the need for everyone to find themselves and take responsibility for their own life. I want people to STOP expecting others to do this or that and focus instead on what they do. 

Our issue in society is the fact we constantly look externally and are disgusted by what we see, but when others do the same to us we are a part of the problem.

Hate begets hate. If tou look around and only see hate *that is you*. Our minds create our reality through perception. When I look around I see good people who are infected by hatred but I make a separate between those people and the hatred within them, for hatred is external. Nobody heals from hatred through judgement, but our society has decided judgement is the best course of action and it is. Not. Working.

I focus on self empowerment, to heal oneself then inspire those around you to do the same. No, not strangers in the store but whoever is in your community. The only way people grow is by being helped by those connected with them. I am hoping to write out my beliefs in case someone connects with them and can be helped by them.

You cannot force others do heal, and believing that will always end in heartache. Healing takes time and patience and *no judgment*. In judging others we dehumanize them and keep them from growing

Whatever you do, do not give into the temptation to view yourself as the victim. In allowing ourselves to be victims we become passive actors in our own lives. It sucks because those around us will often treat us as broken and incurable, but that is why we must find strength in ourselves. You can be better. You can heal. Do not let them demoralize you. Your reality is created by your mind.

39,"The social rules keep people feeling safe, yes, but that is not necessarily good. In avoiding pain we avoid growth. In turning our heads away from ugliness we do not heal the ugliness, we only let it fester. Or society is INCREDIBLY selfish and politeness reflects that. What is politeness but a direct manipulation of what we want to say to get a specific response? Everyone looks at what everyone else says with a critical eye because nobody speaks genuinely. However, our brains will fill in the unknown with the worst case scenario quite often‚Äîmeaning we will assume people are manipulating, out to get us, etc, and we have no way to see genuine kindness when we assume it is meant to be a transaction to get something from us.

How can we be happy that way?

Hatred can only be healed by responding to it with peace. If someone says something hateful, our tendency to shame them to silence only causes their hatred to be more extreme. Yes, it keeps those of us who ‚Äúaren‚Äôt hateful‚Äù feeling good, but what does that even mean? Even the ‚Äúgood‚Äù people resort to mocking those who are not part of their groups. Our social values only extend as far as our societies, so whatever group we feel we are apart of deserve our kindness while those outside do not‚Äîand those other groups feel the same. They hate us, we hate them, they blame us, we blame them, and the cycle continues, getting more and more extreme because no one is willing to legitimately respond peacefully to insults and instead feel the need to punish rather than heal. Sadism is still sadism when labeled justice, though.

Is it caring to allow someone to hide the things that reveal their pain? For words cannot cause pain themselves, only when the words hit upon insecurities. Is it truly healthy to ignore the insecurity and just put up boundaries so we don‚Äôt have to deal with it? That does not heal the pain, it only causes it to be covered and ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù. But what happens as more and more pain is covered, as our default approach becomes avoidance over directness and healing?

People begin to rely more and more on things that relieve the pain momentarily, immediate gratifications. Drugs, sex, and hate (among other things) all give pleasure and keep our eyes away from the pain, but as it keeps growing we need more and more drugs, sex, and hate to counter it and we get to where we are in society now: an incredibly bitter, hateful group of people completely dehumanizing those who do them wrong and incapable of working together to fix any major issues",OnceNotLost,zskr16

44,"I have found healing through acceptance of the cycle of pain/joy. Our current field of psychology is broken because it focuses heavily on avoidance of pain and the need for pleasure, but both of those things do not lead to happiness. It is so ironic how as we get more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù in psychology people get more and more mentally ill. 

Life is music; our notes constantly shift in patterns that repeat but have to be altered occasionally to maintain freshness. When we try to hold onto one note too long we grow bored of it, then resent it, then hate it, and then we can‚Äôt enjoy it when it comes back again like if we had just let it go. There are harsh notes occasionally, chords that sting our ears and silence that may build fear‚Äîbut each of those have their place. When the beauty returns we can appreciate it even more after the anticipation of its absence has built, but only if we do not get afraid and halt the music when it gets scary. It may hurt and we may fear the unknown, but in halting the flow we will never move past the painful note and return to the beautiful melodies.

Life is change, so as we hold onto one note and refuse to move (say, a reliance on pleasure to avoid pain) there still needs to be a change, so that note has to become more and more extreme, louder as louder to make up for the lack of variance

It is easy to find comfort, just return to a previous melody. What is hard is allowing ourselves to go out into the unknown and find the next melody in our progression, but that is the only way to experience joy. We have to constantly be letting our music expand and become more complex or else we go mad

But we don‚Äôt. Our psychology focuses on making us not feel pain when pain is the motivator for that expansion. Just as how an object at motion stays in motion and an object at rest stays at rest until an external force acts upon it; our brains are the same. Pain is that external force, it can allow us to grow if we do not fear it. In pain is lessons, things we can come to understand to be better people and in doing that we grow, expand and our music continues flowing forward

Setting boundaries does not heal us, for the pain the boundary protects is there whether or not someone breaks the boundary. There is a wound festering and the boundary only helps it not be healed. Of course, it may not be the correct time to heal it and in that case that‚Äôs ok, but if the end goal is a boundary what‚Äôs the point in that?",OnceNotLost,zskr16

46,"The appearance of your symptoms makes sense, but in finding where to point your blame you will never heal. When you point blame externally you believe the problem is external, but you can never heal the external.

Our mental health system IS fucked, but not for the reason you believe. Our psychology focuses so much on explaining, justifying, coming up with external reasons for internal pain then labeling issues as incurable because the cause is external.

The cause of your issues is external, but once the issues manifest the only one to blame for holding onto them is you. It is harsh to say, I know, but that is why our society focused on ignoring harsh truths leads to normalization of mental health issues. 

The only one who can heal your issues is you. They stem from elsewhere, but their continue existence stems from the internal, not the external. If you always look outward to find the answers to ‚Äúwhy‚Äù then you will never heal.

If you find yourself continuing to struggle, maybe it is time to take a different approach. Society preaches blame, but society is becoming more and more mentally ill. Stop listening to the lessons taught you by a field that is actively growing at a slower rate than the thing it is supposed to heal. Our current psychology is a failure. We must change our tactic.

You must find self empowerment to heal, but that only comes from understanding your own blame. If tou view yourself as entirely powerless because of these external factors such as capitalism, white supremacy and the patriarchy then tou will never find strength in anything except anger

But anger is an externalization of internal pain, so it will never heal you. It will give you immediate gratification in the same way as drugs, sex, gambling etc. Do. 

You must reject the teachings of a hateful society before you can find healing. I know no ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù people that are not struggling, only people who hide it due to shame.

53,"Mmm, I think the part I'm not grasping is how exactly do you expect to go about bringing changes in people? Primarily when your post speaks about others as though they have some invisible illness because they aren't doing what you want them to do, while also stating that exact behavior is what you dislike? No, you can't force others to heal, you're right... So what exactly is this change you're speaking of trying to bring about.

Bottom line, DBT is about self healing. Getting better for your mental wellness is about *self* healing. You can't get better when you're hyper focusing on what others are doing and saying. I'm thoroughly confused because while no, DBT may not work for everyone, it's true, what does what others think or say or do have anything at all whatsoever to do with healing and bettering yourself? Your entire post mentions other people, what they do, what they say. Great. Okay. But what about you? How are you helping **you** be healed? How are you supporting **you** on your wellness path? 

You mentioned Buddhism somewhere or another, and if that's helping you, awesome! I'm glad to hear it, Buddhism was a wonderful stepping stone for me finding compassion and inner peace. But Buddhism teaches to reflect internally more than absolutely anything else. Sure ""be the change you wish to see in the world"", but the emphasis is on *being* the change, because Buddhism teaches and understands that we can't make others change, as that's imposing your will on others, which is wrong morally, as well as harmful to your own self. In my own time with Buddhism, I came to understand that this means to simply just do your best to be the best you that you can be each day. Some days you might fail, but that's okay. It's never going to be a bad thing to fail, so long as you try to reflect on and learn from your mistakes and keep trying.

My point is, you make so many mentions of changing others, its difficult to understand your stance, because anyone who has taken DBT and learned from it would know that you focus on inner change and personal growth, and the external changes will follow naturally. You don't even have to worry about other people, because if you focus on just you and your path to betterment and not worry what others are doing, one day you'll wake up and understand that was the key all along; like the saying, ""those who matter don't care; those who care don't matter"". We are much more heavily influenced and judged by our own selves than absolutely anyone else out there; once you get to a good place with your own self, you'll realize that inner dialogue of other people wanting you to change and be what they want was your own negative inner voice all along.",UnbreakableJess,zskr16

56,"Like I mentioned, some of these are great philosophical points that i can see the merit of for sure. However, not everyone has the same experiences you describe here. Not everyone turns to vices the same way. 

It's also important to note that it's not our jobs to tell other people how to cope with their trauma and triggers. Saying that not abiding by some social rules, which are basically boundaries, means that you force people who don't want to talk about sexual assault to talk about it and relive their trauma because it's ""good for them"" or you do things like forcing someone into confrontation in a way that reminds them of how their parent used to abuse them, because you just think it's what they should do. It's at best a well intentioned error that could hurt someone, and at worst it's very toxic and can destroy relationships and hurt other people for real. And with some boundaries and rules, how can we actually know what they are for unless we try to see their purpose and empathize with the reason they are there in the first place?

Like, I think that people with BPD want to be able to express how they feel and have that be an ok thing to do. And in the grand scheme, I definitely agree that people in general should be able to express how they feel with less repercussions. The problem is that you never really know who is around you that you could hurt even unintentionally if you're being too intense or aggressive or what have you. It's like a paradox. Everyone's experiences are so different and individualized, it's hard to know how to be. That's why learning how to have self mastery is so important. You learn how to express yourself in better ways and when and where would be best to do that for maximum good. Something that people who have been neglected or haven't developmentally caught up like people with BPD have, were never taught or never learned. But once you start learning how to master your triggers, it's really helpful, even aside from the need to have conformity or whatever. Just the ability to have self efficacy is rewarding on its own.

That being said, it is really easy for oppression to hide inside this whole structure. There are people out there who want to do right by other people and not trigger them and follow cancel culture and try to speak out against injustice. All the rules make everyone walk on eggshells, especially people who haven't been taught to navigate them, like us. And there's also people who use these social rules for evil to manipulate systems of power or other people. So it's not all one thing. Not all social rules and mores are useful, good, or come from a good source (ex: working on holidays because The Grind TM or not talking to coworkers about compensation), but some social rules help other people (not asking about what is between people's legs when talking about gender,  or not forcing someone to talk about the assault they experienced, to avoid retraumatizing them.)

I used to be someone who imposed my worldview on other people because i thought ""well honesty is good for people, it wastes time to lie, I'm just going to tell them bluntly how it is to help them"" and i thought i was being helpful and honest. Really, i was just being an inconsiderate asshole, because some people aren't ready to talk about that thing, or that thing is hurtful, or it embarrasses or humiliates them if you say it in front of others, or it's hurtful unnecessarily because people can't be motivated by cruelty. Some things just require a softer hand, or more navigation of rules. Like i can't just walk into a space for POC people and tell them how to feel about racism just because i have an opinion and feel like something would be good for them. It's not my place. Or, like, I'm bi and i can't tell a lesbian or trans person how to be, but i also don't let them tell me i don't belong in queer spaces.

63,"Yeah! The most important thing to recognize in your journey is that *hatred is not an emotion*. Hatred is always external rather than internal, it stems from something that has happened to you. Giving into hatred and treating it as who you are means you lose yourself and accept that others control you. Hatred comes in many forms, in anger we allow ourselves to point our pain (which we should be focusing on rather than the anger) externally so we don‚Äôt need to feel it, ourselves. Fear and apprehension keep us from stepping into the unknown, but in staying still we stay stuck in pain when life is cyclical: there are good times and bad times. Moving forward means we will experience more pain, but we will also experience joy and allowing the hatred that has hurt us keep us in fear we devalue ourselves and lose the experience to feel the joy of the unknown.

(Gonna go a bit more into the music thing) Life is music, the rests build anticipation for when the notes return. Sometimes a new note sounds harsh, but in not being afraid and accepting it we can hear the note again and it will be less harsh. Our progression continues, growing ever more complex and stronger with each change we make. We return to previous melodies for comfort, as constantly new notes stops sounding like music and is just chaos. The refrain must return to get us comfortable and ready for when the music changes, and we can experience joy in that change as long as we view it from the perspective of new experience and not as an imperfection since it did not follow the previous melody. 

We have to accept the cycle to be happy, and in believing there will ever be a ‚Äúfinal state‚Äù to get to we will never be happy. There will never be a point in our progression where we no longer need change. Once we have accepted comfortable and stop stepping out of our comfort zone we get bored, but something must change.

You cannot change others, but how you react to them changes things dramatically.

I have had ‚Äúbad people‚Äù apologize to me for being aggressive. Why? Because I did not get angry back or treat them as inferior. They are human, the same as me, they are not the problem. It is the hatred that has grown that I target, and that only goes away when we counter hatred with caring, but we can only do that when we have a strong sense of self and are healed, ourselves, enough to not be affected

He literally left therapy today saying he‚Äôll reflect on the pain he‚Äôs holding onto

I do not need people to hear me because it helps me. The music validates me and I am happy without any external validation‚ÄîI want people to heal, though, and feel I must do whatever I can to help because I have healed and I am a good person. Good people do not just take their wins and go enjoy it selfishly, they share it. I desire deeply to share it, and those who listen understand but those who try to argue can never hear me because it becomes a ‚Äúwin‚Äù or ‚Äúlose‚Äù situation

I am not trying to win any arguments. There is no winning or losing in self expression, only inspiration and denial",OnceNotLost,zskr16

Radically accepting that and ‚Äúmoving forward‚Äù means not allowing myself to comprehend what happened and how it affected me.

68,"The thing is that a system will never change without an external force acting upon it, and people will lean on what‚Äôs easy unless forced to do otherwise. Yes, it is hard and painful to push them because they push back but that is necessary for healing. Pain will never heal when ignored, the only way to help is to shoulder their pain with them, and that means speaking harsh truths in such a way that when they get angry we do not feel above them but understand their anger stems from pain and *allow them to hurt us without giving up or getting angry back*

People are not healing in this current system. When ‚Äúgood people‚Äù believe it isn‚Äôt their place to interfere but hateful people interfere readily what do you think will happen?

The only way to truly help is through selflessness, if you found yourself being an asshole then you were holding onto pride and a feeling of superiority in knowing more than the other. You have to let go of that before you can help. If helping feels good it is not genuinely helping them work through their pain.

Society is its own being of hatred, and all beings wish to perpetuate themselves. It has taught us lessons over time that produce stagnancy and prevent healing. It preaches anger, shame and judgement as a legitimate way to change others but that will never work. The only way to help others change is allow them to hurt us and not fight back.

Genuine peaceful protests worked in the past because the protesters allowed themselves to be beaten, insulted, hated without giving into the temptation to return it. Our current ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù are only adding to the problem by trying to change society through judgment and feelings of superiority.

The path we are on will only end in destruction, and the ‚Äúgood people‚Äù must be the ones to recognize their own errors first, as waiting for those in the wrong to change is naive and will only produce more hatred when they obviously will not.",OnceNotLost,zskr16

70,I am happy to share what helped me heal :) I went very in-depth for many of these comments so you can read them if you want or I can share directly with you. I believe those who have found happiness have a duty to help others follow suit and not just have a mindset of ‚ÄúI got mine‚Äù. That is selfish and why our society is so negative; when the bad spreads easily but the good is taught to be isolated once it is found then obviously the majority of us are going to struggle,OnceNotLost,zskr16
71,"Self empowerment always matters. In viewing yourself as a passive actor in your own life you will never be able to find the strength to do anything to change. If you lay blame entirely on the external you will never heal because the external does not care for you. The external will never go out of its way to heal you, and needing it to means you will remain bitter at your circumstances.

Do you believe those in worse off situations than you are required to be unhappy? That they must all hate their lives? Do you believe those with absolutely nothing could never find strength in themselves to keep going?

Our current obsession with pinpointing a cause of our internal strife in the external only denies us and keeps us in a state of standstill as everyone waits for everyone else to heal first.

I do not say to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, in trying to associate my words with the words of someone who does not care you delegitimize the point I make without directly speaking to it.

Our psychology studies us as we are and describes it, but we are suffering. We must change how we are and stop expecting others to change it for us because it clearly is not happening. Our psychology does not see how we must be and work toward getting us to that place. It follows the track already put in place, whether or not that track has a positive ending. In pain is growth when accepted, in telling ourselves pain is bad and something to be feared we deny ourselves the ability to grow from it

It is not on those in the wrong to change because they never will and waiting for them will only lead to heartache. It is on those who are right to help them follow, but not through shaming or anger or hatred. We have to find strength in ourselves before we have the strength to help others overcome their hatred. Hatred begets hatred and our attempts to fight fire with fire is only quickening the rate of burning. People naturally resist change, and if we become angry at their natural resistance then we are just as much a part of the issue as they are, as we deny their humanity in dehumanizing them and making them out to be pure hatred. We deny ourselves in holding onto our own hatred, as hatred is external and gives us nothing but immediate validation when we spread it. It harms our own ability to heal by allowing us to point internal pain externally and never legitimately work through that pain. It turns good people into sadists through justifications of ‚Äújustice‚Äù and turns kindness into a transaction that leads to more anger when unreturned. Kindness is only kind when it expects no return.",OnceNotLost,zskr16

76,"I think this is too much generalizing for what is a problem across multiple topics, and also a myriad of individuals.

What makes it your job to tell someone how to heal and when to do that? You're not more privvy to the suffering of an individual than they are themselves. Even if you are, you cannot force someone to change even if it is for their own benefit. You can be there if they decide to change, and facilitate holding space for them, but you can't tell people what to do. They will only resent you, and they might even get worse. The greatest change comes from patience and compassion. There's been many times where i ""told people how it is"" only to be in the same exact situation later and realize that what i said to them was ignorant, unkind, and unnecessary. Luckily, I've had a few good and patient people who didn't ""tell me how it is"" when i was in a low point or a crisis or dealing with something. They just tried to be there and be accepting and patient, and you know, that helped me more than any other person who had tried to give me tough love or be brutally honest with me ever has. So much so that I started listening to people more about their struggles instead of *judging first* and it was a game changer.

You can't make someone dig up repressed memories of trauma on a schedule for your own or their own benefit. Sometimes people are just not ready, and trying to force them will legitimately hurt them. How would you feel if the person you are trying to force to own up to some of their trauma wasn't ready, and then they went and killed themselves? That death would be on *your* hands. I'm certain that's not what you want. 

It just takes patience to be kind. The world is not so black and white as to be able to spin on a dime when we want it to. It doesn't mean that changes do not have to be made, or that difficult things must not be faced, and that space cannot be made for them. That's what being a good ally is about. You lift up the voices of other people and open the door for them to *speak for themselves* not for you to speak for them.",,zskr16

We can‚Äôt get past our trauma and either it handicaps us to a level that is severe, or it‚Äôs completely invisible. DBT isn‚Äôt for me and I hate that people talk about it like it‚Äôs some magical cure.

Genuine art shares a lot about a person and can be very insightful if not viewed passively

I focus so much on the music metaphor because I came to these realizations while meditatively playing music 10-20 hours a day. 

Idk who you are, obviously, but I would highly recommend finding a medium of expression. Whatever that means, be it art or music or building or anything. It is important to create something from nothing but your own self‚Äîand NOT FOR LIKES/MONEY. It cannot be warped by the need for others to like them.

80,"You misunderstand my approach. It is impossible to force anyone to change, yes, but as you said it requires patience. In saying ‚Äúwho am I to try to help‚Äù I leave them where they are. It requires a constant, light pressure to *help them* and it only comes when we help ourselves, first. We have to be completely confident in our own abilities and our own reasons for helping before we can.

I have been denied, I have been rejected, and I have been resented but that is irrelevant because even if a thousand people get angry at someone pointing out they must heal themselves if one person genuinely listens, which there have been, then it is worth all the pain I go through in trying.

Your words only justify inaction, you say them from a place of believing it helps but there is a difference between forcing people and helping them. As you said, the world is not black and white. 

We focus too much on those we will inconvenience slightly and the pain we will bring on and neglect those we can help immensely. I do not get upset at being rejected because I understand they are not ready, but as long as they continue speaking to me I continue speaking back and sometimes even those who reject come to understand I am not speaking from a place of superiority or judgment but of care and respect

I respect other humans and their ability to change, but I recognize that the change will not start unless a spark ignites the flame, and I am happy to be burned as many times as need be in doing so.

Your perspective is one of hopelessness. You must have faith that people can be helped and not listen to them when there is inevitable pushback. The mistake we make is pushing back against pushback when we must allow people to hurt us because they are hurting and we must show we are shouldering their pain without giving up on them.

That is the only path toward healing. I do not ask them to find their trauma, I do not ask them to find what to blame on their current issues, because wherever trauma stems from is not the thing continuing its existence. Our current psychology is incredibly flawed, as it advances we only get more mentally ill. Incredibly ironic, but people are too stubborn and prideful to recognize that categorizing as we are is not the same as categorizing as we must be. 

Laying blame only allows ourselves to victimize our own minds but in such a way that we can never be freed. We have to find self empowerment to heal. I have healed by recognizing the patterns within myself and I see those patterns in others, so I work to help them untie the knots keeping them at a standstill.

Society has taught them to tie the knots, but society is falling apart. Society is fueled by hatred, destruction and consumption to keep people complacent but that also keeps them from growing. In pointing out which lessons actively hurt us I can inspire healing, but healing cannot be forced. 

That is not an excuse to quit putting in the effort to help, though.",OnceNotLost,zskr16
81,"I found my own path to healing through acceptance of the necessity of pain rather than the need to hide/cover it to fit in. I definitely do not fit in, but I know people look up to me in a way they never did when I was purely struggling to fit into them. Nobody cares about people who fit in, but they will actively make you feel like you have to because they do not find joy in growth but instead find pleasure in destruction (keeping others from growing) because of the hatred that has infected them. Some people try to mock me for standing out/having self confidence but I know that mockery stems from their own pain‚Äôs inability to grow, not me, so it does not affect me.

Being an individual brings so much joy along with the pain, and I would rather cycle through both as intended than get stuck in pain, afraid to move as the apprehension of failure and additional pain fuels my anxiety

83,"I don't agree that my position is one of hopelessness. I have simply shifted my focus to one of patience and compassion instead of judgment. And i am not inactive. I put effort and intention into listening and talking with people about things, just as you mentioned. People often talk with me about what they are struggling with and i ask questions and listen to their perspective without offering too much advice because people have to find their own way. And often, people do find their own way, it just takes being someone who is willing to be there and listen that helps them get to their next milestone of realization, etc. 

The problem with your perspective is arrogance. You are saying that you have healed and that you basically know better than other people who are living their own struggles. You are claiming that they just need help, and that it has to be your exact brand of help. That is the opinion of someone who is not, in fact, healed. It is the opinion of someone still stuck in the youthful mindset of someone who thinks they know what they are talking about and needs to tell everyone how to live. But i tell you again, as someone who once was that, it is true that the more you learn, the less you know. 

Some people need to lay blame for a while before they are ready to move on, and we can be someone who tells them there are other ways either through our actions or if they want to heed our words, but there is no one right way for everyone. And thinking that way is what's causing you to get burned. Relationships aren't about fixing or impressing a worldview onto other people. They are collaborative, and they grow together through diversity of opinion and mindset, and finding compromise in adversity usually. It takes humility to really understand empathy, and empathy is to understand another person's perspective or feel as they feel. You can't do that if you're trying to tell someone how to think and feel. That's why religion is the way it is. People need friends, not cult leaders.

But you're right, society is fucked up and falling apart. We need common ground on which to build. It does require that a lot of people have these kinds of realizations and do the work to heal. But there's a lot of people out there and these systems change very slowly, despite our raging against them. It doesn't feel intuitive to say that the best way to see the world change is to focus on your own healing, but it does have an impact greater than you. When you learn new skills in therapy and start using them and behaving in a new way, other people see that. Sometimes they will look at that and reject it, or sometimes they will want to emulate it, ask you about it, or learn how to do it themselves. They learn organically from the human desire for community, which means that it comes from a place of their own desire, and it's effective that way. You don't have to go out and find people to fix and change, the people that want to change will find you or see you and you can work with them on it.",,zskr16
84,"I think we‚Äôre opposites of the same spectrum. I respect your point of view as it works for you, and honestly at the end of the day what I wish for everyone is to feel good. What I have issue with is, it seems like for mental illness and personality disorders, a lot of the tools used in therapy to feel good stem from this idea that one must ‚Äúbe like the others‚Äù. I was so happy to see that little by little for different neurotypes, this idea is being rejected. For instance, for autistic people there are therapies to learn how to unmask! How great is that! 

I think people think every single aspect of different neurotypes, mental illness and PDs are negative. I fervently believe that some traits are neither good or bad, they just don‚Äôt work in the world we live in. So why must we change those traits instead of changing the expectations of the world? Of course, some traits are objectively harmful. Like if some of them make you abusive, that affects someone negatively. But some traits aren‚Äôt. Like many PDs present themselves as strong emotions, period. Like it doesn‚Äôt go further than that. What about this exactly is so negative? Because it makes *others* uncomfortable? 

I‚Äôm not fully there yet, but I am actively choosing to not change traits that aren‚Äôt objectively ‚Äúbad‚Äù. As long as I‚Äôm not hurting anyone, I‚Äôm not changing. DBT to me felt very much like changing traits that aren‚Äôt harming anyone, and I don‚Äôt like that. I‚Äôm lucky to have ‚Äúquiet‚Äù BPD I guess, as in everything is kept bottling up on the inside and I know not everyone experiences it like that. But for me, DBT doesn‚Äôt work and I wish people could maybe possibly accept that it‚Äôs not a miracle cure. I have issues that actually affect me that aren‚Äôt being treated with DBT. 

Every time I say this here, I get downvoted and when I say it on Facebook, I get backlash. It really annoys me that some people really think that despite how drastically diverse the human condition can be, for BPD somehow we have one singular cure that works for everyone. Oh well.",yikkoe,zskr16
85,"You continue to make assumptions about me and what I speak of, your words are meaningless because they are based in the unknown, in doubt and an attempt to say what you can to put me down rather than raise yourself. You are filling in gaps in your knowledge with your thinking. I do not care if you say my position is arrogance or not right, if I have examples otherwise the reality of those examples far outweighs the nebulous doubt of hypothetical negatives. 

We can always say ‚Äúwhat if that does not work‚Äù and always pretend that helps. Inaction does not help. I would rather everyone do their own, personal attempt to help people *even if it may help* whether or not their attempt aligns with my beliefs. If they are helping people then who cares if they are doing it my way? 

People need hope. They need to stop looking from a mindset of ‚Äúwhat if that does not work‚Äù because it demoralizes them and prevents them from healing. I have full strength in my position and my confidence is something people are not used to and thus can find their own strength in. 

If the reason you believe I am wrong is that is hurts peoples‚Äô pride when I express I can help them, then I do not care. Anyone so insecure that they cannot listen to a perspective outside their own will be upset anyway.  Again, if I can help 1 person per 1000 who get slightly annoyed *though I did nothing to them* then that is worth it. I am not gonna neglect the person I can help because I fear those who have become too hateful to put themselves aside for the greater good

Not everyone has friends to lean on, and not everyone has friends who know how to support. Do those who are outside the average deserve no one to try to find and help them?

If the pain stems from the shame of others then we must learn to separate that shame, but we have an inner sense of right/wrong and if we go against that we will never be happy

Life is music, there are many notes that must play for us to feel satisfied. There is a place for harsh notes, for silence, for chords that tense us, but that place is not in being held onto. Their place is in setting up the beauty to follow.

I do not preach abstinence or guilt for failure, I speak of the opposite. Even a missed note is only a mistake if we are holding onto the old melody, but we can view it as the start of a new one if we follow that new progression. Even mistakes have their place in our Melodies. Each note must be accepted though, and you must accept that each note has a time to let go and move on. Saying it‚Äôs okay not to change will mean you can never be happy, for what is the meaning of living if not to grow? What pushes you to keep going if you feel like the path ahead is the same as the path behind, an endless drone of the same pattern over and over.

87,"I mean I don't disagree on most of these philosophical points. You make good arguments, especially about the need for hope and the need to change mindset. I really do agree that the overall mindset needs to change, it just can't be made to change overnight and at the behest of a singular force. It's often gotta come from experience, or multiple sources, and it's gotta be someone's own idea, etc. Humans are stubborn and not willingly led to change except by their own power, which is good because it is a safety mechanism I'm sure. But you can't force people to change..and being a warrior of truth and justice is great and all, but it's often projection of our own insecurities onto others, which can be detrimental to others and ourselves. People with BPD often have an inflated sense of justice because we have faced such grave injustices. It makes sense to want to help people whatever means necessary, but it also isn't how people operate. People don't want to be fixed or saved. They want to save themselves. It's annoying, frankly, because sometimes i wish people WOULD take advice. But sometimes you realize that you didn't know enough or have enough experience to be giving that advice in the first place, and you just come off looking like a jerk because you should have listened instead of putting in two cents. 

 I'm not trying to really make assumptions, I'm just going off of your words here and now. I have no idea what you've been through, but the way you're presenting yourself in this discussion is very presumptuous, and that comes across as kind of immature. But then again, your examples are pretty nebulous. I have no idea what exact actions you are taking to help people, so it could be exactly what I am saying, which is listening to people and engaging them in discussion. I have no way of knowing that unless I saw it or it was described. If you're out here criticizing people for things and telling them how they should live, i believe my point stands. If you're being gentle with people and trying to hold space for them while they're dealing with things, then great. I'm sure it is helping them.

I am not trying to cause offense. You're actually the one who started making judgments, such as saying I am coming from a place of hopelessness and being inactive when nothing could be further from the truth. You can't determine that i am being inactive from this conversation, and i have blatantly said that I am not, because i am out here doing the work and watching it ripple out to others and engaging with them in doing their own work. So, your assessment of me is also inaccurate.

The overall point is that not all of society's rules and expectations are good or bad. Learning to use them is akin to adapting for survival, regardless of our judgment on whether that's good or bad. Many of the things we do in our modern culture are indeed harmful, and do need to change. But blaming an individual for this and trying to shame them into changing is kind of like blaming all of global warming on individual consumers and expecting them to fix it even though individuals are struggling to just survive as it is. There are also larger structures with greater power that need to be dismantled for things to really change. In the mean time, how can you blame people for just wanting to survive and get by?

Anyway, it's an interesting topic of discussion. I see merit in your ideas, but i also kinda feel like i could say ten things i agree with or ten nice things and one disagreeable thing and you may only hear the disagreeable thing. I hope that's not the case, but i do apologize if that's what comes across.

I have found confidence in the beauty of life and the music around me speaks to me in ways people never could, so I take strength from that rather than another individual, but the issue is that our society is actively one that focuses on the negatives

If you agree with 10 things but disagree with one, that‚Äôs fine. If you keep the one you disagree with from helping you act on the 10 you agree with, though, that is the issue. We all must be able to grow as we may not agree on everything but focusing on that which we do not agree on means we cannot grow from that which we do agree with

I take no offense from your words, I promise :) there are no words that can offend me as I *do*
Have a very solid sense of self. I reject my insecurities and when I find myself in pain I do not run from it, but seek out the cause so that I may grow. That is a very painful process and I cannot expect others to go through it, but I find strength in my cause as while people take it as negative, it is actually positive. It is based on the belief that *things can change* while accepting the fact that they are not okay as they are

If we all continue along the path we are on we will never grow. The only way to grow is to accept the pain that causes growth, and help others shoulder their own pain. Pain must go somewhere, when we need support that means we cannot bear it alone, but in this society of comfort people try to support us through comfort and we only find ourselves alone when we do try to grow.

I use music to connect with people. I have written songs that focus on this and while people may scoff at the idea, it works. Music connects us. There is a reason religious texts are written in scripture and our lessons used to be learned through inspiration, stories and fables rather than sentences to memorize.

We can memorize words all we like, but when we find ourselves struggling to put the lessons learned into practice then we have to change our approach

I‚Äôve played at bars, open mics, and religious events and every time I‚Äôve had someone reach out to me afterwords and I put in the effort to help them *learn how to grow*. I cannot force anyone, but in putting in the effort and making people feel like they can speak with me I can help them change themselves. I post online occasionally when I am tired, and even then I put in effort to help the people who reach out upon seeing the posts. There is someone in these comments as an example of that as well as a direct message conversation.

When people are struggling to find strength in anything it is beyond valuable to speak with someone who has absolute strength in themself. I lend the confidence I have in them and help them find confidence that *they can change*. Stagnancy may be comforting, but eventually even that comfort becomes its own pain as life becomes meaningless.

In being able to speak to someone who genuinely believes life has meaning and does not just resort to ‚Äúbelieve in god‚Äù they can hang their strength upon me while they are in the process of finding their own strength.

I put in as much effort as people put into me, as life only has meaning when we put effort into it. My words are meaningless when spoken to people who have no drive to engage with me. 

Just as you put in effort to speak with me, I will continue to put in the effort to speak with you because I have faith that eventually you can glean something new from it. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much you disagree with if you can isolate the new ideas you find yourself in agreement with.

I promise to you this does not stem from any insecurity, but strength and knowledge that those who are kind must be the ones to put in the effort, that they must be the ones to be hurt and keep being hurt in order to help those who are struggling.

There is no point in waiting on those in the wrong to change first, it is on those who view themselves as good to get the ball rolling. It is a slow and painful process, but if we stay still and wait for someone else to start first nothing ever will. I am not religious but I take faith in my purpose and the knowledge that while venturing into the unknown will be painful, if we keep moving we will find joy to match that pain. That is the music of life, and the only way to find happiness is to embrace the harsh notes with the knowledge they will lead to beauty if we do not get afraid and stop our progressions.",OnceNotLost,zskr16

I read your comment, we have some similar ideas‚Äîsuch as not trying to conform, but I went more in depth because it has already helped me. Even if you DID dismiss it for me, it wouldn‚Äôt matter because the result is there whether you agree or not

But I want to share it, so what matters more to me is a dismissal that it could be helpful for you. I suppose I could be wrong, but by saying you respect my opinion the subtext is that you do not agree, right? Or you are not open to being swayed by it, by keeping it separate from your own

We grow by sharing what we‚Äôve learned. I cannot teach anything, but in expressing myself directly and openly people may take the aspects they agree with‚Äîif they have an open mind",OnceNotLost,zskr16
91,"I did see that you post music, very cool. From what you describe, some of what you do sounds just like what I was saying, which is letting your actions speak for themselves and letting people bear witness to that and be inspired by it, so they can take from it what they can. Nothing wrong with that. 

I don't know what you mean about you having to be the one who gets hurt or burned in order to help other people, so I cannot comment further, because that's the part I'm unsure about. 

For me, I have had to stick to learning rules and codes and regimens in order to gain back stability and sense of self. There are aspects to therapy that are not altogether humane, because it does encourage a certain kind of conformity based on privilege. You have to ""act right"" for people to treat you right, and that isn't fair or good in and of itself. But it is how human nature works, so learning how to ""act right"" can afford you peace and stability, because you fit in better. Humans are very transactional by nature in a lot of settings. Not everyone, but most people live in a world where social currency comes from reputation, conforming to social rules and ethics, etc. So by learning how to understand and do that is a survival skill. In nature, often those who are too different, too old, too sick, too whatever get isolated and die off. Humans like to pretend they aren't that cruel to each other, but they are. It's instinctual. Altruism is an overlay onto otherwise pack minded behavior.

But does that make all survival skills we learn bad? I would say no. If it helped you to survive, who could blame you. You simply did what you had to do. And i don't mean in situations of great injustice like excusing people who were Nazis who were just ""doing their jobs"" because those people made a choice to allow harm. But for people who are going to therapy to learn how to reign in their emotions so they don't lash out at the people they love...are they selling out because they aren't just allowing themselves the full authenticity of their emotions? Or are they learning how to have restraint and control and mastery of themselves to benefit their community? It depends on how you interpret it.

When i go and learn DBT skills, sure a part of me is sacrificed to the process of learning how to act and be like other people. I make the choice to give up a little of my raw natural state, but in return i learn how to have more self efficacy, resilience, communicate more kindly with others, and gain a little peace and stability in the mean time. 

Are there still parts of BPD that i think would benefit society as a whole? Absolutely, I do. I think western culture is too individualistic and devalues community so extremely that sensitive people who can read the nuances of human emotion and care about not abandoning others by ghosting them or canceling them, become outcasts. There are some people who believe that BPD is a systemic societal reaction to capitalism and the havoc that it has wrought on the western psyche. People with BPD are incredibly passionate, loyal, caring, and favor justice over passivity and value community above all else. All things this country needs, if the people here would just take a moment to examine it. People with BPD are a glaring sign pointing to how indifference and invalidation, emotional abuse, and hardship can hurt people, but also how even one stable, loving, kind friend can help heal that hurt. This disorder is a fascinating microcosm of our culture.",,zskr16

I appreciate that it works for you, like I genuinely hold zero judgement about how you (and many people) view life, and I love that you‚Äôre not looking to conform. I‚Äôm not looking to conform either, but I don‚Äôt agree that growth comes from suffering. It can, but it‚Äôs not an objective truth.

93,"It is possible I am just broken in such a way that I can see outside the pattern we find ourselves in. When I tried to kill myself I fully accepted death, and when I awoke I was alone for 40 hours; I thought I had died and had gone to hell. I completely lost myself in that time, and now that I have finally healed I‚Äôve healed in such a way that I have no desire for a pack, but I have a desire for purpose. It took months and months, incredibly pain and a constant fight to not give in to the knife, but when I learned my lesson I also recognized I could help others learn without having to go through that immense pain 

My ultimate goal is to make up for the suffering my previous death caused. I no longer feel pain like I did before‚ÄîI still feel it, but there is no pain that can come near that death, and in recognizing that I found the gift I had been given. 

When I speak of being burned I refer to being denied by people, insulted, screamed at. I‚Äôve had people get inches from my face and yell without feeling anything, because they are not my enemy. I only feel sadness for their pain. The music saved me and the only thing that hurts the music of life is hatred, stagnancy. Hatred is a parasite and now I dedicate myself to doing whatever I can to fight it. Not fight people, but the hatred growing inside them.

I‚Äôve been kicked out, threatened to have police arrest me, and had physical violence threatened, but the irritation I have caused to people too controlled by the hatred is nothing compared to the help I have given to those who listen. It hurts to be denied, ir hurts to be screamed at, it hurts to be insulted, and that is the pain I refer to. If we fear that pain we will not have the strength to find those who will be helped. It is incredibly difficult to deny the urge to fight back, but if we fight back we only allow the hatred to spread to ourselves. 
 In not becoming angry 
 but allowing them to insult me there are two outcomes I have experienced: people calm down when their anger gives them nothing as the immediate validation is taken away by me not reacting, or they try to remove themselves from my presence as I am not giving them the response they expect and I see the confusion in their eyes causing them to want to flee.

I post some music, but my most important music is all not recorded because it must be created in the moment. I have lyrics written but no guitar because I play as I feel in that moment so that people may connect with my expression of self and not a past version of me (the version who wrote a song). It helps people feel like it is personal and not just entertainment to be consumed, i find, which is important because people can be moved by entertainment but when they consume it passively they movement they feel leads to nothing. It has to truly hit them, and that only happens with genuine connections I also write songs because I aim for variety, though and I enjoy having things created fully to be proud of.

94,"I do not say suffering, I say pain. Suffering is holding onto pain and that is not my belief. The people who grow are the ones that can let go of the pain

Holding onto pain is not necessary for growth, but just like exercising requires pain of the body to grow, growing your mind requires pain and that‚Äôs ok. We just need to learn to move on past the pain, is that different from your belief?

An object at motion stays in motion until an external force changes it. Humans are the same, for us the external force is pain. We can certainly grow along the path we are already on through joy, but to change the path requires pain. What big change wasn‚Äôt hard?

If someone is struggling then they need to accept the pain required to change the path from suffering from self empowerment and growing",OnceNotLost,zskr16
95,"Well if you care to discuss it, my follow up question would be why do you think those people have rejected you or acted in such an extreme way toward you. Like was it as a result of something that was said or done? 

But you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. 

Otherwise, it sounds like some trauma has changed you. And you have an idea of what you want it to change you into, so i think you're right, that is a part of having a stable sense of self. I have some similar experience, but instead of music i had to define my values, which define who i want to be. And a strong desire for justice or to defeat hatred is a noble thing. Sometimes, the thing we feel most passionate about avoiding or defeating is something that lives inside us that we fear or want to defeat in ourselves as well. Pop psychology calls it shadow work i guess. For you, perhaps it is hatred? Something that lives under the surface and that you want to eliminate from yourself so you externalize that fight against it, possibly. But i don't know because I'm not you so i could be wrong.

 I know for me it's rage. Rage terrifies me because it's not just outright anger and tangible violence, it's dark and deep and amorphous and alien feeling. I have had to spend time making contact with it, sitting in the dark pool of it and tolerating what i see and feel there, making friends with it. I use my artwork sometimes to depict it like some great dragon coiled up inside me. But the more i make friends with it and demonstrate compassion to that awful hollow rage, the more it comes up to the surface of that deep black pool and the more it works alongside me, and it becomes less of this alien thing i fear. It's like making friends with a wild animal, it is vicious and it could hurt you, but you come to an agreement with it to attain peace. It's like being a trained swordsman. You know you have the capacity to kill, but you train for the discipline and mastery to retain peace and calm in your heart even with a sword in your hand. Like how you describe the sense of being calm in the face of violence.",,zskr16
96,"Sorry, English isn‚Äôt my first language so sometimes I use words as synonyms in contexts where they are not. 

But honestly I take issue with this obsession with moving on. To me it‚Äôs so similar to DBT and how a lot of it seems to be to not make someone else uncomfortable. Because people who don‚Äôt move on are seen so negatively even though often times, their life situation affects no one but themselves. So why do people care so much? What if I want to dwell on something for some time? What if I want to spend time with that feeling? Personally, right now, I want to understand where this whole thing is coming from. I want to understand why my brain works the way it does. I don‚Äôt want to fix it right now, because fixing it would mean having to push aside my entire being. Because in my almost 30 years of life, I‚Äôve been governed with a ‚Äúbroken‚Äù brain that is doing its absolute best to make sure I‚Äôm a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù human being under a capitalist system. But that brain of mine maybe has 40 years left of steam? And I want to understand why it‚Äôs the way it is. And I don‚Äôt care if that‚Äôs dwelling on something I can‚Äôt fix, that‚Äôs my pejorative. Right now to me, it feels natural to want to know more about how my brain is and why it is the way it is, before I can even start trying to change anything. The way BPD is for me doesn‚Äôt come in the way of my responsibilities. Even if it‚Äôs hard, I can keep a job. Even if I am impulsive with money, I have never been late paying a bill. Even if my emotions are absolutely out of wack, I can care for my family. Which is why I don‚Äôt find DBT useful because a lot of (not all!) is about being functional. But internally there‚Äôs a lot of turmoil and question marks I want answered while I‚Äôm still alive. That‚Äôs all. I don‚Äôt want to push through the pain if I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm facing. And maybe other people are capable of that, but I‚Äôm not, and I‚Äôm fragile, and I‚Äôm just trying to survive the way I know works. One false step and I‚Äôm dead. And I don‚Äôt want to gamble with my mental stability like that

Edit to add : After years of begging for help, I‚Äôve finally been able to be added to a waiting list for another assessment. In Canada, everything goes through your doctors first, and my psychiatrist was basically the one deciding for everything for my mental health. Problem is, my psychiatrist had backward views of BPD and mental health in general. It seems to be a common issue he has with most of his (female) patients. For years I felt like either DBT wasn‚Äôt enough, or it wasn‚Äôt what I needed. At least not now. BPD wasn‚Äôt all there is to my struggles. But finally I was able to circumvent my psychiatrist‚Äôs influence, and I am seeing someone else. I‚Äôve had doctors unofficially tell me I have PTSD or I may be autistic. One psychology I can no longer afford did therapy to help me understand me. It was incredible. But she cost 200 a week and I don‚Äôt have that kind of money. So I want someone to tell me once and for all what they think, without any bias. I need someone to help me understand why my brain works the way it does. If it‚Äôs a short label I can Google myself, great. If it requires weeks of meeting a professional to understand it, also great. And maybe then, I can find better help to help me ‚Äúmove on‚Äù.",yikkoe,zskr16
97,"To respond to all of this I will go into what I mean by music. My philosophy did not come from any books, anything someone taught me, but in recognition of the patterns around me. I used logic so maybe it will speak to you, as you seem like someone who values 

What is music? Music is a series of patterns. Each aspect of it is constantly changing or staying still. Notes, volume, rhythm, etc. Every aspect of that change that is locked in place means the other changes must be more extreme. 

If you hold onto only one note, it can still be interesting for a bit if you change things like the volume extremely. But as the note is held on longer and longer, the aspects around it have to get more and more extreme to prevent us from hating the music. 

Now, in that change there are repeated patterns that we recognize and take comfort in, then we find joy when an accepted pattern is slightly changed. However, If the pattern is constantly changing with no returns to previous melodies it stops sounding like a song. So it becomes a. Cycle of repeating what is known then changing it to the unknown.

If we hear music that is entirely outside where we are in our spirals we hate it. Someone who enjoys soft music will likely hate jumping directly to metal.   The progression is slow, but the music progresses and eventually we can like genres we never liked before if they are not forced upon us

There must *always* be change, though. Either the music or disdain toward the music is growing.

Now, what is life if not constant change? We enjoy new things that are similar to what we are used to but may or may not like something entirely different. We try to build routines but find life becomes meaningless when we just constantly
Follow the same pattern

Changing the pattern takes an external force. Just like Newton‚Äôs first law says, the external force that acts upon our brains (And thus the patterns and the music, as I refer to it) must be harsh and comes in the form of pain. People grow when they experience the right amount of pain mixed with comfort away from it, in the same way music sounds good with a mix of familiar and new patterns.

Hearing a familiar melody is comfort, it allows us a break from constant change
Changing is painful because it takes effort, but it allows for new things that bring us joy. What joke do you laugh at you‚Äôve heard a million times? But you will laugh when it changes unexpectedly, I bet. What is the point of conversation if we know what words will return to us? Video games can‚Äôt stay the same, we have to constantly be growing.

Right now we are relying on growth of the external (invention/technology) to fill in the gaps of the internal. We put less and less effort into things and rely more and more on immediate gratification to make up for the lack of effort/growth as we figure out more and more ways to hide from it. 

I‚Äôm sure those scientists are happy, but what about the rest of us who begin to feel that life is meaningless as we only perpetuate the system by following the status quo, learning that is the only way and mocking one another for stepping out of line?

Our own music is not flowing, so more and more people begin to rely on external validation‚Äîpeople telling us we are in the right. as well as mockery, dehumanizing those we view as our enemies and pushing them down to momentarily raise ourselves

Anger is an immediate gratification the same way drugs, alcohol, sex etc. Are. It is so easy to get angry and thus feel justified in not listening to words that expose our inner pain that is is not growing

Hatred is stagnancy. It is a warping of emotions. It turns humor into mockery, love into lust, joy into pleasure. 

What do you see as you look at these? I see new things bringing happiness vs a destruction of those around us bringing us a sadistic satisfaction. Spending hours making a case leaves one with a sense of satisfaction and joy when is done, by the immediate destruction of it will give someone else so much pleasure for a moment.

Life is music; each note has its place. The hateful notes are just notes being held onto too long. We can grow to reject hate if people around us help us to, but that does not happen when we are shamed to silence. 

Shame is a lesson taught by a society of stagnancy. Shame only helps hatred.

Hatred is a barrier to the progression of our music. It allows us to lay blame externally, but we cannot heal external and in telling ourselves to find who is to blame we make it impossible to heal

Nobody has ever been shamed to change internally, only how they present themselves, but as our society is more and more anonymous/online our system of shaming is not working 

Anger takes our inner pain and projects it externally, which we justify through ‚Äújustice‚Äù but that is black and white and when it depends on person to person it becomes meaningless

We focus on stopping other‚Äôs music and feeling superior for that to make up for our own lack of progression 

But that is not us, that is the hatred.
Hatred stems from the external. It was put into us. It must be treated as a separate being before we can be rid of it.

Edit: oh, and as for why people become angry, it‚Äôs really no different that Newton‚Äôs third law, right? We are putting effort to change their minds, their minds will put equal effort back. The anger/pain is in their effort they are putting back when we try to support/press them to grow. Growing is painful for them, trying to get them to grow is painful for us.",OnceNotLost,zskr16
98,"I hold onto my past, I have not moved on‚Äîbut the pain no longer haunts me. I can see the good and bad because I let myself feel the pain

I understand. Pain is hard to feel and scary to do alone. The other night I was afraid my ex killed herself and almost drank myself to death because of it, but when I awoke I knew that I‚Äôd done all I could and all I could do now was hope. I realized, in that pain, that I truly care and that tells me something about myself. The pain I feel for others is what drew me to make posts like these, because I want to help people

We have forgotten how to support people. When someone needs support they are in too much pain to move alone, but rather than shoulder that pain with you to help heal we‚Äôve learned to do things to avoid the pain, to hide it, to make you feel comfortable 

There is a place in music for notes held for a while, but eventually they must be let go of. I do not say you must move on now, but are you struggling? 

The unknown is scary, but stagnancy is scarier. How long can you live on the edge like this, with no hope, just trying to survive? Eventually you‚Äôll have a dark day, right?

I don‚Äôt want that. I do not have an obsession with moving on, but I have an obsession with ending suffering. Holding onto pain will only cause suffering

99,"I'm not used to spending time solidly in the philosophical. I used to do that, but then when trauma happened i had to get very literal about things for safety. To have a sense of control. Which, in itself is infantile, but mastery and prowess are also an extension of it, so it's not all a loss.

When it comes to music, the desire to change the notes, in your case the discordance of shame, hatred, stagnancy, etc, seems akin to tuning a wayward instrument. If a note is out of tune, i throws off the melody or the harmony of the sound. But inside that is also something you said about each note having it's own place. Some people believe in never correcting a note, even one that disturbs the melody. That's arguably how we got jazz music from the blues. The blues mimics the voice, and jazz mimics it. Accidental notes are not truly accidental, in the theory of jazz. Syncopation and accidentals were once considered representative of evil in music, though I'm sure that's just a reaction to the unexpected, as you said. When something is not in control, not regimented, and expresses an intense thing you aren't prepared for, people do become angry or surprised, and then retaliate at that thing. 

In my worldview, I think of natural cycles, which are not black and white per se but they are very matter-of-fact. Things live, things die. Over and over again, forever. Each and every molecule fits into its own place, and even if it doesn't, it moves around until it finds somewhere it does fit. Chemicals in the environment are inert until conditions arise for them to combine with other chemicals, and then a reaction takes place. Seeds cast on the ground have everything they need to sustain life and grow into a plant. They are perfect, they just need water and sunlight, nutrients, and environmental conditions to grow. Guidance, as you might say. But a seedling exposed to too much sun, which in a small amount might break down it's seed coat, can still burn if it's too hot. Seeds that get too much water and not enough sun may not sprout. Seeds that have water and sun sometimes still do not sprout, for reasons unknown. But taking the seed into your hand and prying open it's fibers and asking it why it does not grow usually does not yield fruit. I'm sure there are ways to gently pry open a seed and the put it in a nurturing environment, but generally, you leave the seed to do it's business if it can, because it has all the instructions it needs written in it's DNA.

 It's sad to see seeds that never grow, or birds that never break through their egg, or moths and butterflies so can't overcome the struggle of their cocoons. It seems like such a waste of energy and time. After all that plant put all of it's hard earned energy into making that seed and fruit. Some people become bitter when they see wasted potential. But then again, fruits fall from trees all the time, and bugs eat them, and birds eat bugs, and snakes eat birds, and so on. Even the lost potential of the dropped fruit or the dead hatchling become broken down by fungi and things in the soil that get repurposed into new plants, new seeds. The beginning and the end are the same, and along the pathway between them chemicals have reactions when they are able and ready. When you are the seed it might feel like an eternity waiting for water to drop on you. Or if you're the person looking at the seed on the ground it can be frustrating to see that the seed is perfectly ready to go, but the time hasn't happened yet. Nudging it along can help at times, but after that, it's up to the seed and it's environment. We don't always know how long the seed has been sitting on the ground waiting, or what it might be doing inside it's unbroken coat. It might already be growing in there, and prying it open might kill it before it was ready to grow anyway.

We can clear away trash, and compost to make the soil more ready and able to help the seed. We can enrich the soil with nutrients and plant helper crops and take care of waterways and water tables to help increase the chances of the seed surviving. We can read about how to be a good farmer and learn how to be apart of our own ecosystem along with seeds and birds and snakes and trees. But still, in the end, things live, and things die. Sometimes it seems like there's no rhyme or reason, or there's more we could have done. But really, you just do what you can at the time and figure out how best to be helpful. And when things live and die, you celebrate with them regardless. With the death of a bird comes the life of a mushroom. And with the setting of the sun comes the rising of the moon and stars.

It‚Äôs totally random and seems unrelated to the way my life has been so I don‚Äôt want to move on from it because not only do I not understand where it‚Äôs from, it has made me who I am 100%.

101,"Your philosophy is very similar to mine and I question if viewing it as philosophical is keeping you from seeing that.

I use music because it is a tangible representation for those cycles and we can view it on a scale which we can comprehend rather than looking at the natural cycles around us filled with unknowns and try desperately to only make true statements based around the small amount we can see, only to find ourselves struggled as the gaps we fill in our mind are never fully correct.

We cannot constantly experience joy, we must have breaks in the form of comfort as joy takes effort (a strain that is a sort of pain). We cannot constantly grow because that is painful as well and we become overwhelmed, and that is, again, the place of comfort. We cannot stay in comfort forever because comfort has no meaning. The rest notes are peaceful but without notes to be between it stops being a rest and ends up just being empty silence. We can play more extravagant pieces with one another if we each focus on our own playing *as well as how we fit in with others*. We cannot play music together when we focus on what others should be doing and don‚Äôt play our own music. This externalization takes the form of anger. We can be inspired by someone playing beautiful music, and that inspiration is incredibly helpful for us to get to the point of beauty as well. However, we live now in judgment, in bitterness and mockery so rather than allow inspiration in *for our own good* we‚Äôve learned to tear down the beautiful music through mocking and justify our own lack of beauty as those around us who we respect are the same. That destruction feels good but it is killing us.

If a note sounds wrong and our response is to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how it‚Äôs meant to be‚Äù then not alter it, we are not accepting its purpose. I do not believe that we should avoid tuning, but we can never tune if we fear hearing the notes out of tune. We become demoralized is needing perfection without recognizing perfect is constantly changing, as perfection is a snapshot of a single moment but no moment can be held past when it must be let go of

The refusal to change the notes, the refusal to alter them so that they can be beautiful when they are not is the thing that hurts us most. As we live in a society of justification and validation, those around us validate our out of tune notes and pretend everything is okay as the music becomes more and more discordant. The discordance is pain, and it is building, but our refusal to change ourselves, to continue growing and find our beauty or in denying it sounds bad in that moment is hatred. Hatred is stagnancy. It covers up the genuine beauty of our emotions and replaces them with warped versions that give pleasure at destroying the harmony of others rather than growing ourselves to fit in. 

Words *are* philosophical. They have no inherent meaning except for that which we agree they represent. We pretend our words are as solid as the earth and get offended when people question it, even as we find ourselves constantly questioning others‚Äô. That could be okay if we accepted the inherent subjectiveness and worked towards communication and understanding one another, but instead we simply become offended someone would DARE to misunderstand us. 

We build our reality in our perspective, but if that reality is being build on denying certain aspects it will inevitably grow hateful as the confusion stemming from the difference between what is happening and what should happen causes us to look externally for ‚Äúscientific answers‚Äù when we will never find them if the answer is only in us.

I value the fields of science that study physical things, things that are not constantly changing. However, when we take the same approach of categorization and place it on humans we are making bad aspects of us accepted. We look as we are and compare to the collective rather than look how we must be, so as we focus more and more on ideas that must already be based in our current reality we harm ourselves more and more. We have to change the path we are on, we cannot simply study one another and neglect ourselves because it is impossible to know them fully and they will not speak honestly about the things that are paining them that they have control over. When our psychology focuses on finding external answers rather than challenging the words of the people saying they have no control the field only neglects self empowerment.

True self empowerment comes from strength, from focusing on our own progressions and allowing them to flow so that others may follow suit and fit in. Blame is angry, blame is hateful, because blame is external and we *cannot control the external*. We have to find what we can control and stop using hypothetical words that justify powerlessness. Our words can change, and if we find our comfort seeking is not fixing the pain within us we have to recognize our process is flawed.",OnceNotLost,zskr16
102,"I am as patient as those who speak with me. If someone is willing to put in the effort to talk then I will match them, even if they do it confrontationally the fact they are putting in effort shows we may be able to move past that and connect.

As for your situation, I was in a similar spot. I kept a knife by my bed for months just in case I could get myself to follow through.

There are three things that helped me heal, and it isn‚Äôt an algorithm because they are both individual:

1. I found a medium for self expression in music. I wrote Music focused entirely on my pain. I did not think about who would listen or money or validation, I made music to express myself. It took a while, a very, very difficult time‚Äîbut eventually I began to look back at my past songs and recognize patterns I had not recognized when writing.

I made something beautiful out of nothing but myself. No copying, no thinking of the external, no thinking at all. I just wrote with my feelings and made something I found beautiful. With that beauty, I showed myself that the inner me WAS beautiful. I could not deny it, this thing came from me. So now I focus a lot on the need for creation, to make someone so that we can find ourselves beautiful and in doing so *establish a sense of self*

2. I recognized my own guilt, my own blame, in my victimization. It was subtle and no one else recognized it, but in seeing the power I had but *did not use* if was painful but I realized that I have grown and next time it will not happen. I am not a victim, I have the strength to not let myself be hurt again and not hurt others accidentally

I was lying to myself in making my former relationship out to be pure manipulation, and that left me stuck in confusion because my thinking and hurt was warping my memory of my feelings. I did love her, through all the pain, and I had to accept that before I could heal. Hiding the truth to save ourselves from pain is why we struggle so much to heal‚Äîthat is why pain must not be feared. It should not be held onto, but it will always exist and we must accept that so that we don‚Äôt stop our melody every time we get hurt. 

3. In recognizing my own fault, my own imperfection, I recognized it was not my fault but still my duty to fix. My issues stem from my upbringing, but the only person who can fix them is me and I can, because I am beautiful inside. This made me realize the same about the person I viewed as my abuser‚Äîthey were a product of so much pain, it was not their fault. Their hatred was put into them. They are broken humans, but they are still humans and they didn‚Äôt have to get to this point if people genuinely cared to support them heal. I forgave her, and I forgave everyone else in doing so. People are not monsters‚Äîthe hatred is, and our refusal to help people work through it only makes it stronger 

Then I realized that I needed to do that if others would not, so now I strive to support others in healing genuinely",OnceNotLost,zskr16
103,"Certainly similar. Many of these ideas present both opportunities to be more accepting of what is, as well as a rather lofty ideal. People are just as wonderful as they are flawed, so not all the things you describe are always possible because people aren't able or ready to do some of those things emotionally. People still struggle with hatred, vengeance, anger, pettiness, oppression, prejudice, and fickleness. Despite our efforts to rise above these things, we still all fall into them repeatedly. The desire to separate ourselves from a more animalistic nature leads us to have high expectations of ourselves, and to blind ourselves to what we still have not risen above, so when we fall into it we often feel denial, surprise, and pain.

People still act viciously, people still live  in an evolutionarily competitive world even though some believe we don't. Altruism is found in other species, but it's also a facade laid over our more basic instincts. It's not inherent, but rather learned, just like many aspects of hatred and shame are. Humans do form groups, so things like empathy, compassion, and communication are instinctual, and from that the more sentient desire to practice empathy stems. It's observed in other species as well who are communal, so it's not altogether artificial. But just underneath it, a human can still kill another just like two animals in the wild can kill each other. We don't like to think so, but the veil between us and our basic instincts is so thin, you can practically see through it. You can look at someone who is angry and see it. 

I've started to wonder if trying to live as if we are totally past all our more base instincts just isn't practical. Should we live in a way thats more accommodating of our faults and non altruistic behavior? Altruism keeps people from just outright killing each other and generally keeps the peace, but tribalism can also do that without the lie of altruism. A good example is the current general discourse people have about forgiveness.

People who value altruism say that one should forgive those that have hurt you, because it is ""the right thing to do"" (whatever that means), or because anger is like a poison only to yourself, or it's the merciful or charitable thing to do. If we were all truly communal and altruistic, you would think that there would be no argument for this. People would say ""yes, mercy and forgiveness are more important than my hatred and anger."" But they don't. Why? Because people also value justice, and they *feel* the need for vengeance, which simply is a cover for feeling hurt and wanting to protect oneself. Many people who fee vengeful also feel powerless. There's been a lot of pushback against forgiveness as a concept for the last few years in the field of psychology, because people who feel powerless often are. They are subjected to being abused and hurt by people and systems with more power than they have, and they cannot get justice for the often terrible things people have done to them. So they feel vengeful, and their anger is all they have to combat the sense of pain and hurt from what they experienced. Sometimes that anger can be powerful as a tool in helping someone to break away from that abuse. 

Anger is a motivator. It helps you detach from bonds so you can take action. It helps you break the bond of boredom, loneliness, obligation, etc so you can get up out of bed, leave that abusive spouse, leave that abusive job, etc. And anger is often painted as evil in our altruistic society, because it is associated with violence, something every human being is capable of, but doesn't like to admit it. So it gets suppressed, which often only helps those that have power and like to abuse it because they know people won't fight back because they are afraid of their anger and what it might mean.

But a little bit of something is a medicine, too much of anything is a poison. Even water, or oxygen can be poisonous in the right amount. People paint with too broad a stroke by saying all forgiveness is bad. But they touch on the need to have all emotions in the human spectrum in order to heal. Sometimes people are tired of being told that their powerful abusers should be forgiven when they just keep on abusing, or there's no justice. So the anger helps them break those bonds and keep away, or helps them feel powerful enough to keep living instead of giving up, or makes them feel confident enough to keep growing. Personally, i hope no one clings to this idea forever, because as much value as i see it has, it is still rather juvenile. Eventually you have to learn that anger can't be held onto too long or it CAN become a poison. And i believe in the idea that forgiveness is for you, not for them. It releases you from the need to seek balance and vengeance so you can do other things instead. I also believe in mercy, and used to be one of those people who touted forgiveness, until i realized that it was too idealistic to just forgive. Sometimes you have to flow through the whole process of anger, hatred, sorrow, and denial to eventually find peace again.

Humans are advanced, but we aren't advanced enough to have completely overcome our own very basic instincts, and have mastery over our emotions. Emotions are powerful and basic, childlike, but complex. They drive our behavior, and it frightens people who don't like that they are seemingly mysterious and uncontrollable. People overlay control onto emotions in the form of logic instead of learning how to listen to them. I know I have. Many people in wester culture try to ban certain emotions that they don't like, they fear, or that don't serve the powerful, like anger, hatred, sadness. But you can't be a full human being without feeling ALL the emotions. Every one of them has a purpose, just like water. They give us depth and meaning, motivation, and help us navigate and make sense of things like danger, injustice, family, community, and our self awareness. Too much of any one will be poison, but a little of all of them in the right place is like a panacea. We can connect to things better if we do not deny our need to feel positive and negative emotions in stride.",,zskr16
104,"Thank you for sharing! And I agree this sounds like it‚Äôs helpful. However, I don‚Äôt have situations where I can really sit down and look for where I went wrong, in a way that would relate to my problems. Not saying I‚Äôm a saint (not at all!) but I just don‚Äôt have that many social opportunities to reflect on. That‚Äôs one thing I don‚Äôt really relate to when it comes with BPD. I don‚Äôt have much social interactions with people, outside of social media. I never did. Never had friends or anything. Not close to family. So it‚Äôs hard to find situations like that. My trauma stems from child abuse. It‚Äôs hard to think I did anything wrong when my mother became abusive when I was about 2 years old. And while your third point answers this, like I know my mother is the product of her upbringing and her own personal struggles, some things don‚Äôt add up. For instance, I was the only person she‚Äôs ever abused. And I also find it hard to accept things I didn‚Äôt do or had no control over, especially as they affect me in ways that are so unnatural, or nonsensical. How is it that my mother abusing me made me the person I am today? Was it really just her abuse? I‚Äôve been an odd child my entire life, and something just never worked. And it‚Äôs odd that throughout my life there was always a little something that felt off, that seemingly everyone was reacting to because since I was a toddler, it‚Äôs like I was off putting. What can a two year old do that makes her so off putting  to her caregivers? And that same thing eventually grew and made others around me uncomfortable, but I don‚Äôt know what it is. I‚Äôm a quiet person in real life, I don‚Äôt talk to anyone. But by sitting quietly in a room minding my business, I‚Äôve gotten those similar remarks that are basically like ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs wrong‚Äù. Or I‚Äôve gotten accused of things that I don‚Äôt even know what they are. An anecdote is when I was 14, a TEACHER called me a backstabber after class. I had literally never interacted with that man. I was (still am) someone who‚Äôs shy and who has major social anxiety so how can I backstab an ADULT I don‚Äôt speak to? I still don‚Äôt understand what I did, over a decade later. 

As an adult, yes I‚Äôve made some terrible decisions and have been toxic before. I recognize when I do things wrong, definitely. But there‚Äôs lots of other instances when I quite literally do absolutely nothing. But something‚Äôs always off. 

What is that thing? I feel like such an alien and as if I‚Äôm pretending to be human and everyone can see through my cover, except me somehow. Something isn‚Äôt right and I have no idea what that thing is. I can describe situations where that thing seems to manifest itself, but I have no idea what that thing actually is. 

Therapy and DBT especially aren‚Äôt really interested in answering that question. I just want to be given an answer. 

Anyways it‚Äôs 12:39am, I have to wake up early tomorrow. I‚Äôll be happy to reply tomorrow, but I just wanted to let you know for now I‚Äôm going to sleep. Thank you for your time and patience. Have a great day/night!",yikkoe,zskr16

106,"Us viewing anger as just another emotion is our undoing. Anger, hatred, and fear all stem from the external. Someone who is not angry is viewed as naive because they haven‚Äôt been forced to be angry by someone else.

You are taught altruism does not exist because you have never experienced it. I have learned it does, but it does not come from the self. Altruism is only altruistic if it stems from purpose rather than pleasure. I feel sick when people are helped by me, I feel pained and when people look up to me I want to push them away. I do NOT enjoy it, but I recognize the necessity in that. If I enjoyed it then I would be upset when someone does not change how I want them to rather than be patient in waiting for them to.

Anger covers pain, yes. However, it does not heal pain. Pain continues to exist, whether or not we push it externally and get the pleasure from spreading it. 

Have you ever met someone whose response to things is anger and found them to be happy? Happy people are the ones who can roll with the punches and not let anger get in the way of joy. We have to reject it because I‚Äôm telling ourselves it‚Äôs okay we only lean on it, as we lack self control.

It is okay to feel a response of anger, but as soon as we recognize it the only way to heal it to stop the externalization of whatever pain is causing it and find the pain itself.

If can help motivate us to break bonds, but it also makes us fail to recognize when the bond did not have to be broken. It is far easier to break a bond than to genuinely accept the fault we have in abusive relationships. In viewing ourselves as victims we blind ourselves to the truth that there was something we could have done before it got to that point, and in blinding ourselves we find we keep ending up in abusive relationships because we continue to blame the abuser and fail to recognize the hatred within us keeping us in fear of change and pushing ourselves to confront our own demons.

Abusive relationships quite often start as codependent ones, but as the two partners are not individuals they cannot challenge one another. They cannot bring joy because joy only comes from change, so comfort and pleasure is what is offered. However, everything must change, and if we stop ourselves from growing individually and allowing that challenge/joy cycle the comfort and pleasure has to get more extreme to make up for it. 

There is immense pleasure in destruction, either destroying the self or destroying others/their creation. It is an immediate validation that gives returns relative to the effort put into the thing being destroyed. Destroying a person? That can be the ultimate pleasure, and when we see people accepting pleasure as the meaning of life we see it becoming more and more extreme. We accept it until it crosses some invisible line, then it is disgusting. However, if it is not our place to step in from changing the track then how can it be our place to judge when it inevitably goes where the track leads? In encouraging anger and pleasure we discourage growth

Mockery breaks others down and makes us feel good, this is bad for all parties as the demoralization keeps others from growing and the pleasure from superiority keeps us from feeling the need to grow, either

Humans think in black and white, the way we teach things must be taught in a way they can understand. In saying everything is okay to a limit they will always take it past that limit, and as we live in a culture of external validation we find groups that validate us as we go past that limit so that we validate them, too

Anger plays no meaningful role. It is natural and so it happens, but we cannot strive to accept natural. We have to strive to be more. 

You‚Äôve said society is fucked, how will your point of view lead to any meaningful change when it only describes society as it is rather than looks to see how it MUST be in order to change?

It is impossible to know the truth, but if I am given two options and one has a chance of success while the other is certainly going to fail I will take the option with the chance of success, no matter how small. 

People have lost what empathy is, people have lost what kindness is, life has become a transaction and so people believe altruism is always for a selfish purpose, as you do. Humans understand by connecting, and if tou have only connected with selfish people that is all you will understand",OnceNotLost,zskr16
107,"Looking at your profile, you genuinely sound a lot lot how I was prior to healing. I even considered myself not a human and could not understand why people could not connect.

I still have no close friends or connection with my family, but I help them whenever I can. For me, I‚Äôve come to think of myself as unable to connect on a two-way level because while I can bear other‚Äôs pain easily they cannot bear mine, and that is necessary for connection.

I have accepted this, and I take joy in the interactions I have with people as they come and go, because we are who we are in this moment. Our past does not need to be us, we can be whoever we want right now. I can see my past progression and all of its jumbled notes and mixed-up Melodies, but now they have turned into something beautiful. Idk what the future brings and I know I will find myself mixed up again, but it is in the knowledge of the music and the flowing of time that I keep going, because once that harshness has ended the beauty will return as long as I do not hold onto it.

Perhaps you are like me, and your calling is in bearing the pain of others once you have worked through your own. 

When I lose faith in the music, when I start to feel hopeless, like I am meaningless and I cannot truly help people, that is when I struggle most.

In life we need a reason to live. We need a passion to follow. Life is many notes flowing in harmony to make those beautiful Melodies if we let it and don‚Äôt feel unnecessary shame. Shame is external. We can make mistakes, but we must not dwell on them. We can give into pleasure as long as we don‚Äôt let it get in the way of the other notes; we can cuddle with the comfortable as long as we step out and find joy when ready, knowing that the comfortable will be waiting when we need it again‚Äîjust as past melodies repeat  in music.

Life is a spiral going around and around, back and forth between harshness and loveliness if we let it, but it also has a general trend. If we fight it‚Äôs momentum then trend goes down rather than forward. We lose our senses of selves, we lose our passions, we lose our reasons to live. We become hateful rather than grow stronger.

If you do not know what to target to heal, look toward your hatred.

Hatred is evil. Hatred is external, it is not a part of us. Someone who was hateful put it into you. No one can make tou love something, but they can certainly make you hate. That is how we find mass-manipulation. People don‚Äôt get manipulated by joy, by happiness‚Äîthey are manipulated by hatred.

It shows its face in many forms: in directing pain outward via anger, keeping us in a state of fear and not moving from apprehension, corrupting humor into mockery, turning love into lust as we dehumanize and cause pain for pleasure, turning the joy of creation into the ecstasy of destruction. Allowing us to lay blame so we cannot heal, ourselves. Giving us immediate gratification so that the pain is momentarily covered, but it doesn‚Äôt go away.

Hatred is stagnancy. It will chain down your music as it prevents your healing. Is there anyone/anything you find yourself hating?",OnceNotLost,zskr16

That‚Äôs why I want something different in terms of therapy or help or whatever. I didn‚Äôt lose myself. I never had a self. Whatever is me, is just the shell I built to protect myself from childhood abuse. I never had the change to become a person. That‚Äôs why earlier I said, I can‚Äôt even tell you what my favourite colour is. I can‚Äôt look at any colours and feel some way. I always say black because it‚Äôs the least noticeable colour. I don‚Äôt know what I like. I don‚Äôt know who I am and I barely know what I even look like. When I try new things (and trust me, I‚Äôve tried a lot. Like a lot more than the average person out of pure desperation), I never like anything. Nothing sticks because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to feel. I even tried music since you like music. I played the violin for 10 years, piano for maybe 3/4 years. And the saxophone for a total of one. I did it out of obligation or in hopes of being liked. Nowadays, I can‚Äôt even say I like music anymore. I tried almost all types of art. Painting, drawing, pottery, knitting, crochet, cooking, baking, I even tried doing 3D models. Nothing sticks. I‚Äôve lived in 6 different countries, I‚Äôve been to all continents except Antarctica. I‚Äôve been to university twice. Dropped out twice. I took a class in France. I tried a handful of different jobs. Nothing sticks because I don‚Äôt like anything. Even things I thought were fundamental interests of me, it‚Äôs all circumstantial. Nothing sticks and nothing has ever been part of me. 

I just feel like I‚Äôm lacking as a human. I feel like other people with BPD have experienced loss and are trying to find themselves back. I don‚Äôt have anything to try to find back. Genuinely nothing. 

I‚Äôm only alive because I have a child. I thought parenthood would make me different because I always loved caring for kids. I thought I would have 3+ children but now I‚Äôm done with one because as much as I love my child, this image of parenthood I thought I‚Äôd experience isn‚Äôt me. So what am I? Right now he‚Äôs my only motivation. Making his life as good and worry free as possible is truly my one and only goal. I exist for him. Every breath I take is for him.

111,"You are caught in a loop. The thing you blame for your struggles is something that can never be fixed and thus can always be blamed. Your eyes are eternally pointed backwards, looking at the trauma that made you who you are today. You have to stop looking for ‚Äúwhy‚Äù because the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is that tendency. Look around you, look where you are now and take strength in the knowledge you are not where you have been looking.

Our brains create our realities, and right now the reality your brains is creating is one filling endless unknowns as you focus on answering questions that cannot be answered. You have to stop thinking. In thinking we try to fill in the unknown, but it gets to the point of being detrimental when the path we walk is filled with holes we‚Äôve filled in to our perception but not our feet. You will find yourself constantly tripping and confused why. 

The *only* objectivity in life is how you *feel*. Not your hatred, not your fear, not your pleasure, not your anger; these are all external as they are put inside of you. 

Life is a cycle of experiencing joy, comfort, pleasure (occasionally), and pain. You will find yourself cycling through all of these and that is how it will always be, you will never find a state of one without eventually needing to move onto the other. Use the painful moments as motivation to push to the next joy, when that gets overwhelming then lean on comfort and pleasure but do not let pleasure and comfort become your life. Joy is creation, joy is new, and without that your life will become meaningless to you.

Life is music, I will say again, but I will explain the importance of that a little differently.

Every aspect of music must shift. Volume, tone, rhythm, notes, etc. Each piece must be constantly being held and let go of, changed then changed back. It isn‚Äôt beautiful when completely random and it isn‚Äôt beautiful when repeating the same patterns over and over.

The beauty shows itself when those changes create patterns we recognize, then shift to a *new* pattern before the previous pattern gets played to death, so that in the future the old pattern can be returned to and being us comfort in the familiar rather than irritate us because we heard it too much.

Music will *never* find a final pattern to repeat. It will never become stagnant; and life is the same way. You will never find anything you like if you hold onto it too long. You can find beauty in change, but your mindset of ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I enjoy this forever‚Äù means you will never enjoy it at all. 

Maybe some of those artistic mediums were for a while, then you got bored but told yourself to keep trying? You should have let go and told yourself to return to it when inspiration strikes. I picked up/put down guitar 4 or 5 times over 6ish years. If I had forced myself to constantly be tied to guitar when it was time to take breaks from it and focus on other things I would not love it like I do now, as I would not have given it the time to hear that pattern repeated enough to bond with it.

 Stop telling yourself to find the thing you will like forever, find a variety of things you can cycle between. Let your interests flow as music, have a new interest every week if it suits you and return to previous ones when you feel it is time and *do not be ashamed of that*. 

Do not search into the void to ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù when you can see the objectivity in the joy you feel. Follow that joy. 

Every moment we are a new person, you must allow yourself be a new person. In holding onto the idea that you must be healed you cannot because you don‚Äôt even know what needs to be healed. You will never find a physical malady, you will only find yourself looking back to the past and wishing things were different. You cannot change the past, though, and the only one keeping you in the victimized mindset is yourself. You don‚Äôt view yourself as a victim of your mom but of the circumstance itself, and the circumstance will never apologize. You will never get closure externally.

You have a child, and though you live for him you must find more than that because *he will need you to*. You will never be able to fulfill your role if you lean on him just as much as he leans on you.
Self empowerment only stems from the internal.

I cannot have a checklist for you to follow for healing because the healing is within you. There is no action you must take, the only thing that can help you is through understanding. I can‚Äôt teach you, I cannot give you phrases for you to memorize, but the reason I use so many metaphors is to inspire understanding. Relate your own self and learn the lesson as it relates to you, not as it relates to society.

That is the reason so many lessons were told through art and fables and stories in the past; we only truly come to understandings through inspiration. We are struggling now because we are attempting to replace wisdom with intelligence, thinking to fill in gaps only acceptance and time will fill, but in thinking they never will be. 

You are a person, but you are a constantly changing person and that is okay. You must accept that as who you are and stop trying to pin it down to one aspect. If you allow yourself to flow eventually you will recognize repeated patterns in yourself, but only if you do not try to force them.

Your progression will stop once you stop putting in effort to life. Do not give into the temptation of passive consumption, of numbing, of the easy. The meaningful stems from the effort we put into doing it. Keep putting effort into things as you find the inspiration to do them then move on to put effort into something else when the old thing becomes old.

Everyone changes, people have midlife crisis when they try to fight it. Us with BPD just have faster cycles than them and that is okay. We have to look from our own perspective and stop comparing it to their slower cycle. We have the *opportunity* to experience so much joy, but with that will come an equal amount of pain.

For me, I want to help people but to do so on a broad scale is overwhelming so I start small and grow. Even then, the next step is overwhelming so I return to the familiar for comfort. That‚Äôs why I post on Reddit occasionally, it still can help people but in a way that is familiar to me and thus not scary. It still takes effort, I spend a lot of time in responding, but the pressure is far lessened than stepping out into the unknown and growing. It is a needed break without feeling pointless and motivates me to be ready to take that next step.

As for where to go? You must find your own passion; that will not be what you can do constantly‚Äîyou will always need breaks‚Äîbut it is what you feel motivated to return to and feels meaningful.

Personally, I will generally change my scenery (when I can). I will go for a drive, maybe go and visit somewhere for a couple days, depending on how strong a change I need. 

It is important not to just feel sorry for ourselves and feel guilty, though. Missteps are natural and we can keep moving as long as we don‚Äôt try to punish ourselves or feel guilty. Don‚Äôt let the times when you feel sad affect the times you feel happy. In focusing on punishment we are holding onto our mistakes rather than allowing ourselves to grow from them.

My own journey began with mania, but rather than use it to enjoy I used to to motivate me to venture into the unknown and do something that would last. I spontaneously went and played my music of change at a random bar and a normal person approached me seeking help in his own recognition that things must change but his hopelessness that they can, so I expressed to him much of what I had seen and he understood it. Then, when I crashed I did not crash into nothingness but I crashed down to this new floor that I had built‚Äîin creating something objective, something that would last whether or not I was manic I could take faith that my mania was not insanity and it had a purpose, because that man continues to reach out to me for insight even after I‚Äôd lost the drive to continue, and in seeing how my actions affected reality/the world outside of my manic mind in a positive way I found motivation to push through the depression I found myself in. 

Of note is I have more hypomanic episodes than full manic, so I cannot speak to your own level of intensity, but if you can make a change that lasts past your mania ends perhaps when you fall you can take strength in it in the same way I did

Edit: to phrase in a more metaphorical way; highs and lows will always occur. If, in your highs, you use your strength not to progress your music but instead bolster the melody you are already on then when you lose that strength will you not see how meaningless it was? If, in your strongest moments, you do nothing to continue your progression then when will you? When you fall back down and recognize that hopelessness it makes sense you will feel incredibly distraught. Use your highs to push yourself forward, out of the familiar pattern you find yourself repeating, and when you fall you can take comfort in the fact that you may not have the strength to push anymore but you can follow this new pattern created until the strength returns *which it will* and you can push yet again to expand even more. You cannot be always expanding, but always staying stagnant will destroy you far more than the cycle of expansion/familiarity.",OnceNotLost,zskr16

But she has to want to change. If she is not self-motivated, she isn‚Äôt going to change",,18cckf3
1,"Thank you for reach out here, it's very caring of you.

Lying is protection from the things that we fear, or the consequences of those things. Yes, she can and will recover from this habit, but she needs you to be loving, supportive, non-judgemental, and, above all, incredibly patient with her. At the same time, you will need to learn to recognize the line between enabling and supporting.

DBT, EMDR, and other types of therapy can help her to feel safer, as well as meditation and exercises in mindfulness. If she wants to, she can learn how to calm down her nervous system and bring it out of survival/defense-mode, thus removing the need to lie in order to feel safe. Even just wanting this is hard work, as behavioral patterns that elevate our nervous systems are kind of like drugs. Even though these patterns are painful, they're also physically addicting. This is why she has to *truly* want to let go of them.

In my own life, I used to lie a lot. What changed? I realized that the ""bad person"" I was trying to hide by lying was not actually me. I stopped identifying with my thoughts and my bad behaviors -- none of that is the real me. Once I accepted that, it became easy to confess my lies and to be honest about the things that might make me ""look bad"". Laying it all out, I realized, just goes to show that it isn't me -- how could it be if I obviously want nothing to do with any of it?

I hope that helps.",sophistcatbridge,18cckf3
2,"Jesus this sub is really showing me we have some very similar symptoms across the board. Sometimes I do lie, to make myself seem more stable or more important than I am. I noticed if I feel like I‚Äôm about to lie I need to reconsider what I‚Äôm saying and realize nobody cares if I say something grandiose or bland. Most people are worried about themselves and their own ambitions. I gain nothing from lying.

The flip side of BPD is that sometimes you divulge TOO MUCH of the truth to the point you might hurt feelings. It‚Äôs a very thin and hard line. I think therapy and time allows you to find a balance",Exotic_Sandwich3342,18cckf3
3,"Tbh as someone said in the comments, it's a low tolerance with distress or emotional conflicts, in my case, I learned to lie bc of extreme emotional distrust, Ik it's morally wrong but sometimes some small lies are better than dealing with unfair treatment, like if I tell them how depressed I feel, they tend to get mad at me... And I get anxious with some debts, like Idk how to ask them for financial help without getting yelled and insulted, or even my hyperfixations getting invalidated... Ik it sounds stupid but it's really painful, so sometimes I sacrifice meds money to pay debts, bc I'm having difficulties getting money, I tried with drawing comissions but I really feel hopeless abt it... But in your case, I recommend you trying to let her know that you are trustworthy, for example I always tell the truth to my partner, I'm not scared of her judging me, invalidating me or ignoring my triggers, so maybe conversation is the key, the problem is can the other person try to understand your boundaries? I don't think it works the same for everyone. So I'm sorry abt not giving the best answer, but I think sometimes ppl lie to protect themselves, so just trying to answer in a comprehensive pov like someone who struggles with this, not justifying it, but giving it context.",Random_Sanrio_Lover,18cckf3
4,"Hey there.

I used to lie all the time. I remember doing it just to do it, like, to see if I could get away with it, or something. Then I started doing it to avoid embarrassment. Then I started doing it to avoid hurting anybody. And before long the list of lies I had to keep in my head was exhausting.

It wasn't therapy, or medication that got me to quit, it was just me being sick and tired of lying. One day I just told myself, ""That's it. No more. Nothing but the truth from here on out."" It took a while, old habits die hard, but I got there.

The relief I felt when I decided to let go of all of my lies was huge. I was carrying all this baggage and guilt because of it. It was so nice to just be rid of it.

But, it was a choice that I made on my own.

I'm taking a guess here, but she's probably afraid that she's going to lose you if you learn too much about her. We don't have an identity of our own. We typically create one that's meant to please someone else. So, our whole existence feels like a lie.

She just needs to trust you and understand that she's in a safe space where she's not going to be judged, she's going to be allowed to heal.

That's easier said than done, but stay supportive and keep cheering her on for every step she makes, forwards or backwards. Recognize her effort, and be a cheerleader, be a fan. Don't tell her how she should feel, or what she should do, just foster an environment where she can let her guard down, and begin to tackle these particular demons.

There's some chat in here about perspective, which got me thinking... I have a little overview of our typical situation. It's the perspective I gained after learning all I could about our disorder. I've shared it here a bunch of different times, I'm sure some people are getting sick of seeing it, but it has helped quite a few people, and I thought it might help you, it might even help her, so I thought I'd just throw it out there. Just note, it's written to people who have this disorder.

So here's our typical story:

You're born. Everything is pretty and perfect, and you're adorable, and things are off to a solid start. Your brain begins to create neural pathways that will form the foundation of your understanding of reality.

Everything was going just fine until suddenly... Trauma.

It doesn't matter what it was, how bad it was, it's all the same. You got scared, and your brain initiated a fight or flight response to which you responded with flight. You hid yourself deep in your subconscious in order to protect yourself. You didn't choose this consciously, you had no control over it. So, now that you were gone, in a sense, you were left feeling like nobody. Like nothing. You had no identity of your own, it took off. And because your brain was still forming that foundation it began to believe that you were nothing. That you were nobody. And it began to believe that you deserve nothing but heartache and pain. And since that time your brain, the tool you use to discern reality, has been trying to find every way to hurt you in the most painful way imaginable.

So, you're feeling what you're feeling right now because your brain has created a reality in your head where you are the villain. But it's just a mirage. It's not real. You can pull that reality down and begin to build a new one that doesn't include any of that nonsense.

Because the truth is, with no identity of your own, you've looked to other people to provide you with one. That's what we do when somebody likes us, suddenly we feel like somebody because they do. And then we create an identity based around what we think they like about us. So if you think they like you because you're funny, then you'll create an identity that tries to be funny all the time, that kind of thing.

But eventually, that mask will begin to slip. Because it's not who you really are. And as that facade begins to fall, everything around us seems to start to burn. Relationships end, jobs end, I even know of someone married to a person with BPD with 2 kids who suddenly flipped out, wanted a divorce, ran away, took the kids, filed multiple false police reports against him, refuses to talk to him, had him followed, took all of his money, and now has a restraining order against him, and is living in a women's shelter with the kids.

We are fire. Contained, we're something very special. Set loose, and we have the potential to burn the world around us, and everyone in it.

So, you feel fake. Like an imposter. Because you are. You're not you. You haven't been you since that trauma took place. What you need to do is find a way to talk to that little kid. Tell them it's safe to come out now, and that everything is going to be okay. And then you go about building your own identity, one that's just for you. Just for you to like. Just for you to be impressed with. You create a person you can love and are proud of. And then you take that new identity out into the world and you defend it. And you never surrender it to anyone else ever again.

I apologize for the long comment, but I hope something in there managed to help.",GastonsChin,18cckf3
5,"I truly feel that the root of lying has to do with self-preservation, perfectionism, and fear of judgement/rejection, at least in the case of someone feeling like they don‚Äôt want to do it and aren‚Äôt doing it to be manipulative on purpose, but has trouble stopping themselves from doing it. Change is always possible but it is incredibly difficult and time-consuming even for those of us who are committed to self development and growth.

I'm generally reliable; I don't back out of plans if it would screw somebody over. I despise dishonesty, there was so much denial in my family of origin.

I've never seen lying as a symptom of this disorder, it's a coping mechanism that some people possess separately. It's not in the diagnostic criteria. People with BPD may lie to avoid abandonment, as all of our disordered behaviors are motivated by avoiding abandonment. The kind of repeated lying you describe sounds more pathological. She may not actually have *this* personality disorder. Or she may have more than one.

Edit to add: A pwBPD would concede and apologize to save the relationship and avoid being abandoned, or completely rage at you, insult you, threaten to harm themselves, and cry a LOT, and then concede and apologize and beg you to not to leave them. Someone with more narcissistic features would  lie, deny, deny, deny, manipulate, twist, resist, and make everything your fault somehow even if they do kind of admit they did something wrong. Then they lay on the tears and the love bombing. It's hard to tell the difference unless you know the person very well because it can look similar, but narcissists are just more... snakey.

So you'd do a 'treatment' where they'll deliver it via IV and when the hallucinatory effects and initial high start wearing off, you'll feel a strong antidepressant effect, at least for 1-3 days (and ofc the high is absolutely awesome too, although some people can find it discomforting... Depends on the person but they'll go through that with you, I imagine, with it being a professional setting)

And maybe with the official treatment being more 'controlled' maybe it'll last longer than that, I hope it does but as I said initially, ketamine is still ketamine so it stands to reason it will depend more on the dosage you have.

I'd definitely recommend trying it though. If anything, just to show that you are still capable of feeling happy because I know when you've been suffering with things like depression and BPD for a while you begin to forget what you know and only know what you feel - the walls close in, so-to-speak.

Recently doctor been experimenting with a organ anti rejection drug that i take 3 hours before the infusion and then it is suppose to Kickstart the antidepressant effects and definitely seemed to work.   I always describ getting a ketamine infusion as changing my mindset from a half glass empty to half glass full.    It can definitely save lives when other means have not worked.   I had tried everything and ketamine really is the only thing that radically works.   How long it lasts varies.   

Because of the expense i would love to find a way to buy the infusion machine and then buy ketamine somewhere.  Then administer at home.  

I think it would also work better at home because take the stress out of having to find a ride there and also having to get in a car right after the treatment.    It is over a hour away.   So for me it is the expense of the treatment and then I pay whoever takes me unless my girlfriend is available.    It is a pain in the ass but again I truly believe I would of committed suicide if it wasn't for it.   I was at my breaking point many times.

And getting the infusion is completely different from taking it recreationally.   No comparison.   On the street you take say 100mg at once and go into k hole.

I wouldn't suggest a diagnosis to anyone. Only a mental health professional is qualified to make those judgments. The stigma also makes BPD a very loaded diagnosis so it could possibly make your loved one feel defensive or shameful, which could cause them to act out or spiral. Focus on the behaviors and getting the person to consider therapy. Therapy is also a good move because regardless of the label (and you can have behavior like BPD without ever meeting the criteria), the person is still receiving help.



So focus on that. Focus on what's distressing to them, your feeling out of your depth to help, and suggesting professional help as a needed step. If you're willing to help them search that out, you can offer that, or whatever type of support you want to offer, but I think it's worth being clear on your boundaries.

1,"It‚Äôs tough for anyone dealing with cancer potentially terminal as well as mental health. Along with my own issues, I cared/supported my dad with his cancer and his mental health issues which he has over 20yrs. 

For me, it was about being there for him, listening to how he was feeling about the cancer and potential treatment. You just have to keep a open mind, being willing to listen to your brother about his wishes and his reason. 

My dad wasn‚Äôt initially going to have palliative treatment but then changed his mind and started chemo. After the first round, due to side affects he thought about stopping but in the end, he continued. There has to be consideration of the balance between extending life, with quality of life, if the treatment is worse than the cancer, what the point and that is about the individual. No one know they will react to treatment or if it will work

My dad did continue and it gave us 2 years, which were important, both happy, sad and tough. I would not want to have those memory no matter the pain. As much as I was hurting, I wanted to give my dad dignity and control, so when I was concerned about a choice, I would say my views but make it clear that it would be his choice.

Specially with BPD patients often dissociate from what is threatening to them as a last resort in order so mentally survive, but if this gets in the way of surviving physically professional is urgently required.
Neither he nor you as a family can‚Äôt deal with all of this alone.
The best you can do as his closest relative is to offer to seek an appointment with a psychiatrist to elaborate where to start and that you‚Äôll accompany him for support.

It's by far the only thing that ever made me feel a sense of utter peace and contentment, and that was just from unregulated black market ketamine. Imagine how effective it could be under professional and medical supervision. It is one of those mysterious substances that people keep trying to find faults with because it just seems too good to be true, but it is. The only thing to truly watch out for is that it could be emotionally addicting because who wouldn't want to be in a constant state of peace ü§£ 
The only thing that's keeping me from pursuing legal treatment is the fact that ketamine treatment is just ridiculously expensive. It's the same reason why I stopped self medicating too, I just couldn't afford it anymore, which is super sad.

8,"I tried so much medication and ketamine is the only thing that has helped. It‚Äôs not a silver bullet by any means but has been life changing after only 2 months. 

I microdose almost daily and meditate for about an hour after taking it using guided hypnosis or just listening to binaural audio. This method allows me to reach a deep meditative state fairly easily, and I‚Äôve had all sorts of helpful insights under these conditions - from meeting my subconscious to some more ‚Äúotherworldly‚Äù things. 

Ketamine works on your glutamate, which is different than most other psychedelics that work with serotonin. I‚Äôve been resistant to serotonin-based medications in the past and feel treating the glutamate works for me right now. 

Everyone‚Äôs brain develops a Default Mode Network, which is the thing that sets us on autopilot. My DMN put me into negative thought loops and made it really hard to see things from another perspective. The worst are the shame spirals and paranoia from my BPD. Glutamate floods the brain under ketamine, which allows you to develop new neural pathways and thought processes. Now, I can notice the negative thoughts from my DMN more easily. Over time, I hope to be able to ‚Äúrewire‚Äù my thoughts to be healthier. 

Like another commenter, I started microdosing at the same time I started DBT to help ‚Äúcement‚Äù the skills I am learning. I chose to microdose because I was a little afraid of what infusions would bring up for me emotionally. But now that I understand how ketamine works and feels, I‚Äôm planning to graduate to higher doses and try other serotonin-based psychedelics.

First of all, I am really sorry that you are being so neglected by the health care system, it‚Äôs like they won‚Äôt do anything unless you are killing yourself or other people, I‚Äôve been through something similar and I know that it can be really hard and scary‚Ä¶ but weed is not the way, trust me, I learned the hard way too, but it can causes panic attacks, severe anxiety and dissociation, among with other things, so I don‚Äôt think that is a good thing to do, maybe you should give it a try. I deeply suggest writing about what you‚Äôre feeling (like you just did and it‚Äôs amazing), talking to someone you trust about your fears, maybe do some research and try to understand yourself! Don‚Äôt be so hard on you, all of the fear you are feeling is understandable and I also have a tip that I used when I used to self harm, maybe it will work for you: I hold two cubes of ice and I wait for them to melt, my therapist told me to do that and it really helped. Apart from all of that, at night when I could I would invite someone in (someone that i trust) and just to have someone sleeping next to me calmed me down a lot, but if you can‚Äôt, I also watched a lot of meditation and it was really helpful. About medication, they all have side effects at first and I like to believe they are a friend that helps me a lot, but along with it, it‚Äôs really important to take care of yourself, you body too (like drinking enough water, spending a little time in the sun, maybe reading a book).

1,"I would really encourage you to stop self medicating with cannabis in the meantime as it's known to cause and or exacerbate psychotic symptoms in some people. I myself cannot tolerate it for this reason, and I don't have those types of symptoms in its absence. Coincidentally I've been diagnosed with the same mental health issues as you have, so that's one thing you can do...

 I also had psychotic symptoms when I stopped taking benzos as prescribed. This can actually be a symptom of stopping the drug too abruptly. Honestly I feel the combination of my mental health issues plus stopping the medicine all at once is what caused the psychosis for me personally. 

I know what you're feeling is very scary and can empathize with your situation. That said, there are a number of things going wrong that I believe to be aggravating your symptoms, and social isolation is one of them. 

I understand the isolation came about because of the symptoms, but now I think the isolation serves to make things worse for you. This is a common vicious cycle for people dealing with any type of illness. 

Drawing from my own personal experience and what you've written here those are the two lifestyle changes I recommend making to hopefully improve things for you while you wait for more intensive treatment. Give yourself a break from cannabis especially, and finding a safe outlet for socialization. 

You can pick a safe low impact social activity like visiting your local library. This gives you proximity to others without pressure, and all sorts of distracting subject matter to immerse yourself in. 

Finally, while evaluation and proper medication could be super valuable for you, I do worry a bit about it being sort of built up in your mind as your one saving grace, as sometimes hospitalization leaves people in a worse state emotionally. 

Definitely work with a general practitioner on medication management in the meantime and do seek emergency care if you need to about the self harming. I hope there's something useful in here for you...",Most-Shock-2947,17ll7mx

1,"Honestly I don't think it's possible with BPD. Our disorder is too chaotic and characterised by distress for it to be enjoyable. There are some disorders where there are more structured coping mechanisms that allow for the kind of embracing you describe, as the person generally doesn't suffer as much (although in some cases they may make the people around them suffer - but that doesn't always matter to everyone) and what you find with these disorders is that they access treatment less frequently and give up on treatment more frequently. BPD isn't like that though, we spend a disproportionately high amount of our time and clinicians' time trying desperately to fix ourselves because it's the only way.
 
As an aside, I'm moving back to the UK soon and am worried that I am going to be a long time waiting for treatment.

10,"I struggle with this a lot. Sounds like we have a lot in common. I'm 28. I have quiet BPD and although I was diagnosed this year I've suspected I have BPD for several years now. My symptoms started when I was 13. I've been in general individual therapy with 6 different providers over the last 6 years receiving treatment for depression and anxiety, but nothing else. I knew that my mental health situation wasn't that black and white and I was right, but I couldn't find a provider who would actually take it seriously and explore that with me until I found my most recent therapist. She diagnosed and referred me to group DBT which I started before I got the diagnosis. Seems like my old therapists had a hard time believing it because I don't have the stereotypical loud BPD emotional outbursts. Mine are internalized. I very much resent them for that, especially the ones that told me they didn't like to attach labels to their clients.

I see people's ""recovery"" posts on here and I find myself wondering if I actually want to be ""recovered"". Granted, I don't know what exactly that looks like but what I do know is that this disorder has done a lot to shape who I am and although I am generally miserable most days I see myself learning to be content while still going thru the pains of BPD. I've spent so much time developing my own skills before I got in to DBT and have come a very long way, all by myself.

6I don't want to be on medication forever. I'm worried that I'll lose what little identity I have. There are positives to BPD. I'm a very empathetic person who cares deeply about those around him and although feeling emotions as intensely as I do can be painful I also think it has advantages. I want to feel those intense emotions I just need to learn not to turn to self harm, drinking or drugs in order to cope. I don't want to be ""normal"" like everyone else. I have always been different and would like to stay that way. BPD has given me a unique lens through which I look at the world and I'm grateful for it. I see things for the way they really are. I'm good at reading people and can quickly determine if they give off good or bad vibes. I can see when someone is fake and when they're genuine. Because I lacked a concrete identity growing up I got to create my own as an adult instead. I've come so far as a person since I moved out on my own 10 years ago and have worked hard to mold myself to be the person I want to be. My mental health is a product of the abusive environment I grew up in but my personality is not.

Idk, it's just who I am and it's all I know. I've made it nearly 30 years, I'm sure I can make it 50 more. I'm going to finish DBT but so far I've gained very little from it. I'm not afraid of no longer being mentally ill because it's comfortable and all I know, I'm afraid of losing the part of me that makes me who I am. I'm okay with being defined by my mental illness, it's not the only thing that defines me it just plays a huge role in how I operate.

Sorry, that was a word mess this post just got me on a mental tangent so that meant it was time to rant lol.",higleyc99,tfbyg6
11,Regardless whether you decide to stop treatment or not the pain you will feeling will be from living with a untreated condition which can often times feel a lot worse than if you got the support you need though it is not a comfortable process... ultimately the disorder diminishes with time usually late 30s early 40s I would recommend getting extra support it's always better to get help than say fuck it....,,tfbyg6

13,"I think it depends on the degree to which you embrace your BPD. It is great to love and accept yourself, including those parts of you which characterize a borderline personality. However, embracing who you are should not cross over into embracing harmful behaviours, and it‚Äôs important to keep that in mind.

My situation is somewhat different than yours, given that NPD is my primary diagnosis, but I have found that self-acceptance and embracing it to some degree has helped me. I‚Äôve learned to turn my previously maladaptive behaviours into adaptive behaviours and take pride in some of my narcissistic characteristics. 

For example, I‚Äôve been able to tone down arrogance and turn it into confidence. What had previously been a tendency to one-up people and boast excessively, I have turned into pride for genuine achievements and confidence in my abilities while also congratulating others for their achievements and letting them take the spotlight.

While I used to be manipulative for my own gain, I‚Äôve learned to refrain from those behaviours and instead use my persuasion abilities for the benefit of others, bolstering their self-confidence and influencing them to act in healthy, self-supporting ways.

I want to note with these examples I give that I do not embrace the disordered behaviours that had caused harm- I embrace the skills and characteristics underlying those behaviours and use them in ways that benefit the well-being of myself and others. This is what I would recommend to you in terms of embracing your BPD.

I do not know your situation, so this particular recommendation may not resonate with you. Still, I would like to offer an example of how this may apply to your situation. You mentioned you experience emotions of extremes; I believe that with the proper self-control, this is something to embrace. Emotions can be some of the most powerful motivators and are of immense value in creative pursuits such as music, artwork, playwriting- pretty much any form of expression you can think of. Some of the greatest works of art and media are highly emotionally charged, which adds to their appeal. As well as this, channelling your rage into passion and drive can provide you with fuel to pursue what is important to you. As long as you do not let your emotions lead to dysfunctional behaviours such as taking out your rage on loved ones, your emotional intensity is something to embrace and express.

To summarize- find the characteristics that underly your behaviour, embrace and accept the positive aspects, and channel it towards healthy and beneficial behaviours.

Best of luck on your journey. I hope that this is able to help.",wanderingwhiskeyjack,tfbyg6

0,"You fit the criteria. Abstaining from certain stereotypical behaviors and having a certain level of self awareness doesn‚Äôt negate that. 

BPD is madly tricky to diagnose because of the vast spectrum that each diagnosis can fall under, and the contributing factors to the development of the disorder are also really broad. In men especially, it‚Äôs much more common to see misdiagnoses because of how the disorder presents and because of some of the stigma associated with mental and emotional instability in men. Because the disorder IS more commonly diagnosed in women (I think it‚Äôs 1 out of every 7 is men?), the control groups for study are also composed mostly of women, meaning that men aren‚Äôt as commonly represented when it comes to the diagnostic process. Women face a similar resistance to being diagnosed with ADHD for similar reasons. 

Get a second opinion. You‚Äôre in a somewhat unique position where you‚Äôre self-aware enough to recognize how your symptoms are abnormal and may not appropriately fit other diagnoses, but you may be in an unfortunate situation where your health care provider is not comfortable or confident with treating BPD, and may be trying to negotiate a diagnosis that fits better into their expertise.


Edit to add: Even if your therapist continues to insist that you don‚Äôt have BPD, but agrees that you suffer from enough symptoms to qualify for a diagnosis, the treatment methods used for BPD may still be of great value to you, since they‚Äôre designed to treat those core issues. DBT is the most common, with MBT being much less common but statistically more effective.",Dagny1672,10zfgi5

I didn‚Äôt even argue that you only need to meet 5 criteria and that one specific thing can‚Äôt rule you out but I should have. But I still feel like we walked away and changed our therapeutic approach to at least work on coping skills and include some group activity so maybe that will work out better.

0,"The easiest solution I can think of is to start with treatment for CPTSD, which will help with the major emotional dysregulation, while not containing the perceived blame of a BPD diagnosis.

A person with BPD has essentially had their emotions gaslit their entire lives.  From the subjective point of view, of a person with BPD, the conclusions that they are reaching make sense because their nervous system and brain are working together to form a conclusion, even if it is not correct. So to directly contradict their point of view will feel like gaslighting to them. To make this even more confusing often people who have BPD have legitimately been Gaslit and taken advantage of in the past by being deceived or otherwise betrayed.


I unfortunately can‚Äôt offer more than suggesting to her that she may have CPTSD, because she probably does, and if she is able to better manage her emotions with your validation, she may be able to get to the point of not immediately jumping to blame. 

This is also a common tip, but talk to her about your feelings and needs when she is not dysregulated. You are your own person and can only support so much, and it is entirely valid for you to set boundaries in the relationship. But start very small and be consistent in your validation of her but solid in your own personal boundaries in what behavior you will, and will not accept.

1,"Ive tripped on L multiple times at all different kinds of doses. Did 120ug after like a year of doing nothing and I laid on the floor for a good two hours listening to mac millers circles. I heard parts of the song and messages that I swear mac left behind that I've never heard again sober and not like in a schizophrenic way but in a larger, like everything's okay kind of way. Before that, I went for a walk and laid in the middle of a soccer field just watching the stars/moon. It was amazing. After I woke up the next day, I no longer had any suicidal ideations. It was like the pathways in my brain had themselves wiped clean and when I would usually just have those kinds of thoughts come to mind, not only were they weren't there but I had the opportunity to choose new ways about how I was handling what I might be going through in the moment. So instead of going straight to suicide, it was just nothing. Ive found since then that thinking about suicide and forming suicidal ideations ""feels good"" in a sense. Its easy to fall back down that path and so you gotta actively work to choose another way about going about things and I would've never even gotten that opportunity if it weren't for that trip. Now, with that being said, I do believe that anyone who's thinking about using should be in a good mind space, feeling really present with minimal dissociation going on as the chance of getting into something that you can't get out of and as a result having a bad experience are way too high. Once you're there, you're there and there's no coming out so imagine feeling that way and losing track of time all together, looking at a clock and numbers meaning nothing? Thats whats on the table and it's not a pleasant experience, its the kind that could really psychologically fuck somebody up/cause psychosis so if you're going to trip, just make sure its responsibly and you're set/setting and all that are good before hand and be honest with yourself. You can always take more, you can never take less. Just a few principles I try to live by but overall, I would say LSD is amazing at treating some aspects of BPD.

1,"I was older when I was diagnosed too. Wanted to start tackling things right away. There is a sequence you should roughly apply.

First is to deal with the internal distortions that govern your reactivity. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) will give you some tools to question your own assumptions about your place in the world. Things are not what they seem.

Second (or simultaneously with CBT) is to learn tools that help with interpersonal skills. The external component of BPD, which can cause a lot of damage, is fueled by emotional disregulation. DBT - dialectical behavioral therapy, which was invented by Marsha Linehan (a very interesting story behind that), gives you tools to tone down how your internal emotions affect your relationships.

I found group therapy to be very helpful in this endeavor. Listening to other people's experiences and getting input from a wide variety of people was enlightening. I went to a place that had intensive outpatient therapy for a few weeks.

Once you understand these therapies, give yourself some time to make new habits, stop ruminating so much, and internalize new, positive messages to yourself. A month of rigorous mental and emotional hygiene after you learn your new coping skills at a minimum is recommended. 

Journal during this time. Certainly take notes on ideas, insights, and tools that you find helpful. But also be introspective. Write down your feelings and try to trace those feelings back to the negative thoughts and assumptions that are the fuel for those feelings. It may not be evident at first. People with BPD are not very good at understanding why we feel like we do. Those of us who are self-aware understand that our reactions are way out of scale to the inputs from the external world - criticism, adverse events, loss of control, things perceived as aggression (even if they are not meant that way). Getting understanding of why the reaction cycle works the way it does is important.

The last piece of the puzzle is coming to grips with the trauma you experienced early in life that made you adopt the defensive measures that now govern your life. BPD is essentially a suite of hyperactive defense mechanisms. These mechanisms may have made sense at the time of the originating trauma/abuse/neglect/inconstancy but have no place in your life now. The central problem of BPD is not that you are acting inappropriately to negative things happening in the present, but that your emotions are reacting to that earlier problem every time something negative happens now. Emotions don't know how to tell time. The unresolved trauma is just as fresh now as it ever was.

So the final piece is dealing with the trauma, essentially reliving that trauma, as an adult, with all of the knowledge and perspective you have now. The reason for doing the CBT and DBT first is so you have additional armor and tools to be able to adequately address your earlier years. When you are ready, look for a trauma therapist or schema therapy provider (you would particularly like this approach I think). 

[https://www.healthline.com/health/schema-therapy-2](https://www.healthline.com/health/schema-therapy-2)

Again you aren't going to be ready to tackle your earlier trauma until you go through a series of epiphanies about how you are currently acting and what is causing it.

Also understand that there is some upside to BPD.

4,"DBT is the go-to for BPD in my area. I was particularly inspired by Dr. Linehan's story, the founder of DBT. From what I recall, she had BPD or exhibited symptoms thereof, and essentially found that she could think herself out of maladaptive behaviours. DBT is the result of her approaches to improving her own quality of life--and I find that inspirational. She dragged herself out of mandatory stays and into a damn doctorate. 

How to begin this process is a difficult question to answer, as I can only speak to how things work in my Canadian province. But here, I received a referral from my GP to a psychiatrist, and from a psychiatrist to a public clinic. I then had to do yet another assessment at the clinic, and I was triaged into their bpd program. 

When I graduated from the program (which took over 2 years, I might add), they said I ""no longer had the symptoms of bpd""--bs. I feel like I still have those feelings, but I a) no longer harm myself physically in order to cope with them, b) recognize the transience of my emotional states and can tolerate them more readily. 

I don't think that it diminished the intensity of my emotions so much as my willingness to sit with them and challenge them.

11,"Hygiene is the practice of control over some condition or other. Just like oral hygiene keeps gum disease in check, mental hygiene is the use of tools to question the underlying assumptions of your condition. Saying to yourself over and over again, for example, ""no one will ever love me"" is you letting BPD take over (the equivalent of mental gum disease). Mental hygiene means that you question this basic assumption and use real evidence to support the truth of things instead of this obviously false statement. CBT will help instill techniques to be able to question yourself.

Emotional hygiene is basically not letting emotions get out of control. Not all that easy for people with BPD, and is usually the thing that causes the most damage to ourselves and others. So being rigorous in how you deal with your emotional state is important. DBT skills can help you counter out of control emotions.",rtodd23,xpmzg7

first, I remove any non-essential things in my life that cause me stress. any friends that i‚Äôm often doing things for or am unsure about my relationship with, any things i‚Äôm working towards that are difficult but can wait, any plans i may have that I‚Äôm not sure I want to go do, anything like that. make your life as simple and easy as it can be. pick the coping mechanisms that you have that aren‚Äôt bad or aren‚Äôt super harmful and allow yourself to lean on them more. i usually become more lax in my diet, allow myself to spend more time playing games, allow myself to sleep more, stuff like that. find people that are close to you that you can trust and let them know how you are feeling. rely on those close friends when you need support, whether that be through venting or having them do things that you can‚Äôt do yourself without risking stressing yourself out and causing a crisis. these people are here for you and you aren‚Äôt being a bother. during these periods basically the only things i‚Äôm maintaining are a couple friendships, my job, and my monthly payments. once i‚Äôm feeling more stable, I‚Äôll slowly add back more hobby work, work towards bigger goals in my life, bring back friends I set aside for a while, basically reversing all the things I did step by step. bpd is situational emotional instability, and if you can avoid as many instances that would cause you to become emotionally unstable as possible, then it won‚Äôt be as difficult for you to recover from.",byftrash,13mxdi0

6,You will get it everyday for 2 weeks? How long was the procedure? Did you feel anything?,bumblebee5015,ue758y
7,"I go in every day for two weeks (excluding weekends) and I get 3 treatments done in one ‚Äúsession‚Äù or 9 minutes. Theta burst sessions last 3 minutes to have the same effect as a ~30 minute regular Tms session. So I get 3 treatments back to back totalling at 9 minutes. So I will finish the two weeks with the 30 or so sessions still done, just in a shorter time period than normal.

Today I found it a bit painful. My provider is MagVenture and I felt the zapping pretty heavily before my technician lowered the strength. It feels like a strong pressure on your left temple and it also made my eye twitch. It‚Äôs not pleasant but I don‚Äôt think it would qualify as physically painful either. It‚Äôs more like uncomfortable. I think the only thing you need to do is tell your technician when it hurts and they‚Äôll lower the strength just as mine did for me. 

Today instead of feeling worse I feel better. It‚Äôs the first time in almost a month that I‚Äôve had a day where I just feel okay, so that‚Äôs making me feel hopeful! I just feel a little bit lighter and less weighed down by worries and traumas. Like slightly more optimistic.",Clown_17,ue758y

Possibly been misdiagnosed as c PTSD instead of BPD, tried a horde of antidepressants and a few mood stabilizers, none of which worked, and made me suicidal.  I'm so tired of feeling like shit, tired of hoping the next treatment will work.  But I'm trying EMDR and TMS next.  It sucks.",I_like_cakes_,dbg8aw
2,My therapist points out I discuss more of why I dislike DBT than using it. I did a res program with it and am going to a weekly group now. It doesn‚Äôt click for me for a variety of reasons. Mostly I already overly control and think about my emotions so by constantly being told to observe them it freaks me out.,Fallowart,dbg8aw
3,"TMS helped me for a few months and  was the only thing that made me feel happy again (though temporarily). For most it lasts though.

0,"I knew I needed some outside assistance. For starters, I was misdiagnosed bipolar 1 17 years ago. I wasn't aware of this until I switched doctors late 2019. Somewhere in there I had an episode at my mom's house. I am unsure of what triggered me but I felt angry, invalidated, and sad all in one. I screamed so loud my throat hurt and and threw things across the room. I felt so out of control. I was hyperventilating and almost like turning a light switch off, I realized what I had done and things started to clear in my head. I needed help. I can't treat other people like this, although these episodes have only been few and far between. I can't act like this. I am not this person, whether these are valid emotions or not, this is not how I want to act. As soon as I could speak, I apologized and told my mom I needed help.

This woman has been through the ringer with me emotionally starting with that first diagnosis. During this episode I was already on medication and seeing therapists etc for treatment, but DBT has really been an eye opener. It was hard to admit I needed help, but seeing the fear and sadness in my mom's eyes drove it home. I had to do it not just for me, but for my loved ones too.",sparklew0lf,k8ng4u
1,"It was me who take the choose but it was complicated for me as I was wondering for many years if the suffering I feel is ""normal"" (because everybody suffers) or it is more than ""necessary"". What made it even harder was that my anxiety/episodes could totally disappear and just re-appear again. For long, when I was in one state, I couldn't understand the other. But then I changed perspective and I was trying to focus on the fact that I'm wondering about that for years. It doesn't matter if it above or below some imagined normality if it makes me feel bad and makes me thinking about that from time to time. So then I went to psychodrama, just to see what'll happen (I didn't think I have anything particular, I was just giving a chance. And it was one of the best choice I've ever made. It made me realize many things, and make even more questions in a good sense.

So when I finished psychodrama, I had the knowledge and sense that I have stuff to work on. After a few months I went to psychotherapy and now we're doing schema therapy for 3 months - and that was the place when I first heard about borderline in my own context.",LeniOrNot,k8ng4u
2,"I was firstly diagnosed with bipolar in 2019, after I had a psychotic episode and had to go to the hospital. After that I started treatment and in the beginning of 2020 my psychiatrist said I had, also, BPD, we discovered that because of my clingy attitude and fear of abandonment, I continued with treatment because I destroyed a relationship with my friend because of a rage attack whch I don't remember.

0,"It isn't fair that your wife won't get help for such a potentially destructive issue. The negative effect that I have of others is a main reason for me seeking treatment. I saw that my explosions and irrational thinking were not only embarassing, but these behaviors were getting the opposite of my desired effect. I would feel rejection and in turn I would push people far away with all the power I could muster and with every harsh word I could think of when I really craved the opposite. I wanted to be approached, seen, heard, loved, etc but my behavior made that impossible for anyone to do.

I suggest that you equip yourself with all the information possible for a spouse in your situation. I know any old book on BPD can help you get some insight into what your wife is going through and where she is coming from but I also remember seeing books specifically for those with BPD affected spouses.

Honestly this is more so the work that your wife needs to be putting in but if you decide to stay in a situation such as this you should at the very least help yourself instead of waiting for your wife to do something she said she wouldn't do.",Zamily,r5kw5f
1,"Well here‚Äôs the thing. You‚Äôre not listening to her. She told you that you can‚Äôt help her. And what the fuck are you doing? You‚Äôre here. Trying to help her. Because [Nobody‚Äôs listening. ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ87793QXes) I want you to listen to that song. And while you listen to it remember it is sang by Chester Bennington. Who suffered from BPD. Who took his own life because of the pain he was in. That‚Äôs why your wife doesn‚Äôt believe you can help her. Because you aren‚Äôt listening to her. You aren‚Äôt taking her pain seriously. Nobody takes our pain seriously. Whenever she has her bad times you treat like someone with a broken leg. Treat her like a rape victim. (Most of us are anyways) Walk up to her like you would an injured animal you know is gonna bite if you touch the injury. Show her you believe her. Show her you‚Äôre listening. After about a year or two she should trust you enough that she‚Äôll follow your advice. Dialectical Behavior Therapy has worked for many of us. Medicinal Magic Mushrooms with a therapist to Sherpa them through has worked for some of us and many soldiers with P.T.S.D. It‚Äôs all about healing the long term potentiations in our brains caused by the trauma we‚Äôve suffered. It links our amygdala (fight or flight) with our trauma. So when we experience negative stimuli our amygdala gives us an involuntary ‚Äúhey‚Äô you‚Äôre about to get fucking raped again!!!!!‚Äù We are hit with a tsunami of emotions. We can‚Äôt think straight when we‚Äôre like that. Fucking nobody can. How would you like to be running from a bear, scared shitless just for someone to tell you to calm down and stop overreacting??? 

Listen to your wife. BPD‚Äôers will tell you exactly what they need. We‚Äôre just ignored until hurts enough to check out.",IchibanSuzuki,r5kw5f
2,"She will probably need help finding a therapist that takes her seriously and treats her compassionately. It's extremely hard, especially right now with therapy being in such high demand. It was so hard for me as someone who struggles with rejection to constantly hear that there was no one available to help me after years of struggling with even making the attempt.

If she's able to start therapy and stay in it and have progress, the best thing you can do for her then is to be compassionate and patient while maintaining reasonable boundaries. I'd recommend that you try to avoid information from people who do not have the disorder and are not clinical psychologists. Many people post online about surviving people with BPD and the experience are describing what is actually someone with a narcissistic personality disorder versus a borderline one.

Talk to a narcissist and it's everyone else's fault they aren't loved. Narcissist think they're the only people in the entire universe. Borderline's think we're never good enough, will never be good enough, and we're the only people in the whole universe that don't matter. Or maybe don't even exist at all.

This disorder is a measureable and previously recorded phenomenon that has very good reasons for existing, it's a massive protection system and she is very much still using it. She needs to learn that she's treating you and the world around her like she's still in the danger that she was in when she was young and truely needed these mechanisms. Learning about it, and accepting that these protection systems are detrimental to your lives is the only way to dismantle it and if she never puts the work in, she won't change.",Zamily,r5kw5f

That's pretty much normal. Most therapists will have 4-6 years of education, and will have learned ""about"" the major mental illnesses, but treatment options like DBT, CBT and anything like an expertise of any illness are usually learned on the job or in trainings after graduation. Most therapists are not equipped to treat mental illness, and offer supportive talk sessions, which can have a benefit, but it's not the same as treatment.

1,It's very dependent on location. Everywhere has differing quality of staff and services. The one I stayed in indiana was not nearly as good as the one in colorado. But when you self admit you can obviously choose when you want to leave but if you leave before they want you to they won't help you once you get out with finding therapy or medication management or anything. They'll kinda just send you on your way. When I was in the colorado facility I stayed 9 days. It was a very nice environment to be surrounded by people going through the same thing. In a typical day you attend group therapy/classes. You go to the cafeteria and all that and the rest of the day is pretty much watching tv or otherwise occupying yourself. All of this is in my experience of course. I've only been to two facilities. But in the indiana facility I was not placed with people going through the same thing so the environment was not nearly as nice at all.,,wxni7d
2,"I did and it‚Äôs where I was properly diagnosed.

Could have done with more to be honest. But what I did get was a chance to exist without being scared of hurting myself and knowing if I had an episode of despair or a huge anxiety attack that I was under the care of people who knew what to do. I‚Äôd recommend it if you feel like you‚Äôve tried everything else and you can afford to facilitate the time off work etc. but do speak up for yourself and advocate for your own care when there too. In the uk you could end up a way away from home like I did (1.5hrs) because the nhs is struggling for beds always, so just be prepared to utilise the time and freedom from life to reset and remember how to human again.",Logical_Rutabaga3707,wxni7d
3,"Like previously mentioned it‚Äôs really dependent on the place you go. I went to a wonderful residential place in Wisconsin through a place called Rogers and they did incredible work there. While I know it may not be accessible to you to go there specifically, Rogers is a great company and they seem to really care. I think they may have a couple locations throughout the country. I had been to a residential in Illinois before that and had an awful time. The first time I stayed with Rogers, it was about 42 days. The second time around a year later was about 50. I‚Äôve been through so so many inpatients and PHPs and had individual counseling through all my adult life and can easily say that my time in residential helped the most. Since you‚Äôre living with people going through a similar experience, it‚Äôs so much easier to ditch those feelings of alienation and you‚Äôre much less likely to isolate. Even if you don‚Äôt have an issue with isolation it‚Äôs so helpful to be living with people who understand. The 24/7 help is a life saver. Generally they‚Äôll still follow a schedule of seeing your primary providers once or twice a week (including a therapist, maybe a behavioral specialist, a psychiatrist, a dietician, and possibly if you‚Äôre interested someone who attends to spiritual/religious needs) but if it‚Äôs a good program they will typically try to have someone you can talk to at anytime (barring another patient isn‚Äôt in need) I know it can get exhausting to keep up with appointments, and inconsistencies personally led me to hopelessness due to feeling like I‚Äôm just waiting for the next session of whatever it is. From my experience and what I‚Äôve heard of other places too it‚Äôs really hard work, they run tight schedules. Not a lot of free time, but that‚Äôs the goal. I also feel that since your situation is a bit more unique and your stay a little less temporary, providers are more likely to be more real with you. At my last stay and my last time doing any formal type of treatment, my psychiatrist who I‚Äôd grown quite fond of told me straight up ‚Äúyour life fucking sucks right now. You gotta do something different, leave home, do something meaningful‚Äù and provided me with a website that got me a job in a national park and I never ever looked back. 

I‚Äôm rambling a bit now, and I don‚Äôt want to ultimately tell you this is the only and best way to move forward because everyone needs something different. Residential just helped me immensely and I feel very passionate about it. I hope you found this helpful in anyway and I wish you the best of luck with your treatment.

If you're anything like me, I get really anxious learning something new when I don't know what to expect so getting a base line knowledge of dbt and ita creator can help ease some of those what ifs. Marsha is amazing and one of the best things about her is that she also suffered from BPD when she was younger. She developed dbt specifically to help other like her. Also youtube has some good videos on the topic. Bpd mom , psychology in seattle, McLean Hospital, Bessle Van Der Holt , and Pete Walker are great channels to check out for a deep dive into the origins manifestations and treatment of dbt.

for example, if you were like a mega genius, they would need to alter their therapy styles to match your intelligence. if you think better with pictures than with words, they may want to adjust how they approach teaching DBT skills so that it's actually helpful to you and easier for you to retain the knowledge.

I'm just guessing though. In my experience this isn't standard (or hasn't been for me), but this might be a new standard, or it may be something special your doctor's office is doing to try to make their therapy more effective. i don't think the goal is to measure your intelligence so much as to figure out your learning style.",bog_slut420,panhp3

I can picture a situation where insurance has decided that DBT is not effective for profoundly mentally disabled people or developmentally delayed people as opposed to other types of therapy.

If that were the case I can picture a situation where your therapist has to ""prove"" you arent in those categories to get this specific type of therapy even though it is obvious you are not.

This may not be the deal but notice how it could absolutely be some red tape bullshit and have literally nothing to do with you personally. My gut says it probably is.

0,Yea I think borderlines can self sabotage and push away. It may be due to previous disappointments in the past or just feeling unworthy.

There's definitely an element of self sabotaging. I just feel like I deserve to suffer and be miserable. My therapist told me that I'm severely depressed so I think maybe it also comes from that. 

The thing is, if I tell this to someone I feel like I'm being fake and in my head I feel guilty because I, or at least part of me, is kicking myself because I've 'let the secret out' and undone all efforts to really damage myself and feel like I want to die.

6,"Absolutely you could potentially benefit. A lot. And pretty much immediately. Ketamine actually is frequently given in ERs when they get patients who are suicidal or self-harming. It just makes those feelings disappear (in my experience). 

It‚Äôs a dissociative psychedelic analgesic so everyone‚Äôs experience is different‚Äî but they all share the relief of almost all physical pain. Some people only need to do it once or twice and it alleviates depression or other symptoms permanently. Others (like me) benefit from a weekly treatment‚Äî it can be intense (in a good way), profoundly liberating and/or help you to zero in on exactly what you need/want from life again. 

I completely connect with feeling like an emotionless husk with a body and no soul. And when there is a soul, every moment of existence is agony. I feel you. 

Ketamine is a game changer, but of course there is no one size fits all medication. Some people hate it, I‚Äôm sure, some people it just makes them sleepy, but the only way to know is to try.

Remember that the immediate psychedelic effect can be quite a ride for some people, but it only lasts for 15 min and then things chill out (not like mushrooms or whatever at all where you‚Äôre tripping balls for hours). Generally you‚Äôre supervised in clinic for a couple of hours. 

I‚Äôm someone who gets anxiety now from even just smoking weed and Ketamine treatments are something I actually look forward to.

Something else I should note is that the experiences I have from week to week actually vary significantly. Sometimes I cry, sometimes I laugh and am joking around, it all depends.

9,"Oh, yeah I have clinical treatment-resistant depression. As well as clinically diagnosed BPD, GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), ADD, and PTSD. I also get non-epileptic seizures and have chronic nerve pain and TMJ in my jaw so it‚Äôs a fun basket of issues! 

So in addition to my Ketamine treatments, I‚Äôve been evolving over several years with trial and error with different medication to treat my complex set of symptoms. Currently I‚Äôm prescribed Lexapro (for major depression and anxiety), Lamotrigine (mood stabilizer), Adderall (for ADD), Gabapentin (for anxiety/major depression/nerve pain/seizure prevention) as well as Baclofen (for TMJ). 

When even through ALL THAT I started self-harming again after being stable for a couple years my new psychiatrist recently added Rexulti (an antipsychotic that‚Äôs also used for easing borderline symptoms especially mood stabilization as well as treatment-resistant depression) at the same time as the ketamine treatments. 

Funnily enough that seems to have done the trick so much that mild side effects of depression have become my most pronounced symptoms, mainly resulting in tiredness. The shame, pain, guilt have faded to whispers in the background that I can more easily not let dominate my mental state if I‚Äôm distracted. 

Tiredness being my main problem now I‚Äôm ok with if it means I don‚Äôt wake up dreading every hour, every minute, every second of existence and wishing I could disappear like a ghost with no one remembering me so that it wouldn‚Äôt hurt them and I could end the brutal suffering. 

Everyone is different, but I will say the Rexulti and Ketamine seem to have helped both my depression and BPD significantly and other people in my life see it even more than I do. My thoughts have gone from crippling ‚ÄúI wish I could die, I can‚Äôt stand the thought of making it through another day and I am an enormous burden to the few people who care about me, I should cut myself‚Äù to something more like ‚Äúlife sucks, but it kind of does for everyone, and it sucks more for me in lots of ways, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm a terrible person but at least I‚Äôm trying to get better. And at least food doesn‚Äôt taste like cardboard anymore and I have so much gratitude for everything I do have, even if it comes with horrifying guilt.‚Äù 

6 weeks ago I was literally drowning, and now I feel like I‚Äôve been thrown a lifesaver ring. I‚Äôm still in the water, but at least I‚Äôm not going under.",vinoprosim,vffmgi
10,"To add to that, ketamine is used for treatment-resistant depression and PTSD patients too. It is definitely intense, but if you ride the wave, it‚Äôs actually a fascinating ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from depressive symptoms because it is a dissociative. 

Ironically being a dissociative means the experience of ketamine may feel like a complete detachment from the environment and the ‚Äúself‚Äù ‚Äî and the extent of ‚Äúego dissolution‚Äù during treatment is actually directly associated with more positive outcomes on the patient‚Äôs perception of their life post-treatment. [Sauce 1](https://revitalizinginfusions.com/why-we-strive-for-ego-death-with-psychedelics/)

It‚Äôs notoriously difficult to put any ‚Äúpsychedelic‚Äù experiences into words (and I‚Äôm even a professional writer!) but a rough translation is something like‚Ä¶ you cease to become an emotionless husk during treatment because there is no ‚Äúhusk‚Äù to be emotionless. You‚Äôre sort of not a person anymore‚Äî just a free-floating entity simply experiencing. What you experience is going to be completely subjective to what your brain decides you need. I couldn‚Äôt even begin to put what I actually experience into words. Well, I could try, but I would sound like some insane hippy burnout. ‚ÄúThere is no ‚ÄòI‚Äô, you‚Äôre just one with the cosmos, dude.‚Äù 

During my last treatment, one phrase I kept thinking was ‚Äúwow, this is like a spa, but for the brain instead of the body.‚Äù Another metaphor: our brains‚Äî much like muscle tissue‚Äî can get fibers and fascia tangled and twisted causing severe pain. Ketamine feels like a deep tissue massage at a spa, it can be uncomfortable as hell to iron out those knots, but at the same time pleasurable. Sort of like that pleasurable soreness after the gym. You come out the other side feeling more centered after having had a ‚Äúbrain vacation‚Äù

Neuroscientists are still figuring out how exactly ketamine does what it does. According to Harvard Health: 
 >*One likely target for ketamine is NMDA receptors in the brain. By binding to these receptors, ketamine appears to increase the amount of a neurotransmitter called glutamate in the spaces between neurons. Glutamate then activates connections in another receptor, called the AMPA receptor. Together, the initial blockade of NMDA receptors and activation of AMPA receptors lead to the release of other molecules that help neurons communicate with each other along new pathways. Known as synaptogenesis, this process likely affects mood, thought patterns, and cognition.*

Medication can help with symptoms that comes from BPD like depression,anxiety,ocd, etc. But the actual treatment for BPD is therapy more specifically DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY (DBT). DBT isnt like the therapy you see on tv. Its a skills based program which helps you sort your problematic thinking that leads to emotional distress. The program is typically done in a group setting and does often included 1 on 1 therapy with a counselor but that is in addition to the skills class just to help you keep on track. So its not really diving in the deep end into all your painful memories not unless you want it to be. PTSD is a completly different program. You need a trauma program to help with that. Unfortuently for both of these issues you need to face them or theyll never go away. Youll keep pushing it away and it will come back as a problematic behaviour.

Related advice since it sounds like he's in a bad place right now: be very gentle with him at this time. Remind him that you care and that you're here for him. And don't take anything he says personally. Believe me when I say we have *zero* filter, and while it doesn't make it okay for us to say and do the things we do when we're upset, but we have no control over it. We also have no concept of emotional permanence, so right now he may be genuinely feeling like you hospitalized him because you hate him and/or don't care about him.

2,"C-PTSD and BPD are nowhere near the same thing and I find it somewhat disrespectful to both individual experiences to consider them one and the same. They can be comorbid, absolutely, I speak as someone diagnosed *with both*, but there is a reason BPD is considered a personality disorder and not a trauma disorder. 

First of all, its development is not solely based on environmental components like PTSD is. There is a genetic factor. If you have family with cluster B personality disorders, you are far more likely to develop it ‚Äî and there *is* a reason BPD is classed alongside ASPD, HPD, or NPD. They breed each other and intermingle. Those three are pretty common comorbidities with BPD as well. All of these things have environmental factors when developing, but trauma is not required when diagnosing any of them. 

Trauma therapy can also be helpful for a lot of us, but the reason we often don't receive adequate treatment is because of stigma. PDs are notoriously hard to diagnose and treat, and doctors know that and don't like that. The treatment for BPD and (C-)PTSD are also different, especially when it comes to medication. I take different medications for my BPD and C-PTSD ‚Äî if I go without the meds for one, the other starts to act up. There's also different approaches to therapy from an individualistic level. 

I want to clarify that none of these are a ""bad"" thing, ASPD and/or NPD do not make someone a bad person. We are a lot more similar to them than we often think. I think the real key is accepting that fact and squashing stigma against ""scary"" PDs instead of brushing BPD off as ""just a form of PTSD"", because it's very much not.",dogwithab1rd,1bvw5l4

my CPTSD is from a prolonged period of various forms of abuse, and neglect. i was subjected to things i should have been protected from, and i had nobody to turn to. i knew as soon as i was old enough to know anything that i had no agency and no protection.

CPTSD manifests in me as flashbacks, as night terrors, chronic insomnia and panic attacks. my BPD makes me vulnerable, emotional and a slave to my unpredictable moods and responses to others.

i‚Äôve done a year of EMDR and it has helped in a couple of areas. it has made no difference to my BPD. 

i take antipsychotics and antidepressants for my BPD and my Major Depressive Disorder. my BPD can make me manic, or psychotic. i have no sense of identity. i struggle with interpersonal relationships (i suspect autism is a factor here but that‚Äôs something else i need to be assessed for).

my CPTSD simply makes me afraid. i‚Äôm 51. i‚Äôm afraid of the dark, of mirrors, of 3.15am. i‚Äôm frightened at night and i cannot sleep, because my abuse and trauma was worst at night. it was always there, it was just worse at night.

BPD makes my life extremely difficult. so does my MDD, my GAD, my OCD and my CPTSD. but, they are not all the same thing.

CPTSD triggers panic. BPD makes my emotional response to that panic unpredictable. my internal life is chaos. i learned from infancy that my emotional response did not matter. so i never learned safely how to manage my emotions. they were simply ignored. CPTSD is rooted in events that play over and over in my head like a showreel of horrors. BPD just reminds me that i‚Äôm completely alone in a world that doesn‚Äôt care to understand me. 

please don‚Äôt tell me what i do and don‚Äôt struggle with. BPD and CPTSD are not the same thing.",BINGGBONGGBINGGBONGG,1bvw5l4
9,Im very happy you finally got treatment that works for you. Im sorry you were initally misdiagnosed.,_-whisper-_,1bvw5l4
10,"I thinks it's important to remember that the primary difference between these disorders is that trauma is not a necessary component for BPD, actually! Literally, you can just wake up with it one day because of a genetic disposition. C-PTSD requires repetitive, long-term exposure to trauma. The two frequently overlap because some people can develop BPD as a sort of protection mechanism, but the two are capable of existing separately from one another :00",LaserBatBunnyUnder,1bvw5l4
11,"I have both cptsd and Bpd.
My main problem with Bpd is my fear of abandonment, intense emotions that change very rapidly and an unstable sense of self. 
Cptsd doesn‚Äôt have a fear of abandonment and unstable sense of self as a symptom, instead it has ptsd-like symptoms with a few different things in it. 
Someone diagnosed with cptsd doesn‚Äôt deal with fear of abandonment, they don‚Äôt have black and white thinking (all in or all out). 

Although‚Äî>Ppl with cptsd could have a very intense and rapid emotions, BUT ONLY in results of being triggered off of their flashbacks or nightmares.
But this doesn‚Äôt mean that they are the same, since the CAUSE (flashbacks from traumatic events for cptsd and black and white thinking for Bpd) of the similar symptoms (intense and rapid emotions) doesn‚Äôt mean that a patient that has cptsd also has Bpd or vise versa.

When I have episodes, I can usually tell why I am having them and what the root cause is. For example (cptsd); if I can smell candles that are lit, I‚Äôll freeze and my head will go into having flashbacks where I was physically abused. The sent of candles in my head are attached to these traumatic events.‚Äî>Bc it smelled like the sent of candles when I was abused. And that‚Äôs cptsd.

I can tell you that I‚Äôve met ppl with Bpd and they don‚Äôt act like me when they are talking about their trauma, compared to me, who when I start to think a lil bit too much of my childhood I start feeling dizzy and I start dissociating from reality.

For Bpd, my fear of abandonment will get triggered if a friend leaves me on read. I‚Äôll start crying, I‚Äôll have a panic attack and will call them asking if they are going to leave me behind and if I did something wrong to them and that I am sorry for anything that I did that I don‚Äôt remember and blah blah blah it‚Äôs just me being extremely, extremely worried of the future of our friendship.

I don‚Äôt think anyone who ONLY has cptsd will ever act like that over a friend leaving them on read. (Except if they brain is fried af lol)


Honestly it‚Äôs okay to have ur own opinions about things but u have to realize that some ppl might read ur post and could just think they have Bpd or cptsd and it might happen that a symptom might be neglected bc it doesn‚Äôt fit the mental disorder symptoms that they chose. It could harm them in the long run.

if you are genuinely serious and passionate about looking for the truth between Bpd and cptsd, go study them and I don‚Äôt mean a quick google search I mean go study in a college or university, look for LEGIT studies, researches made by colleges and universities. You‚Äôll learn a lot from them and then you can make your final judgement. But for now I don‚Äôt think it was a good idea to make a Reddit post bc someone could read this and it could affect them negatively on the long run.

Reasons why I think i have BPD:

- Chaotic and unstable pattern of relationships 
- Episodes of paranoia and dissociation
- Impulsive/reckless behaviour episodes 
- Self harm (did not grow out of)
- Extreme anger outbursts
- Identity issues
- value and devaluing someone (I try hard not to let it show, so I internalise it until it passes, but sometimes I can't control this)
- Emotions can be absent or I feel fucking everything and it's so painful physically and emotionally 


CPTSD differences:

- Traumatic childhood to adulthood that lasted until I was 25
- I've been through every single type of abuse
- Dissociation from childhood to cope mentally
- Emotional absent and neglectful parents
- Anxiety and depression 
- substance abuse
- Inability to relate to others/connect emotionally",808drumzzz,1bvw5l4

cPTSD can walk alongside just about any disorder (or those without) as there's no telling when a person will run into trauma multiple times/for a long period of time.

with neurodivergence in general, we are more likely to run into traumatic experiences (like you said) but that's not what defines BPD. sure in some cases it may be the cause, but like most people have said it also has a genetic cause.

as someone who was diagnosed initially with BPD but was reevaluated to have cPTSD and OCD (i also have ASD and getting evaluated for ADHD however that's besides the point), they're definitely distinguishable though it's hard to tell at first glance.

Also, for me personally, I genuinely believe I was born with BPD, or was at least predisposed to it and had symptoms of it *very* early on in my life. I believe people can be born with other cluster B disorders too. My PTSD came long after the signs of BPD did, developmentally speaking, and then the PTSD made the BPD worse, so on and so forth. As a very young child, there was no real reason for me to act the way I did, nothing had happened to me yet. I just *did*.",dogwithab1rd,1bvw5l4

103,"ty ty ty I'm aware it's not easy to talk to me sometimes but I am earnest and sincere.  I'm not sure what you're describing looks like; so you grew up under a rainbow eating  birthday cake with your family and would exibit symptoms out of the blue?  Being torpedoed or excavated from your existence at birth was not part of what primed your body to fall down a rabbit hole of rejection at stuff like weaning or toilet training?  A segment of folks with anxiety disorders describe wanting basic soothing at their core: to be held as they fall asleep, to not wake up completely alone.  Really basic desires that stand out for how deeply their lack devastates a person into adulthood.  

I grew up in a community where by far and away most people are deeply affected by Cluster B PDs (survivors of genocide).  As a result, all of that experience one could say is unique to contributing to and perpetuating that type of intergenerational trauma is just normal and baked in to the background.  I am very distrustful of people needing to control a narrative with black and white thinking and lack of nuance.",ferrule_cat,1bvw5l4
104,"I wanted to take time to think about the what about dissociative disorders -- you mean other than the one we're already talking about?    BPD is a highly dissociative disorder, not to the extent of Schitzoid PD or DID, but we're in there amongst the greenery.  People living with those diagnoses did not develop them by having a holly, jolly Christmas; generally, some shit went down while their little ape brain was growing and resulted in neurons not connecting as intended to result in disorders that are remarkably consistent across society and cultures.  

Models of evolutionary psychology use the concept of a group of fifty to eighty people working together to enhance survival.  No wheel, food was difficult to obtain.  Conserved behaviours that enhanced survival were driven by a stark and brutal reality.  The primary barriers to entry in the human race were surviving being born, then surviving being a baby.  In order to STAY in the human race, you had the additional hurdles of surviving to reproductive years and finding a mate who had achieved the same.  Get that partner to survive pregnancy and ideally giving birth so they can help care for the offspring.  This is how humanity survived all those millenia with nothing more than some sticks and a can-do attitude.",ferrule_cat,1bvw5l4
105,"From what I have heared and read, cluster Bs at least always need a genetical predisposition. When I was in kindergarten I was already behaving noticeably different. Back then everyone pushed it on my adhd, but I never fit in with adhd kids either. The first close friend I had (bejond my sister) was in elementary school, the other child that threw tables at ppl and cried loudely when he didn't want to studdy anymore. Ig bc we related bc of our intense feelings and impulses but that's just guessing now. So far facts are tho: B PDs need the genetical tendency to develop and then a few pushes to ""grow"".",Grimm___s,1bvw5l4
106,"To address both of your comments at once and to be wholly honest with you: yes, as a small child, I did exhibit symptoms pretty much out of the blue. I've always had *severe* attachment issues, namely with my mom. I had really bad anxiety whenever she'd leave me alone. I'd spend hours crying at preschool waiting for her to come back to get me, she couldn't hold down a part-time job because I'd panic when she left ‚Äî these were all baseless, relatively speaking, and then it got worse when things actually started to crumble in my household and traumatic things began to happen. I attribute some of my attachment issues at that age to my autism, but I also wholly believe they were precursors to BPD. Perhaps somebody fucked up somehow when I was a baby and it left a permanent mark on my psyche, I don't know, I don't exactly remember. But I do believe that genetics played a massive part in what led me to be who I am today. I'm not entirely certain on who or where I inherited those symptoms from, but I do know that I was not the first or last person in my family to have exhibited that behavior at a young age ‚Äî I'm also definitely not the first or last person to be cluster B.

Trauma manifests in a million different ways and no one's experience is truly the same ‚Äî same thing with BPD. It's a very, *very* complex and nuanced disease. You could talk to 50 different people with BPD and you'd understand them on an intrinsic level, but also be nothing like them at the same time. It's all a spectrum. And at the end of the day, the real reason BPD develops is kind of speculatory; we don't *truly* know, same thing with other cluster Bs. Maybe it really is rooted in the personality, as the name entails. Maybe our understanding of everything is all wrong. But the current consensus is that genetics and environment combine to make the puzzle pieces fit together.

TLDR: all I know is what the modern science says and what I have experienced.",dogwithab1rd,1bvw5l4
107,"That's pretty much what I've been trying to say! If I wasn't born with it, I *did* have the predisposition for it, and all the calamitous things that happened in my life kinda pulled the trigger for it to fully develop. My psychiatrist agrees with that hypothesis. I think a lot of others have had very similar experiences.",dogwithab1rd,1bvw5l4
108,"ty for sharing your experience.  The initial symptoms you describe, those are not what I'd call occurring out of the blue.  Your infant and toddler self's trauma was abandonment, and that trauma made you express distress in the characteristic ways it rolls out during development.  Experiencing symptoms out of the blue would be getting triggered every time someone gave you Jell-o, or you saw a red bird in a tree.  In your case your parent was doing normal parenty things like work, and while most children receiving the level of parental attunement you were, they would be able to sort out the abandonment part on their own with a little help, children whose trauma is abandonment do not and cannot without serious insight from a caregiver.

I fully appreciate that PDs are complex and nuanced and diverse and we really need to be a wizard to detect them.  Except not really; our crap boundaries and emotional disregulation tip our hand every single time.  We are all hyperexpressive with our facial muscles when emotionally charged, noticeably moreso than a similarly emotionally charged neurotypical person is.  We all know what that euphoria is like, it's the fking best.  We all know that waking nightmare devastation.  Psychologists who've developed insight into PDs, they're not surprised by it when it comes to light, you know?  The signs are there around boundaries, a fixation on relationships and getting exgtremely volatle around them, disordered eating and other things that come from dissociating as a response to core trauma.  Like, it's complex and nuanced but it's not an eternal mystery only an oracle can divine.  It just takes insight and understanding.

eta SOURCE: have reparented myself to recover from severe childhood PTSD, which how I refer to my trauma from ages outside the criteria for a BPD diagnosis.

110,"Genuine question: how does one have a deep-set psychological abandonment wound as a literal, actual baby? Like, the example I gave was from toddlerhood, but I wasn't an easy infant either ‚Äî according to my parents I was a colicy baby with sensory issues from very early on, I could not be left alone for any period of time, etc. etc. I'm not saying your argument has zero merit, but these are things that can and do occur out of the blue. These are things that *are* genetic; while there is no ""BPD gene"", if it already exists in your family, your genes are way more likely to combine in ways that make you more likely to pop out of the womb already predisposed to it. It's ridiculous to assume that everyone who is mentally ill has some, like, core wound from that one time their parent put them down a second too early for their liking as a literal infant, or something. It's like how people have things like dementia or type 2 diabetes in their families, or bad teeth, or bad eyesight. All of those are genetic ‚Äî not *entirely* so, but there is an undeniable link.

Just look at how perspectives on maternity health issues have progressed; giving birth has transformed from a thing that was not discussed openly and just something women did sometimes, to being acknowledged as a medical event comparable to major surgery.  For an infant, being outside the mother's womb in some cold hard place is genuine trauma.

BPD ""can't be treated"" by medication. Many of us do take some medication to help us with our own worst symptoms. Antidepressants for some, anti anxiety for some, mood stabilizers for some, antipyscotics for some.

2,"I believe that is not the only but the most important way to live with BPD.
When I was at my worse 5 years ago (I tried to kill myself 5 times, had severe anxiety and depression) I did therapy and also medication. The best therapy for BPD as far as I know is very specific, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and at least in my country, the basic studies of psychiatries and psychologists don‚Äôt even teaches then, is like and extra they need to learn after graduation if they want to do it. 
I don‚Äôt understand how you will do it to yourself honestly, even if you knew how to do it I don‚Äôt think it works that way. Of course having healthy habits is important but you basically have a different way to see the world with this disorder, it‚Äôs something deep in your personality so probably is not enough. 
When I was stable for example they stoped my medication and I kept only the therapy and nowadays I have a completely normal life and I‚Äôm not suffering all the time. I‚Äôm not even always on therapy now, just when I feel that something can trigger me enough. But at the beginning yes I was once a week or every other week to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù my thoughts.",AbleValuable133,1bepwvs
3,"I suffered a lot, I had no choices but therapy.
There are pros and cons to it.

I did EMDR (for traumas) and schema therapy (for mild BPD or quiet BPD and codependency)

The pros

It help reduce the high and lies, EMDR did reduce my triggers by 80%, once upon a time I felt really peaceful if it wasn't for my bad choices due to ingrained coping mechanisms.

Then I started schema therapy.

It helped me name where I am in my head.
Am I leading the trajectory or is fear leading ?
Am I dissociated or still anchored in reality?
To quote one horrific person but still a good quote ""you've gotta name it to claim it"" (Dr Phil, I know just his name gives me nausea, still...)

Allow the above where emotionally very demanding.
Therapist needs to be well trained and accustomed to PD and Trauma (meaning either they're gifted or they suffered a lot too)
(Very few are gifted, dome pretend to, most of them had a lit of extreme feelings to)

It's great when done well.

You get to know yourself and you win control over your life and emotions.

You start yo understand that all isn't gloom and doom and you'll start to feel like life has worth instead of wishing daily to ve out of the game.

The cons

While you're doing that your life seems ""on hold"" which can trigger anger and frustration.
Although your life is definitely on hold with a PD if you learn how to live with it you can still function.

You can't hide and you'll have to face yourself. This is the hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life.
Blaming my abusers, feeling like a victim felt like a breeze compared to that.

If you are in the US the Golden standard for BPD is DBT. I find it somewhat abusive myself as I am also a cult victim
I preferred schema therapy,  that gave me the source of the pain and the solution. 
I can chose to use it or not, at my own expense 

Therapy IS REALLY demanding for PD's. You've got to destruct your identity to built a new one. This is now in the cons but should be on both side.
It's excruciating but salvation. 

Therapy IS DAILY COMMITMENT! If you do not want that, do not even start.
Either you'll feel more as a victim or worse end up more damaged.

You've got to want it really bad in order to make it work.

Conclusion 

If I had a comfortable life and my PD in check I would never have searched for therapy. 
Life threw me so much lemon that I couldn't slip away.
I mean the pain was unbearable.
It was either therapy or suicide. 
I chose to live.


I do not blame anyone avoiding therapy. 
If there was a magic pill I would have gladly taken it.

For PD's there isn't,  unfortunately. 

Unless you want to be numb all day (which I would totally get btw)

Good luck to you on your way forward.

It might just mean therapist shopping, which can be expensive. You might not connect with the first ones you meet. And yes, actually applying skills is needed - and I always sucked at that, however once I got into DBT I started using the skills almost unknowingly. I also made it a habit to write down every emotion I felt and discover the reason I felt that way and ask myself if my reaction was necessary/appropriate. Shit like that. It got easier every time.

He requires walking, self care, food, organized living that didn't allow for degenerate chaos (this person experienced).

Bonus thing: dog picks up her vibe meeting people, and growls if something off.. I don't know or think she gets what's happening (she V smart, grown woman well educated) and I'm not gonna spoil the magic.

The doc cleverly express her inner vibes and ""if he doesn't like you"" it's not gonna happen. Allowing her far greater autonomy, conscious or not.

>Thanks for sharing your experience. EMDR has been difficult for me to pick up but maybe with the right therapist it can work.

Depends where you're at. I was in the midst of a storm PTSD then. It helped me be more mellowed in response to some triggers and core beliefs.

I have a dear friend (BPD too) that couldn't do EMDR, it didn't work for him.

I'll still suggest it , maybe it helps someone else.

It can be retraumatizing for some persons.

Not one size fits all. Some here found solace in DBT.
I can't have it due to my past experiences. It reminded me of the brainwashing of the cult, I can't deal with that.
But it works for many !!!

Schema therapy and ACT are for me more reliable/less controlling.

You can find a lot of exercises books online and you can do the test yourself online too.

If you want to/feel the need to.

Internet helped me a lot when I was really down.
It still does.

I hope that I can give that back üôè

17,"Oh have I. It would be a novel if I listed every instance, so here‚Äôs a few:

My former psychiatrist who I saw weekly for about a year and then sporadically after didn‚Äôt recognise my symptoms. When I was diagnosed by a therapist and told her, she was rather dismissive of that. I later found out that on one random bill she had put ‚Äòpersonality disorder‚Äô so idea how that makes any sense, she certainly never told me. 

My former therapist, the one who diagnosed me, asked to see my cuts. When I showed her, she went ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre not that bad, I thought it was more urgent than that‚Äù. At a later point I told her about some resurfaced memories of a high school friend sexually assaulting me, which had led me into a complete breakdown. She reacted very perplexed as to why that bothered me all of a sudden when I had been fine with the situation for the past ten years. 

I then, completely desperate, went to my GP to get both a sick note and help for dealing with the situation as my therapist wasn‚Äôt taking me seriously. I was crying, had cuts all down my arms, was obviously in serious distress. She brushed me aside with ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk this through with you, that‚Äôs also not my job, I suggest you talk about this with your therapist at your next session‚Äù. Gave me my sick note and ushered me out the door. 

Next stop was my current psychiatrist (looking for a new one). And this point I had resolved to go inpatient because I was really at the end of my rope. He was understanding enough, prescribed me some Xanax (weird choice for someone with BPD, not really recommended but ok) and told me to come back in a week to talk about going inpatient. Went back the week after, obviously considerably calmer as I was no longer in acute distress and also heavily sedated ‚Äî he said that it had just been ‚Äúa classic borderline crisis‚Äù and look how well I made it through it, was I sure I needed that inpatient referral?

None of these practitioners were of any help in getting a place in a suitable hospital (which is quite difficult where I live and the waiting time for accordingly specialised hospitals can be from months to over a year). None at all. None of them took me seriously, none of them felt any sort of responsibility in getting me the care I needed. 

Thankfully I did end up finding a good inpatient programme on my own and I have a great new therapist. Next up is a new psychiatrist. In the future I do not want to engage with any practitioners who are not expressly specialised and experienced in treating BPD and who treat us like we‚Äôre lesser humans.

It‚Äôs honestly incredibly harmful how prejudiced and misinformed professionals are regarding this disorder.

I say this because your therapist is your best bet on working through this. The FP mechanism of BPD doesn't use logic, it just idolises people. Your therapist can help you work through that.

I wish you the best. The goal is to not have an FP anymore",CosmicSweets,1ahwt54

I think when he's older he will look back and appreciate u so much for putting in the work, but that reality rn might be to skewed to really notice any big picture stuff or behind the scenes stuff
Just know things will and can get better for u both relationship wise

Honestly, I fought with my mom 24/7, she had NPD and it was rlly hard to get along, ever.
The thing that rlly made me feel good was my relationship with my dad. When I told him I wanted to be acknowledged for doing chores he did so, when I freaked out and had attacks or spirals or fights with mom, he would talk me down and comfort me. He rlly listened. 

My advice is only rlly based on my exp but I'm sure others left rlly good comments.",RyleyThomas,1anhx1p
2,"Be there for him. Listen to him, even while he‚Äôs in agonizing pain and might not feel the same intense feelings hours later, let him be heard. As a teenager with BPD, something that hurts the most is feeling like your emotions aren‚Äôt being regarded with care, even if they‚Äôre part of a momentary outburst. Create a space for him to openly express how he‚Äôs feeling in the moment, and maybe think of some activities to do with him/ones he can do alone to help him regulate. Lastly, school was extremely hard for me as i became older and my BPD/trauma intensified. If he‚Äôs telling you school isn‚Äôt working, listen. It took me into junior year to get my mom to realize school wasn‚Äôt for me, after two years of constant mental breakdowns and violent fits of rage and depression. School is hard for lots of kids but especially those with severe mental illness, it can literally break them. It‚Äôs so amazing that you‚Äôre already trying to do everything you can for him and reaching out to find even more resources. Cheers to you and your son, I hope you both find what you need in the world and each other ‚ù§Ô∏è",,1anhx1p
3,"i think the most important thing is to try to be as understanding and empathetic as you can. living with BPD is basically like living in agony. it‚Äôs considered the most painful mental illness in the world. yet we are often dismissed as crazy or dramatic. our emotions are usually so heightened- and i promise you that it feels just as horrible for us as it does for you (or the person on the receiving end). it‚Äôs a very exhausting disorder. not to mention that he‚Äôs entering his teenage years, which to me, was one of the worst periods of my life. he‚Äôs really beginning to discover the world around him, his feelings, the reality of things, and starting to feel strong mental health issues. he‚Äôs most likely never trying to be malicious. you mentioned that he‚Äôs had intense moments of rage. this was one of my biggest problems as a teenager and i can say that from my experience, anytime i entered an episode of rage it was almost always because i didn‚Äôt feel seen or heard. no matter how many times i explained things to my parents i was never taken seriously. so, the most important thing is to always listen to him and how he‚Äôs feeling. don‚Äôt dismiss his thoughts, don‚Äôt act like he‚Äôs being overdramatic, but genuinely listen to him. not as a child- but as a human being. 

try to notice and learn his triggers. are there certain things that are said that trigger his episodes of rage? what leads him to feeling that way? how does he explain it to you? how can you try to prevent those things?

along with his triggers, notice and learn what soothes him. i had shitty parents who didn‚Äôt care, but my boyfriend now does this for me and it helps me extremely. after 6 years together he learned that doing simple things during an episode like rubbing my back, asking me how i feel, and repeating to me that everything is okay and that he loves me always seems to calm me down. 

also encourage him often to be slow and to take care of himself. i find that self care is really important because many people with BPD have a hard time relaxing with such heightened senses and emotions.",ham_alamadingdong,1anhx1p

5,"Understanding that his pain is real is so important I‚Äôve had a lot of issues with parents/family members invalidating my emotions because of the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù inconveniences . Another big thing is to talk to him, ask him how you can help in high stress situations like when both of u are calm ask how u can help when he‚Äôs feeling emotional.

11,"also, remember with BPD there is just an inherent pain. many of us often feel the weight of being alive at any given moment, an emptiness inside of us aching for more. sometimes it really does feel like our souls are trapped inside of us clawing to get out. so sometimes we act uncharacteristically or out of line. this isn‚Äôt a reflection of your son‚Äôs character, but a reflection of the illness he‚Äôs working to fight. obviously accountability and responsibility are important when hurting a loved one, and he‚Äôll need to learn it too, all i‚Äôm saying is give him second chances. we need those to realize the ways we acted before weren‚Äôt okay. BPD kids don‚Äôt often feel understood by their peers or the world around them so working to do so with open communication and some grace will make him feel so much safer knowing he has someone on his team.",,1anhx1p

I'm trying my very best to learn it all to be his safe space and the place he's allowed to blow up and still feel comfortable in. At this point he has no idea that's what he's being treated for and I think it's because we can't get a formal diagnosis until he's 18 so I haven't gotten the sense he knows what his triggers are and we (all his loved ones) can't seem to find anything that makes sense.

I spent Thanksgiving alone because I just couldn't be around people because I didn't want to talk to my son and all the problems, I left for Christmas because I just needed a break....I tried to push him away. This is absolutely one of the hardest things, but recently I read about how much harder it is for him and that really changed my mindset.

My parents never seemed to care about me, if you ask them what hobbies and interests I have they‚Äôll tell you shit about me as a child- because they just don‚Äôt care enough to get to know me. When people care enough to spend pointless time with me and get to know me for who I really am it helps so much.",,1anhx1p
18,"It auctually did get better! 
My mom's been through a lot of her own trauma but it was hard being raised by her and we never learned I had bpd until I was 21 and moved out. So 100% she had no idea she was even doing anything wrong, especially since my older sister was fine with the way she was being raised. 

Unfortunately things only got better after I was put on medication in grade 12 with therapy and when I moved out at 19. I found it was easier to have a relationship with my mom when I was looking after myself.However I learned through my dad that she read books on bpd after I was diagnosed and that meant so much to me. And she started to auctually listen, and talk to me and support me when I moved out and after getting diagnosed. It can still be rocky sometimes but it's much better.

I think with u knowing so early about his bpd you'll be able to salvage ur relationship and rebuild it much sooner then my mom and I had. But it did get better. The older he gets the more clarity he'll have and hopefully with therapy he'll learn the skills to help himself.  Keep working at this and remember to take care of yourself too

A super awesome recourse:
I have this book, ""Talking to a loved one with bpd"", it  is an amazing book. I gave it to my mom and at one point my friend. It has rlly good dialogue examples and breaks down how what can affect a person with bpd and how to counter and difuse conversations aswell as great examples. It's so easy to grasp!

Trying to find an intensive outpatient program for him but things like that aren‚Äôt available where I am. So I‚Äôve turned to the internet to try to find something available via telehealth. It sounds to me like you went through exactly what I am going through right now. I think that you are doing exactly what you need to do. You are acknowledging how he is feeling. You are being supportive and providing him space. Maybe reach out to his intensive program and see if they have resources for you to support him?

I myself had a really rough childhood and lost my mom as a teenager after a grouling fight with cancer so I know I have my own set of problems, which is why I'm trying to get myself help. I didn't know until very recently that all of this is completely out of his control. When he would lash out and say hurtful things to me over and over again I honestly thought it was intentional. And with my own defense mechanisms I was trying to push him away to protect myself. It was after I started getting articles on it and really reading in depth that I learned what it was really like for him and I had to change now otherwise my own thoughts and feelings were only going to make him worse. 

It's so hard being this open and at the same time I hope someone else can recognize this in themselves and choose to do better. I was so focused on getting him help that I didn't realize how bad I had gotten until the end of this last year.

2,"I couldn't stand DBT. I did get some skills from it, but I was only able to grasp those after I'd gotten out of the program. I hated group and was worse under it.

That said, you don't go into a 12 week program and suddenly you're healed. Think of it more like training. You spend 12 weeks learning the material and learning how to apply it, observed by someone to guide you. After 12 weeks, you take those skills with you and continue to work on them, via individual therapy and self practice.

DBT certainly isn't for everyone. I found it condescending and infantilizing. That said I have quiet+petulant bpd and I've recently been informally diagnosed by my therapist as almost certainly autistic. That could have played a factor.

I ended up going back to CBT and while it hasn't been perfect, I am slowly getting better. If a DBT program isn't for you, look into other psychotherapies. DBT is not the only style of therapy that's shown success in pwBPD.",princefruit,1braol1
3,"(Before i begin, I‚Äôm based in the UK) A few years ago I was in a similar position, got diagnosed in hospital and following my stay did an outpatient DBT programme. At this point I wasn‚Äôt actively self harming or making any attempts - I was very ill don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I was coasting and whilst suicidal ideation sucks, it‚Äôs something I could manage to an extent. DBT felt inconsequential in all honesty - I think what actually made more of a positive impact on me was the camaraderie with all the other people in my group. I completed the programme feeling like nothing had actually been worked on that caused all the problems in the first place.   

I then started private sessions once a week in Schema Therapy. I cannot overstate how much it changed my life. I had years of therapy under my belt, I was at a point I overly intellectualised my issues which prevented me from really *feeling* what was wrong - my first session of Schema was when I cried in therapy for the first time. It‚Äôs a long commitment, my treatment lasted c. 8 months. It‚Äôs also pretty gruelling (my therapist and I used lots of imagery which can sometimes feel quite emotionally taxing, but I don‚Äôt believe a requirement of Schema is engaging in loads of imagery). I‚Äôd really, really recommend reading up on the therapy.   

Whilst I‚Äôm not totally symptomless, I‚Äôm a HELL of a lot better than I was and don‚Äôt resemble the irrational mess of anxiety and fear I used to be. It enabled me to work on my childhood and unpack how it resonates with me today. It‚Äôs very validating and liberating. 4 years later from my treatment ending and I‚Äôm like a different person.  

I still do therapy (for me it‚Äôs important for accountability, and catharsis), specifically Internal Family Systems - which I‚Äôm actually thinking of ending soon, as it doesn‚Äôt click for me like Schema did. But that could click for you, so give it a Google / prompt ChatGPT to give you a run down on both therapies :)",frickened,1braol1

I did 6 months of CBT while I was in the military and it did nothing for me.

So really, with things like this you have to put the effort in with the material to benefit from it.

10,"DBT felt invalidating for me and can just trigger me into anger.
I have to understand WHY , I can't just ""reprogram"" myself without that.

Here in NL they do schema therapy as the golden standard for personality disorder.
ACT comes second.
DBT is just an extra tool then to exercise and practice. 

Schema therapy lays out you inner ""landscape"" very clearly.  To the point that, once identified,  there was no way for me to see it differently. 
Once you know who is talking inside of you, then DBT isn't that invalidating anymore.
You can ""talk"" DBT to your inner child and feel ""in control"" of what you are doing.

As a cult survivor this was the only way for me as the de-programing and reprogramming was a trigger in itself.

I do not think it's DBT in itself that is an incorrect treatment. It's the way it's given mostly.

Plus indeed in 12 weeks they just give you a tool kit for the future, the healing only happens with repetition and automatisation.

I hope you'll be able to use it on your own after and that you find the right people around you to reinforce the good work.

No I do not think 12 weeks can heal anyone really .

11,"Just opinions, based on my partner of 20 years having bpd.

BPD cannot be ‚Äòcured‚Äô. I wouldn‚Äôt want that anyways, you need to take the bad with the good.

BPD is hardest on people in their mid 20s to mid 30s. Things did get easier and it was hard to think back on going through a decade where we didn‚Äôt even know what the diagnosis was.

Fast forward to our mid / late 30s and going through dbt (twice) has helped. It had even helped me manage through the final stretch of a shit job. The skills are generally good life skills for everybody in my opinion. It is almost like a life reality check for those who have trouble but the idea of ‚Äòradical acceptance‚Äô is a universal concept if you ask me.

Asking folks with bpd to regulate their emotions may make sense, but I can see how somebody would react this way especially if they‚Äôre younger.

Net-net I would be thankful you are self aware before you go on the ride, because things won‚Äôt be getting easier for you before they get harder. That said they will get easier, and the tools will stick with you. You‚Äôll need them for a long time and you just have to reset expectations for yourself that you are on a journey because you are right there is no quick fix for bpd.",coconutstatic,1braol1

DBT felt patronizing, infantilizing, and at some points impossible, which made my already fragile mental state much worse. I‚Äôm currently in CBT but I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about that either.

17,"Success story for me. I failed twice with DBT though before it took.

The key is 100% committment, if you're half way out the door it'll never take. Because it's all about habit building those skills into automatic reactions.

- First time I tried it I did a self-learn/workbook of DBT.
- Second time I tried it was with a therapist one on one.
- Third time was a group setting course, where we had a set up of:
- Meditation
- Learning Lecture
- Skills practice within group with each other
- Take home homework

I'd just recommend, try and try again till it sticks. It will ONLY WORK if you put in 100% effort, practicing all the skills as often as you can ever day, till it becomes an automatic habit.

Even small decisions, check the facts, find the wise mind decision, if you have down time practice mindfulness observing, describing, etc. Select one activity each day you do ""one mindfully"".

However, inpatient, I had no choice BUT to utilize my skills. Shit can get wild when you have to live with a bunch of other mentally ill and drug addicted people!  
Needless to say, 2 weeks inpatient made me an expert in about 3 distress tolerance skills when 15 days before, I could maybe recite what dear man stood for (again, 8 weeks into a weekly group).

Here's the thing: you can do more than 12 weeks of DBT. Just because the program you're in is only 12 weeks doesn't mean you have to stop therapy. Find a different program that's not 12 weeks. Find one that will last as long as you need. They exist. Just do the research.",blackivie,1braol1

I keep reminding myself it's getting better, but tbh if I knew it was gonna be this rough I wouldn't have pushed myself so hard.  That's led to me really slowing down on emotional processing.

I've been watching The Behaviour Panel on YouTube, Scott Rouse brings up limbic activation often.  One thing I thought was very helpful to keep perspective is that for a really anxious person, whatever they are feeling strongly, their instinct is to hide it by leaping into an opposite reaction; not an intermediate one, but the opposite one.  Their example was Chris Wa\\Watts with the police , he felt extremely afraid and instead of mirroring the body language of the people around him, which would have been the intermediate state, he started making exagerrated, highly energetic moves and sounds of being relaxed or happy.

46,"Hi u/SumDumFukU

Other than the age we were diagnosed (I was 46) your diagnosis experience mirrors my own...I'm also in Canada, admitted myself to hospital for a ""wellness-check"" and was promptly shown to a quiet room for emergency counselling.That's where I was given an initial diagnosis of BPD and my first introduction to DBT. 

What I was shown during that session (the 4 DBT T.I.P.P. techniques) saved my life so many times over the next few months afterwards while I began BPD treatment and therapy...and it's been a godsend everyday for managing my emotional dis-regulation.

Though that's just my experience with DBT and CBT therapy as a 47yr old pwBPD.

I feel you didn't post looking for advice or help on DBT/CBT skills implementation, nor reassurances on their statistical success rates...and that's okay!   You're feeling what you're feeling...and thinking what you're thinking.

Thoughts like:

""...12 weeks isn't enough time...""

""...BPD isn't just how we act, it's how we are/feel...""

""...There Is absolutely no way 75% of people's Crippling mental health disorder can be prepared or appeased to a point where it no longer meets the criteria for the disorder in 12 weeks...""

All of these statements are ""true"", both inside and outside of the context of your feelings, yet your feelings alter the ""truth"" of each thought vastly different which drastically alters their affect on your perception of reality.    

A 12 week DBT/CBT course that can fix that BPD-fuckery and that 75% of pwBPD who complete this course are no longer actively symptomatic and their BPD is confirmed by a qualified mental health diagnostician to be in remission by the end of those 12 weeks?   That's impossible, though I reckon that's not what ""they"" guaranteed the 12 week course would do...because that'd be fraud.  

Also,  there's no mention in your post citing any contractual or legally binding declarations made by the course-providers suggesting that it's reasonable and logical to have confident expectations of remission in those 12 weeks..

...which begs the question(s): what were your expectations, how did you come to have those expectations, when did you first begin to feel that your expectations weren't going to be met, have you addressed your concerns-if so, how and with whom? 

12 weeks not enough time for you to feel confident in applying your new DBT/CBT skills?  Take it again if you can.  Practice applying what you learn every waking moment of every day.  Never stop practicing because it doesn't come naturally to pwBPD, and being confident in ones skills requires consistant practice.  

For clarification, the statistic of DBT/CBT therapy having a 75% success rate treating pwBPD is correct..with 75% of pwBPD meeting BPD symptom remission in about 3-5 years when combined with regular therapy sessions (3-4 times weekly is recommended for optimal recovery progress) as well as continued and prescribed treatments/medications for managing other comorbid mental health factors (ADHD, Anxiety/depression, other Cluster B disorders, etc)

BPD can be treated, but not cured.  We will always feel our feelings more intensely than neurotypical folk and we will always struggle with how our thoughts work...DBT/CBT doesn't fix us, it gives us the tools to be able to manage how we react, how often we react, and what we react to.",BlackoutBarberJ,1braol1
47,"That is definitely not a long enough time to ""fix"" bpd or its symptoms, its a lifelong battle that doesnt necessarily get easier with age but it gets less out of hand if you learn to recognize your behaviors. The statistics are bullshit because they go off of short term results but anyone with bpd knows that short term is a very relative term. You are very lucky to have that level of help so accessible, especially that long, im in the US and even with insurance im unable to find that kind of help. DBT isnt meant to fix bpd, its meant to teach you different things to try and use to improve. It only works at all if the person is ready and willing to do the work themself",MTcs5187,1braol1

49,"I'm really glad to hear this was a tremendous help for you :)

In my case, unfortunately, in my head it's like Idc if it equals reality or not, even if it doesn't, I still feel these extreme, sometimes crippling emotions,  and though the thoughts might not equal reality , the impact the those thoughts have on me definetly impact my own perception / reality in a very real way. 

Unfortunately this means so far I've been doomed to dismissing the notion that my thoughts may not be the reality others see, as the impact they have on my state of mind is still very real nevertheless. Ofc I'm sure it's deeper than what you explained in a few short sentences so I maybe can't completely understand what you mean, but from my understanding that's what happens to me.

53,"I actually do have ADHD aswell, however you should not dismiss this as a reason for your treatment not having been successful. Nearly 100% of people diagnosed with BPD also have other underlying diagnosed Disorders such as ADHD, G.A.D, Depression, ODD, Autism, OCD, ect. Infact I belive having other diagnosed Disorders Is 1 of the criteria used when giving a diagnosis for bpd to begin with. Though I do not suffer from autism, I have adhd, aswell as severe insomnia, G.A.D, and a few others I can't remember.

The sad truth is nearly all BPD sufferers have other mental health diagnoses aswell to some extent. So this should never disqualify you from having improved from treatment, as these treatments are designed with this in mind. 

I just want you to know you aren't alone, and you don't have to blame yourself/ other Disorders for the fact it barely worked or did not work.

Additionally, one of my newer close friends is autistic himself and a licensed behavior therapist getting his masters in psychology. He's been helping me a lot in navigating it as well, and is agreement with my therapist.

Both have said they think assessment may not be worth the cost considering that I don't exactly struggle enough to need assistant. Still, if money ever allows, I hope to get an assessment anyway just to have the full confidence of it.

I wouldn't say my parents were unloving nor would I say I had a bad childhood. But there really was no significant bonding between me and my parents, and I basically spent a lot of time entertaining myself and soothing myself on my own. My father's side of the family had a lot of issues, and it caused a lot of trauma‚Äîmore than I really understood until recently.

I got my diagnoses when I was 24 from a wonderful neuropsychologist. I had come out of a particularly terrible relationship and it was at a point where I was so disassociated that I convinced myself I wasn't real, and I knew if I didn't get help I'd end up dead or in inpatient. I had heard of borderline before, but had absolutely no idea of what is really was. I did some research and I wasn't sure if it was a perfect fit, but it also felt so relatable that I was shocked. I was put into CBT with a therapist that saved my life, and after a few years of therapy, when I had to quit because I lost insurance, I was in a really good place.

I still struggled with Favorite Person dynamics but overall I felt like I was in remission. I had cut out a lot of people who weren't great for me in that type and felt stronger for it.

When I turned 30 about 3ish years ago, I moved to a new state to get away from family. It ended up being a terrible few years‚ÄîI didn't know anyone here but my brother and was completely isolated. Trying to make friends failed miserably and I suffered a pretty traumatic instance where accidentally making the leader of a social group angry, my entire new friend group turned on me after the leader (who I thought I was close with and also had BPD) split on me and told a lot of heinous, untrue lies. The fallout for that was deep, and it lead to the first romantic partner I'd had in 8ish years to break up with me. At the same time, a lot of unexpected costs happened. My car needed its entire AC unit replaced, I got really really ill with COVID and a string of UTIs with super crap insurance, inflation spiked as well as rent, and my cat also got sick. I moved here with a not insignificant amount in savings and a secure job, but within 2 years I had drained almost all of it, and had a maxed out credit card. I got suicidal, and so I took my food money and put it into seeing a psych for medicine and a therapist. It helped some, but food insecurity and just one thing after another happened. My grandmother I was close to died and I couldnt afford to go to the funeral. My father estranged me. Three of my cousins got married and I couldn't afford to go home to be there. My best friend/FP moved to Spain for school, and suddenly they became a stranger. I started with long covid symptoms I'm still dealing with...

I could write a book on the last few years but, it was bad. I was in full relapse of BPD, and CBT and my old medications didn't help like the first time. I tried DBT and it made me worst. I got into a bullying situation (at 32, can you believe).

About 6 months ago though, I had the opportunity to move in with my brother and his roommates, halfing my rent. At the same time, my job gave me a nice bonus and offered an HRA, which allowed me to get a much better insurance, so my healthcare costs decreased a lot and I was able to get better care, better medicine, and better therapy. I was able to pay off my debt and I'm slowly, but finally, getting back on my feet. The financial stress being gone and better care has really really helped me see a lot of progress. While I think I have a ways to go, remission feels like it's in sight. During this time is when I bought Dr. Fox's workbook and it blew my mind. That lead me to the resources I shared with you. They gave me so much more information and hope about BPD than I ever had, and I understand myself so so so much better than I did. It's helped a lot \^\^",princefruit,1b9vs2g
3,"omg are you me? lol its just so amazing how relatable the stories in here are to me. i really wanna confront my psychiatrist to confirm or not if i have BPD because i dont wanna come here to this sub to connect just to end up feeling like i'm reading the horoscope hahahaha

im really happy that you are seeing the remission coming and i wish you the best for you. really hope that you can manage it, you sure deserve it

it seems to me that even with some troubles along the way you had had a share of good professionals with you. i was never really lucky with the profissionals that came along my way and it seems that that is really a very important point. even the ones im used to, i always feel like they lack the attention that my case need. but maybe thats because they are not even honest about my treatment in the first place. but then again my treatment was always a very tricky thing for me. I was forced into it the beginning because of a suicide attempt and after many theraphists i ended up with one just because i gave up trying to find someone else and in the end they betrayed my confidence. she talked about our sessions with my mother and she treated my sister while treating me (and thats forbidden in my country for ethical issues). Anyways... 

Also, reading your story i now wonder if emotional distant parents has anything to do with developing BPD. That was a very important in my life too",tetrasbox,1b9vs2g
4,"Well I was very lucky my first time with professionals for sure. But this time around it took a while. This is my 4th therapist and 3rd psychiatrist üòÖ though admittedly all of my psychiatrists were awesome. Insurance nonsense is why I went through so many. By therapists was a shopping trip. My current one still isn't the best but she has really taken feedback well and I do see myself progressing.

It sucks but sometimes shopping around for the right people is part of the process. You want someone who challenges you but should never ever feel forceful and should ABSOLUTELY not break your confidentiality unless there is good reason to beleive you are a harm to yourself or others. I'm so sorry that happened to you. You deserved better, shame on them.

And yes, childhood abuse and/or neglect is *extremely* common with BPD. Most people with BPD were raised in some sort of invalidating environment, often traumatic. So if any of that feels relatable to you, it's something worth digging into. 

I'm glad youre still here after your attempt. Keep aiming for the right support network. Even if you don't meet the diagnostic criteria, anyone can experience traits found in BPD, and anyone can gain from the tools available to us!",princefruit,1b9vs2g

i‚Äôm genuinely happy for you that things have got better. i wish it could happen for me. 

i‚Äôve just done over a year of brutal EMDR therapy and it‚Äôs helped some of my triggers. i would love to try DBT. i can‚Äôt afford a private therapist and it‚Äôs just not going to happen. i‚Äôm 51 now. i‚Äôm both terrified of getting old, and horrified that i might live another 30 years.",BINGGBONGGBINGGBONGG,1bpqhed
3,"Personally I knew I needed the extra help from medication. At first I was prescribed anti anxiety meds, two antipsychotics, a mood stabiliser and an antidepressant. Because I was on so much medication, I needed MORE medication to mitigate the side effects. Over the course of three years I'm now on one antidepressant, one antipsychotic and one mood stabiliser. I'm finally at a place where I can start weaning off and the process so far has been smooth, my energy levels are fine and I try to go to the gym for that extra boost of dopamine.

I know it's difficult to take care of yourself and I've struggled with staying disciplined sometimes too. One thing I remind myself of is ""if not me then who"" and that pushes me to do better for myself by myself. We tend to depend on others and it affects our moods and motivations a lot, but you need to recognise that you as an individual have your own story and shit to go through first, THEN you can see about others (keep it balanced tho don't turn into a selfish dick)",ysr_aa,1bpqhed
4,"I gotchu
My favourite was the DBT skill STOPP, it really helped keep me from lashing out and stopped me from developing major negative thoughts based on my interactions with my fp or just friends in general. Honestly it took about 2 years to develop the mindset I have now, but sticking through the process was completely worth it

On a day to day basis I've reframed and now take hiccups or obstacles as entertainment (could be a funny story to tell later on) or just something that was out of my control. I try to appreciate the little things in life like seeing a cute dog out on the street or seeing a couple hold hands, try to seek out special things every day and be more aware of your surroundings, it makes every day more fun 

I also studied my triggers, thoughts, physical reactions and emotional reactions to everyday obstacles and tried to change the way I thought about them. For example, if my sister isn't getting the car washed and I'm mad at her for not taking responsibility because I think she's lazy and the burden falls on me, instead I reframe and think that a clean car is just not one of her priorities and I can't hold that against her because our priorities can't always be the same

I used to have to reframe and restructure my thoughts actively and put in a lot of effort, but over the years it's become a habit and life has become easier to deal with",ysr_aa,1bpqhed

the EMDR. was very intense, but we did a few weeks of ‚Äòstabilisation‚Äô before we got into the actual memory recall. you name your squad of protective people, you create a safe space for if it gets too much,

it really is incredible tho. the first couple of bits of work we did, i was sort of poking at those memories afterwards. just memories now, not flashbacks.

it would take about 50 years for me to work through every trauma memory. we worked on some key beliefs, we worked through the worst of the abuse and we did a lot of work with my inner child.

I'm not really sure how my BPD interacts with some of these other diagnoses. I think several of them might have been a misdiagnosis - I've been getting mental health treatment since I was a minor, and minors aren't generally diagnosed with personality disorders because their personality is still developing. 

I think it's good to remember that diagnoses aren't cut and dry the way another medical diagnosis might be. Every disorder listed is a list of symptoms that generally occur together, but they're not concrete things the way something like, say, appendicitis is.

Then once they have the information to be able to identify the symptoms/issues and what they do for them that they can make more progress towards their personal treatment journey.

It is good that you are aware of some of the issues you have been experiencing and I do hope that you can get some answers to your questions.

110,"It is quite interesting to me too. The way it was explained to me from my psych doc was that because of the combo of diagnoses I have that I do have depression as a baseline from both. It is just when both start doing it together that it sends me into a ""super depression"" as he put it. Thats when the psychosis begins and starts getting crazy up in there. But then when my mania episodes hit from the BP II it is leveled out mostly by the MDD trying to bring down but then the BPD swings come and can send me from one extreme to the other over the matter of a week. The best way I describe is like a game of tetris where the pieces will line up just right and things go great but more keep coming anyways. Never know what will come after the next one until just before and your still trying to fix the mess you already got while trying to figure out where the next is going to go. Anxiety as the blocks begin to stack and you start to run out of room. Depression as you know the blocks will never stop coming and it is pointless because it only stops when you lose. The psychosis is bad when it get to the ""nothing matters anyways, it is never going get better until it ends"" kind of thing lol the adhd is jamming to the soundtrack and watching the pretty colors hyperfixating to figure it out or just zoned out and autopilot has sorted the blocks with no real rhyme or reason. 

It is quite confusing to me too and I don't know how else to try and describe it to help understand lol it even confuses the professionals I see sometimes because they don't know which one is feeding into the others. They even tend to contradict one another through the symptoms.

I wonder if there had been a study between the correlation of things like autoimmune diseases and BPD. While there has probably got to be some about the BPD and other mental illnesses.

140,"i am diagnosed both bipolar 2 and bpd (amongst others) and they are two separate diagnoses that require separate treatment. approximately 20% of people with bpd have bipolar and vice versa, and it doesn‚Äôt eradicate either diagnosis. bipolar requires mood stabilising and/or antipsychotic medication to stabilise, where bpd tends to need therapy, sometimes alongside meds but usually not the same course as you‚Äôd be prescribed for bipolar. there is overlap between the treatment of them - both can benefit from therapy, and to an extent, medication - but they are fundamentally different disorders. bpd is a personality disorder while bipolar is a mood disorder and as such they have both different causes, different treatments, and also different illness trajectories. 10 years post diagnosis, with adequate treatment, around 50% of pwbpd will no longer fit the criteria for bpd; this is not the case for bipolar. if you are CORRECTLY (and emphasis on correctly) diagnosed with bipolar, you will deal with it for the rest of your life, and most people diagnosed will need to be medicated for life. this is because it is a progressive disorder (ie gets worse) - every mood episode that happens to a pwbipolar does tangible damage to the brain that can be seen on a scan, which worsens bipolar symptoms inexorably. as such, it is crucial for medication to be implemented. in contrast, medication for bpd is only provided under specific contexts, and antidepressants may be a more suitable course of action, although this is not always the case. when they co-occur, treatment is more complex, but because of the high rates of comorbidity out there it is fairly well documented. please feel free to ask questions!",theonetruebicon,169kwrk

Additionally, cPTSD isn't officially in the DSM and there's quite a few professionals in the field who are somewhat doubtful that it even exists as its own meaningful nosological diagnosis.

I really can‚Äôt show any emotions outside and I can shut them off for most times but I have episodes when I am complete vulnerable mess. When I fall in love (if you can call this love) in beginning I am obsessed with them and love bomb them and treat them as typically borderlines do with their favourite person, but if they start showing me too much love back it usually turns around and I just use them for validation and my advantage (I recently am really trying not to be in relationships because of that and get my validation in other ways). I am extremely obsessed with myself and self-centred. I noticed that when I am not doing well I show more borderline traits, I have problems with impulsiveness, fear of abandonment, paranoia, self destructive behaviour, aggression and when I am doing well I show more narcissistic traits as in self-absorbance, lack of empathy, grandiosity, manipulation.

Your response is very helpful and informative. I greatly appreciate your well thought response. 

Are you by chance able to manage your symptoms well enough to still be able to work? I am unable to work and disabled due to mental health. Have you found things that help you that may help others to manage navigating their diagnoses and symptoms? (Obviously therapy and meds respectively as you mentioned above, but I mean in addition to those.)",thraway2004,169kwrk

I do hope you can find a great therapist for you who will lead you to the path of your personal understanding as well as journey to a better place. This is not an easy thing to do and great that you have taken the time to not only acknowledge what is going on but that you have started the path to making it better for yourself.

The MDD diagnosis has been kept on since 2012 and then later on at 2020 the with psychotic features was added and kept on there. The ADHD and PTSD diagnoses came around the same time (2013) as the original MDD on as well. In 2019 I got diagnosed with BP II at a psych ward (who i still see their NP as my psychiatrist). Next in 2021 was a different hospital and provider who diagnosed me with the OCD. In 2020 ended up going to a long term place who then diagnosed me with BPD. The list just kept building. 

It is honestly me not understanding how my brain if sanction that has caused the miscommunication of how it is coming out. I struggle to articulate properly my thoughts at the time.

In the part you quoted is the bipolar II dragging me to depression episode and during that episode I will experience the mood swings of the BPD which can be strong enough to flip my depressive wave from Bipolar II to the opposite extreme and send me to mania for a bit while the emotions from the bpd swing is gone shortly after the bipolar is still going and keeping me in a mania until I eventually crash again in a depression. 

Tbh I have no fucking clue how this shit is all fucking me up. I thought I had an understand but guess not lol. I can't even figure out how to keep myself alive without major interventions so idk. It just fucking sucks.

Something that a couple of my past therapists have told me is that there is quite commonly a link between PTSD and BPD. That they have been taught that when they get someone with a personality disorder such as BPD that 9 times out of 10 there will be a PTSD accompaniment and if it is already there on the list of diagnoses that even if it doesn't have the C on it for complex that is more times complex anyways than not but adding the C isn't usually a worry when they already kind of know.

2,"Hello, yes, sorry about that. It's a doctor who's based in MA, and his co-host . While there is some medical jargon a lot of the language used is very accessible. This particular medical professional is of the opinion that Borderline can be treated and does not have to be a permanent fixture in a persons life, if the patient is willing to accept treatment and be consistent with it. Some mildly difficult points to listen to arise when the providers mention that they've had many borderline patients who don't seem like they want actual help and only want the meds to ""work"" as opposed to doing their own emotional heavy lifting but there is NO derogatory language used at all. In fact these providers / this medical office is pretty open about the fact they enjoy working with and educating borderline-presenting individuals.

Five main findings have emerged from this study. The first is that remissions lasting two to eight years are extremely common for borderline patients (and axis II comparison subjects). In fact, cumulative rates at 16-year follow-up for borderline patients ranged from a high of 99% for a two-year remission to 78% for an eight-year remission. These results are consistent with and extend our findings pertaining to the first 10 years of prospective follow-up in this study where we found that 93% of borderline patients had achieved a remission lasting two years (5).

Conclusions

Taken together, the results of this study suggest that sustained symptomatic remission is substantially more common than sustained recovery from borderline personality disorder. They also suggest that sustained remissions and recoveries are substantially more difficult for borderline patients to attain and maintain than those with other forms of personality disorder.

60% of borderline patients do achieve recovery, but 40% do not, primarily because of their inability to work or go to school on a full-time basis
Recovery, which is defined as concurrent remission and good social and good full-time vocational functioning, is more difficult for patients with BPD to achieve than remission alone",bellabella3000,gciqik

I begged the crisis teams to help, I was so far into my delusions after having 4 friends aged 16-18 die within 6 months (3 of which were suicides) that I believed I was cursed because each day one of my friends passed was a day I had a plan and intent to take my life.

11,"My ex didnt feel comfortable telling me. I languished for 11 months trying to understand. Turns out I have it too. Explains why I related to her so much. Coming up on one month no contact.

Idk if ive ever been this sad. She told me her mom had it. She tried to tell me then. I was guilty of the stigma too. ""No you dont. Youre just beating yourself up, etc."" 

I had only ever heard of the worst case people, with no self awareness or desire to change. 

A text I sent to a friend:

--

Im still not ready to move on. Im still unable to let go of hope. 

Im still thinking in terms of giving her space. Its not about space. Its about letting go. I honestly dont know that I can. I know I wont contact her again. But bro. It just feels too wrong. The way this all happened is wrong.

We listened to ""the trial"" when we met. 

""Since my friend you have revealed your deepest fear, I sentence you to be exposed before your peers.""

When I was discovering all of this I was having a mental breakdown and (her name) really did everything she could have to make it as bad as possible. I was so relieved and hopeful realizing I had  a name for my problem. I went to (the bar) to try and talk to her. I said ""(her name, her name) its borderline its borderline. I know whats wrong I can get better."" She looked at me and said ""I KNOW"". 

Thats whats killing me rn. Not being lonely. I went there trying to apologize and acknowledge my fualts. Meanwhile it was her worst nightmare. Her friends were all around. It haunts me thinking that she thinks I went and learned about it, but am such a narcissistic asshole I only recognize it in me but stay oblivious to her after all shes told me. That is torture. I pray she has enough confidence in me that she understands that I know her now. 

All I really want is for her to know I finally understand her. I tried so hard and failed over and over. I want her to know that I see her. 

Its not about getting back together. 

If I had just lost her and that was that, id be able to move on. 

But for it to happen this way is just so terrible. 

So many things she asked me about, and I didnt know what to say. So many times I was helpless when she needed help. And now I cant help but feel like it would never be like that again. 

I understand why she goes to the bar. I understand why she draws people in. I understand why she cant make friends. I understand why she flakes. I understand why her relationships hurt her. I understand why she has low self esteem. I understand why she wants to run away. I understand why she feels like a monster when she just wants to be a good girl. I understand the compassion that springs forth and the desire to love all with intensity. I  understand the drinking and the drugs. I more than understand. I relate to all of it. All of it, deeply. 

And now I know how to help her and I cant. And I even know how she can and cant help me. I would never put pressure on her again because now I understand what pressure feels like to her. 

Thats why this is worse than a Kidney stone. I wish I was just some teenager heartbroken cus he doesnt think he can get another gf.

I know I can be overly reactive, but it‚Äôs like I never get to have negative emotions about anything. Even if I do manage to handle things without freaking out, I still end up being told I‚Äôm crazy or dramatic. My therapist told me I have BPD about 10 days ago (still processing the news honestly) and my partner (the first and only person I‚Äôve discussed it with) is already throwing it in my face every time I‚Äôm upset about something. I have other mental illnesses so I‚Äôm accustomed to this stuff, but it still fucking sucks.

On a different note though I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. It‚Äôs a really isolating feeling. Something my therapist told me that‚Äôs made me feel a bit better is that I am always allowed to feel how I feel. I started kinda arguing with her; I‚Äôve been trying so hard to be self aware and work on myself and just not have those feelings since they always cause problems for me. I started going on about how I always over react, I always get too upset, I‚Äôm too dramatic, I don‚Äôt know if I feel the right things or if I should even be upset sometimes‚Ä¶ She was like yeah that doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôre allowed to be as upset as you are. No one can tell you how you feel, and listening to them will just make you question your own reality. Certain behaviors aren‚Äôt okay, but you are allowed to be upset. It‚Äôs just up to you how to handle it and learn to soothe yourself until you can see things from a calmer perspective. 

It might seem like obvious advice and I apologize if so, but it honestly made me feel a lot better, like she was giving me permission to breathe almost. I hope you can give yourself that permission too. It is completely unfair when people treat you like your emotions don‚Äôt count as much as anyone else‚Äôs. They do.

21,"BPD in particular has soooo much stigma - and I think that‚Äôs the medical professions fault tbh.

I developed the ‚Äòfreeze‚Äô response because my family were so invalidating of my feelings, but I‚Äôve worked in the last three years to really be able to express and validate myself.

YOU are valid and your feelings are valid. Three possible suggestions:
üí™ work on your self esteem so that you can recognise when people are gaslighting you and you can walk away (hard I know)
üí™Try to develop your self awareness and communication skills - not because you‚Äôre bad at them! But because I feel like with BPD I‚Äôve had to learn to understand, name, and communicate my emotions and feelings waaaaayyyy better than non BPD people do. Some people respond well to this and begin to understand BPD better. And if they don‚Äôt - bingo! There go the üí©heads! It also gives me confidence in myself.

Whats crazy is I actually am telling myself that lol. 

Its so hard because I give her the same grace I give myself. Theres missing details but she was going through a lot, sick kids, her ex died in a tragic way, and shes got an abusive past. 

I fully accept that if she had wanted to make a commitment, and sat me down and explained what it was, i would have accepted it AND saw it in myself. 

But she was so hurt. I had heard a million tragic stories. Stuff that was so dark and yet it was just a small thing. Like her friend calling her and some other people in hs to commit suicide over the phone. With a .22 ffs

That wasn't even a significant part of her trauma. So when she told me about her mom... man I think I was on ectasy, xanax, cocaine, weed, and liquor all at once. I do drugs a bit, but I was keeping up with her for sure. 

And would I know to listen to this tragedy specifically, but not the various sexual assaults and rapes, or the abusive relationships, or any of the other stuff? 

I was truly overwhelmed. It would have been nice if I went home and deeply contemplated everything instead of smoking, but I needed a break. 

She has a toxic mindset about true love and fairy tales. Her favorite movie is True Romance. We love bombed in the beggining. She wanted me to just know. 

When she came over I had the list of 10 cognative distortions in my apartment. She liked that. I think she thought I was more far along in therapy than I was. Just a year in and we were looking at all of what I previously mentioned.

I read stoicism and buddhism and cope via intellectualism. Im also very self aware. So it was hard to disgnose. I probably needed to be with this woman for me to find out finally. So im trying to stay thankful for that.

I'd just like to say, everyone that posted or commented with their troubles and shared their experiences living with BPD you helped me and my fianc√© Pete so so much.

He actually posted a video on here of himself year before last and then one of me last May when we were struggling.

He passed May 2020 by suicide, but what I wanted to say, was that I could separate him from his BPD. He was the most kind, amazing, wonderful man and person I've ever met. He is my angel, and I would have stayed with him forever battling and living with his BPD. 
He couldn't live with the pain he had caused others in his past, and couldn't forgive himself..he was loved immensely and I promise you you're all fucking wonderfull. I know this BPD has bad traits, but it also comes with great ones. The ability to love intensely and honestly, I have never felt a love like it or had such a connection. You all have so much more to give I wish I could make you all see that but I know all too well the demons you face.

Sorry if this isn't my place, I just wanted to say even though I'm a partner of someone who had BPD, I am with you all and have no hatred or think you toxic.

The man I will love forever, who was the greatest father I have witnessed, kindest soul, more pure heart, most sensitive, friendly, inspiring, encapsulating person I've ever met and probably where will, had BPD, and the lack of understanding and help out there is what led to his death and I will keep fighting your corner and educating everyone I know about it.

So we have a unique opportunity for people who have been hurt to come and discuss their hurts with us and to give them insight, just like you said. But, just as those of us with BPD struggle in our emotional responses, people who have been hurt and who are discussing that hurt will have a hard time regulating as well. 

A few weeks ago we had someone come on to this sub and advise people to kill themselves. They went on a rant about how we're all the same, we ruined their life, etc. (I don't say this to pay my own back, just to be honest) I responded to him with all the grace and patience I could muster, I acknowledged that he has been hurt by someone with BPD, and that we, as a community, were available to help him understand the disorder. A week or so later the DMed me. They offered a heartfelt apology for the vitriol, they told me their dad had BPD and their mom killed herself and that they were hurting very deeply.

I have been finding this a great safe space but when one of those posts pop up it really digs deep into my unresolved things. I am relatively high functioning now and at first tried to just use my skills but then I was like FUCK IT! THIS IS FOR US!!! It is not a barrel for people to come shoot at us because they are angry at another person or uninformed or whatever. THIS IS FOR US! To find each other and try to be there for each other. I should not have to use every fucking possible skill I can reach in a moment I may be really vulnerable just because someone decides to say how horrid we all are. 

I really wish that neurotypical people would be redirected and advised this is for us only. I don't make the rules but I think we deserve it.

Now that I am taking an honest look at my life I can‚Äôt help but notice that my reality has warped a lot of peoples reality. 

I wish I knew sooner that my mind is not a reliable witness. I agree that this subreddit it for people like us. 

I‚Äôm self diagnosed. I am now in the process of working with a lot of doctors to understand the things about me that are malfunctioning. I‚Äôm doing cognitive testing and psychology testing because now that I know I‚Äôm toxic I feel responsible for cleaning my shit up so it won‚Äôt be a problem anymore.

My husband and my closest friends think I‚Äôm borderline.  I do too but I only recently even consider it. 

In less than an hour I‚Äôm going to do more testing. I figure I shouldn‚Äôt smoke a joint because I‚Äôm doing cognitive testing.

So I‚Äôm painting and waiting for my zoom appointment. Has reading the post from people around the BPD loved ones been helpful to you at all ?

I ask because it actually helps me. I really hate subtracting from anyone‚Äôs happiness. Like I would rather be alone than act like I act. 

So when people give feedback about how people who have what I think I have effect them I actually value those insights because more times than not it applies to my life.

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve asked my husband or a friend after reading one of the posts you described ... hey, do I do this ? Or does what I do ever make you feel like fill in the blank feels.  Not one fucking time has someone said no. Not üëè one üëè time ! And they always looked embarrassed so obviously they didn‚Äôt want to be bringing it up. 

The people around me are the sweetest most generous people. My actions reverberated through them in ways I wasn‚Äôt aware of. I am now striving to the zenith of my ability to change and take full responsibility for my life.

I would be a liar if I didn‚Äôt say that reading the posts of non BPD people ranting about the frustrations of trying to love a BPD person didn‚Äôt help me.

They did help me ... big time to a degree that I now feel ashamed of how deeply vampiric I behaved towards perfectly lovely people who were left hurt and confused because of my fucking donkey brains.

I see the value of people who love people with BPD getting love and support for themselves like Alanon is to Alcoholics Anonymous.

This sub was designed for those with BPD, and like op said I think most of us here are happy to provide insight to someone who is neutrotypical but looking to better understand BPD.

45,"Thank you x

I'm managing, getting used to the reality it happened and he's not coming back.
Our son, Edwin, misses him dearly. He turned 4 in September and Pete died in May, so he's still so young to be able to understand. But he knows his daddy is dead, and he died in the house, and that it's because his brain was poorly and daddy did it himself. He's so happy for the most part though, he gets me through and Pete would be so proud of him. Pete used to call Edwin his hero, so I cling onto that to get me through.",nevergonnauseum,kumiyr
46,"I feel like Pete had the same idealisation about death. He was a punk in his younger years, and a skater, and he always seemed to just want to be different. He was the first in his friendship group to do drugs, then when they caught up he did harder drugs. All his idols were troubled people and I really think he wanted to go in a different way, a way that would be talked about. And I don't mean that with any judgement its what I really believe. He wanted to be remembered. Maybe idolised himself. I dunno.

Anyway, I'm sorry you feel this too and battle with your mind. It's so hard because whenever he would say he wanted to die and he was going to do it, at first early on in our relationship I'd panic and freak out and cry...make it about me basically and that would just result in him feeling fucking awful and horrible about the pain he was unintentionally inflicting on me.

A week before he died, he told me he was going out and I forced him to sit and talk and he basically said he's done. He wants to hang himself, he's got it planned knows how to do it in the least painful way etc. I stayed calm (kind of), and basically guilt tripped him into staying saying his son will follow in his footsteps, stay for me etc. I even apologised to him for making him stay when he so desperately felt like he wanted to leave.

I wish I had words for you. I think people who don't think about death think thoughts of suicide are so scary and wrong. But I think its quite a natural reaction to ending pain in your own life, and to think about it isn't all that horrible really, it's a process to work through your choices and what decisions to make in your life to improve it.

Like you say it, ""one day I'm going to make the biggest mistake and finally do it"", because it's such a snap decision isn't it, and there's no going back. I know if he had just sat for half and hour with me when he was on the brink of doing it that day he wouldn't have...but he sat alone upstairs whilst me and our son were downstairs and so..he did it. And I know, if there is an afterlife, he's thinking ""oh fuck fucking bastard shit wanker I fucking did it no no no no"".... yano?",nevergonnauseum,kumiyr

51,That‚Äôs what I thought also about BPD being a spectrum disorder. Because I‚Äôve read about quiet BPD and I‚Äôve tried to do my own research about it in general and it seems that there are many different characteristics or BPD traits and on top of that everyone is different and has their own personalities. But it‚Äôs different reading an article online versus reading someone‚Äôs personal views and experiences with BPD. I feel like it‚Äôs easier to relate to real people who have gone/are going through BPD related things.

I think that someone whose gone through rough things and/or mental health issues can be much more understanding in general.

Always keep in mind and let Edwin know that it's not your or his fault that it happened and that you couldn't have saved him from it either. Don't ever let that thought enter your mind. Sadly it's a thing that happens often in the heads of the bereaved when someone real close dies due to suicide.

It‚Äôs not anyones fault but the people that harmed you while you were growing up. Organized religion will teach you that mental illness is bad and can be prayed away. While I do believe prayer can offer a lot of comfort, I don‚Äôt think it will just magically go away. The Bible is filled with people with anxiety, depression, and various other forms of mental illness. 

I strongly recommend watching ‚ÄúThe Chosen‚Äù it‚Äôs a free app and it documents the life of Jesus very accurately. It‚Äôs not preachy, it just shows the love he has for people. It‚Äôs a really good watch, I promise. Even if you don‚Äôt believe in it, its a really good feel good story.",KingCosmicBrownie,yqqh3l

11,"I suppose that's your own interpretation of God. Everyone's varies. It can be based on a mainstream taught religion or your own Knowing(my version of God).

I choose to believe that no one has an easy life. There's evidence of it everywhere. We all have our own struggles and our traumas. My family has a long history of trauma, some of them ignore it, some are more sensitive like me. Healing and growing is what makes us who we are, or makes it possible for us to help others. It shapes you, it won't always be positive. But for instance due to the struggles of others we have access to books written by survivors of sex trafficking, we have music from artists with BPD. No one's existence is easy, perhaps your God made yours more difficult because he thought it a challenge you could overcome and share your strengths through those hardships with the world.

I know that's likely not what you want to hear. I'm sorry for your suffering. But on the good days we have to believe there is a silver lining. A reason to continue. You are lovable, you have strengths to share with this world. And everything up until now already happened. So it's about what happens moving forward.",Uniqorn993,yqqh3l

As I believe (I'm an orthodox Christian), God didn't allow mental illnesses, he gave people free will, and people betrayed him. Some people choose sin, which affects people surrounding them. It's not your fault. God didn't want to punish you with that. That's just how some people are, they choose sin and violence. But there are kind and caring people who can love you.
My (christian) therapist says that God can be even more merciful towards the ones who have mental illnesses and who suffered due to other's behavior, such as abuse and neglect. It may not compensate all the pain you're going through, but it can help sometimes, if you remind it to yourself.
I try to remember that there's a God who loves us, even if we're suffering from consequences of human sinful nature. There's always a hope.

To be honest, the biggest problem I have with BPD is the horrifying way its portrayed and treated. Sympathy can be had for people with depression, anxiety, or PTSD. But not for narcissists, which YES is a mental illness, or people like us. That's where this sense of unfairness really sets in. Is it fair what happens to any of us? No. But others have support from their fellow man. Not me. I am denied that privilege.

They don't even say, people with BPD. They say ""borderlines."" Borderlines, narcissists. But it's not ""depression-ites"" or ""anxiety-ers"" or whatever. Why?

57,"This is a very insightful and cultured answer. I am glad you posted this. I think we just evolved too quickly for our own good and a side-effect of our cognitive awakening and abstract thinking is religious belief. We are anxious about the things that can potentially harm us; from archaic humans that lived among deadly animals to early farmers that lived in irrigation societies in the antiquity where droughts happened for seemingly no reason the will to live and the abstract mind combined *wants to* find a logical reason behind disasters, a logical pattern with which these can be avoided. Because the thought that there is no rule of good, there is no providence and there is no reason for our suffering because we're just basically bugs exposed to the cruel, unforgiving forces of nature that are beyond our control can drive us insane. Hence our religions, gods, and similar constructions.

I think there are three options to go by: 1. use technology and society to minimize suffering. This is what most of us do, yet it still does leave us fairly vulnerable because we are growing too dependent on our technology and each other. And in times like this, when people get increasingly isolated it is an insufficient solution.

2. Believe in a vengeful god like orthodox Jews do and hope for the best.

3. Zen buddhism. Empty your mind, master mindfulness and control your emotions and possibly dismantle your desires. It's a tough road, but I think it's the best and safest option. 

We are wretched creatures, there is no point arguing that. In our strength (abstract thinking) lies our weakness too, for we can create anything, but we cannot escape the notion of time and death. So our best bet is to become mindful of the present and diminish our ego. Those who accomplish this, those who become enlightened don't suffer anymore.",JasonZZ369,yqqh3l

You have to keep trying until you find the right fit. It also took me years to find the right combo of meds and they are starting to be less effective and want to try a different combo but am worried as it's really trial and error and some have bad withdrawals even if on them briefly. I suggest trying new meds when you are not about to have any life changes like a new job or moving or new relationships. Be patient and don't give up and speak up right away and don't let yourself get pressured or pushed around, if you do find another psychiatrist. Patience is key.

Also growing them can be quite therapeutic in itself. :) I only take .1 grams and I take them at night time, if I skip a night I really feel the difference in my mood the next day.

26,">I know it sucks but the truth is, BPD is not treatable with medicine. 

Hey, I just want to expand on this since it's an incomplete statement and the nuance can misguide a lot of people. BPD isn't cured by medications, but BPD can also be treated with medications. It just isn't done alone because BPD is a complex mental illness. Medications help with the surface content but not the core content.

Medication treatments differ from psychological treatments in that they are intended  to help people improve the quality of their lives by changing aspects  of their body or brain chemistry. Generally, the most common medications used for BPD include antidepressant medications, mood-stabilizing medications, and antipsychotic medications.

Most of the studies on antidepressants for BPD have focused on  SSRIs (Paris 2005; Silk, Wolf, and Ben-Ami 2005). This is probably  because these medications seem to have fewer or less-serious side effects than TCAs or MAOIs. Four open-label studies have indicated good  effects of fluoxetine (Prozac) on patients with BPD. In one of these  studies, patients who took Prozac had reductions in their sensitivity  to rejection, as well as improvements in anger, depressed mood, mood  instability (or mood swings), anxiety, and impulsivity (Norden 1989).  A few other open-label studies found that Prozac helped to reduce  psychiatric symptoms, depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity among patients with BPD (Cornelius et al. 1990; Markovitz,  Calabrese, and Meltzer 1991; Markovitz and Wagner 1995).  A few double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have also found  beneficial effects of SSRIs in patients with BPD. For instance, one  study found that anger, anxiety, and depression in patients with BPD  who took Prozac improved more than they did in patients with BPD  who took a placebo (Salzman et al. 1995). Another study looked at  how well Prozac worked for patients who had BPD and a mood or  anxiety disorder. This study found that patients who took Prozac had  greater improvements in depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric  symptoms (Markovitz 1995). A double-blind placebo study of another  SSRI (fluvoxamine, or Luvox) for women with BPD found that the  patients who took Luvox reported more relief from rapid mood shifts,  compared to the patients who took placebos (Rinne et al. 2002).

So, given these studies, what can we conclude? Well, right now,  the best conclusion we can make is that SSRI antidepressants may  be helpful in reducing depression, anxiety, and mood shifts among  patients with BPD.

Mood-stabilizing medications are another type of medication  commonly used to treat BPD. When you think about it, this makes  sense. If having an unstable mood is a key symptom of BPD, then you might expect mood-stabilizing medications to be helpful.There is some evidence that mood stabilizers may be helpful for  people with BPD (Paris 2005; Silk, Wolf, and Ben-Ami 2005). For  instance, there is a small amount of evidence that lithium can be  helpful for patients with BPD (Links et al. 1990). The problem with  this research is that most studies on mood stabilizers have been openlabel trials or have included a very small number of patients. Also, the  medication that has been studied the most is divalproex sodium (DVP). Although DVP has fewer side effects than some of the other mood stabilizers do, it is important to remember that DVP can be harmful to a fetus, so it isn‚Äôt a good choice for everyone.

A limited number of studies have shown some good effects of DVP  for people with BPD. One open-label study of eleven patients with BPD  found that after taking DVP for eight weeks, patients had less irritability and psychiatric symptoms (Stein et al. 1995). A larger open-label  study of DVP with thirty hospitalized patients with BPD also found  that DVP seemed to help lessen psychiatric symptoms (Wilcox 1995).  However, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies haven‚Äôt always had  the same good findings. For instance, one study found that DVP was  no better than a placebo (Hollander et al. 2001). However, another  study that looked at BPD patients who also had bipolar II disorder  (Frankenburg and Zanarini 2002) found that patients who took DVP  experienced greater improvements in interpersonal sensitivity, anger,  and hostility than did the patients who received the placebo.

The best conclusion we can draw is that mood-stabilizing medications may be helpful for some patients with BPD, especially in  ¬≠alleviating irritability, anger, and general psychiatric symptoms.

Sometimes people use antipsychotic medications in the treatment of BPD. These medications help treat psychotic symptoms and were originally used with people with disorders like schizophrenia.  However, the fact that these medications are sometimes also used to  help people with BPD does not mean that those with BPD are psychotic. Psychosis is a term for problems with being out of touch with  reality. People who have psychotic symptoms might hallucinate (see,  hear, feel, smell, or taste things that are not there), have delusions  (unusual or bizarre thoughts), or experience other such symptoms.  On the other hand, even though BPD is not a psychotic disorder like  schizophrenia, people with BPD sometimes do have unusual thoughts  or beliefs that they just can‚Äôt seem to give up (like believing you are  ugly or fat, no matter how often people tell you that is not true, and  try to convince you otherwise). Therefore, some of the medications  used to treat psychosis may be helpful for people with BPD.

The best treatment isn‚Äôt just therapy alone. Or meds alone. The best treatment is meds + therapy (specifically DBT, a type of CBT) together. There are tons of studies that state this is the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for treating BPD.

No doubt DBT/ cognitive behavioral therapy is fucking *exhausting* work. It can feel frustrating/alienating/lonely we with BPD can‚Äôt just be ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Every day can feel like drowning. It‚Äôs not surprising BPD is the most deadly of all psychiatric disorders with a 10% suicide rate.

I can‚Äôt tell you how much it has helped me‚Äî the techniques learned in the first few chapters have probably saved my life more than once. 

Any psychiatrist or therapist who knows their shit will have already heard of this workbook. 

As an aside, I noticed you mentioned struggling with anorexia too. I can say from personal experience, DBT will help with that as well. As I‚Äôm sure you know, anorexia is about control and feelings of unworthiness‚Äî when we can‚Äôt manage our emotions and they are out of control, we cling to things we can control because the negative voices are overpowering and we spiral. 

Just remember that this work is exhausting because you are literally carving new neural pathways that serve you better (the Workbook explains this beautifully). Sometimes I can only handle a few paragraphs in a day. That‚Äôs totally ok! Go at your own pace. No shaming yourself. 

Fighting to face each day, wanting to give up, being sick of fighting, is something I think all of us here empathize with. But I *promise* if you put in the that early work it gets easier.

You also mentioned your family being ‚Äúfed up.‚Äù I can relate to this and obviously all of us with BPD have felt friends or family suffer because of our disorder and them struggling to understand. 

I know it made me feel better when I got my family a copy of [**Stop Walking on Eggshells** by Kreger & Mason.](https://www.adlibris.com/no/bok/stop-walking-on-eggshells-9781684036899)

Here is part of the description:
*Stop Walking on Eggshells has already helped more than a million people with friends and family members suffering from BPD understand this difficult disorder, set boundaries, and help their loved ones stop relying on dangerous BPD behaviors. This fully revised third edition has been updated with the very latest BPD research on comorbidity, coping, and communication skills you can use to stabilize your relationship with the BPD sufferer in your life.*

I think giving that book is a nice way of you acknowledging the feelings of frustration and pain that your family feels as a result of you suffering from BPD, while also giving them the tools to understand, cope, and communicate more helpfully with you.

I usually also give a copy to anyone new I date after it‚Äôs been awhile and they start to bear witness to my ‚Äúwaves‚Äù as I call them. 

Hope any of that helps. A lot of libraries have these books too if you are super cash-strapped. And there are e-books you can print off from WorldCat for free I‚Äôm sure....

However yes, you will have to, at some point have that conversation with your girlfriend. See it this xay, she will probably learn that it exists from you and probably has no existing stigma internalized. She knows you, and you have BPD, you're not a bad person so she will know that BPD doesn't make people automatically bad.

Telling will allow her to support in additional ways and for her to make better decisions regarding your relationship. If she's your FP she can for example learn that boundaries are important, which can lead you to have a healthy and long lasting relationship!

Plus, it's good that you're stable right now but if a big life event happened and made you spiral, she'd probably would like to know what to do or where to find ressources to help you.

Also you can absolutely tell her how you feel and why you have been hesitant to tell her that you have BPD. You said she's very empathetic so I'm sure she'll understand and reassure you about that.

18,"I was diagnosed about 6 years ago, at this point I feel like I have done a lot of work to manage my symptoms. Now, I can pretty much always see where my emotions and behaviours are coming from and also see the more realist logic of the situation, and not just what I blew out of proportion.

However, while I might realise these things after the fact, I cannot stop the overwhelming rage, depression, resentment, sadness etc I feel. I feel completely out of control sometimes, though less than before, despite everything I've worked on. It honestly just feels hopeless sometimes. I dont feel like I can cope with all the emotional energy in my body and it comes out in explosive fights or me bawling on the floor for seemingly no real reason. I'm tired. 

I guess my question is, will I ever feel in control? Will i ever be able to trust my emotions, and whether I'm justified in what I'm feeling or if I'm overreacting?",Niimsthefree,hp9yzy

Quick about me:

Diagnosed BPD 3 years ago. 
Accompanying Dxs: pure ocd, add, anxiety, clinical depression, chronic fatigue, IBS. 

I take 4-5 meds (1 is as needed only), see therapist and psychiatrist regularly, and have a great support system. 

Full time worker (op tech), full time student, wife, mom to two young (and perfect) little girls. 

I have A LOT going on, I know that. And I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way tbh.

With COVID/pandemic losing jobs & health insurance has made my weekly DBT skills group inaccessible for the time being. I‚Äôm doing what I can with low cost/free resources such as 12 steps groups etc, but it‚Äôs nice to be able to ask questions.

I‚Äôm still trying to figure out the medication component of my treatment with my psychiatrist. I felt pretty defeated the other day because I feel like after a decade of treatment, I‚Äôve tried so many medications and I seem to have issues with everything. My psychiatrist is working with me to figure out the mood stabilizer component of my medication - we seem to have the anti anxiety, anti depressant, and PTSD/nightmare meds down finally. I‚Äôm trying to find something that doesn‚Äôt inflame my BED, cause migraines, and now I have to look out for aggravating TMJ/lockjaw at night. I know that the medication is not a cure all and therapy is the much larger component of my treatment, but it would be nice to have a mood stabilizer that works decently and doesn‚Äôt make me miserable.

29,"hmm. Interesting.   
Personally I don't really like the term mental illness. I know that it can help to reduce stigma possibly, and to compare it to a physical illness, but I also think it causes people to think that it can't be recovered from, and can actually be more stigmatizing.   


I do think that there are some ""mental illnesses"" like bipolar, schizophrenia, autism, that are more biologically based, and even if you were raised by mother theresa and ghandi you'd still have them. Your brain is an organ that is a little wonky and will always need medicine to be functional, just like someone with diabetes has a messed up pancreas that needs insulin. Definitely not your fault, you've got a wonky brain, take meds and get therapy to help manage it.  


Personality disorders on the other hand, do have some biological components, but they have a ton of environmental influence. They basically boil down to how you figured out how to survive. Some people get excessively anal and perfectionistic to deal with anxiety and they have OCD, some people shut down and are depressive. Some people get impulsive and are BPD.   


Those things, though incredibly hard, can be changed and grown out of. You can replace the unhealthy coping style and patterns with healthier more effective ones.",thestudio8,hp9yzy

31,"I believe they're cousins, like with ADHD. Somehow related, somehow on a spectrum. People with BPD have exceptional sensitivity. That usually shows up in regards to their emotions, but they also have higher sensitivity to pain, stimuli, sounds, textures, etc. This is similar to ASD. Also ASD has issues with emotion and understanding them and with empathy. BPD does too but on the more extreme opposite end of the spectrum. Someday we'll understand how it's all connected, but I believe it all definitely is.",thestudio8,hp9yzy

33,"I'm only doing teletherapy too, it sucks and is a blessing all at the same time. Better than nothing but not as good as the real deal.   


It goes away, after a lot of time and work. Unfortunately if you're putting the wrong work into it, you can be busting your tail, without good results. So like algebra, if you're studying physics the whole time it just won't get you the right answers. I've had people be in therapy for literally 20, 40 years and not get results, but when they match up with the right treatment it happens quickly.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
34,"I really like ""Overcoming BPD, a Family Guide for Healing and Change"" by Valerie Porr, has rocks on the cover. It's the least derogatory and most DBT aligned that I've seen. 

It's not your insecurities, or may not be, there is definitely a strooooong stigma against BPD in culture and within the therapeutic world. You've absolutely got to find someone who believes in you and believes that you can get better (and someone appropriately trained) to get better. There are plenty out there who don't believe it's possible.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
35,"Well, I guess that's possible, but not what I've seen from my experience. I can only go on what I've personally experienced, and that is many people going from being miserable to having a tolerably normal life. 

One of the big issues I have with many of my clients is them not being assertive enough. They take and take and take, then inevitably blow up, and when they do they look like they're the ones who are jerks. So teaching assertiveness skills and how to set good boundaries is part of the process, and that has nothing to do with not bothering people. But it's not for everyone, if you've fully tried it out and it's not for you that's perfectly understandable.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
36,"DBT is not about shutting you up. It helps you speak up.

Part of DBT teaches interpersonal skills, some of them which include how to communicate your needs in a way that gets people to listen. For example, alot of times I need my emotions validated. Instead of saying ""hey you don't know how I feel"" or ""your being asshole, I have a right to feel this way"", which just make people defensive. Instead I clearly state ""I need help validating my emotions first""",trainsforall,hp9yzy

39,"As far as not having access to DBT, I think it's possible to work your way through it with a 'regular' therapist and self study, just much harder. If you can just find a good supportive relationship with a therapist and are self motivated enough, you can take online courses/read books and have them help you with them.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
40,"Absolutely, it's one of the dialectical dilemmas, apparent competence. It's a problem with a lot of people who never get diagnosed. They can look amazing in one context, say at work, but be a hot mess in ways people never see. It's actually a detriment to always look like you've got it together because you never get the help and support you need. In fact, people probably come to you with their problems when you're dying inside! So a ceo that can hire and fire people no problem may have issues with being assertive with their family, or be a hoarder or alcoholic.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
41,"EMDR is a great trauma treatment, as is brainspotting, so itd be great after some stability with DBT. Group is absolutely important, in some studies found to be the most important aspect. The skills can be taught in individual but it'll take forever and you don't get the benefit of learning from others.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
42,"Interesting question. :) Yes, the transference back and forth is very powerful. The relationship between me and my client is crucial in DBT. After suicide and self harm it's the second thing we focus on in any given session. If there are therapy interfering behaviors on either of our parts that's what we have to fix first, because if we're not on the same page it can't work.   


There's a lot of in the moment, humanistic/exestential type of therapy, that happens. So I get to be a real person and if I'm annoyed, or proud, or bored or whatever in the moment I say so. Which is awesome for me and allows for a true bond to develop. Then we can work on our relationship which will help with their outside ones.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
43,"Yes, you can have both. To diagnose you have a certain number of symptoms from each in the DSM.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
44,"Goodness, that's a lot to take on. I'd say have patience, and be supportive but with good boundaries of what you will and won't do. Progress definitely goes in fits and starts. In my mind, like with addiction, I like to think that any given person needs some random amount of times to hear something before it sinks in. Maybe they need to hear that they're worthy 150,000 times before they get it. So it's really frustrating when they don't get it and don't get it (or relapse and relapse) but I think of each time adding to that magical number and the 149,999th time is just as necessary as the 150,000th. 

I've literally said the same thing to a person a hundred times and on the hundredth time they're like ooooooooh you mean bla bla bla, and I'm like, yes!!! that's what I've been saying this whole time!! It's a complicated internal system, it takes time and patience and consistency.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
45,"My pleasure. üòä 

It's hard if they won't recognize it, as that probably means they won't be putting in much effort to make changes or meet you in the middle. 

You'll have to decide what you will and won't accept and then what your actions will be. For instance, no one deserves to be yelled at. So I'd tell them in a moment of calmness that you've decided that if you get in that situation again you're going to do whatever (take a break, get off the phone, etc) and give you each time to calm down till you can speak calmly.

Then give them resources on how to regulate their emotions. And try to remember it's not they're fault, they really don't know how not to yell, but as an adult it is their responsibility to learn something different.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
46,[removed],,hp9yzy
47,"Sorry i missed this one!! Yes, absolutely, and yes to all that they said. You can't do the other skills without mindfulness. With it you can catch yourself before you do any problem behaviors, or when you have an emotion that's not helpful, and once you catch it you have an option to change it. Otherwise life happens so fast that you feel like your emotions and behaviors happen first, and thoughts only come after the fact, so you become captured by them and some of their unfortunate consequences. An app like headspace is a great way to get you into daily practice. Good luck!!",thestudio8,hp9yzy
48,"I guess she's done answering. Yes, meditation would be great for someone with BPD if it's comfortable. Mindfulness is one of the core parts of DBT, and can help greatly with emotion regulation and overall to make learning and practicing other skills easier and more effective. Any type of meditation can help - walking, sitting, etc-  or other mindful or ""flow"" based activities like art, music, gardening etc. You could google ""one thing mindfully"" for a common DBT exercise.",TranZeitgeist,hp9yzy
49,Absolutely!! it's all about behavior change. Unfortunately you need some really specific help to get there (usually) but once you're pointed in the right direction it can definitely become something you've grown out of.,thestudio8,hp9yzy
50,"Man, I hate to focus too much on DBT, but for real, it's all about learning what the emotions are, and how and when to regulate them. If you've gotten to this point on your own, that's amazing, nice work!! 

The second stage of DBT, after getting a grip on things and understanding them for what they are, is to address all of the inevitable PTSD symptoms that you've gotten from all the years of invalidation, chaos, and trauma. 

I'd imagine that it might be time to address those things if you're able. If not it'll be like those gasoline fires in the middle east, as long as there is a well of fuel, the fire will always be burning.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
51,"eek, that's complicated. The favorite person issue has to do with both the black and white thinking and the abandonment issues, as well as attachment problems. You're kind of making that person be everything that you didn't get when you were a kid. Which can be great and feel wonderful, but they'll inevitably let you down, and they probably won't like all that pressure. 

So my advice would be try to put your eggs in different baskets. Diversify your social portfolio. Even if you want to spend all your time with one person force yourself to spend time with a bunch of different people. Some acquaintances, some casual friends, some close friends, and just a couple of people who are really really close. 

Also you need to get a lot of what you're wanting from other people from yourself. So working on self worth, self love, etc is important, as cheesy as that sounds. 

Don't not have friends tho, that'd be awful! :)",thestudio8,hp9yzy
52,"I think she is done answering. DBT is a challenge for most people, and someone with anxiety might find that the structure of DBT is helpful. For example using DBT diary cards gives some notes to start conversation during 1-1 therapy sessions, and ""group"" DBT is structured like a classroom, usually with handouts again offering some familiar rules and structure. Of course being open is a challenge with social anxiety, and perhaps a group of peers makes that more comfortable. DBT is also based on a 'non-judgmental' attitude, and genuine expression, hopefully lowering the sense of expectation and formality.",TranZeitgeist,hp9yzy
53,"It won't be easy, but it'd be worth it. The groups have minimal interaction, mine do at least. They're like a college class. You show up, tell about your homework listen to the lesson, then i have my folks end with saying one thing they'll remember from the day. So speaking twice is all i require, though obviously other instructors may be different. We don't talk about your childhood or traumas, there are very specific rules, it's really all about learning. It might actually be a good place to work on your social anxiety as there is low pressure and interaction.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
54,"One thing to note, is that many (Maaaany), other diagnoses fall under BPD. I would confidently say all my clients could easily be diagnosed with depression and anxiety and ptsd, many could be diagnosed with OCD or ADHD, bipolar, etc. So if you've got BPD, it's kind of understood that you've got some of the others, it's kind of impossible not to. (And people can be mistakenly treated for one of those others for years, when their real issue is an umbrella BPD.) 

As far as tips, it's hard to balance so many saucers spinning in the air. Sometimes you might have to sacrifice some for the others. 

I like the analogy of having 10 cups that hold 1 ounce, and an 8 ounce bottle of water. Each of those cups represent one of your values: being a good mom, being the most amazing employee, physical health, spirituality, etc. 

You've only got so much time and energy (the water) and you can never fill everything up to 100%. You'll have to rob Peter to pay Paul sometimes, you'll have to neglect self care to put on a great birthday party for your kid, or have to do a bad job on your work project so you can focus on taking an educational course. It's impossible to be perfect, we're all juggling competing values. Allow yourself to be mediocre, and cut out whatever extraneous things are stealing your water.",thestudio8,hp9yzy

58,"hm. Splitting isn't necessary to benefit from DBT, so it'd still be useful if you have emotion dysregulation. Schema therapy is great, I use it with Narcissistic Personality Disorder a lot, and use it within DBT too. Mentalization therapy is also really good, though I'm not trained in it so don't use it. Also don't know much about EFT.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
59,"It's not wrong, but you may have higher hopes than are likely to be met. Medication is good, but sometimes it's throwing darts blindly at a board. There's no telling what meds will and won't work with your particular biology and chemistry. 

Unfortunately it can be a long miserable guessing game to find which one works and has tolerable side effects. I have had clients who have found livable concoctions for sure, but they were my clients, meaning they were also in treatment. It's really only possible to get so far with the meds, the rest really has to be taught. 

DBT is like algebra. It has to be taught. Nobody is blaming anyone for not knowing how to do quadratic equations. You've got to learn addition and subtraction, then more complicated skills. It's the same with emotions and emotion regulation. You wouldn't be able to teach yourself long division, you need outside guidance for BPD. It'd have been nice if you could have gotten that in childhood, but if not, then its never too late. :)",thestudio8,hp9yzy
60,"Id say 80% of my clients have been diagnosed with bipolar, most erroneously, but they can have both. It's a real shame when they're misdiagnosed with bipolar as that medical treatment can be harsh and it definitely won't fix their bpd.

Schizotypal is interesting, I've had a couple with bpd that id also put in that category but its rare. I think future research will show there's a connection with it and bpd. Also with autism. As far as the key markers- schizotypal will have stronger psychotic looking features and doesnt have to have the strong emotional sensitivity.",thestudio8,hp9yzy
61,"Goodness, that's a big question. DBT takes a year of weekly individual and group sessions. It is ALOT of work. AND it works. There are some family supports out there, the book I like best is Overcoming BPD A Family Guide for Healing and Change, by Valerie Porr. I think it has the least derogatory language towards the person with BPD and has some great advice. (I hate you don't leave me, stop walking on eggshells, etc can be pretty mean and hopeless at times.) Valerie is also coming from a DBT perspective.

But the short answer is use grounding and calming skills with them, and use validation. 

And definitely I've had people get off meds after DBT, but that can't be a blanket statement of course. It is possible though.",thestudio8,hp9yzy

85,"getting into the topic of suicidality is tricky. But I can tell you some basics. If she's talking about the little risk label on the side or the side effect warnings, here's what I understand of that: When someone is horribly awfully depressed they have zero motivation or energy. They don't even have the energy to kill themselves. When they start to take antidepressants and are just starting to come out of that hole, they reach this danger zone, where they now have the energy and motivation to plan out a suicide attempt but the medication hasn't worked well enough to make them feel better enough to not do it. Hope all that makes sense. So in my experience I haven't seen that too much as an actual risk. A psychiatrist could better explain it all. I'd definitely try to get her to at least get a consultation with one. Medications won't solve all her problems but I'm a very strong proponent of them. They almost always help a little at least. They help to make it easier to learn the skills and change. As far as minimizing risk, if she's in treatment and has good family support that would help.

There is no easy answer as you know, but there are increasing options emerging.

Also, depending upon your exact diagnosis and any comorbid conditions one area that has ME very eager ti learn more about is DMT or Psylicibin. 

I am not a doc and haven‚Äôt yet tried it myself, but the results with some military veterans w extreme PTSD have been nothing short of jaw dropping.  

It is NOT for the faint of heart and you MUST consult a physician to not be totally reckless.

You do it once, it takes 10-15 minutes and it is beyond intense which is why you need to be careful w any psychiatric conditions as some people apapeemtky have been messed up after.

2,"A Favourite Person is someone you form a co-dependent dynamic with. The relationship is dysfunctional by nature. This refers to ‚Äúa specific relationship addiction characterized by preoccupation and extreme dependence‚Äîemotional, social and sometimes physical‚Äîon another person‚Äù (Lampis et al., 2017). The main consequence of codependency is that ‚Äúcodependents, busy taking care of others, forget to take care of themselves, resulting in a disturbance of identity development‚Äù (Knudson & Terrell, 2012).

Codependency can be distinguished from BPD; while BPD includes instability in interpersonal relationships, it does not involve dependence on other people.

To sum up, codependency is a psychological concept that refers to people who feel extreme amounts of dependence on certain loved ones in their lives, and feel responsible for the feelings and actions of those loved ones. Codependency is not recognized as a distinct personality disorder by the DSM-5.

That said, while codependency does overlap with other personality disorders, it appears to constitute a distinct psychological construct.

In a healthy relationship, both individuals have a sense of autonomy and independence, and are able to maintain their own identities while still being connected to their partner.

While in a codependent relationship, one person may sacrifice their own needs and wants in order to please their partner, or they may become overly enmeshed and lose a sense of self.

Additionally, in a codependent relationship, there is often an imbalance of power, with one person being overly controlling or dominant.",ladyhaly,158eugl

Based on what I know, I agree with this. A Favourite Person is someone a person with BPD forms a codependent relationship with. The ""addiction"" in the case of BPD isn't just with the dopamine hit with being preoccupied and in constant contact with the other person though. There's also the addiction to self harm and/or impulsive and destructive behaviours as a means of blowing off stress.

9,"My mom actually wasn't mean, really ever. My father was the bad parent. He was emotionally abusive to both of us (more so towards my mom), I rarely saw him because he came/went randomly. We had a high anxiety, unpredictable home life because my father was paranoid w/ ptsd, etc from his own past & his job as a cop. When I was around 5, he just didn't come home & I never saw him again. He was totally unstable, supposedly bi-polar, by my old psychiatrist believes he had BPD since all the traits/behaviors were there. I turned out exactly like my father, unfortunately. 

I had bad episodes since I was little kid. My mom tried completely normal parenting, but I'd get triggered, be screaming I was going to kill her because she wouldn't explain exactly why she wouldn't buy me some piece of candy or something. My mom would tell me, 'Don't worry, this is just a phase', which would trigger me screaming/crying for hours more. 

Besides the massive episodes I had every month or so, I thought I was a happy kid. I was totally split black/white, either completely fine or having a meltdown. Because 95% of the time I seemed great, my mom didn't get me any help. I just got worse. When I started dating as a teenager, my boyfriends triggered the episodes. I was fine w/ friends so I thought my mom & my boyfriends were the problem. 

I don't know anything for sure but the black/white stuff might be related to how I emotionally blocked out everything with my father. I wouldn't talk about him, I never cried that he vanished. I thought I didn't care. I just pushed him out of my mind like he never existed. Then I'd explode from other stuff.",Piconaught,158eugl

I know they were doing the best they can, but they were often putting themselves first.

I don't really want to get into a lot of details with what I went through because there's a lot and I'm afraid I'm just going to get caught up in recounting them. My upbringing with having no safe person to turn to led me to split on myself the most. I genuinely hated myself at times and only tolerated myself at best. I truly believed that I wasn't lovable unless someone was benefiting from my existence.

I'm happy to have lived a life that changed that perspective for me. I'm glad I moved countries. If I didn't leave my previous environment, I'd still be stuck.",ladyhaly,158eugl
11,"I felt I was alone a lot of the time just because I was on only child of a single parent & my mom was at work. I'd just be home alone after school everyday, reading or something. I guess it wasn't totally 'normal' parenting since I didn't have any rules, responsibilities or punishments. but she was like a normal, nice person. 

I got called 'spoiled' a lot, but I can't remember who'd say that. I think it was friends who had to do chores or who had curfews. For a long time, I thought a lot of my BPD issues were related to me being an only child. I had no other kids to compare myself to. My cousins were all 15+ yrs older than me so my extended family were all adults. I didn't know if or how abnormal my behavior was with my mom. My friends seemed to be more respectful to their parents but it's not like I had episodes in front of anyone, so my friends didn't know I was sometimes out of control at home. 

The splitting on self thing is interesting. I don't think I really did that, but I'm unsure. I was suicidal a lot, but that's different. The intense splitting I had on my mom or boyfriends was never anything I felt for myself, I know at least that much. I saw myself as both good/bad at the same time, but there was a clear divide. Like '75% of me is good, 25% is terrible & unacceptable'. It felt separated inside of me. Like if I could just cut out this bad section I'd be fine.",Piconaught,158eugl

Clomipramine is doing the trick for it now. Depression seemed to ease for a little while when I was on one of those, but I can't remember which :( As for BPD, I've never been given anything specifically for that but for my physical health issues I'm on Carbamazepine which is sometimes used as a mood stabilizer I guess and my BPD is much better now, but that could also be because I'm away from my main triggers. Hope this helps a little :) Everyone reacts differently to different meds. OH also therapies: CBT for depression, ERP for OCD and DBT for BPD.

I have a BPD medication named Rexulti which massively helped with my depressive episodes, but I‚Äôve tried every soft-core anxiety medication and I still have lots of trouble managing it and regulating it. The only thing that works in Xanex, and typically doctor led won‚Äôt prescribe both Adderall and Xanex together since they‚Äôre opposite effects essentially.

It's very helpful to me as a mood stabilizer in addition to helping with suicidal thoughts. Additionally, my personal experience has been that the fewer meds I'm on, the better and more helpful it is for me. I highly recommend either option!

4,"It can be sketchy at times but I've shed a lot of anxiety and feelings of discontent by snorting ket. It is definitely something you want to do in moderation because depending on how traumatized you are it can become addictive, can fuck up your kidneys and in my experience chronic usage can actually make it harder for you to be less anxious while sober.

 BUT for about a two-week period after my first time using it I felt damn near no feelings of anxiety or fear  while sober and my urge to drink evaporated. It gets you into a headspace where you are better at looking at yourself in the third person and evaluating your thoughts and emotions objectively. I've done a lot of acid over the years which helped me immensely but was also very painful and frightening at times, and I would almost describe ketamine as LSD on training wheels where there is far far FAR less of a risk of having a bad episode on it.",GiveBackTheBoard,16f4xn9

Don‚Äôt just step away unless you are certainly done because that will not help her going back and forth. Everyone‚Äôs therapy takes different time, does she have other things going on that she may be talking about? if she was diagnosed in couples therapy wouldn‚Äôt her new therapist have those records?

But we could all tell when she found the one that clicked.

If you feel this is important and why you are sitting ducks and that you love her enough then help her move along with treatment.

Now, she rarely talks about her therapy, and I am starting to wonder if she is thinking the couples therapist was wrong. She rarely mentions going, and when she does talk about her sessions, she mentions nothing of BPD or treatment. It was a big diagnosis for us, and we did ALOT of talking about how it had affected her life. Now, nothing. Like I said, I don‚Äôt want to pry.

I still have a long journey of recovery ahead of me, but I've definitely made some progress since my diagnosis. BPD is definitely treatable, it just takes a lot of work and dedication. You got this!

I highly recommend Dr Daniel Fox on YouTube! He is a fantastic, compassionate human being.

I had to stay away from most bpd subreddits, especially the ones that are made for individuals that have a loved one with bpd in their lives. They are very harsh and toxic. I spent hours reading them just to make me feel worse about myself and justify the ""monster"" that I was. But with time, some healing, my own experiences and reflection. I had to come to my own realization that there are some individuals that have BPD that are unfortunately untreated and have abused these people. I had to tell myself that it is their place to vent, it's none of my business and it won't help me heal.

6,"BPD is a combination of hereditary genes, brain structure and environment. People can be diagnosed without having any trauma. This illness is so stigmatized and misunderstood so that‚Äôs probably why you‚Äôre in disbelief. Try not to focus too much on the label but treatment. There are many disorders that benefit from the same therapy. The other thing is make sure you are not taking in every video on YouTube and reading articles online. Go to sites like National Institute of Mental Health or Nami (anything .org). Any doctor can write a book or make videos but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs accurate information (their own knowledge) or reviewed by a team of experts (that have published many studies and have a plethora of experience). I can walk into a grocery store and buy homeopathic remedies for a problem I‚Äôm having but those treatments mage claims that have never been studied (are not FDA approved), have no long term data or potential adverse outcomes or the ingredients aren‚Äôt even screened. People read the label and are completely convinced yet when you look up the ingredients in medical journals, hundreds of studies have proved that the ingredients are ineffective or you‚Äôd have to take massive doses etc. Nami.org is another great source to educate family in your life. So many subs here are peoples opinions and support is great but don‚Äôt take everything as fact. Most folks with BPD have experienced trauma and BPD is a painful illness. It is natural when suffering and hurting (especially when it wasn‚Äôt your fault) to feel angry and blame xyz. I won‚Äôt use BPD because I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings so take for example a spouse healing from being married to an NPD partner (not traits, actual disorder). They are adamant that their partner loved them and they know it. NPD don‚Äôt have emotional empathy or experience positive emotions. They don‚Äôt prey on empaths, that‚Äôs bs. They don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre sweet, a psychopath, fat, skinny whatever. They care about the 4 things: sex, supply (sadistic or narcissistic), services, and safety. Supply is all that matters and as long as one of these services are meet at any given time, they are fine. True NPD don‚Äôt want a caring, sweet person. They want someone to be mean to them (it‚Äôs a whole other explanation) that‚Äôs why they are so cruel to nice and caring people that don‚Äôt react poorly despite their abuse. So many comments you read, people understand the language and terms surrounding NPD but they apply experiences to match those terms and it‚Äôs way off. You experience BPD, before diagnosis would you say to a therapist: ‚ÄúI have dichotomous thinking‚Äù or ‚ÄúI fear intimacy‚Äù or ‚ÄúI tend to follow a relationship cycle where I idolize someone and then devalue and discard them‚Äù. That is not conscious and entirely absurd. If you knew, you wouldn‚Äôt be here.

It‚Äôs natural but don‚Äôt get so hung up on causes and things that keep you spiraling in negative ways. Focus on getting better. This isn‚Äôt a death sentence and with the right therapy (of course it takes a lot of motivation and hard work) the prognosis is actually very good (better than bipolar) but it‚Äôs not easy and requires a lot.

My mom has been diagnosed with bipolar, BPD, undiagnosed, all the things. I have told her it looks like BPD to me, and that has never caused an issue with us, maybe because I also have it, idk. 

I would say unless you have that level of communication, you may just want to suggest she ‚Äútalks to someone because we all need help sometimes.‚Äù  Which is true, but it is going to be less likely to make her feel ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù. Once she do that, then let the professionals handle it.

I'm glad you have a diagnosis.

I wouldn't recommend smoking. I think doing DBT should be your focus. Weed might help you in the moment, but it's just masking the real problem. DBT will help you look at things differently and it will teach you coping skills to deal with what the weed covers up. You won't progress in your recovery if you ""just"" smoke weed. Therapy is VERY important. 

I smoked weed all my life (I'm 55 next month) and it's never ""helped"" me with my symptoms it made it worse. I quit 3 months ago. After awhile 1 or 2 ""puffs"" is going to turn into 3 or 4 and then eventually, You'll be smoking way more than you intended because your tolerance will go up and you'll need more. 

Most people with BPD have problems with addiction, so be very careful if you continue to use it. Ask your psychiatrist if the meds they want you to take comes in shot form. One of my meds is a shot that I take once a month.",Snoo_69221,10q2m76

>Marijuana dependency really isn‚Äôt good for BPD. I believed it was the best and healthiest mood stabilizer for me for a very long time but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs a depressant.

Medication dependency is probably WAY worse than marijuana dependency, especially in the long run. It isn't necessary to smoke weed, especially if you don't want to smoke for whatever multitude of reasons, as there are edibles. This isn't to say a dependency on anything is good, but I'd prefer anyone have a marijuana dependence than a possible medication dependence.

What a lot of people don't understand is that weed reacts to our bodies because we have endocannabinoid systems in our body that allow the chemical reaction CBD, THC, etc. provide (meaning we have historically, for thousands of years evolved to consume cannabis in some way, some how). This isn't opposed to the chemicals in medications like Prozac, Wellbutrin, etc., BUT the copious amount of synthesized chemicals ingested in medication overtime as opposed to cannabis overtime makes medication less preferable, at least to me. (Not to say I don't take medications. They're cheaper because my insurance covers it compared to cannabis, though I'd rather use cannabis instead.)

&#x200B;

>I support this actually. I use 1:1 edibles that keep me from getting stoned but calm. I have to because I do have severe ADHD but that medication has helped with my impulse control.

&#x200B;

I have ADHD as well and a byproduct of my hobby of learning about and using cannabis is that I can be focused on multiple hobbies of mine that can cause me executive dysfunction through ADHD or feelings of BPD that may arise from not doing things a certain way, like someone else, or succeeding in a given time at a HOBBY which I don't HAVE to be good at. Along with my medication, cannabis can help me guide myself better towards better goals, discipline when it comes to certain hobbies of mine like graphic design, gaming, whatever. This is dependent of what I'm smoking though. (This goes into the next thing)

&#x200B;

>I believed it was the best and healthiest mood stabilizer for me for a very long time but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs a depressant.

&#x200B;

I forgot to address this whole thing and just decided to address the first part first, then this part now. Cannabis CAN be a depressant. CAN be. Depending on what you are ingesting cannabis can have a wide variety of effects on you and your body. This is because different strains have different effects on the body and mind and can be broken down VAGUELY into indica and sativa strains, where indica strains can make you feel chill, want to sit or lay down, and is typically what people imagine when someone says they smoke cannabis. Sativa strains usually have you up and doing something, and can help focus on specific tasks that need to get done throughout the day or whatever hobbies you want to focus on.

But like I said, indica and sativa are vague and don't give the whole picture, if any picture at all, on how different strains will affect you and your body. What is more important than strain and THC % is freshness and terpenes. Terpenes react with everyone's endocannabinoid systems differently, and THC% is nothing without knowledge of how fresh the cannabis you're smoking can be. For example, something ridiculous like a THC %100 strain that is a week or two old from harvest vs a THC %50 strain and less than a day old from harvest. More THC sounds more potent, but the trichomes, which hold the psychoactive properties of THC, CBD, etc. degrade overtime causing less potency.

&#x200B;

I'm happy cannabis helped you with previous addictions, and that's a huge achievement!

THOUGH, long term use (heavy or not) CAN benefit us if used right. If you just smoke or use edibles and don't really do much, it's a personal choice which isn't indicative of the plant itself not working. When high, or even just using CBD, you don't really lose YOURSELF and your decision making, which is an important part of getting better. Your decision making. Introspection, Therapy, DBT, can ALL be done while high or using cannabis on the side and can even aid with these processes to help someone with BPD learn to better emotionally regulate. It's the personal choices you make while high, or using cannabis, that can help you ALONG with the cannabis helping on the way to a better life. It's a hand that guides you, not a car that takes you to where you need to be in life.

The one thing I hope you do is take the time to learn about cannabis, whether it's before or after using it, because it isn't really exactly hard to explain, but there are people out there who can explain these things WAY better than me or the people in this subreddit.

*Also because cannabis is super interesting and an interesting part of human history lol.*

I'm not a doctor, I can only give my personal experience. Apologies to any scientists. 

I've taken medication(SSRI) for a few years now. It effectively regulates my intense suicidal episodes, but nothing else, no matter what was changed. I'm very grateful for this and will continue to take them. 

I started smoking weed recreationally as most do. When I take a few puffs in the morning, I feel similar to how you describe where I'm more productive, more clear minded, less tired, etc. I do also get high, and I think people don't really know the difference. 

Your body has whats called the endocannabinoid system(ECS). The ECS is a cell signaling system that affects different neurological processes including learning and memory, emotional processing, sleep, temperature, pain, inflammatory and immune responses, and the digestive system. 

When you take a few puffs, you're releasing cannabinoids into your system which attach to ECS receptors. Your body also naturally produces cannabinoids which do the same thing. This attachment excites the receptors and basically signals to them to do their job. When you're high, your ECS is very excited. When you take a few puffs, your ECS is just a little excited. When you havent ingested any cannabis, your ECS is at its normal rate. 

It's up to you if you decide the effects from this are what you want or not. But its not poisoning your body or anything, it's all biology. If you feel the effects without medication or combined with your medication help you function more, maybe you should consider continuing to ingest cannabis. You can choose alternative methods like edibles or vapes which MAY(i stress the may because of vaping, the science is not 100% conclusive on that yet) be healthier and/or less intrusive than smoking. Whatever you choose, it should be up to you and informed based off factual information.",sabaping,10q2m76

17,"Excellent comment, especially what you say on if you get high and do nothing thats not indicative of weed working/not working. Getting high is a biological process that causes certain effects. None of those effects include laziness or a desire to do nothing. Weed can make us comfortable and if we are always extremely uncomfortable(whether due to stress or anxiety or anything) then that comfort can be addicting and you will feel a lot more inclined to stay comfortable. 

Personally I went through a hard period of smoking and doing nothing. I was also horrifically depressed. I will say getting high allowed me to introspect by clearing out all the anxious/intrusive thoughts and I really got to the bottom of my feelings. I also developed an intense love for nature and the world around us, but thats just my personal experience. Your journey is your journey and if you're getting high and doing nothing, it almost certainly isnt because of the weed. And most importantly it doesn't make you a bad or lazy person!

I guess I plan to go about it in a more measured approach, under the care of a doctor who will prescribe certain strains and ways of injecting that have a THC/CBD content that would work for everyday use and my issues. It‚Äôs expensive but I want to avoid the pitfalls that a lot of people seem to have fallen in when it comes to weed, self medicating to the point where they stop building up emotional resilience or other coping skills through DBT/therapy since ingesting cannabis/getting high takes those feelings away and they become dependent on that. While I enjoy getting high, I view getting high and using medical marijuana are two separate things? My goal with medical marijuana is not to get high all the time, it‚Äôs symptom management through daily controlled intake under the direction of a professional, as you would any other mental health medication. 

I will still recreationally use of course, but will do it when I simply want to get high, which is not a bad thing!

20,"As ‚ÄòSno‚Äô said, caution is in order. We tend to have addictive and/or masking tendencies.

There is no recommended medication for BPD.  None.  

BPD isn‚Äôt a chemical imbalance or an organic deficiency it is a personality disorder and, by definition, is primarily about cognitions - thinking patterns.  

Medications don‚Äôt fix cognitive patterns.  But, fortunately, various talk therapies and associated skills can address and change cognitive patterns.  DBT, IFS, MBT, TBT are all therapies which show high efficacy with BPD.  And, when these therapies are used, BPD is literally the most addressable of all personality disorders.

Medications MAY help with ‚Äòco-morbid‚Äô/co-occurring mental health issues that are also commonly experienced by people with BPD. Some example common BPD comorbidities include anxiety, depression, paranoia, etc.  I say medications **MAY** help with these comorbidities because there is some evidence that even these are a bit different in people with BPD - being generated by our thinking patterns as opposed to organic origins. And, again, medications do not address cognition patterns well.  (But, people certainly CAN have BPD and ‚Äòorganic‚Äô depression. Anything is possible with humans!)

You‚Äôre Psychiatrist KNOWS all this. They are likely compliant to the marijuana idea because they know there are unlikely to be ‚Äòbetter‚Äô medications and just want you to experience some relief if you can.

It's going to be a lot harder for people in general to find those social and healthcare related tools. I imagine that leads to a lot of remissions in those with BPD being slower.

But don't give up hope! Your doctor made an overgeneralization. You can struggle with BPD at any age, and you can get help and learn helpful skills at any age.",princefruit,1b9lv00

0,"In late 2022, I was diagnosed with CPTSD, major depression, and BPD. 

In late October 2023, I started seeing a new talk/couples therapist who specializes in BPD. At the same time, I started what‚Äôs called RODBT which is typically a treatment for people who lean over-controlled. 

Anyway, both new therapists saw me at the height of emotions and behaviors that resembled BPD but believed were trauma responses. They both explained that while there are similarities, their experience with BPD patients was that the frequency and severity of ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù were often and high. While I have my reservations, I feel they know best. Most importantly, I now try to see myself outside of any diagnosis and treating myself with more compassion due to trauma. Trauma is the core. Since doing that, I noticed such a shift in how I speak to myself and my motivation to be better each day. It‚Äôs really hard. For almost 2 years, I thought I had BPD, started more meds, and had the diagnosis pathologized by a partner. When they left, it was hell trying to escape from the BPD identity. 

All this to say, you are not any disorder. You are human. And some really tragic things probably happened that caused life to feel unsafe. Treat yourself like you would a close friend and take care of you as you would for someone you love. üíï as long as you are feeling safer and steadier, through ebbs and flows, you‚Äôre healing.",xgirlgeniusx,1cu9ryb
1,I have both Cptsd and BPD. I've only had one really good cptsd doctor and therapist and thr others not so much and really found a lot of Psychiatrist don't like dealing with BPD. That's just in my case though.,Lilauren86,1cu9ryb
2,"Hii. I have a friend (let‚Äôs call her Bianca) who exhibited BPD symptoms for years. Her parents didn't pay much attention to her because her older sister, Stacy, was dealing with drug addiction and other issues. Stacy is about 13 years older than Bianca.

Their parents spent a significant amount of money on rehab for Stacy, even sending her to another country for treatment. While their family is comfortable, they aren't super wealthy, so they used Bianca‚Äôs college fund to cover Stacy's expenses. Stacy eventually recovered, got married, and is now thriving with a daughter of her own.

Meanwhile, Bianca went to university and started seeing a psychiatrist. She was shocked when the psychiatrist diagnosed her with CPTSD instead of BPD, attributing it to her childhood trauma. Bianca then discussed this with several friends, including me. We all have similar upbringings and relationships with our parents, experiencing minimal physical but evident emotional abuse. Interestingly, all of us have been professionally diagnosed with BPD, except Bianca, who was diagnosed with CPTSD.

Here are my thoughts:

You have four people with similar upbringings and symptoms.
Three were diagnosed with BPD, one with CPTSD.
Who has the correct diagnosis?

In my opinion, you should reach out to a psychiatrist who specializes in both CPTSD and BPD (perhaps even in DTD) to get a more accurate diagnosis. The differences between these disorders can be subtle, and an expert who understands both can provide the best insight.

Also, I found this article that might give you some insight: [CPTSD vs BPD.](https://thewaveclinic.com/blog/cptsd-vs-bpd/#:~:text=Individuals%20with%20complex%20PTSD%20often,intense%20anger%20or%20self%2Dharm)

8,"Also, I asked ChatGPT the differences in BPD and CPTSD based on my characterizes and this is what it spit out:


While there can be overlap in the characteristic traits of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), there are also some differences in how these conditions manifest. Let's compare the characteristic traits you provided in the second prompt in the context of CPTSD and BPD:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Emotional Instability:

CPTSD: Emotional dysregulation in CPTSD often stems from traumatic experiences, leading to intense emotional responses to triggers related to past trauma. Individuals with CPTSD may experience emotional numbness or detachment as a coping mechanism, alongside sudden and overwhelming emotional reactions when triggered.

BPD: Emotional instability in BPD is a core feature, characterized by rapid and intense shifts in mood, often in response to interpersonal stressors. Individuals with BPD may experience chronic feelings of emptiness, fear of abandonment, and difficulty regulating emotions, leading to impulsive behaviors and unstable relationships.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Impulsivity:

CPTSD: While impulsivity can occur in individuals with CPTSD, it may be more directly linked to trauma-related triggers. For example, impulsive behaviors may arise as maladaptive coping mechanisms to avoid or numb overwhelming emotions or to regain a sense of control in triggering situations.

BPD: Impulsivity is a hallmark feature of BPD, often manifesting in various areas of life such as spending, substance abuse, reckless driving, self-harm, and risky sexual behavior. Impulsive actions in BPD are typically driven by emotional dysregulation and a desire to alleviate distress or avoid perceived abandonment.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


Fear of Abandonment:

CPTSD: Individuals with CPTSD may also experience a fear of abandonment, particularly if past trauma involved abandonment or betrayal. However, this fear may be more generalized and less pervasive than in BPD.

BPD: Fear of abandonment is a central and pervasive feature of BPD, often leading to frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. This fear can significantly impact relationships, behavior, and self-image.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Interpersonal Relationships:

CPTSD: Individuals with CPTSD may struggle with interpersonal relationships due to difficulties in trusting others, maintaining boundaries, and regulating emotions. Relationship challenges in CPTSD may stem from past traumatic experiences and attachment disruptions.

BPD: Unstable and intense interpersonal relationships are a core feature of BPD, characterized by idealization and devaluation of others, fear of abandonment, and a pattern of alternating between extremes of idealization and demonization in relationships.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

In summary, while CPTSD and BPD share some characteristic traits such as emotional dysregulation and difficulties in interpersonal relationships, there are also distinctions in how these traits manifest and their underlying causes. CPTSD is primarily rooted in past trauma experiences and their impact on emotional regulation and relationships, while BPD is characterized by pervasive patterns of instability in self-image, emotions, and interpersonal behavior.",SwimmerSuper1072,1cu9ryb

Honestly I would also advocate a grippy sock vacation to get yourself properly sorted out by the pros

I say this due to personal experience as I did exactly that last July

- left abusive relationship, moved in with parents, grippy sock vacation

So the results for me were : a proper mental health diagnosis and treatment plan, a safe place & time to heal and work on myself seriously for once, I‚Äôm now sober for 9 months, the financial bleeding has stopped

I‚Äôm extremely fortunate to have supportive parents and this was huge during the first few months which were rough beyond belief for me : I was able to do things like - give them my credit cards, have them lock the house at night so I couldn‚Äôt go do crazy impulsive shit, be in a controlled drug free environment, help with stuff around the house which made me feel good about myself, and so forth

Basically rehab at the parents but also with professional medical help

I gave them access/permission to talk to all my doctors regarding my treatment plan etc

The way I looked at it was well - I‚Äôm 38, and at this point it had gotten pretty damn undeniable that I was a total train-wreck so desperate times called for desperate measures

And I totally get it - I had not lived at home since I was in high school

&#x200B;

It's a great idea in theory, it's a great idea to have group work by trained therapists who are prepared and have subsequent training, great boundaries ect but i don't see as very feasible digitally, by people which no training and own personal lives which can make moderation harder and likely volunteers who themselves are somewhere along or done in treatment. The sheer traction that it got in the last attempt within just hours and how quickly it turned overwhelming for the person despite many offering moderation and it seemed like they were going to have a strict schedule with days to practice dbt skills...

Sometimes adding a medication can help augment the effects of each, so it could be worth giving it a go. I always make sure to discuss their reasoning with my psychiatrist - its your body and if theyre just stabbing in the dark you deserve to know.

2,"My FP pulled me out of it. Honestly, if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be ready for treatment. Any therapy would have been treating my version of history, instead of reality. Talking to her, her sharing her perspective of my worst splits and my cycle of manipulation and abuse, and finally questioning every emotion I've had and treating each memory as if I had manipulated it, was the only way for me to finally grasp the severity of my mental condition. I got extremely lucky with her.

The only advice I could give would be to ask: 'what am I hiding from?'. Dissociation is an unhealthy coping mechanism. In my case, I was hiding from the guilt and the shame of what I had done to my FP, and avoiding responsibility of my actions. I completely shut down all emotions in order to avoid the uncomfortable feelings of reality. Once I recognized that, I forced myself into the uncomfortable, because I knew that was the only way to get better.",wutgaspump,1bb3hag

obviously BPD is biological so can go into remission and has to be monitored for life. I see narcism traits as being much more easier to treat once one sees one‚Äôs traits and behaviours. I would cope before I was diagnosed with BPD by doing the things my dad did (narcissism) like displaying my prowess of knowledge to hide the trauma I was suffering from BPD. 

Now that I know what‚Äôs going and have begun to unravel the puzzle the BPD is the main thing I deal with, the narcissism I see quite clearly on reflection of my past. I don‚Äôt feel worried about it. I see people with BPD as having superpowers in seeking the truth and what is genuine and that cancels out Narcissism which is shallow, superficial and self serving. As far as I can see from everyone on the  BPD forums they are the opposite of self serving, they seem very open to give and help out others. So I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried beyond the fact that you could use narcissism to mask BPD but if your working on yr BPD then it wont be a problem.",DiStUrBEdMeLoN,zvrvd0

Essentially there are nine traits that PW BPD express on a continuum from not at all, ever through to every day, all day long.  There are also relevant considerations included, like hypnogogic phenomena.  A specialist will use a diagnostic tool that is designed to assess this disorder.  They are looking for a specific cluster of symptoms that impact all areas of life.  

The adrenal gland is the one responsible as I understand it for the norepinephrine response that causes the euphoria.  According to my voice assistant, low norepinephrine levels are associated with symptoms like depression, anxiety, and ADHD.",ferrule_cat,1crfh4w

Euphoria is a very specific thing and directly tied to mood and psychotic disorders that produce mania and/or psychosis.

I have been diagnosed with this disorder for a long time and have seen a lot of therapists and psychiatrists, I also am in the mental health social services field, and I have never heard a professional talk about euphoria being a defining trait of BPD.

4,"You raise good points and I should have been mindful of the more formal and proper definitions of euphoria.

When I was initially diagnosed with BPD and when talking about it with a separate psychiatrist after, both made specific points of there generally being a pattern of both lows and highs in mood. And you're right, the DSM does not use the word euphoria and it explicitly states that periods of well-being are in fact rare, but when describing the instability of mood as a criteria for BPD it uses dysphoria as an example.

Since I was thinking of missing highs, I was thinking of extreme feelings, and the DSM links BPD to the exact opposite of euphoria, it was a term that made sense to use in its colloquial usage.

Obviously that doesn't make it necessarily correct but maybe that line of thought can help you make sense of why others are using it as well.. though, to be honest, I sort of doubt there's as much to it for others and it's likely just a combination of the colloquial usage of euphoria = mood high and seeing other people use it that way.",apidaexylocopa,1crfh4w

As you know being a year into it, emotional reactions are simply your body sensing danger and trying to protect you. 

I don't consider DBT to be a bandaid at all. There are components of it that are particularly bandaid-esque, especially when it comes to how to handle an emotion. These are important steps though, since the freakouts tend to cause most of our severe problems.

However, it's equally important to be analyzing your triggers later on. Anything that made you feel intensely is worth your time, but not everything must be solved at once. Wise mind is so much more powerful than a tool for handling stress. Pay attention to these situations once in wise mind: what were you thinking at the time? What was the fear? What are the things that would happen if the fear were true? How would you handle them? What ways is your fear tied to an emotional wound? Consider which scenarios in your past contribute to your reactions, and then you gotta do the whole, hug your past self and reparent them thing.

In order to change the way your brain is reacting to these perceived dangers, repitition and processing are your friends. No matter how many times you feel like you already know DBT, keep going. When you finish, go again.

I watched a video about a guy on a bike once. He switched the controls on the bike to go the opposite direction when steering. It took nearly a year for him to learn how to ride this bike, because his brain was so used to naturally steering the way it always had. He had to remind himself each time ""wait, left is right"". Until one day he woke up and just hopped on the bike and road it, his brain knew what to do. He said it was so sudden after a year of work and I think about this every time I feel discouraged.",,11c44gs
1,"I graduate from my DBT group this coming Thursday after one year. My last homework was on radical acceptance, and one thing I chose to radically accept is that I am always going to have big emotions. I told my group that I was assuming and expecting DBT to get rid of my big emotions, but I've had them my whole life, so I think they're here to stay. I have come to recognize that DBT gives me to tools to change my emotions, which for me, I think means I will always have to work to use my skills. My urge to explode, act unskillfully, the physical pain in my chest from perceived rejection that result from my big emotions is something I'll always contend with to some degree (and they have been putting me on the struggle bus this past month), but now I have the skills to recognize and contain it. It can feel almost pointless at times to continue to work so hard, making it difficult to recognize and acknowledge my growth. And ngl, even a bit resentful at times. While I don't have the answer for you, what if it doesn't ever actually go away? Could radical acceptance be a helpful skill in this moment of self doubt and what sounds like maybe a little bit of defeat?",Alainasaurous,11c44gs
2,"Maybe this other entity is angry at you for gaining more agency, upping the emotional ante until you can't bear it.. By ramping up the worse feelings with the most provocative thoughts, it'll make you go back. That's usually a sign of progress isn't it?

And the emptiness? Why not throw in a fear of progress! What usually fills the void is vanishing.. The chaos, the problems, the familiarity etc..

I kept being told to practice the skills *before* boiling point. But got consumed in how much everyone else was thinking, compared to what I was learning. It wasn't fair, that they live these happy, stable lives while doing the shit I'm being taught not to do. The ante was upped.. i got even more scared of not being accepted.. i/me continued to fight or cave.. contingent on others, yet again. 

So I think DBT is meant to be preventative more than just used in emotional emergencies.. ie we're not meant to get to that point if we're using the skills. If you only do it when it feels right, it's another way of turning back. But I get it's not that simple. 

It's a tough fight. Being patient, nurturing & somehow stern AND compassionate, NOT go against our own selves.

""Do whatever works"" is the other thing I was told. Instead of going on a voyage of criticism in a sea of denial (lol) just let yourself do the thing, or do many things, whatever they are. You're allowed to tell yourself not to be mean. And if the usual isn't working, change to a different cope.. then confusingly, what doesn't work that time, might work another time ü§ØüòÖ",,11c44gs

And, I don't have any friends, I'm alone quite often, so therapy is the limited space in my life where I feel seen and understood, but outside of that, it's been the physical pain in my chest, it hurts beyond belief.

2,"So to be clear: I am not formerly diagnosed at Autistic. Costs prevent me from getting a formal assessment. However, my longtime therapist is someone who largely works with Autistic and ADHD clients, and she is certain that I would qualify and has given me an informal diagnosis. This opinion is backed up by a friend of mine who is a licensed therapist and also on the autism spectrum. I've also taken the RAADS-R test in an informal setting (therapist friend gave it to me), and scored 170.I've been spending the last couple of months learning about Autism, and I am coming around to accepting the identification based on the evidence. For me, autism was never ever a suspicion, so it came at a surprise when my therapist brought it up.

BPD and Autism have some overlap‚Äîand for a long time, like 9 years long time, I just attributed a lot of my ""neurospicy"" quirks on my BPD. However, through this experience of reading research talking about Autism with Autistic friends, I'm learning that a lot of things from my childhood and beyond actually did hint towards autism, I just wasn't aware, as my previous understanding was outdated and misinformed.

I still can't say exactly where the BPD line ends and the ASD begins yet. I'm still learning so much. But I do know that certain aspects of my life make a lot more sense if I indeed am on the spectrum.

So-called ‚Äúautism‚Äù tests, like AQ and RAADS and others have high rates of false positives, labeling you as autistic VERY easily. If anyone with a mental health problem, like depression or anxiety, takes the tests they score high even if they DON‚ÄôT have autism.

4,"Hi OP. I appreciate your kind sentiments, but I have huge problems with the sweeping generalizations you are making, your erroneous scientific inferences, and your purporting of opinion as fact. You are bordering on spreading false information. 



Let‚Äôs go:



1. You do not need to take the MMPI for diagnosis of BPD. There is no official diagnosis process for BPD other than a licensed clinician agreeing you meet the criteria. Period. You may have other opinions, but they are not generally agreed upon in the scientific community.



2. Mania is a symptom of bipolar and is absent in BPD without comorbidity. I quote the sixth criterion of BPD: ‚Äúaffective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood‚Äù‚Äîwhich can include euphoria. Mania may include feelings of euphoria, but the terms are not interchangeable. A person of your credentials should know this.



3. It is theorized that trauma influences the development of BPD, and it is likely true, but the neuroscience of it all has not been determined, and we don‚Äôt know the process of how it all happens. Don‚Äôt claim to know this.



4. And this is what I find really offensive‚Äîyou claimed in a comment that early screen time leads to development of autism. The studies you‚Äôre talking about were correlational only, and to assume causation from these invalidates the most essential and basic scientific principle somebody of your background should deeply understand. 



Hope this helps.",Peachntangy,14n36op

I was extremely ill from this disorder and have multiple suicide attempts under my belt. I was emotionally disregulated for most of my life and had almost all the criteria for this disorder. I was manipulative and played the victim. Once I realized that my behaviour and emotional outbursts were MY problem, I wanted to learn better coping skills so I could feel and act like a normal human being and improve my relationships with others.

‚ÄúManic Episode

A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day‚Ä¶

B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:

1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep.
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility.
6. Increase in goal-oriented activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences.

‚Ä¶‚Äù that‚Äôs all from p. 124 in the DSM-5

I won‚Äôt copy the BPD criteria as you seem to know it, but as you can see, all of these listed above can correlate with those of BPD. For example, impulsivity, that can relate with all manic symptoms.

Bipolar and BPD have a lot of common ground. The biggest difference I share with people is that bipolar is a pattern where BPD is more irregular in mood changes.

I had a series of chronic and acute traumatic events occur in my childhood and teens along with emotional neglect and abuse. Both of my parents were also alcoholics. I suspect my late mom was a quiet borderline and that's my genetic component.

I got my BPD diagnosis from a different former therapist earlier this year and she said that the environment of one's upbringing had a lot to do with it, along with a genetic predisposition to being more emotionally reactive. So I have extrapolated that without the emotional abuse and being raised by alcoholics and other stuff, I might be a particularly sensitive person but i wouldn't be borderline. 

I do still agree with c-PTSD but I feel like the ""c"" part is important because most of my trauma was on a smaller scale over a long period of time, rather than one big defining event that occurred in a brief window of time.

98,"From Sablesweetheart: ‚ÄúBPD is very, very wrongly demonized, and it's frustrating because VERY effective therapy and life management techniques exist.

BPD is secondary trauma based dissociation.  That means (typically) one ""apparently normal part"" and multiple emotional parts.

PTSD and cPTSD is primary trauma based dissociation.  if they manifest emotional parts typically only have one (related to their specific trauma(s)

DID is tertiary trauma related dissociation and features multiple ""apparently normal parts"", often multiple emotional parts, and parts have an emancipated sense of self and agency.

The majority of techniques for managing BPD are the same as for PTSD, cPTSD, OSDD, and DID, with specifics tailored to BPD.

As you can see, BPD belongs to the traumatic disassociation group of disorders. It is worse than PTSD but not as bad as DID.

I‚Äôm about to be 31. When I was a teenager, I attempted suicide 7 times. I had multiple stents in psychiatric facilities. I suffered from self-harm behaviors. But all of that is what led me to wanting to get into the field because I wanted to break the stigma and help people who suffer how I have; to show them there is hope.

Now, I‚Äôm not perfect. I haven‚Äôt self-harmed in over a year, and before that it was 3 years, and so on. I have my moments too. I even have self-harm behaviors where I‚Äôve been overly promiscuous in the past, used substances, and just overall been super self destructive. So trust me when I say, I completely understand. And I hope sharing my story helps you know that you‚Äôre not alone. But it does get better. And my recommendations in my original post aren‚Äôt because of my degree, it‚Äôs from my personal experience. We tend to lapse when we hold things in. At least, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned.

And if by relapsing you are referring self-harm, one thing I learned during my internship under someone who has years of experience: When you have a thought about doing something, so sort of urge, immediately do something else that involves moment; it refocuses the brain.

When I want to hurt myself, I acknowledge my feelings, but then I remind myself of how far I‚Äôve come and how I‚Äôd hate to have another scar to remind me of a moment of weakness for a temporary lapse in emotion. And if you can‚Äôt get away from the urge, do the rubber-band trick. Or just slap your thighs. Or run as fast as you can so you feel that burn. It‚Äôll usually satisfy that urge.

And if your having self defeating talk, try combating it. Try focusing on good qualities (e.g., I‚Äôm a good friend, I‚Äôm strong, I‚Äôm good at‚Ä¶).

It still remains possible, though, and I would reckon (though I have nothing to back this up) that BPD would suffer from manic episodes unrelated to Bipolar than the average person would. High levels of stress can result in manic episodes, and with BPD having such intense emotions that can shift within minutes to hours (opposed to days to weeks, which you'll see in Bipolar 1) it's very possible to experience a small manic or hypomanic episode without ever realizing it classified as one. I wouldn't say I've experienced one myself either, but I can't rule it out cause I have had some crazy episodes in the past. 

Basically, mania isn't bipolar disorder. Mania is a symptom of bipolar disorder. If I'm remembering correctly, Bipolar 1 you have to experience at least a week long manic episode, Bipolar 2 requires a 4 day hypomanic episode.",susabb,14n36op

168,"Surely, I jest, but it would make your day a lot easier and lighten the vibe.  It could make a funny movie and maybe improve peoples' lives.  Being around all that hostile energy on a daily basis must be very draining mentally.  You must have crazy dreams.  I volunteered with the Elizabeth Fry Society and visited women in a medium security prison once a week.  I had volunteered for ten years with the Crisis Centre where I live and decided to do face to face work.  The inmates generally liked us because we offered a little break from their boredom, did crafts with them or just chatted.  I did it for a year and every time the energy was palpable.  It was certainly an eye opener into human experience and behavior.

I'm curious as to what led you to want to be a guard in a maximum security prison and how you feel about that decision so many years later.  I can't imagine that it's the pay that keeps you there.  What would you say to a young man or woman who thought they might want a career like yours?",22rockyroad,14n36op
0,"I've completed a year long group DBT program and I would consider myself in remission. I had tried DBT several times prior, but this round stuck. During earlier attempts at DBT, I think they didn't work out, because I was in my ""crisis-era"" and really needed crisis management skills and validation before feeling ready for group DBT work. Without validation and understanding of where I was at, I was skeptical of DBT and felt like I was being told everything was my fault because I didn't communicate well. Through individual therapy, I learned (and continue to do so) where my challenges come from so I could see how the skills could fit into my life. Understanding the why behind the skills, for me, was very important to know. I haven't ever done individual DBT therapy, just group, so I can't speak to how it is 1:1.",Alainasaurous,15pq365

2,"this is so helpful! I luckily am not in my ‚Äúcrisis-era‚Äù ‚Äî that occurred almost 2 years ago, which brought me to intense therapy. For the first time, I am recognizing a lot of drama around my life is created by me (directly or indirectly through others‚Ä¶).

The hardest part I am still struggling with is being honest about my motives in therapy. I‚Äôve made progress in that I started opening up a little more this year‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the feeling and explanations I struggle to voice. The attention-seeking aspect, I can‚Äôt help but deny it to my therapist though she knows and makes me aware in many ways. I am too embarrassed and scared of being vulnerable, for some reason I can‚Äôt help but care what my therapist thinks of me‚Ä¶ when I do start opening up I cry.

Hoping my desperation to gain the skills and willingness to change will surpass my fear of losing my security blanket",Affectionate-Ride472,15pq365

4,"I wish I had a better answer. Honestly,  I think it's we have built up a lifetime of these behaviors to protect ourselves and that can be very hard to give up,  even if we logically agree it's for the best. I'm not saying don't do it. Please do. Try to help and love yourself anyway go can. I will say this,  almost everyone in my therapy group was in dbt before. It's possible it takes more than one for some of us. 

With love bro. Hope that helps",WhiteHeatBlackLight,15pq365

I highly, highly recommend Dr. Fox's BPD workbook. It's invaluable information and self analysis. Also, this community is great for seeing yourself in others and others seeing themselves in you. We all have a lot of experiences and resources to share with each other. Self awareness and review will be what saves you.",,vc97hs
