Does anyone have any stories of healing or recovery with BPD?

I never had a diagnosis and I was wondering if anyone has a similar or different experience of living with BPD. I am not in need of diagnosis now (yay :)) but I do recognise a lot of my self in these posts, of the times that trauma really affected me.

what exactly is the difference between recovery and remission? is either of them ""permanent""? like does a stage come up where you have barely any relapses or just get better?     

also, does your emotion intensity get any better after recovering? i feel like if my intensity gets a bit less, i can probably deal with my emotions better and will have very less, if not any, relapses. does that get any better?",1705299269.0,False,1,1,nishies_dreams,None,1971tlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1971tlb/questions_about_recoveryremission/

10,BPD ex randomly reached out has completely thrown me off my recovery ,"a rant about my lame ass situation that’s fucking with  my recovery - i also posted this in another BPD subreddit if you’ve already seen it

for context my ex (19m)and i (19f) were together for a year and a half, talking a long time before that and briefly after. we went no contact for a long period of time after we broke up and spoke again a little bit from october to december before i cut off contact completely because he is just not good for me and my healing journey that i am on not to mention he is quite an emotionally manipulative and aggressive person even without his bpd side ( we both have bpd he was only diagnosed last year i was diagnosed not long before my 18th birthday) when i cut contact off completely and asked him not to contact me he told me that he would and he would let me go on my journey of healing but then last week he started spamming me on two separate accounts practically begging for my attention and i just can’t handle him and his cries out for me. It sounds terrible i know but he is the kind of person who thinks he can do no wrong and always paints himself as the victim even in situations that have absolutely nothing to do with him. (ie. my literal SA :/ )

Since he contacted me i have not been able to get it off my mind and it’s plaguing me constantly, it’s put an absolute rift in all the work i’ve been putting into bettering myself and improving on who i am as a person. I know i’ve spilt on him again because i just feel intense rage when ever i even think about him. I don’t understand why he couldn’t just stay away and let me heal like i asked him too.To make it worse i seen him out and about 2 days ago and it just ruined my last 2 days i hate that he still has this hold over me and my life. I wish that i never met him so i could just live my life like a normal human being again.

13,BPD and Recovery,"[by: BRIDGER PALMER](https://newgrantland.com/diet-coke-3/)

I believe everyone should go to rehab at least once in their life. It is the most terrifying time in your life that you never want to do again. I met so many people and learned so many valuable things. Most importantly, I walked out sober.

Then I relapsed again. Then I got sober. I repeated that process a dozen times, never staying clean for more than about a week before “going back out”.

Today, May 12, I am three months sober. It’s the longest consecutive time I’ve not been under the influence of anything since I was 14 years old.

Somehow that makes it sound not as bad as it is, and also worse. I was a southern California white kid smoking skunk in early high school, then went to college and joined a fraternity. My addiction spiked and tried to kill me. I’ve had multiple close calls.

I wrote out one of those close calls, and it seemed a little too spooky, so I asked ChatGPT to rewrite it to sound like it came out of Star Wars. It did not change much:

*I opened my eyes, facing the night sky of Coruscant. The bright lights of the city drowned out the stars, and I couldn’t see much. I was cold and sore. As I sat up, I realized my feet were completely exposed, resting on hard rocks. I looked down and saw that I had lost my boots. I felt the wind blow, and realized I was shirtless. I stood up and wobbled a little, still not completely sober. Then I heard a speeder flying down the road behind me. I was sleeping on the rocks by the speedway because I was on the run from the authorities. I checked my pockets and found only a small amount of credits, my hotel key, and a lightsaber. I felt the most intense thirst anyone has ever felt.*

*I suddenly came to my senses and realized that I was in Coruscant, without my boots, my shirt, my comlink, or my speeder. I had no idea what to do next. Suddenly, I felt a surge of energy as the Force flowed through me. I became fully aware of my surroundings, and realized that I needed to find water and shelter soon, or I would not survive in this heat.*

*I quickly searched for my speeder in the nearby parking lot, but was stopped by a security droid who ordered me to leave the area. I explained my situation, but the droid refused to help me. I walked to a nearby shop and bought a spare robe from a vendor, along with a large bottle of water. I sat in the shade outside the shop, trying to figure out what to do next.*

*Just then, a taxi pulled up in front of me. I approached the driver and said, “Excuse me, I have a hotel key for the Imperial Palace and a few credits left. Can you take me there?” The driver laughed and said that there were many hotels by that name, but he would take me to as many as I could pay for until I found the right one. He drove me around for hours, until we finally reached the Imperial Palace. I thanked the driver and got out of the car.*

*As I walked into the lobby, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. I had found my way back to my hotel room. But as I entered the room, I was confused. All of my clothes were there, but I couldn’t remember what I was wearing when I woke up. And my communicator was missing. I realized that I must have lost it during my blackout.*

*I called my master, who contacted the Jedi Council. They instructed me to stay in my room and wait for their arrival. I waited for hours until my master arrived with other Jedi. They took me to the Jedi Temple, where I was treated for dehydration and given a stern warning about the dangers of overindulgence.*

This is the part where I’m supposed to write about how beautiful sobriety is, how much happier I am, and how I can never see myself doing anything bad again. While I am happy, and my life is great, and I have no desire to drink today or use anything ever again, it’s not all unicorns and rainbows.

I’m still an addict. My issues run deeper than that. I have BPD, which is either borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder depending on which doctor I stand in front of.

That being said, my mood has mellowed out a lot. I almost never get angry because of what I’ve been through. As I said, everyone should go to rehab.

It’s weird – that steely exterior going through all that stuff gives you. I can take people yelling at me, I can take people not liking me, and even people hating me. I can take people breaking up with me and telling me that they never want me in their life again, because compared to waking up on the side of the road in Coruscant without my lightsaber, with no credits, completely naked, except for my Jedi robe, everything else doesn’t look that bad in comparison.

I thought about this a lot while I was watching *Baby J* by John Mulaney. I understood where he’s coming from: making light of it is okay.

While I put my family, my friends and, unfortunately, people no longer in my life through a lot of pain, I think the right thing to do is to find a way to laugh at it now. What? It’s supposed to be the secret thing we never speak about? I find that idea ridiculous. I have made amends to those I’ve hurt, and I will continue to do so the further I get in sobriety. I continue to do better every single day. I continue to abstain.

I regret so many things, but I am way stronger now than I have ever been, and I have my addiction to thank for it. I’m thankful to still be here. I don’t want to say I’m happy any of that bullshit happened, or that I put anybody in my life through it, but clearly those are things I had to learn the hard way.

Of course, part of being an addict is losing things when you’re in active addiction. I lost my job, and I lost a lot of people really close to me. But I’ve also had a few stick around.

To everybody reading – no matter which side of the fence you’re on – I’m thankful for you eternally. I appreciate you touching my life.

22,What I've Learned During Recovery,"Hello Everyone! 

I've been seeing some tough posts here as usual 😢 and I wanted to offer some concepts that may change your perspective on BPD and help you to recover like I have been able to start doing. 

-None of this is medical advice, but it is backed by scientific concepts and derived from traditional psychiatry. Much of the nitty gritty science is left out. -

Additionally, I'd love more insight from everyone and to round out this information and make it more understandable and accurate/applicable, so I'd love feedback. I hope to one day develop a therapeutic processes which can be regulated and implemented for the treatment of severe psychiatric disorders!


Understanding BPD: 

• BPD is a list of symptoms that individuals fit into and are subsequently categorized into. Each individual's BPD is still unique and intricate, but it is not a hopeless state.


• BPD is thought to be the result of the inability to sufficiently actualize one's own self. Individuals suffering have experienced deep rooted trauma before the age of 3. 

• Trauma is a relative term based on our ability to cope with our environment at the time. BPD and all disorders evolve and integrate into our psyche. In BPD's case, most behaviors and thought patterns have been laced with the trauma from the specific incident which resulted in the inability to self actualize. 

• BPD and mental health disorders are environmental by nature. We develop like sponges, and as such, our environment plays a massive role in recovery. It is also the reason why environment limits our ability to truly recover. 

• BPD is a coping mechanism used to protect the body in times of severe stress. It has been reinforced repeatedly throughout your life, even if you didn't realize it at the time.


Treatments and focuses: 

• Identifying when, why, how long, when it began, when it was noticed and for what purpose splitting is occuring is imperative to recovery. Your body likely split much before your mind realized it. Understanding the behaviors, thought patterns, antecedents, and associations around splitting can help to identify patterns of trauma which we can trace back to our original trauma. 

• Everything has a pattern, but even clinicians only look for patterns that are normative for a disorder. Most don't have the adept pattern recognition that people with BPD have and additionally have no idea of what you personally feel like. Meaning that most clinicians will be unable to identify behavioral patterns and using CBT or DBT will help you to become the best doctor for yourself. 

• Therapies, such as CBT and DBT are quite common and effective for the treatment of BPD. (https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22838-dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt)
I found CBT to be more helpful in learning to identify the patterns and trauma and DBT to be more effective for building a plan of treatment and healthy structure. 

• With extreme caution and expertise; Approaching trauma in a controlled environment and actively exposing yourself to traumatic experience under guidance is extremely effective and I hypothesize to be the only method of long lasting recovery. 

Hallucinagenics may allow for the reduction of influence from the ego, but regular use in combination with therapeutic services can at least the reduction of its control over our own overstimulated self protection systems. Many medications for BPD also sedate the body, but force the mind to sleep as well. We want the mind to explore the body actively, not subconsciously. Delaying the response of the body to explore it is effective but taxing. Creates cycles if not done properly. Therapy mixed with hallucinagenic substances can be an effective treatment if in a comfortable and controlled environment. (Inhibition reduction) 

• bad trips are trauma being brought to the surface. 

• Learning how to help others first can make it easier to learn how to help yourself. 

• Learning how to use coping mechanisms will change your life. Look around and identify how other people are coping with their bodies. How they stand, act, behave, respond, move their hands or feet or wipe their nose. Look at how others handle stress. 


What I've learned a long the way;

• Anxiety prevents vital introspection. Approaching the feeling you are deathly afraid of is the answer. Anxiety and trauma are telling you to stay away. Your body physically recoils at the concept. Your mind begins to catch on fire. You are certain you are bound for death. For a psychosis-like dream. True terror. It will be horrible and unfixable. It's not true. Anxiety is ""protecting"" you, because the amount of trauma you are repressing feels too painful. 

• Your thoughts cannot physically harm you. Your actions can, but you cannot break your arm by thinking about breaking your arm. You are in control. 

• Behaviors are linked to underlying emotional responses and as such are methods of stress relief. 
The stress relief for the jaw and upper body tension, Laughing and crying, are two sides of the same coin from an anatomical perspective. Explore which calming or relieving behaviors have similar ways of using your body to your natural propensity for coping. 

• Our minds unravel like layers to an onion. We will be plagued with new symptoms in new areas despite progress. It simply indicates the readiness to approach a new depth of one's self. As one aspect of our life improves, a hardship will come. 

• We've lived every day before and gotten through it every other time. We have value because Individuals with BPD have faced a struggle that is unimaginable, quite literally. We have a unique perspective on life and unique ability of hyperawareness. It can be redirected towards helping others. 

• Any behavior can become maladapted. It is possible to protect yourself with grandiose or depressive thinking. These can become a mechanism for coping to the point of immobilization. But we must find out why we are immobilized.


Questions to ask yourself;

•  Throughout your life, in what ways has your BPD positively served you? Psychological processes are a result of functional need. They protect us and satiate what we have consciously or otherwise determined is needed to survive. As such, there will be a functionality to BPD symptoms. 

• Become aware of the disconnect between the body and the mind. When was the last time you remember your mind developing? How old do you feel? Why? What else did you feel at that age? Why? 

• Was I always this way? Use artificial markers to identify chunks of time and look at them more closely. (From admission to graduation of school) Take a more fine look at the aspects of your life in different stages, identify positive and negatives. Find trends, follow trends based on their functionality and the purpose they serve. Attempt to adjust your perspective and to argue against your own bias.

24,"The further along I get into my recovery, the more I wonder who I could have been.","As I have worked in therapy, built healthy relationships, and have worked really hard to be the best version of me for my kids, the more I have come to understand the scope and depth of my abuse and neglect and its influence on my behaviors that I've struggled with for quite some time. While harmed in past relationships, I have experinced kindness, empathy, and validation in my new relationships, giving me the context for healing and knowing what to look for and expect in a support system (you don't know what you don't know, right?). However, it has also put into context the historical absence of those things from my parents and my family. And it hurts really bad.

As a result, I have been finding myself wondering more and more who I could have been if I had healthy and supportive relationships from the get-go, if my parents had provided me with those things, had kept me safe. I think about the people I wouldn't have hurt myself, the parent I could have been to my kids, the colleague and employee I could have been. This self dialogue has never helped me feel better (surprise), so I have tried to tell myself that I can't be certain I would like that version of myself any better.

Anybody have any tips to lessen the feelings afterwards to recover quicker and move on?

39,Dealing with family in recovery,"I’ve been stable for about 5 years now, and during that time I’ve experienced a lot of success accomplishing goals, but my family consists of people who see the worst in me. With every goal I’ve accomplished, I’ve experienced nothing but doubt and typically discouraged by my parents.

When I wanted to move out of my grandmother’s at 30, my parents did everything they could to keep me from doing it. “What happens if you lose your job?” “how could you leave your grandmother?” “You have no concept of what it costs to live on your own.” I did it anyway and have successfully lived on my own going on 5 years now. 

When I wanted to buy a car because mine was falling apart, it was the same thing. “You can’t afford a car payment” “having a car payment is stupid” “you have no idea about the cost of insurance”, I got a great deal on a much newer car with very low mileage during the pandemic (I thank my lucky stars) and have had no issues with my car payment or insurance.

Now I want to buy a house. I’m paying off the last of my credit card debt by mid-February to raise my score, and my lease ends mid-April. I’ll have what I’ll need for good faith money and my lender told me I would probably qualify for all of the first time home buyers programs in my state leaving me with only the good faith money out of pocket. But I won’t have it until March. So I asked if they would let me stay with them for a month or two until closing since it usually can take anywhere from 30-90 days. They said no, and told me it wasn’t a good idea for me to buy a house, that I have no idea about the costs associated, I can’t afford it, etc.

The crazy thing is, I make more money than my 3 siblings but my parents don’t treat them like me. I don’t have financial troubles, I pay all of my bills on time, have a budgeting spreadsheet, the only reason I don’t have all of the good faith money yet is because I’ve been using my extra money to pay off debt to make my credit score higher. 

I get ENRAGED when they do this, and end up going off on them. They are literally the only people I still feel rage with sometimes. Dealing with family who still see you as an unstable liability even during recovery is hard.

44,I need recovery hope :(,"I’m coming to terms I have at least a mild form of BPD. I have a C-PTSD comorbidity that makes it difficult to discern but as I’m recovering from the PTSD, I still have the symptoms that both carry.

I feel myself getting sicker: lots of splitting, rocky relationships, mania and mild dissociation. It’s infuriating. I’m becoming a monster before my eyes and I can’t stop it. But I want to.

I believe my psychiatrist will be switching me to mood stabilizers from my SSRI because of my mania and emotional outburst symptoms, but I need some reassurances that I can treat this. I know being “better” is a nebulous idea with illnesses such as this, but I want to feel more calm and less scared of this abandonment. I will work for it! I want to trust people again and have lasting relationships. I don’t want to have outbursts of extreme anger and act out, or feel so violently towards other when they don’t warrant it.

I think I wish the most to not feel so extremely, but I know that might be the hardest.

47,A metaphor for BPD recovery.,"At one point I was part of a crew, a family of behaviors, who roamed the oceans. We were a pirate crew. We had no home of our own except the ship that we sailed on.

We tied ourselves up to other ships when we came across them. We would dress ourselves up so we didn't appear threatening and for a time we would sail, tied to these other boats. The boats tied together were safer. They weathered storms because they were wider. We shared provisions. We relied on each other.

The issue, however, is that me and my crew were pirates. We had been raised in a way that meant that all we knew was the pirate life. We didn't know how to be a ship that was self-sustaining like the ones we tied up to.

Slowly but surely over time the ships we tied on to would realize that we were masquerading. 

Our pirate guise would become visible during a storm or when resources became stretched. If we sensed that the other ship was going to uncover us we would hack and slash and burn the connections that kept the ships together and sail away, leaving the other ship to wallow and recover.

Sometimes we'd see a new ship on the ocean. Bright and shiny and not worn down like the one we had slowly aged. In the night we'd sail over to the new ship, leaving a skeleton ship in place to fool the original one.

One day, standing on the bow of the ship I looked around and the fog that was often on this ocean cleared a little. Maybe it was the light, maybe it was the breeze, maybe I looked a little bit harder than usual.

All around me I saw ships that my crew had harmed. They were the same ships they had been, but with subtle differences.

Some no longer caught the wind in their sails like they used to. On some, their colors were faded. Others had erected protective barriers around them or invested heavily in weapons to keep them safe.

This ocean hadn't been like this before…it had only become this way because of us.

I turned to my crew and implored to them that we needed to change our ways, but they refused. Time went by and I witnessed more casualties and eventually I decided that this was not my crew. I could be somewhere else. I longed for seas where the sun glistened off clear waves.

I confronted my crew and asked for change, but they revolted on me. If I wanted change, I would have to leave the ship. They would give me no provisions, no boat, no support…If I wanted to leave, I could leave and swim for land. Or I could stay. 

There was no land in sight. I had never even seen land.

If I left, I would be swimming away from the ship into an open ocean. I would have to swim past ships who would look at me and laugh at me. Ships that would not pick me up if I were floundering.

For weeks I didn't sleep. My crew was all I had ever known. They were my family. I didn't even know how long I could swim for.

One day the crew broke away from another ship. What was once lovely and fair was left battered and broken, limping back to a port far away. My crew laughed and jeered and started looking for a new ship.

Standing on the deck I watched that ship sail away and resolved to never let that situation happen again.

I knew I couldn't swim very well so I resolved to learn. I read at night while my crew mocked me. I learned everything I could about how to survive in an ocean alone. I confronted the fear and the risks and decided that swimming for shore was better than staying on board the boat with this sick crew. The mist had started to clear in recent weeks and as a result I could see the never-ending horizon. This helped me mentally prepare for the impossible task ahead.

Then one day with my crew mocking and jeering me, some of them pleading with me to not leave, I stood on the end of the plank and stared towards a land mass that I couldn't imagine.

Many of the crew pleaded with me that they would die without me. Some willed me on, knowing that I would fail and swim back to the boat, where I would be even more of a hostage.

Finally, I thought of the broken ships and my resolve to never be part of creating another one and I dived overboard.

As I hit the ocean's surface the fear caught me and took my breath away…I couldn't do it. The ship was a safe harbor, there is nothing for me out here in an ocean that is threatening to swallow me up. 

I tread water, desperately wanting to climb back on board but I soon noticed that treading water was ok. I continued to tread water, listening to the pleas of my crew, until I felt like I could move away from the boat.

Turning my back to the ship and crew I had known all my life I took a deep breath and started swimming strong uncertain stroked towards a horizon that didn't end, and a shore that might not exist.",1617035598.0,False,8,3,Grundini001,None,mftgih,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/mftgih/a_metaphor_for_bpd_recovery/

But i find it personally really problematic when there only content is like ""oh look im doing this crap"" and telling everyone this is a recovery Account. Like i dont know. Its important to talk about struggels but when youre only get views from being miserable then like i don't know i think its kind of reinforce the feeling of being miserable to get People get you attention.

Attetion is a human need. But can you get better when you're online content is just based on im doing shitty.
Especially when there calling youreself aRecovery Account.

58,I’m in need a love and support. I’ve just started the path to recovery after destroying a beautiful three year relationship between my ex boyfriend and I. Is there hope for us? Is there hope for me?,"I am a 21 year old male who was diagnosed with BPD around a year ago whenever I was in an inpatient use for self-harming.

I met my ex boyfriend whenever I was 18. He was my first true boyfriend. He was my best friend, and the best partner anyone could ever ask for. He is truly one in a million, and I fucked it up.

I went into our relationship with a lot of trauma, but I am a very sweet and good person, and I tried to hide my trauma from him. I showered him with love, gifts, and everything you see in rom-coms from the 90’s. That was how good our love was.

A few months in, I became very jealous of him. Both of his parents were together and alive, while my parents divorced whenever I was younger, and then my father died not too long after. My grandfather died after my dad did. I still grieve over both of them.

My ex boyfriend had the life I had always wanted. He had a lot of friends growing up, and he was the popular kid in school. He went to dances and got to experience so much.

I didn’t feel like I deserved him because I saw myself as some damaged bully victim who has to homeschool his senior year because of the severity of it, and I missed out on so much.

I always turned to risky sex and self harming to make me feel better. Sex made me feel powerful and wanted, while self harming was a punishment for myself because I thought what I went through was my fault.

Fast forward, my ex boyfriend stayed with me during all of this, and he helped me so much. He called me everyday whenever I was in the psychiatric unit, and he was always there for me, truly.

He loved me. He still does and I still love him.

However, as time went on in our relationship, I started becoming very distant with him and less intimate for some reason. I was craving attention from other people. I would go on Grindr just to chat, not to physically hook up, and I told him the truth about this and he forgave me.

Months pass and I said I was going to get better, but I didn’t. I swept BPD under the rug. I did stop self harming, but I was still wanting attention from other people, even though my boyfriend was giving me all of his love and attention.

Why the fuck wasn’t it enough? This type of person is all I have dreamed about and wanted. Why the fuck was it not enough?

3-4 days ago, I impulsively downloaded Grindr, and I  had oral sex with a random person. I hated it. I knew the whole time that I was supposed to have changed and not go back to that, but I didn’t stop myself.

The experience was horrible, and I told my boyfriend the truth the very next day. I told him that I wasn’t even aroused during it, and my clothes were on, as well as the other guy.

I felt a rush in the process, and I assume that’s why I did it, but I just can’t believe I actually followed through with physically cheating because of how in love I am with my ex.

My ex and I are leaving on very good terms. We talked about everything maturally for around 3-4 days. I made myself vulnerable to him, and I feel so sorry, and he knows this. I didn’t do it to hurt him.

I made myself a therapist appointment the next day, and she has put on a BPD recovery path.

I also made a vow to stay far awake from a sexual activities so I can heal. I bought a black ring to wear on my finger to remind me of how much pain my actions can cause others, and to think before I do something.

I don’t why it took me doing something like this to someone I love very much for me to open up my eyes.

I have taken full accountability. I also will be meeting with a group through zoom this weekend about BPD.

This explains why I always had mood swings with him and everyone around me, even though I wasn’t wanting to be mean. This explains why I would impulsively walk out of jobs. This explains why I self harmed. 

HOWEVER, I AM NOT BLAMING BPD ON ME CHEATING. Nothing can justify cheating, or any actions really. I’m just saying I can at least connect the dots.

My boyfriend and I had very, very intimate sex before saying goodbye. The fact that he still engaged in meaningful sex with me after what I did says a lot, and it makes me feel like he truly is the one.

I wrote him a poem because I used to love to write poetry for him, but as my BPD started to get out of control, I stopped doing the things I loved.

He liked the poem, and I will always be sorry for what I did to him.

It could be months or even years, but he told me that there is a chance we could be together again, but he would have to meet a new version of me, and luckily he got to meet that developing person yesterday.

We talked about all the good memories and fun we had, and we shared one last intimate moment.

Is there hope for me? Is there hope for us?

We’re over and now is the time where we’re not speaking to one another so we both can heal.

He told me he’s not mad at me, he’s just mad at the situation.

I am fully aware of what I’ve done, and how I’ve acted in the relationship. I refuse to let myself live a life like this.

That version of me died the night I did that, and now I’ve been reborn.

61,Talking through with a recovery buddy- Something that helped me!,"My best friend and I both have BPD. 

Something I’ve found that’s been helping us is talking to each other about our FPs and talking feelings through with each other. 

We both became friends at a time where we were attempting to wade into deeper recovery and understanding of our disorders, and a time when we were both struggling with abusive relationships. As we learned to let go+move on from those abusive relationships, become more self aware, and entered into new relationships, I noticed we began doing something in the process. 

We were talking each other through our experiences with our FPs, helping each other identify when we were being mistreated, helping each other identify “green flags” (when someone has treated us in a healthy way, even if we may have had impulsively negative reactions to it), and helping hold each other accountable for things we wanted to work on which we felt powerless over. 

So I guess I just wanted to share that! Having a community is incredibly beneficial, but having a trusted friend and  “fellow traveller” to help keep each other accountable, process emotions with, and talk to really makes a world of difference as well ❤️",1616965326.0,False,22,2,cleobbycleo,None,mf9vr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/mf9vr3/talking_through_with_a_recovery_buddy_something/

I ended relationships with those who are still suffering out of self-preservation. I was privileged enough to move into a safe, stable environment with others.

**TRIGGER WARNING: Suicide, self-harm, ED, abuse**

**My Story Blurb**

For 10 or so years, this progressed slowly throughout my teens and into my mid-20s, where I spent the last 2 years of my drinking in what I can only describe as a personal hell. I drank to feel “free.” Free from loneliness, free from anxiety, freedom from judgment, pain, responsibility, control, discomfort, free from care. And at times, I would drink and do drugs to feel like I could be free from living and the bondage of structured life and all the distress it causes me. If I’m drinking, all fear was thrown out the window and I could *be.* I could feel alive and breathe again, or I could simply not feel at all. Whatever I felt I needed. 

And that's what I did. I drank, and I did not only *feel* like I was free, but I was *actually* “free” ...from the self-control, I do have. I was free from social cues. And empathy. And logic. And stability. And sanity. And anything and everything else that made life worth living or allowed me to even be somewhat functional. My erratic emotions wouldn’t always be numbed and would instead be magnified. And I would act out my impulsive thoughts and feelings, which meant saying and doing things I thought and felt regardless of consequences. I found a way to remove the guilt and shame of *who I was* and the responsibility of existing, which I felt I was incapable of doing. I didn’t have to try anymore. All of my problems I already struggled with in life were amplified, however.

I was facing homelessness and sold the few possessions I had to get by. I destroyed all of my relationships, including those with friends and family. My already unpredictable spending and eating habits became unmanageable. While I struggled to show up to work before, I couldn’t hold a job whatsoever while drinking and took up sex work. My behavior was often wild and unpredictable, I would overshare and react in inappropriate ways. I'd self-harm and sleep with people I didn't know. I’d do unspeakable things to save a relationship of any sort--to feel connected, loved, or accepted--to avoid being abandoned. One night, I worked myself up and was so resentful of the abuse/neglect I experienced as a child, I drove 8 hours in a blackout to run from the negative feelings I *associated with the city I was in*\--with no plan, money, or destination, overnight in the rain. Drinking all the way. This is a great example of how I couldn't see that drinking was not curing the pain I felt. I was not in reality or on the same wavelength as the people around me. I was very much deep in self-delusion (*side note - while it was happening, my delusional state was not something I was even slightly aware of nor directly something caused by drinking in this instance)*. I didn't even fit in with the neurotypical drunks, I surrounded myself with other people who behaved as I did, and wanted to escape just as badly. ***But*** I didn’t feel restricted by the pain and difficulties of living. When I felt empty and desperate, I didn’t have to attempt suicide or seek out other solutions, I didn't have to crawl in my skin, I could drink and feel alright (...and still attempt suicide while drunk, hm). Alcohol was my solution to all of my problems.

I was carrying out my own worst fears, the same ones I had desperately sought to avoid in the first place. It happened gradually and I was in denial. I was destroying myself because I felt I couldn’t exist sober and I was creating new depths of pain, embarrassment, guilt, and loneliness I had never experienced before, and this only worsened as time went on. I knew my drinking would kill me. My body and mind (clearly) weren't tolerating the alcohol well and I was in a constant cycle of dangerous withdrawal, hallucinations, and all. I was frequently in and out of the ER, detox, and treatment. I would have a mood swing and become unmanageably resentful and angry and leave if/when I was able, I did this both once I sobered up and while I was drunk. This happened more times than I can count. I was once deep in a delusional state while drinking and had to be put in a hospital. I've been committed to mental facilities for extended stays, been 51-50ed (suicide watch), and had welfare checks from authorities. I was put in jail. I slept on couches without a home because of my behavior and substance abuse. I faced homelessness for a second time. I surrounded myself with others who were just as sick I was. I did not have a ""bottom."" There was nothing that was going to ""consequence"" me into sobriety, there was not a low that was low enough. I want to say it was the fear of dying alone that pushed me to take the plunge and commit to sobriety. But if I'm being honest with myself, it was the fear of **not dying** and surviving in that unbearably painful, lonely existence. That brutal, unforgiving cycle destroyed me. I can't articulate how this felt for me, it's indescribable, but I couldn't die and I couldn't stand living.

**Where I'm At Now**

Looking back, I understand why I drank. It was the best coping mechanism I had, and ironically, it's what probably kept me in one piece all those years. I was too drunk to successfully carry out an attempt ""correctly"" and would have likely tried while not drunk and perhaps succeeded. I'm learning to see my story from a place of compassion and acknowledge the pain I was experiencing before and during active addiction.

Most people struggle to get sober. It's fucking hard. Life is hard. Being human is hard for a lot of people, even those without mental illness. And recovery from my addiction doesn't make my life sparkle and my mental illness didn't just up and \~poof\~.

It feels like I've walked out from a storm and straight into a disaster area. Most days, I am indifferent about being alive, and sometimes I outright wish I weren't. I likely have many unhealthy thought patterns and beliefs, some I'm likely not aware of. I can logically grasp many ideas and suggestions, but I do not genuinely connect with them (such as the illogical nature of worthlessness). I struggle immensely with feelings of inadequacy and self-hate. I did not have a coming to god moment so many people talk about when I completed my 5th step in AA (sharing your resentments and character flaws with your sponsor/mentor). That experience brought on paranoia, hopelessness, emotional overwhelm, and an urge to use. I struggle to form connections and experience vulnerability. I actively avoid the opposite sex as best as I can and maintain a considerable distance from any sort of romantic relationship because I fear that I will likely have unmanageable emotions and behaviors, ""ghost"" the other person, or hurt them, it's just not something I'm equipped to handle yet. And I actively avoid a connection with my parents for the same reason. Most of the time I'm in a constant state of irritation and I actively live in denial of my thoughts and emotions and put on a mask to survive while I learn how to ""just be"" in a healthy way. When I wake up, I have no idea what my emotions will be like that day or what sort of identity I will take on.

I *do* know I was diagnosed with a severe mental illness, *a personality disorder, and I am an alcoholic. But t*hese do not define who I am, and I hope somewhere underneath all of this I can find or create who I am one day. As difficult and unbearable as experiencing myself, thoughts, and emotions can feel, it is nowhere near as painful as living in my alcoholism. My disorder is one that, with a great deal of therapy, can go into ""remission."" And objectively, I've made a lot of progress compared to who I was before. Some days, I get to feel that bit of hope that I may just find out what a sense of normalcy and contentment is like. I have days that are better than others. I am safe. I am somewhat functional and independent. I work and I'm going to school. I have friends I've made in AA. I try to help others in recovery as much as I'm able. ***I am not devastating those around me.*** And while it's not super often, I do have moments where I feel happy and content and find joy and gratitude in things.

76,"I’m becoming cold and heartless? Lost the majority of my symptoms, but this isn’t recovery.","I don’t really know what the goal is here. I guess to just see if there is anyone out there like me? 

I was diagnosed 7 years ago. I was just turning 20 and had suffered with debilitating symptoms for years before that - fear of abandonment being my most chronic. 

I went through 10 years of domestic violence and escaped in early 2019. Lost a large piece of my life and suddenly, one day I woke up alone in my house in June 2019 and realised I no longer had fear of abandonment. I was independent. Alone but not lonely. I felt free. Ready. 

Somewhere along the line, though, I have lost the ability to love anyone. 

When I lost my fear of abandonment, most of the other symptoms just faded away. But I seem to be left with this unsettled burning rage in my stomach. A hatred. 

I’ve become cold and uncaring. I cannot enter a relationship because I will end up cheating and lying and deceiving. And I won’t care about it, because I wouldn’t care if they did it to me. How do I know this? Because it’s happened. I was hurt for half a day and then I picked myself up. Let it go. It is what it fucking is and people are shit. 

I believe that I am not responsible for others peoples feelings, so I should be free to act or do what I feel is right. And in the same breath, other people are absolutely not responsible for my feelings, so should be free to act or do what they feel is right. But I blur my own lines here - and I do what is not right, in the name of self righteousness. 

I’m burning with rage and anxiety every day. 

I don’t text or call my friends, ever. I’d be content to stay alone all the time and never speak to anyone again. Nobody feels like a loss. 

I hate listening to peoples problems because they never listen to mine, and when they do, they always have the generic same old answers, or you can tell they’re just bored of listening. 

I despise physical touch. It makes my skin crawl. It makes me feel sick. 

I know people don’t like me. It isn’t “just a feeling”, it’s a well known fact. My life became the town gossip a decade ago - and people still won’t let it go and I can’t escape. I cannot change their minds. I can’t change the narrative and I cannot leave. I’m desperate for them to like me. 

So, I switched off. I stopped giving a shit. I lost my innocence completely. And I want it back. 

I used to be a girl who hugged everyone - my friends would fall asleep on my shoulders. I was the girl who loved so damn hard that I knew every detail about a person, but now, I wouldn’t even remember a “loved one”s eye colour. I used to be interested in my friends and want to know what they were up to and now I just don’t. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to start. All I know is, I don’t want to be this heartless bitch anymore. It’s weighing heavy on me.

What were obstacles you faced that were keeping you from having/maintaining healthy relationships?

Also, did you have a tendency to gravitate towards unhealthy/abusive people ? Become upset about their behavior, and start obsessing about them, struggling to let go even though the relationships was negative in the first place? Have you realized your own part within those unhealthy/toxic relationships and the role you played in those interactions, what you gave and eventually received in return?

79,I've been in remission for 2 years and have a BPD Youtube Channel,"It's been a couple months since I posted about my channel here, so I figured I would since my content has grown and there are new people here every day.

My journey hasn't been an easy one, and I try to stay involved in the community as I feel so much for everyone who is affected by BPD. But I can only respond to so many posts here and my reach is limited, so once my recovery was stable, I decided to start a channel as the best way I can help a wide variety of people with my experience and knowledge. I love the accessibility of youtube - it can be accessed anytime, anywhere, when someone needs or wants it.

I cover BPD as well as other mental health/wellness and self improvement topics - all things that have helped me on my recovery journey that I hope will help you. I use a combination of my experiences, the experiences of others, and research from various reputable sources to write my videos.

I already have BPD-specific videos on a breakdown of the diagnostic criteria, advice for people with BPD (or BPD symptoms), BPD remission/recovery, and an intro to DBT. I post videos weekly and have many topics i want to cover.

Please check it out and subscribe if you're interested. I hope you find it helpful, I made it for you!

82,heres my story,"i broke up with my really shitty ex boyfriend fall of 2019. i was 17 and had just started my senior year of high school. after that i just kinda went crazy. i started drinking excessively every night. and every night i would get super drunk and hook up with my ex in the back of my car. we stayed in communication until january 2020 when i finally felt strong enough to cut things off when he started calling me crazy, getting on his knees and begging me to tell him everything he did wrong (he sexually assaulted me multiple times), and told me that he only loves me because no one else will. i had to physically push him out of my house and i was close to calling the police because he wouldnt leave

he started therapy after we broke up. and his therapist at the time told him that she thinks i have bpd (this was before the diagnosis). i remember when he told me that one of the guys i hooked up with had a girlfriend i ran downstairs and self harmed. and he had to come downstairs and see what i did

after i cut off communication i realized i had hugeee crush on one of the boys in my class. we texted a lot and i took his virginity. the fucked up part is that he had a girlfriend, and i knew about her. i just liked him so much, looking back his was definitely my fp. i was completely obsessed with him, and would get drunk every night and just overshare everything to him

once that semester was over we stopped talking as much, until that spring when i graduated high school. 

summer 2020 i dated another really shitty guy. we dated through out all of summer 2020. he was emotionally abusive and even choked me out one time because he saw my self harm cuts

i broke up with him after i found him texting another girl, but again we stayed in somewhat of communication. 

one night when i was at my lowest and drinking, he left me on open. that hurt so much that i swallowed a bottle of pills and chased it with liquor

i was hospitalized for the first time after that and was diagnosed bipolar

i met my current boyfriend in october 2020, about a month after i was diagnosed 

we have had our ups and downs but overall ive never been happier 

last spring i really wasnt doing well and went into the hospital again (for the third time) and thats where i was diagnosed with bpd

throughout 2019-2020 there was a few other guys that had sexually assaulted me, and that only contributed to the alcohol abuse at the time

i got sober fall of 2021 after blacking out at my boyfriends party (i used to black out every time i drank basically)

when i turned 21 last february i started drinking again socially. ive had a few blackouts since then but its not the same as 2020

overall this is the best ive ever been doing. my boyfriend is so supportive of my mental health. im currently in dbt and am working on getting better

anyway, sorry this post is super long, if you made it to the end, thank you, i hope youre doing well🫶",1714478998.0,False,1,1,No_Pair178,None,1cgr9bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cgr9bf/heres_my_story/
83,It's not impossible. You can recover. And you can live.,"Trying to keep it together as I write this, first time posting like this. If you're suffering tonight with BPD, throwing intrusive thoughts at you, shouting loudly in your own head, disrupting your moods before bed and attacking you when you wake up, know this;  there are other people with BPD all over the world, who are experiencing the same things as you in uniquely horrible ways. What is true is that many are fighting every single day to stay alive, to begin recovering, and maybe, with a tiny portion of hope, to build a life they really enjoy. And you can too.

Checking the facts, there are people who have reached remission. There are people who have gone further to enjoy life on their own and find peace in solitude. There are people who go on to build healthy relationships with themselves first and then with others (familial, friendships, work-based, vocational, romantic, etc.) to work towards and achieve all their life goals, to have fun, to express their true selves and comfortable in their own skin, to become more resilient, and to burn bridges to the ones that kept them in unhelpful cycles. In other words, all feelings aside (even when those thoughts scream so loud), recovery is possible, it takes many forms, and it is a fact that others have shown this.

I am on the path to recovery. It is early, it is back-breakingly hard. There are large ups and big downs for me and many other people. The walk of your steel through the fire is painful and incredibly invisible, but will help build a sword of your own making. You can make progress. You might be very lonely, and sometimes alone, but only a message away from someone who gets it.

When I personally look back, I was not initially told this myself. The label was slapped on me the first time I was in the psych ward at eighteen (which, in Canada is the youngest you can legally be diagnosed.)* I found out later on, through my own research, that recovery is possible. But until then I kept wondering what was setting me apart from others with BPD and I was questioning my diagnosis. It’s because I was getting better!

A separate psychiatrist formally told me this information later on, when I was 20. Two years! Imagine if I didn’t do the research I did! I believe that it’s SO dangerous to slap a lifelong diagnosis (that’s often deemed one of the hardest mental health disorders to live with) on someone and send them on their merry way. The idea that people with BPD are “unwilling to receive help” is 100000% the fault of professionals. There are not enough people with BPD actually studying the illness. 

My dream is to change that. My dream is to receive a doctorate in psychology and dedicate my life to BPD advocacy and research. I truly believe that by the time I’m old and can’t lift a pen anymore - let alone conduct research - I will have completely changed the way professionals in the field observe BPD. The people studying us, diagnosing us, they have no idea what it’s like to live with this on a day-to-day basis. They feel as if they can slap a diagnosis on us and walk away, giving us virtually no information on their end. I’m in college now for child and youth care. Can’t really learn about a diagnosis that has ties to childhood trauma without working with kiddos.

109,Overwhelming feelings of envy,"I am 13 months into my BPD recovery journey. I am learning to identify my feelings. I was surprised to find out recently that one of the biggest and ugliest feelings that I contend with is envy. I hadn't put a name to it until last week. I feel envious of literally everyone. I watch a tv program and I am envious of all the characters who look good, have talents, have jobs, etc. I don't see a lot of people face to face yet, but when I do, I feel envious of them, too. At this point in my recovery, I am still not very functional. I work very part time as an independent contractor. I am under the poverty line, I struggle with money and feeling secure financially, and I am alone because, at this point in my recovery, I still have a hard time letting people in and getting along with people. So, at this point, everyone seems to be better than I am at everything. I know this isn't a rational way to feel, because I don't know every single person's struggles and I also know I need to give myself credit for the major improvements I have made in my life since my diagnosis. I am proud of that. But at the same time, I feel overwhelmed with envy at every turn and it is making it hard to have inner peace. I would like to be a grateful and compassionate person, and I feel that the opposite of that is envy. Does anyone else struggle with this? How can I learn to stop feeling envious of everyone else and be okay with me, just as I am, even when I have so far yet to go before I can really call my life ""good.""",1681829529.0,False,9,2,Just_Operation_4284,None,12qpna6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/12qpna6/overwhelming_feelings_of_envy/

Mood swings) and I feel like my self expression when it comes to art is devoid of personality??

I’m reading my DBT workbooks from when I was in it a year ago. Someone posted today about what counts for recovery…. I am so far into my recovery and yet I am EXHAUSTED. My all time FP suffered a severe brain injury earlier in the year and I feel like I’ve been a different person since as well…. 

I’m so fucking alone and I have friends but they all ditch me/ignore me for various reasons, usually romantic partners, and I can’t fucking take it anymore. I want to just split on all of them go out and find party friends like I used to. Drink and dance the night away, not giving a fuck about real relationships. Not giving a fuck if I bothered or upset anyone. Not giving a fuck if they bothered or upset me, just letting my emotions out on them (abusively) and then numbing my pain. Not checking my bank account. Not caring where I slept. Not even caring if I lived or died.

I think maybe it’s time I start backtracking. Cuz it’s very fucking obvious that no matter how much work I’ve done to try to be stable normal and a good human, no one wants me anyways. No one gives a fuck about anything but themselves and they’ll never understand the strength it takes just to get to where I’ve gotten which is still an unworthy fucking place.

Last year I hit the lowest I have ever been, and with many failed attempts of seeking help over the years, I am finally beginning to make progress.

Today I hit 10 weeks sober and my mindfulness is slowly but surely starting to take effect. I am beginning to forgive myself for my previous mentality and behaviour towards myself and others, and I am taking steps to make sure that I will never act that way again.

I felt that way for a while, but really want to help people with my experience and knowledge, so I'm back on reddit, in my discords, studying from expert information, and creating YouTube content of my own.

ive been celibate now, sober (which has helped the most), have been with close friends and family, told every friend i have about how i cheated and about my struggles, and have remained friends with my ex. as it turns out i was going through a manic episode when the cheating took place and now it all makes sense.

i am a lot happier now. i am not proud of my actions but the lessons it has taught me and change it has led to in my life has been night and day. i am now learning to put my extra energy into exercise or something creative or even just watching tv- something that isn't damaging to me and it helps a lot. my self respect has also went up a ton. i keep on reminding myself that it is better to learn these things at 20 rather than 30 or later when my actions impact kids and a husband and lead to major financial upsets. listening the podcast back from the borderline is the most helpful thing i can recommend ",1710937375.0,False,4,7,Capable-Bed-7003,None,1bjc5ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1bjc5ad/so_happy_tw/

146,No longer meet the criteria,"Today I finally understand what my therapist said when she said I no longer meet the criteria for someone with BPD. She told me this in December but I was hesitant to believe it as it had only been just over a year since my initial diagnosis with severe BPD. 

Today, I stood my ground to someone who had been gaslighting me at work. I did so without crying, spiralling or wanting to hurt myself as she doubled down and invalidated me. But once it was over I was able to forget about it and I can confidently say it does not bother me. Sure I am angry but it is at an appropriate level of intensity and I am not overwhelmed by it. 
One year ago I would not be able to do that. I would have spiralled, disassociated and taken days off work to recover in bed. 

So here I am telling you, you got this. Therapy works when you find the right one for you. 
Today may be hard but you are doing your best to make this work. Relapses are part of recovery and that is okay. 
Be kind to yourself and know you got this.

148,I regret not getting help sooner.," I’m so conflicted that I didn’t get help for this sooner. I think I got diagnosed at 25. I was diagnosed with major depression earlier- maybe 14 or 15- but a part of me thinks that wasn’t even real. I was just an angsty teen who probably liked to come off as sullen. I don’t think the depression was real.  
   I know I felt bad at times but I also isolated myself as a teen and was very quiet and socially awkward so how happy are you going to be when you push away friends and isolate? 

    Anyway I always told myself I had major depression and the borderline so I took anti depressants and didn’t start therapy until 2 years ago (cbt). I have so much remorse that I didn’t address the borderline 13 years ago when the diagnosis came. I was ashamed of the diagnosis as well. 

    I am trying to reconcile with the fact that I caused people around me to suffer because I didn’t do the things I needed to recover way sooner. I feel so much hurt for my parents because they were my main supporters and always talked to me when I had my frequent emotional upsets. It must have been awful dealing with that constantly. 

  I know that I’m recovering now and trying now. But my parents are mid 70s. They are getting older.

I got in contact with a guy a couple of months ago, we met up on the Monday just gone. We had a date at a few bars and then went back to his, one thing lead to another and we ended up having sex.

SH has become a problem as well. I've read alot about quiet BPD recently and I even took the self-eval and it scored me high. I've never been incredibly manipulative of others and have had ranging degrees of depression and emotional swings, but what struck me is that I've always been obsessed with identity, to the point of it being all i think about. This could be because I'm trying so hard to figure it out? I really don't know. I should clarify I'm not looking for a diagnosis here. But if this is the issue I'm curious what other's journey has looked like and looking towards recovery. I have a therapist and will be seeing a psychiatrist to get the correct diagnosis I should add as well.

160,Being told to practice mindfulness makes me absolutely furious,"I'm aware that mindfulness is helpful for pwBPD. I know DBT has the best recovery rate of all therapies. I know that, rationally, it is in my best interest to try these things out. But I can't make myself do it. Because even the mention of mindfulness and how I need to *train my thoughts*  and *redirect my attention* fills me with so much rage I don't know what to do.

Because practicing mindfulness and altering the way my thoughts are, it feels like I'm violating myself. Being told to practice mindfulness makes me feel like I'm being told to gaslight myself and sweep all the bad, yucky pieces of reality under the rug; if you don't pay attention to it, it apparently doesn't exist. I don't care that it'll potentially make me feel better: I can't lie to myself about the state of the world or my life just so that I can feel better. I truly don't know how I could motivate myself to do that. 

All my life I feel as if I've been used for other people's pleasure and benefit. I've got Quiet BPD, so I have my life pretty in order. And for this reason, my mind just flares when someone suggests mindfulness, because it means none of them have to change or take responsbility for how they've hurt me. That once again, *I'm* the problem, the scapegoat and the one who needs to fix herself to fit into an environment that hates everything that she is. And if that's the game I'm supposed to play, I don't want to >!and I'll off myself!<

A part of me wonders if this reaction to mindfulness is just an immature reaction because I'm so content in my suffering. But I don't think that it is. 

tl;dr: The concept of mindfulness makes me angry, because I feel as if it asks me to deny a majority of depressing reality just to feel good. 

Can anyone else relate to this feeling? Should I accept that mindfulness/DBT isn't for me, or should I try to overcome this resistance I have to it?

It's not news that people with BPD seem to gravitate towards perpetually dysfunctional behaviours at times. I've finally come to the point in recovery where I can identify the behaviours I keep defaulting to and accept that I won't ever stand a chance at improving my life unless I can let go and embrace a new, more stable, and constructive identity & behaviours. I keep trying to recreate the times I feel particularly nostalgic for which is frequently leading to me relapsing on drugs, thank God it's not consistent like it used to be, but it's self destructive nonetheless

The first doctor I visited diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), but the addiction treatment center told me otherwise, steering clear of any diagnosis beyond substance abuse. After overcoming addiction, I started experiencing anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and severe difficulty concentrating, along with chronic fatigue. I am a highly sensitive person, and reading about others' experiences in this forum makes me feel like I may have BPD. Recently, my brother, who is studying psychiatry, suggested that I might be closer to having Borderline Personality Disorder.

171,A Word of Hope For Those Still Struggling With Their BDP,"I woke up this morning to a post asking the relatively older members of the community (late 30s to early 40s) if they still struggle with the emotional roller coaster that is BPD. The OP asked if anyone else in that age group was still struggling with wild shifts in mood despite being told that their symptoms are supposed to stabilize in middle age. I’m glad to say that the OP found kindred spirits and I hope that was enough to comfort them with the notion that they are not failing at recovery.

As the day went on, I stumbled upon some interesting information that I think would be more helpful. I am currently listening to the audiobook “How to Be Sad” by Helen Russell (which I think many of us should, it’s a wonderful book, but I digress). She talks about the importance of letting ourselves feel our emotions lest they get pent up and rare their ugly heads later on in life. 
In her research and consulting of numerous professionals for the book, she found that statistics show that humans and monkeys are more likely to display symptoms of depression and emotional distress in their middle age, hence the term “mid life crisis.” Most of the experts she consulted mentioned that as you approach old age, the symptoms begin to lift as the stresses of middle age begin to subside. 

I found it rather helpful so I thought of sharing it with the OP. Thing is, I can’t for the life of me find the post. Im in three BPD related communities so I’ve decided to share this as a post in all of them in hopes it’ll make its way to the right person. 

While I can’t relate to the situation because I’m a little young (25, F), having the notion that there’s a reason this is happening and I’m not failing at my recovery is helpful. I hope that OP and the several kindred spirits in their comment section can also feel the same way with this info. 
Peace and love to all of you. 

TL;DR: If you’re older and struggling with your symptoms even though you were told this would slow down as you get older, you aren’t broken. There’s a scientific evidence that middle aged people are more prone to depression and emotional distress due to the stresses that come with it. Keep doing your best, the science also shows that it slows down once you get closer to old age.",1695334164.0,False,1,0,TheUndrachiever,None,16ot09u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/16ot09u/a_word_of_hope_for_those_still_struggling_with/

174,Not having a person to fixate on (FP) feels so liberating,"Not sure if this actually helps anyone but I just thought I’d share some progress to maybe give some of you a little hope. 

A few weeks ago I broke off contact with my then best friend/fp after a situation massively triggered me and I absolutely blew my top — which I hardly ever do, I’m really the quiet/discouraged subtype. It was a really unhealthy, co-dependent relationship which I don’t think was good for either of us. 

Ending it was an incredibly hard decision to make and I don’t think I could have taken that step even just a few months earlier. 

BUT as difficult and painful as it was, I haven’t felt this free and like myself in years. Usually my romantic partners were my FPs and I would subconsciously mold my personality and interests to suit theirs which really exacerbated my identity disturbance. After a breakup or going no contact, I would never last a long time without finding a new person to cling onto and to “tell me” (metaphorically speaking) who I was or was supposed to be and becoming entirely emotionally dependent on them. Without that crutch I would feel completely lost and alienated. 

Now, I’m far enough in my recovery to not feel that sense of being unmoored and not knowing who I am, even after breaking contact with my former FP. I actually feel like myself or at least like I’m getting the chance to discover who I want to be without someone to use as a stencil. 

I didn’t think I’d ever get to feel like this, I genuinely could not have imagined it a few months ago. If you feel similarly, I hope this gives you hope. The work we’re putting into our recovery isn’t in vain, it’s a slow process but if you keep at it, you will see improvement over time.

I recently learned the checking of my own emotions in a depression recovery program, and so I become concerned when my partner lacks this awareness.

She expects me to also have emotions when we discuss her emotions which further complicates the situation. Especially since I am bipolar 2 and have lifelong depression and my emotions are suppressed.  

Note that I do not have BPD. My partner has been recently diagnosed and I am really trying very hard to understand how to help. I will never know the extent of her suffering and so it is really hard for me

181,AE really hurt by the things said in support groups for partners or relatives of people who have borderline?,"It seems like the only answer to any problem is always just ""Leave them"", ""get away from them"" no matter the problem and how small it might be. Like recovery or bettering would just not be possible. Like a problem in a relationship or a fight is always the BPDs fault and never just a normal fight or a normal problem that occurs even in relationships where both parts are not mentally ill and so the only way to solve it is to leave cause ""They won't change, they never change"". Everything is a manipulation, everything is meant to be harmful, every action is performed because of pure evil that will never stop and of course you're not worth anything to them anyway. So just leave. 

It hurts so much to read it. Like I'm, like we're some kind of monsters. I know very well that BPD can be very bad especially untreated and in many cases a relationship might not work out or someone isn't ready for it and of course then breaking up is the best option. But that's just not the case for everyone! Like none of us would've ever made a change of put effort in recovery for our partners and relatives as well. Like many of us wouldn't hold back like crazy so we wouldn't hurt the ones we love. Why are we treated and talked about like it's not able to be together with us? Like all of us would be the cliche manipulating, lying evil bitch that some people think we are? Like we couldn't ever be better? Like we would always just be our disease and there's no person behind it? 

They aren't even trying to explain anything or to give advice, nope. Only thing ever is to leave them cause they're shit anyway. Had an argument? Leave their ass. They had a bad day? Leave their ass. You don't share the same opinion? Leave their fucking ass. It's almost every message.

And it fucking hurts me. Cause I'm trying so hard. Cause I know so many people who are trying so hard. It's not fair to them to judge them like this. Not every person with borderline is evil and can't be trusted. Not every person with borderline is manipulating you.

I am at the point in my recovery where unless you read my diary or were my therapist, you wouldn’t even know. I’m at a point where I make and keep friends, I’m not argumentative just for the fun of it, I don’t make an effort to destroy my own life, I’m in treatment and taking my medications. The biggest one is, I try my best not to be overly defensive and try to walk a middle path in my interactions. And because of that, people online and in my personal life seem to be shocked that I could have such an “evil” disorder. I’ve had people go, “Oh, you’re not like other borderlines.” Is that supposed to make me feel better? I have not always been this functional. I have been that bad borderline you’ve heard of before. I am here because of hard work, which is a possibility for everyone if they truly desire to. 

Then, they realize I’m safe, and start trauma dumping all the abusive horror stories of their experiences with people with BPD. They tell me about their abusive ex with BPD, the BPD friend who stole their money for drugs, their mom who beat them. And after this they look at me expectantly, waiting for an apology. They wait for me to apologize for the borderline who hurt them, because apparently I will be the apology they never got. I will be their closure, as the “normal” borderline. 

I’m sick of it. I am sorry it happened to you, and I also am tired of apologizing for people I don’t even know for things I didn’t even do. I am not the scapegoat for your unresolved trauma.

196,Lost control with my parents the other day,"So, I am extremely worried about my brother’s mental condition’s

They are 14 and 9.

My parents are loving, and they do care for all of us, but I think they have problems, they both have really traumatic pasts, different backgrounds, and they never got help for them, and sometimes they loose their cool, this of course has affected me throughout my whole life, hence why I probably have this disorder

Now a diagnosed adult, I have tried my best to make my parents more aware of mental health problems, and patient with them, but I lost it the other day, and I forgot all about my therapy in the moment

My parents fought, really badly, in a get together with their best friends, my friends were there too, luckily no one saw but they def suspected, I was so mad at them, they made both of my brother’s cry, and during that time, when they were crying, I guess my mom wanted to calm them down and said that this fighting is normal between couple’s, I was drunk and furious

I screamed at her, “Its not normal, that’s why I am fucked up, and my brother’s will probably end up where I am if you don’t change (go to therapy)”, they say their fighting is normal, but I swear my mom is so rude to my dad, my dad gets really angry at her, she screams back, blames him for our suffering and paints him as the bad guy

They love each other, but the fighting has increased a lot, they make up all the time, but the small fights are constant, I still hate it even though I have grown up, I have told my mom that she should try therapy, but she just turns my suggestions down, idk what to do, i am scared for my brother’s, I dont want them to end up like me

197,Exhausted ,"Hi all 💞

I (27 F) have been doing DBT for the past two years and am done with that, and now looking for a therapist who does schema therapy to keep going in my recovery.

The thing with DBT I've realized is that it helps you manage your symptoms, which makes life in general better, but at least for me it doesn't make my borderline go away at all. It just makes it so that I have strategies when my reactivity acts up (which I would say is about 10-12 times per day, at least).

Anyway. To the question at hand. I'm always using my DBT skills and thinking about mindfulness. I'm active with my dog, I have a full time job, I'm working on having a social circle and a validating environment. I feel like I don't do too much at work and I don't spend a lot of time working on the other things really. My hobby is my dog and its not much work. Given all this I feel like I should have a normally functioning body, at least, and be able to do something after work.

Despite this, I'm constantly exhausted and worn out. Does anyone feel the same? I'm starting to think just living with the reactivity is the biggest contributor. If I don't spend the entire evening lying down, I get more and more exhausted and eventually physically sick so I can't work. I even get chest pains. I also do less at work because I'm sick and tired. This has been a pattern for the last year at least. I often have to keep this in mind when planning trips etc because I have to have several hours of down time every day in order to manage.

Does anyone else experience the same thing?

208,At the doctor right now receiving ketamine treatment for Borderline. Came in here a hot mess in tears and am right now completely ok with the fact I’m not ok. I want others to be aware of effective this treatment can be for some people. Feeling hope!,"I’m going to keep this brief: while I don’t believe in “miracle drugs” to cure Borderline, ketamine really gives me hope that we may not be far off. Real healing and recovery from Borderline will always require some sort of talk therapy or DBT/CBT and ongoing management, but WOW.

I’m someone who has spent *years* in therapy and receiving psychiatric treatments for BPD (GAD/PTSD/ADD) and actively “working” my recovery and focusing on DBT (a form of CBT) and EMDR (wow so many acronyms). 

I think Ketamine (for me) actually ignites some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. Something resembling hope. 

It, at first in a treatment session, provides (at least for me) profound immediate relief from the constant, heavy feelings of guilt, shame, fear, and genuine terror of everyday existence.

But then the lasting effects I think are that it gives you sort of that distance from your problems in your life, and their perceived weight. It’s like, by giving you a break from carrying everything, it gives you a chance to breathe and reevaluate your issues from a healthier point of view that is less biased— almost like viewing yourself in the third person as a kind friend trying to help. It kind of allows you to be your own lifeguard in a way (Borderline for me often feels like I’m drowning beneath the emotional waves with the trauma response grabbing at my heels to pull me under.)

It’s not like all your problems disappear. It’s more it makes me feel “ok with not being ok” while at the same time reminding my brain how to have an internal monologue where you aren’t attacking yourself constantly with toxic thoughts. Something I probably haven’t experienced since early childhood or maybe ever. 

I see how it is helpful for people with PTSD/ trauma too, thorough similar relief mechanisms. It’s almost like it makes the the coping skills you learn in DBT/CBT more accessible, if that makes sense. Right now I’m getting the visual of a carpenter being able to find a tool in his tool belt. If that makes sense?

So much for keeping this brief, haha! If this helps even one person get closer to feeling ok, it was worth spending my $200 session typing this.

My therapist explained to me what BPD actually is and what that diagnosis means. She also told me that it can't be healed, only treated and that it will be a long and Rocky way to recovery. 

I also did some digging on my own and found out that BPD is seen as the mental illness that causes the most suffering and shortens your life expectancy by 20 years. 
Some get better when the went through menopause. 

So now I just feel like my life is worthless. Like I'm just bound to suffer all my life until I get 45 and then? Enjoy the 10 to 20 years that I have left? With what?
