0,i finally got prescribed antidepressantssss,"ive been on antidepressants before, they honestly do fuck all for my bpd but some have helped for depression and anxiety. paroxetine 

i stopped taking paroxetine after a year of taking them cause of sexual side effects in 2023. 
but now i lowkey identify as asexual cause i’ve been hyposexual since december. i literally have no sexual desire, im so sex repulsed i can pretty much imagine my life without sex in the long run. i might feel different in a couple of months who knows

paroxetine is known for causing issues with people’s libido. but it also really helped me with my anxiety so i hope it’ll do the same this time cause lowkey i think im developing agoraphobia cause i can’t go outside due to my emetophobia.

anyway hopefully in the future they’ll give me mood stabilisers for my shitty mood swings and episodes as well, cause antidepressants really do nothing for bpd symptoms in my opinion ",1715717488.0,False,2,2,mentallyillgAng,None,1cs1uza,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cs1uza/i_finally_got_prescribed_antidepressantssss/

24,"Trileptal/Oxcarbazepine, anyone?","Hey y'all! I've just recently been diagnosed with BPD. First it was schizoaffective disorder, but then I went to a realllly experienced doctor with a phd and he diagnosed me almost immediately, we ran some tests and holy shit I've never understood myself better!

Anyways, I was prescribed Lamotrigine (which is basically Lamictal) and everything was amazing, my emotions were under control for the first time in ever i could feel like a normal person, but then I developed a rash on my hands and my gland was swollen :( I felt really disappointed and guilty (idek why) and, of course, had to stop taking ut immediately. Then my psych prescribed me Depakine and honestly, it didnt really do much for me, I scooped super low, self harm, hysterical crying and rage, almost broke up with my bf again, suicidal thought abd etc. 

So I went to the psych again. I offered him to try a Lamotrigine rechallenge, which is when you try to get back on it again super slow, but he suggested not to risk it and changed it to Trileptal now (Oxcarbazepine). I'll be upping my dosage super slow. Not seeing any side effects yet, apart from the fact that im sleepy (but maybe that's also influenced by my period). But honestly, I felt very discouraged because everyone keeps saying that itwas so incredibly amazing and its the first drug that's always prescribed... I don't see that many positive reviews for Trileptal from thise with BPD. Has anyone here had a good dinamic on it? Does it cause loss of libido?

And also, can my period cycle worsen my rage, sadness and autoagression? If yes, how do you deal with this?

She told me I could split it in two, one in the morning, the other in the evening. But then she told me to stop it and prescribed me Temesta 1mg for anxiety an Stilnox for sleeping.

39,"relapsed, need advice","TW: relapse, self injury, infection

i really don’t want to have to talk about this with my doctor if it isn’t a big deal but i’m not sure what to do!

about two days ago i went to the doctor because i have like, wounds on my underarm/armpit area due to a miserable reaction to some new deodorants i tried. 
even though i stopped using them, they wound area got more painful with time so i went to my local walk in clinic. turns out i have a staph infection.

the kicker is that a day before i went to the clinic i had a pretty bad relapse on cutting. It’s something i’ve struggled with for almost 10 years now, i don’t plan on trying to kill myself or anything like that at the moment, just was struggling and had a lapse in judgement. 

so before i leave the clinic the doctor talks to me because she noticed the cuts on my arm (i had to take my shirt off to get examined), i explain my addiction and that i’m being actively treated still (therapy once a week & meds) and she trusts me enough to let me go home.

she didn’t tell me the nature of staph at all, and that it was very contagious, after taking some time to read about it, i learned that if it gets in your bloodstream and stuff it can make you very sick.
my problem here is i didn’t tell my doctor about the rest of the cuts on my body. 
they’re also covering just about the entirety of my arms, thighs, and calves. all over.

should i call my doctor and discuss this? i’m concerned that the infection will get worse if i take a shower or something and spreads to my legs, as my arms have pretty much healed up but my legs have not followed suit.

I thought I stressed to her that I was curious about starting mood stabilizers and she didn’t seem too open about it but i’m not sure if i’m reading too much into it. 

I’ve only been going to therapy for an about 2 months, and only now have been going weekly. I am trying to find a therapist who’s certified in DBT as she isn’t. I still feel hopeless after all of this time but I feel like it’s hard for me to express how bad it really can be for me, and i feel like there isn’t much sense of urgency. 

Do you think I should stress more on the bpd meds or just let the new medication start and see what it does? I was previously on 100mg of sertraline, and then i think 30 of Lexapro. I never felt much from either and they prescribed be with the beginning dose of Effexor. I am trying to be hopefully. I was never super good at taking the previous ones but have read a lot about the SNRI i was prescribed today, i start tomorrow. I am understanding that it is very strict to not miss a dose.

44,Can't cope with BPD partner any more,"My wife has BPD. 10 years married now, and I don't think I can do it any more. 

Enraged, she tells me it's not her fault for punching me or assaulting me with blunt instruments, it's my fault for 'not dealing with her emotions' or 'not communicating effectively' , or whatever. This kind of thing screamed in your face a couple of times a month. 

For a few years, my life was a hell I shudder even recalling. She was prescribed pills by a psych,  which took her from being extremely violent and abusive to more just petulant and unreasonable. Still, nothing is ever her fault, no matter what the circumstances. It's always me, or someone else, who is evil. 

She needs Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, I guess, but I can't see her doing it. Not for a more than a couple of sessions anyway. That's usually how it goes, therapy a couple of times, then quit. 

I don't really know what to do. I'm so tired of being a 'hostage', so tired of walking on egg shells, so tired of being told that everything is my fault. 

I think we're going to have to split. She went away to her family last year for a few weeks, and I know it's terrible to say, but it was such a relief for me. I don't think anything will make her understand that my needs are just as important as her's.

46,BPD and cannabis? ,"Does anyone have experience with the use of cannabis after your diagnosis? 

I've been diagnosed since I was 23 (I'm now 31)and have been on prescription meds since I was 16 (pre-diagnoses). Have been in therapy since I was 15.

I was always very hesitant with cannabis and drugs in general, since I have a tendency to get addicted very easily. 

But since a half year I have been using cannabis and it had giving me more insights in my brain and thoughts than all the therapy and meds together. 
It has helped me tremendously and has made me a more calm person. 

I know I'm addicted to nicotine, that has never been a secret. But I don't feel the same about cannabis. 

Has anyone had similar experiences (or a negative experience)? I'm curious.

Edit. Maybe a totally new discussion idk

But 
why is it that the big farma can make ton of chemical meds with so much side effects and can earn so much money with it (+so many of these meds are also addictive), and somehow something natural (also with side effects, but in my opinion have less that prescription drugs) is illegal in so many countries?

I take a prescription drug that helps me sleep and it makes me foggy AF. I've taken it for half my life so far. If you are a little bit sane you know not to take it during the day or before you drive a car/bike/whatever. Same goes for weed.

My doctor prescribed me tradonal (a very addictive opium) for my menstruation cramps. I mean. How it that better?

This is probably going to sound stupid but im worried if i have a diagnosis of BPD it might effect being prescribed future medications like amphetamine.

Reason for that is i would have to be completely honest with my psychiatrists, and i have been lying to them about a few things saying i dont have suicidal thoughts and have never attempted to commit suicide. and that i dont use drugs at all. And have never had an issue with any substances etc. 

The only reason i havnt been completely honest with my psychiatrist  is purely out of fear it might stop me getting prescribed amphetamine in the future,which im desperately hoping for.

God forbid they have a life outside of me🤦🏽‍♀️ I’ll usually go into a depressive episode centered around them leaving me. 

Then, out of nowhere, I’ll just break up with them. Usually when we are about to take the relationship to the next level. The first time, I had signed a lease with my ex and then broke up with him two days before we were supposed to move in. Another time, my ex had just asked my mom for permission to propose to me. Then I start to devalue them and basically split. I become very cruel and all the love I had turns to hate for them.

I’ll usually quit school or a job or move away entirely. Then , I’ll find a new partner and believe that we are meant to be together.

Monday this week, write off didn’t sleep. Same today Tuesday. I’m trying to get off of sleeping pills (zopiclone) that my dr prescribed me 3 years ago. I was taking care of my Mum while she was dying and died from lung cancer. I have been so traumatized by that situation, it has to be its own post. 

If you have ready some of my other posts was prescribed oxy after gallbladder surgery. I got addicted. Now I’m addicted to these sleeping pills and they mess up my sleep so bad. Also, was not told how addictive it was by the Dr, and received no information. 

I did go to see my Dr about this. I was angry, but tried to keep emotions out and just talk about facts. I asked her why she hadn’t called me, (I was her first patient, we became very close)to get me to come in and talk to me about the oxy. I got myself off of it, but have been on suboxone for two years. 

I can’t keep a job. I do volunteer, they are very understanding if I can’t come in. My kids were taken from me and given to my ex. Loooong story there, I’m blowing thru my inheritance on two years of legal fights for something that should have been one session of mediation. The stress of this adds to the insomnia. I can’t function today. This happens every few weeks. The legal issue should not have taken this long. My ex ‘s lawyer has no reason to settle. His Mum is paying to have me separated from my children. 

Is every person with bipolar and/ or BPD having the same experiences?  I’m 51, my kids haven’t lived with me for 6 years. I don’t care about having a partner or getting married again. I want to be a Mother to my children. 

I’m starting to cry just typing this. I’ve been divorced for 13 years. WHY AM I STILL IN COURT?  His Mum sold her cottage, her house and moved in with her daughter. Who does that?!  She is 85-87 yo. What Mother tries to keep another Mother from her kids. She messing with the mental health of her grandkids to make me mad. This what I find so frustrating. Why do the courts allow this?  I’m be abused by the legal system and my ex is the puppet master. 

This is a rant. How many times do you have to Re wash a load of laundry multiple times before it goes in the dryer. It’s stuff like that. 23 years of abuse. I want out. 

Please make whatever comments you want. I had to reach out to people who understand. This is the one social his 56 yo sister isn’t cyber stalking me on.

76,BPD or Bipolar 1? ,"hello! I’m a 26 (F) and today I went to my first appointment with a psychiatrist. They said they suspect I have Bipolar 1 and are planning to prescribe me medication (vraylar) during our next appointment. I’ve been worrying about it nonstop since then because I don’t want to begin a medication that maybe isn’t even what I need to be taking. The key difference I’ve noticed in symptoms is that my mood swings are entirely situation based and irregular. They’re also always consistent with the fear of being abandoned or perceived judgment. Someone can make a simple comment in passing and it’ll send me on an emotional spiral. Kind of like my psychiatrist saying she suspects Bipolar 1. I’ve read that it can go misdiagnosed and I’m wondering if that’s happened to anyone here? I want to make sure I know how to advocate for myself the best before going into my next appointment. 

I’ve been in therapy for 3 years and have found that DBT has reduced my symptoms and improved my emotional regulation the most. 

Appreciate any advice!

90,My wife wants to open our relationship and it’s rotting me alive ? ,"The love of my life, my wife, has asked my to open our relationship. I will never be okay with this and her doing it will break my heart and already is. But it’s an urge she can’t resist and she says I am clipping her wings and that she is suffocating when she is not doing it. She has been an amazing wife, always there for me, always understanding and loving. But despite everything we’ve been through this is it, the one thing that has changed everything between us. The thought of her doing that is burning my insides like fire, she is asking me again and again why it does that but I can’t find an answer. I feel insane, why can’t I find an answer ? She is driving me insane telling me I’m not thinking enough because I don’t have a clear answer to why I don’t want it other than that it fucking hurts so much I would rather get shot. She also thinks if I can give a “real” reason other than pain I can work on it and find a way to accept
it. (her opening the relationship). She says she loves me so much she wants me to be happy even if it wasn’t with her . But I don’t love her selflessly enough to let her have that happy experience without me. She fears she will get erased. 

We’ve been to couples therapy with no success. Therapist suggested my wife finds a way to deal with her urges and I find a way to deal with the emotions it has brought up in me. But my wife simply can’t and she will open our relationship. Despite everything I want to stay with her but am in for years or torture that will happen again and again and again. It will never stop. But how can I leave my soulmate ? Other than that I can’t imagine my life without her. She is my everything and we have so many plans together. She hasn’t done it yet but the pain about this situation has made me self harm brutally for the first time in years, I’ve been doing reckless things, abusing prescribed pills, not going to school and ditching my job. Slowly escalating my behavior.

And for the first time in years I really really really have the thoughts I thought I’d never have again. The big S, the 10% statistic. I have lost one of my closets friends to S and swore to never do that to anyone ever and better be a drugged up zombie in the grippy socks hotel but there it is clear as day. I feel so cursed for being alive with BPD because I feel like I’m dying inside while having to breathe. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this situation? Most importantly how to deal with the pain ? It’s to a point i’m in so much pain i’m wondering if i’m not getting a hearth attack, I feel like my hearth is in a bath of acid , I can’t eat or breathe normally anymore.  I have horrible nightmares every night and every morning when I wake up I feel like a bear sat on my chest. I can’t sleep anymore and am loosing the grip on reality. I 3x my emergency anxiety meds and it doesn’t do shit. 

How can I find a way to live with this pain ? How can I live ? I feel so alone , I’m in therapy but f that , nobody knows how fucked up it is to live with this curse , I wish I had every limb or my body amputated instead, anything is better than this life. I feel like the universe opened a hole under my feet and I’m falling into an infinite void that never stops. Please give me advice. Why do we deserve to be cursed ?

Edit for clarity; 
She says her opening the relationship is not a surprise. We discussed having threesomes before (which to me is totally different). We never made a secret we find other people attractive. I don’t want to sleep with anyone else but knew she would probably have agreed to an open relationship if I suggested it. But I was not interested in that. 

And I never knew it was going to be such an intense need for her she was not going to be able to live without us opening our relationship. I thought she was fine being monagmous but according to her she has been repressing that side of her for years. This is never something I wanted for my life but according to her I made indications in that way (because I was interested in a threesome however when it got more concrete this summer I backed out because I was not comfortable with that idea anymore and was scared it was going to hurt and make me feel jealous.) She thinks she has been open but I never knew she was hurting so badly over this that she was willing to loose our relationship over it.
I still feel completely blindsided but she doesn’t feel that way .

Edit 2 : Thank you all for your kindness and advice. I’m too exhausted to reply to each of you individually but I wanted to express gratitude for helping me. It helps me realize I’m not crazy for feeling how I do. I’m not good enough to decide anything but as some of you suggested I’m going to get medication prescribed asap so I can try and even start to handle this situation instead of committing self exit.

I felt like they prescribed more than they listened and after trying all different concoctions & getting out I decided to deal with it on my own.

I never really had a self image, never knew who I was because still to this day I’m trying really hard to fit into sociality around me. Plus I have a really addictive personality, I’ve fought with many addictions in the past years, everything you can think of. Hard drugs, weed, alcohol, medicines.. I started using substances when I was 14, got diagnosed with bpd at 18 after my third attempt to unalive myself.

96,How to cope until I get treatment?," Sorry  if any of this is incoherent or difficult to read, it’s very difficult  to make sentences that flow right or make sense but I'm just gonna try  my best.

I have had recurring  psychotic episodes for about 2 years now, alongside depression and  anxiety, and I have mananged it not too horribly until roughly half a  year ago.

I have been looking for  treatment for my mental state since then, mainly for the debilitating  psychosis that, as a few doctors told me, is likely caused either by a  combination of BPD and CPTSD, or the beginning stages of paranoid  schizophrenia (my biological mom has it so it's fairly likely that i  might too).

I have seen multiple  medical professionals in the past months and been assessed as high risk  due to the severity of my situation, rapidly worsening psychosis,  suicidal ideaction, etc. and given an urgent recommendation and referral  for inpatient treatment. Because the mental health system is so  ridiculously overstretched where I live though, I basically won't be  able to get any help for at least another 8 weeks. I have spoken to  countless psychiatrists, treatment falilities and so on in the past few   months, and got told over and over again ""sorry there is nothing we can  do for you, we just don't have the capacities"". Sometimes I'd get  referred to someone else, who would inevitably tell me the same thing. I  can't travel to get treatment, because in my country you have to get  treated in the same area you live.

I  fortunately have lovely family members in a different district, whose  house I legally ""moved to"" on paper, which is the only reason I was able  to get assessed at the last inpatient facility a few days ago. Even  with referrals from multiple doctors though, they told me that they can  only take me in 8 weeks at the soonest.

Until  then, I have neither therapy nor medication and honestly I'm very  scared. I have terrifying hallucinations and paranoia that makes  interacting with others incredibly difficult. Even holding a  conversation or stringing a simple sentence together is hard because I  am distracted by my hallucinations, mentally exhausted and/or  distrustful of other people.

Frequent  panic attacks and nightmares, emotional dysregulation and so on... I am  dissociated constantly and don't know whether I am awake or dreaming.

I  have been holding myself together more or less by self medicating with  things like kratom and weed to help me sleep at least a little and stop  me from freaking out 24/7 but it's a very flawed ""solution"" and  exacerbates certain symptoms. Recently this seems to be working less and  less. I spend increasingly more time in that freaked-out state of  impending doom and unable to distract myself from the scary things I  see, hear and feel all the time.

I  can’t do very much, all my energy is spent on trying to keep myself  safe-ish and that doesn’t always work. I frequently self harm to  distract from the overwhelming emotions or because I am so stressed out  by the whole situation. I have some friends but none of them understand  any of what I’m going through and I can’t find the words to explain  what’s going on. I used to be able to talk at least a bit about my  problems, but my paranoia tells me I can't trust anyone and even if im  in a less paranoid state, I just don’t have the mental capacity atm.

I  had to go on sick leave from university, so I spend my days at home  trying to keep myself distracted. I have a hard time going out in public  because of the constant paranoia and anxiety. Also the hallucinations  are incredibly distracting and I look visibly freaked out cause I keep  looking behind me, hearing voices, never knowing if an actual person is  talking to me or if I am just imagining it.

I  struggle immensely with nighttime. The hallucinations get stronger and  scarier and more difficult to ignore and I find myself having tons of  sleepless nights cause I'm just too scared to fall asleep, or I get  woken up by terrifying PTSD nightmares and won't be able to sleep after  that.

I have a general  practitioner who prescribed me antidepressants and benzos in the past,  but isn't comfortable with giving me anything antipsychotic. And  honestly I wouldn't want her to just give me her best guess, cause  multiple things she prescribed me in the past didn’t help and made  certain things worse (the benzos caused intense dissociation that never  went away and then a psychotic episode when I stopped taking them, even  though I was taking them as prescribed)

I  don't even have an official diagnosis for what’s currently going on  yet, apart from BPD, generalized depression and anxiety disorder, that I  got diagnosed with a few years back. The inpatient place that I am on  the waiting list for will do more diagnostic tests and prescribe me the  meds when I get there, but until then I have nothing.

But,  as scary as my situation is, it can hardly be unique. I’m sure I am not  the only one who has had to wait for treatment in a horrible and  declining mental state like this, especially since the pandemic left the  system even more broken then it was before.

Is  there anyone who has been in a similar situation and can give me some  insight into how to cope until I can get help? How can I keep myself  safe? How do I survive 8 or more weeks like this, without meds or  therapy while my mental state seems to keep declining?

Story is, I was grabbing medical records and got the record from one of my inpatient stays and noticed that BPD and Depression was likely but they’ve never shared any information with me and just prescribed me Abilify during my stay. I didn’t stay on it due to the side effects, but that was my first introduction to BPD. 

Recently, I was able to find someone to talk to. Initially, I was looking for a counselor but I got put with a social worker and he was great. The only issue was, I told him why I was there and more of my background for the events in my life and he essentially told me, “I don’t think you have BPD at all. BPD is a scrutinized mental illness that’s been having a bad rep and often gets mislabeled.” What he essentially told me was I have “maladaptive defense mechanisms” due to all the trauma in my life. 

I don’t know if a social worker is able to say all this. So just looking into anyone that might’ve gone through this before. 

I’ve told him about my splits and still, he thought it was defense mechanisms. ",1711161308.0,False,3,8,gnarlygnk,None,1blhi47,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1blhi47/has_anyone_ever_been_misdiagnosed/
100,How to help?,"I'm new here. I'm a parent to a teenager who may or may not have BPD. It's not yet diagnosed,but the psychiatrist believes they probably have it,but it requires further investigation. 
She's not gonna come to the follow-up appointment. She got medications prescribed, but will not take them. 
In the meantime, how can I help? He refuses all the help to begin with, wants to feel the way she does, meaning depressed, angry,sad, hopeless, wishes to die, doesn't want to get better, etc. I feel like whatever I say or do, it doesn't matter. I know the desire to heal oneself has to come from within, but how to subtly motivate them? How to communicate? What to avoid when talking to someone who wants to be dead but will not (yet) attempt to end it themself? There's also drug abuse and occasionally alcohol abuse, self harm. 

Thank you if you have any words of encouragement or pointers on how to help. I don't want to lose her.",1699359849.0,False,1,9,lunar-explorer,None,17pt3sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/17pt3sb/how_to_help/
101,Has anyone tried Topiramate / Topimax medication for their bpd symptoms?,"Hey all, I got diagnosed with BPD about a year ago. I've been in therapy but really struggling with my symptoms and looking to try medication. 

I know no single medication will help BPD specifically but if it can help some of the symptoms that would make things so much easier. 

I've tried a couple of SSRI's before and found they don't help and just make me feel super numb and foggy and flat. 

I've been doing some research and found a couple mentions of a mood stabilizer called Topiramate (or brand name Topamax) which looks good - it's primarily a medication for preventing seizures in epilepsy but it's been found to treat some bpd symptoms successfully too. Specifically impulsiveness and mood swings (anger / aggression) which happen to be my worst symptoms and cause the biggest of my life problems. It also can be used to prevent migraines which is quite a common occurrence for me especially when stressed. I think it would be good to try and ask my doctor to prescribe. 

Was just wondering if anyone else had tried it and if so, has it helped? 
I know there are a few side effects so I wanted to see how they've effected people

What do I say when I call a psychiatrist? That I’m showing signs of BPD and want to be assessed? I don’t want them to think I’m trying to self diagnose myself, but the patient/client always knows their body best. (I work in healthcare and stand by that)

110,Online vs. In-person DBT therapy. Advice needed.," 

Hi. I (59M) was diagnosed about five years ago with BPD and a co-morbid of Bi Polar Disorder II. It explains a lot as far as how I've reacted to situations in my life. I've recently quit taking Xanax after 23 years of daily prescribed use, and reality is hitting me in the face and I'm not quite sure how to block its punches.

When I was diagnosed, my shrink told me she couldn't help me and that I needed DBT. I think she's right. However, I'm uninsured and online DBT therapy is half the price of in-person therapy.

So, my fellow BPD'ers, what has your experience been for in-person vs. online DBT therapy? And, ultimately, is either method better than none?

hi,

i feel a little silly(?) if that’s the right word, maybe embarrassed but i just met with my local community mental health team assessor today for the first time. after 15 years of being messed about, let down etc she actually listened to me and said she doesn’t diagnose but she said i can tell this isn’t clinical depression and your symptoms seem to suggest EUPD(the word she used), and said she thinks the doctor is going to prescribe mood stabilisers, so i’m wondering what are the side effects like for any mood stabiliser? just to prepare myself. 

also, does anyone have any advice on how to come with finally getting that diagnosis? just to add, i’ve had many GPs suggest i probably have BPD but they never actually referred me on to get this support/actual diagnosis

131,I’m ruining my own life ,"I lost my father this past July and I have honestly been spiraling ever since. I work an extremely hectic job with impossible hours.. I’m a clinical supervisor at a residential facility for boys 9-21 years old with sexually problematic and behavioral issues. I live in a one bedroom apt and my mother moved in after my father passed (she is extremely mentally ill with no friends, family, money, nothing) and I am her sole care taker, my brother lives in California. I started dating someone about five months ago and we fight almost every night (we started living together after two weeks). I am spiraling horribly with my mental health and have started resorting back to old self harming and erratic behaviors. I scream like a little kid, sometimes so loudly that my head shakes and voice cracks. I punch and hit things around and stomp on the ground/throw myself around. & last but not least I started pinching, squeezing, biting, hitting, and slapping myself. 

WELL about three weeks ago I was in a really big fight with my girlfriend and I went into the bathroom during a full meltdown to be alone. When I went in there I was just screaming and crying and rocking back and forth on the toilet but quickly that didn’t feel like enough. I then started open hand wacking myself in the head.. over and over with the part of my hand that connects to my wrist. I was hitting myself in the temple area and the top of my head. After doing that back and forth for about 2 minutes, I hit myself repeatedly on the right side crying even harder & then suddenly I couldn’t hear out of my right ear, I got dizzy, and couldn’t walk straight. All of the symptoms subsided after about two days except for the loss of hearing in my right. This happened three weeks ago and I still do not have hearing. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I had a hearing exam done and found out that I have profound hearing loss in my right ear and will never hear again unless I get what’s known as a c.r.o.s. Hearing aid or a cochlear implant. I ruined my hearing because I couldn’t cope with difficult feelings. I’m truly starting to hate myself. I’ve been feeling so low and most days I genuinely daydream of dying. I don’t want to kill myself right now but I do wish an accident would happen or something. I just keep making everything harder for myself and I’m so tired of living like this. Who hits themselves so hard that they literally make themselves deaf? That’s fucked up. I’m fucked up.

132,I think I've got BPD,"
Hello everyone !

As the title say I think I've got BPD. So I am 20 yo (F) and I live in Belgium. I recently went to see a psychiatrist and took an appointement to a psychologist after 6 years of not seeing one (and having a bad mental health which shooked my psychiatrist but another story). My psychiatrist prescribed me some antidepressants. It's too early to say if it's working or not.

I don't want to diagnose myself (because we all now it's a bad idea). But I don't really know anyone who knows about BPD or don't really want to talk about it (since it waq not really well percieved whenI talked about it) so I'm writing here and don't want to offend anyone just looking for help.

I looked up some article about BPD and since I'm studying psychology (ironically) I've looked up some professionnals articles too. And I really recognize myself and it's to a point where it's kinda scary.

Should I talk about it to my psychiatrist or psychologist ? Should I wait (since it's only the beginning of the ""treatment"") ?

Sorry for my english and if you want updates or have any question don't hesitate.

I have recently started doing research on it myself to point out unhealthy patterns in my behavior but sometimes even tho I am well aware I'm obsessively thinking about something I still can't control it so that brings me here. Instead of showing toxic behavior I wanted to ask people suffering from the same thing to share how they deal with it.

134,anyone else experience vague & unclear diagnoses for years before getting officially diagnosed?,"so last night i was going through old meds i had been prescribed in high school (21 now) so i could make a list of everything i’ve been on that has not worked for me. the entire time i was seeing therapists & psychiatrists in high school i was under the impression i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and that was it. in my head i had a long list of SSRIs, SNRIs, and antianxiety meds (only mirtazapine ((Remeron)) & hydroxizine for anxiety) that all never worked/made me physically ill. after trying these meds and none of them working, i got discouraged and eventually stopped going to therapy and self-medicating, but that’s besides the point. when i was going through my old meds, i found that i was prescribed Abilify (5mg and then 10mg) but where my confusion comes from is the fact that i was never explicitly told “i’m prescribing x for your diagnosis of y.” i’m not sure if they were keeping my diagnosis on the low for some reason (thinking i would be upset by it maybe?) or what. i’ve heard that a lot of professionals won’t make diagnosis clear to people with BPD, but i’m not sure how true that is. has anyone else experienced something similar? 
i was never told anything other than anxiety, depression, and adhd; not even if they were considering different diagnoses (i’m thinking they might have been considering bipolar disorder but not trying to diagnose that since i was under 18). i definitely was exhibiting many signs of borderline that i can now recognize with confidence; i even vividly remember first experiencing the feeling of emptiness at age 7.
now after seeing my current psychiatrist, they initially thought bipolar as well, but at my most recent visit i asked to be screened more closely as that diagnosis did not sit right with me (as in all the symptoms i had been researching for months did not line up with the way my brain works lmao) but now here we are with the diagnosis of BPD, it feels the most accurate and i was honestly relieved because after years of not feeling anything was accurate and knowing there was something else going on, treatment and working on managing my symptoms feels so much more doable. thank you if you made it this far 🙂",1649772075.0,False,8,5,jessedarko,None,u1ztco,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/u1ztco/anyone_else_experience_vague_unclear_diagnoses/

136,Need help about medications with BPD," Hey!  This is my first time posting on reddit. I am struggling with taking a  decision on whether I should take medications especially mood  stabilizers for my BPD. I just wish to share my experience with therapy  and a little about my current situation first before asking but if you  aren't interested you can skip the next two paragraphs.

I  was having a bad time with my mental health for a long time and finally  decided to take therapy four moths ago. Majorly, I was diagnosed with  BPD, and was told I have severe anxiety problems with a bunch of other  issues. Once I was told about my diagnosis, I was asked by my therapist  on how I feel on taking meds .. and I said that I am not comfortable  with them. I have seen some really closed ones who have taken some meds  prescribed by their psychiatrists and have gotten addicted to them and  completely dependent on their meds. At that time, my therapist told me  that she wouldn't recommend me any meds till the time she sees that I am  working on whatever tasks she gives me and that it is having a positive  affect on me. But she did tell me that meds help in the treatment and  should only be taken with therapy because meds cannot solve the root  cause of the illness which only therapy can. I was determined to fix my  illness and really was working really hard over it.

Fast  forward to three months, I started to feel a lot better than I was  three months back, I must tell you that I haven't yet started with DBT.  Then, something happened the following week and things went downhill for  me. For the entirety of the week I had never felt this  isolated/secluded in my entire life which escalated my fear of  abandonment. During that week, I had a total of 8 anxiety attacks and  went suicidal. The only constant thought was to kms. The week went by,  and the next two weeks I was all alone at my home too which further  escalated things and one other thing happened which I don't wish to talk  about publicly but that was the biggest trigger. There were a total of  three continuous weeks of this misery where I hadn't taken any therapy  session (because I couldn't book slot in the first week and after that  the only next available slot was two weeks later), left all the coping  mechanisms I was told to work with, had stopped journaling, lost my  appetite, didn't talk to anyone, etc. I could see myself being in this  trap of depressive episode but felt completely unmotivated about working  over it in any way. After these three weeks, I started to talk to my  friends a bit and I started journaling, meditating, force feed myself,  etc. I would also mention that I am no longer suicidal, and even when I  was I would've never committed suicide. It was more of having a constant  thought which I felt helpless about and that I was tired of being this  hurt again and again.

I finally  had my therapy session yesterday and she recommended me as I am going  through a low phase I should take some meds majorly mood stabilizers and  that it will be temporary and with time as I get better she will  decrease its dosage to a point where I won't have to take them. She  asked me to book a session with the psychiatrist she works with and get  some meds prescribed. Now, as I have been mostly anti about taking meds  throughout my life, but feeling so helpless in the past three weeks I  can understand why I might need them. There is also a little part of me  that thinks that I am getting setup in a trap of therapy and  psychiatrist where I would've to pay two people as they have a  partnership but at the same time because they have a partnership they  could really help me.. idk.. See, I am a guy from India where mental  health is in general not received very nicely especially for men. But  that is still the least of my concerns, for me, taking therapy has been a  very big step then accepting that I have a disorder has been tough too  and now meds are a big hurdle. Also keep in mind my DBT starts next  week.

The advice that I am seeking is -

1. Is it really necessary to take mood stabilizers for BPD?
2. Can  I get addicted/dependent to them and how realistic is it to have some  dosage now and slowly reduce the dosage to zero as I get better?
3. Are there any side-effects to mood stabilizers?
4. What questions should I ask the psychiatrist about the meds she prescribes except for the 3 I mentioned here?

I  know I might be asking for too much and sharing too much. Also, sorry  for my English, it isn't my first language.

148,Medication Feedback,"Hello,

I'm in a kind of desperate state right now since I don't know which medication to take. I'm prescribed Vyvanse 30 mg even though I don't have ADHD but BPD. I took it for Binge Eating but somehow it really improved my mood and made me euphoric for approx 1-2 hours every day. I took this for around 2 years in which I accomplished a lot. But I also struggled with mood swings and anxiety and emptiness as soon as the medication wore off around 11-12pm. Recently I got more intense crashed so I decided to consult my psychiatrist. They proposed Lamotrigine because it brilliantly helped me once to get out of a depressive time. A few years later I tried it again and didnt help anymore. I tried stopping Vyvanse which made me very depressed, unable to get out of bed. Before that I would run halfmarathons 3 times a week and go to the gym 3 times a week. Now I can't even get out of bed but I feel more relaxed and my mood swings are different, I can reflect and distance myself for once. I'm currently taking  25mg Lamotrigine, next week 50mg. 

I took so many different meds in my life from lithium to ssris to neuroleptics. I couldnt find any single one which helps long term without serious side effects. Seroquel helps me calm down but the next day I'm depressed, Benzos are great but addictive, Vyvanse makes me productive and happy-but vor a very short time. Ritalin gave me also euphoria but afterwards intense crashes with depression. Lithium did nothing for me, aswell as Wellbutrin, countless SSRIs and Attarax. 

I really don't know what to do. I know you guys aren't psychiatrists but you all have experiences of your own. I'd be grateful for your experiences and advice.

157,Hi. I need help,"I am a 20 year old girl. I have been in therapy and went to a psychiatrist for many years for eating disorders, especially bulimia (I also had a period of anorexia, but it was very short. To date, my main eating disorder is bulimia and I've been suffering from it for 8 years now). The psychiatrist prescribed me antidepressants when I was 16 and also prescribed me a potent drug used for schizophrenia (although I am NOT schozophrenic). With the medication I was prescribed I got better, even if I have never known or experienced happiness in my life: I have suffered from abuse, I have never known my father, my mother suffers from a personality disorder, I was bullied, but mostly my eating disorders led me to attempt suicide.
Now, I don't know why, but in 2020 I stopped everything: psychotherapy, psychiatrist and I suddenly stopped taking medication. I seemed to be fine but my eating disorder never went away. I am writing this to you because now another problem is added: my mood.
I have always been an unstable person but now the situation has worsened and it's affecting my life so much that I still find myself thinking about suicide.
I absolutely do not want to diagnose myself with borderline disorder, I don't have the skills to do that, however when I read the symptoms I find myself on everything. Right now I'm wondering whether to go to a psychiatrist again, I feel I desperately need medication (however now I attend university in a different city so i should go to a different psychiatrist).
My main symptoms are:
- my mood changes abruptly from one moment to the next, sometimes for a reason, other times not. All this in an extreme way (and this has a huge influence on my life, even my studies and my relationship with people)
- The way I perceive myself: sometimes I go from considering myself the most intelligent, beautiful, nice and important person in the world to considering myself a nullity without any value, which does not deserve to live
- the relationship with my few friends. I am very attached to them, maybe they are my only reason for living, but sometimes I feel a real unjustified hatred towards them and disappear for a while 
- Bulimia and impulsive behaviors 
- I have obsessive thoughts about my body and my appearance 
I'm very sorry guys, but thanks if you read this far. And sorry for my English (I'm Italian).

161,Whyyyy did this trigger me so bad,"I have been prescribed 1mg alprazolam for years now. It was given to me to help with sleeping when I have trouble due to anxiety. 
I am not reliant on it at all, but it’s such a relief to have when I’m somewhere new and can’t sleep or just anxious and can’t calm down TO sleep. Usually I refill and get 1mg and 30 pills. Often I break it in half. I haven’t refilled the 30 pills since September and I still had like 7 left! I’m not fucking addicted. At all.  

I asked for a refill and I go to pick up and I got 10 pills of .25 

Super confused so I contacted my psychiatrist and they said because I have the propranolol that she won’t give the 1mg. 

The propranolol was only given to me because I told her my heart rate went way up one day due to the increas of the bupropion. She said take it when your heart rate is up. I haven’t even used it because it hasn’t happened since! She never said to take it for general anxiety. 

I don’t like this change especially without warning or reason. I had an appt with my PCP and they won’t prescribe it either because it’s for anxiety, not sleep. And LITERALLY I WAS TOLD TO TAKE IT TO HELP ME SLEEP WHEN IM ANXIOUS. Like 3 years ago now!

PCP told me to try zzzquil. But for some reason, after my virtual visit, my mood completely switched from fine to distraught, angry, frustrated, annoyed. Fighting the urge to throw and punch things.

But how stupid is this change in mood? I have this for sleep. I just know it works and doesn’t leave me feeling shitty, so I don’t want to mess with it.

 I guess I’ll try zzzquil but I’m unreasonably upset with the change. It’s not like I don’t have any alprazolam if I need it.

I've thought about this before and I'm just curious if any of you are like this. 

Throughout my life, I've had some physical health issues, and surgeries, that have privileged me to some of the most addictive painkillers prescribable.

I have watched some of these painkillers destroy, of hurt, people that I cared a great deal about.

But I never got addicted. When it was time to taper off, I had no problem. When it was time to stop, I had no issue besides lingering pain. Occasionally, I still need to request a bottle of some of these medicines, but they last me well past multiples of the prescribed term.

I have even tried illicit drugs (I'm a sucker for peer pressure, lmao) and tbh, never even really felt a high. I never felt a draw to go back. 

Whereas, I am extremely addicted to praise and attention. I used to play online games because I was good at them, and the praise that group after group gave me was ridiculous. I'd join failing groups and people knew my name and would be relieved.

I literally had to sell my character so I'd never go back.

I've never been this terrified of wanting to end it all in my whole entire life, not only is this in suicide but it's also in my general life too. My thoughts, how I function. Every single hour I'm on the verge of a break down if I'm not having one already. It's such a struggle and it's because of my Dad.

Long story short: I've been prescribed aripiprazole by my psychiatrist, with the starting dose. My godmom looked it up, and she said how she'll talk to my Dad about it. In the end I wasn't going to take those meds because my dad didn't like the side effects. He told me over text, and I quote, “[Deadname] we trying to get you to a point of you being able to handle this world on your OWN...stop fighting us on growing up please because you're growing up baby”. Mind you this was over my medicine, he never liked antidepressants but I genuinely needed these for mood stability. Not only do I have BPD I also showed signs of Bipolar Disorder as well, specifically type one, me and my therapist both believe I have bipolar disorder. 

The next day, my Dad came over only to say how he was going to my psychiatrist appointments over the meds, basically trying to dictate my appointments. This made me more vulnerable to splitting, and not even 2-3 days later I spiraled to consuming disgusting content to cope. It was a horrible coping mechanism I gained after my mom died when I was 16 years old due to a sudden heart attack. I'm 18, turning 19 in May as I'm writing this.

I've never been at such a low point in my life. I'm terrified of myself. I'm terrified of what I'll do. I'm crying again as I type this. I don't want this anymore.

187,My Friend Was Recently Diagnosed,"I reconnected with an old close friend of mine last October. We occasionally hang out and text/call (not on a daily basis, but frequently). I was busy the last 2 months because of work so I wasn't talking to them as much during that time. I reached out at the beginning of this month to catch back up with them and offer support as they were heading into exam season. I'd noticed that their emotions and mental state seemed to fluctuate with more intensity but wasn't sure if it was stress or other factors so I would try and cheer them up or talk through things with them.

We had dinner together last night and they confided in me that their pcp diagnosed them with Quiet BPD. I've never met another individual with BPD or have much knowledge of it. They told me that they were prescribed medication and it did help when taken, but they do not want to rely on it in fear of getting addicted. Their pcp referred them to two general psychologists, but they haven't gone to any therapy sessions yet. They are in the process of looking for a therapist that specializes in BPD but have yet to find one.

I know the journey ahead of them is going to be a long and difficult one but I want to be able to offer support when needed. The only thing I am wary of is if they will become heavily dependent on me. They used to be very dependent on me before we stopped being friends. I stepped away because I felt that I wasn't taking care of myself and always putting them first. I think right now we have a good relationship where we are comfortable sharing personal thoughts and emotions with one another, but maintain certain boundaries at the same time.

I'd like to keep the relationship we have because it is most comfortable for me, but I wonder if it is comfortable for them? Am I being a bad friend if I want to keep our current boundaries up?

191,Gabapentin and Mania,"I recently took a huge step towards my mental health and went into a 7 day inpatient program. I learned so many coping skills, gained self-love, and made new friends. While I was there, I spoke with the mental crisis hospital's Psychiatrist every day. I used to take Olanzapine 2.5mg and 5mg and I just did NOT like how it would completely sedate me to the point to where I would fall asleep no matter what. Well, I mentioned this to the Psychiatrist and she instead prescribed me Gabapentin 100mg. I did not feel much if any effects on this so she raised it to 300mg. I was feeling this dosage but still having a good amount of anxiety. That's when we raised it to 600mg.

I take 600mg Gabapentin 3 times a day and all I have to say is wow. My new self-love, combined with my Wellbutrin and Prozac makes me feel like a new man. I'm actually feeling happy again and not depressed which is amazing because I've had MDD for over a year now. It's such an amazing feeling and I don't want it to stop.

My Psychiatrist warned me about one thing though. She said she is over-prescribing me and because of that, I could start experiencing mania. Now, guys, I don't know if what I'm feeling is mania or true happiness. It's a great feeling. I'm doing much more around the house and I'm able to regulate my emotions better. But I'm scared. She said this mania could evolve into Bipolar, and im already BPD, so I don't really want that.

Do you guys have any experience with Gabapentin? Is this dose too much? Have you experienced mania with it? I want to know more about this drug or combination of drugs because I feel like I FINALLY found something that works for me. Any input around mania, this medicine, or things of the like would be greatly appreciated. THANK YOU!

A few questions I should’ve clarified with him but wanted to get opinions first. 

1. Does “meeting the criteria” mean I have it? 

I’ve been beating myself up all day because looking back at my past, I would say it all makes sense. I was so melodramatic as a teen and young adult lol I’m 29, for reference. When I graduated high school, I learned about BPD, surface level stuff, and thought that could be me. I never explored it but had I , I could’ve saved so many relationships…

But have I been diagnosed? Or am I just jumping to conclusions.

2. Is it possible to have all of those overlap?


We decided to tackle one thing at a time, so he prescribed Wellbutrin for MDD and Anxiety.

I was diagnosed with BPD, Bipolar, mild OCD, Body Dysmorphia, & social anxiety..... I do not take any medication. In the past, I was on seroquel for about 2 months. Seroquel made me very suicidal & I gained about 20lbs which irked my body dysmorphia. So I was prescribed another drug which I cant remember the name of now (starts with an A) but it was too expensive at the time for me to fill that prescription. Since then I was put on Hydroxyzine which just makes me sleep. Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine; a large dose benadryl if you will. Also taking NAC as an additional supplement-not a drug. 

Other than that, I've never tried an antidepressant, anti-anxiety, or mood stabilizer. I fear the hair loss, mood swings, & weight gain of a lot of these prescribed medications.

203,New prescription of Lamictal. I’m scared.,"I’ve been unmedicated for years. The first and last time was over 5 years ago, and it wasn’t a good experience for me. It was Escitalopram (Lexapro), Buproprion (Wellbutrin), and trazodone. I was jittery, trembling, and sleepless, and the trazodone would make me groggy and I’d have difficulty getting up in the morning after. Plus now that I may be possibly bipolar (borderline confirmed) my psychiatrist thinks SSRIs are not a good option, as they may swing me into mania.

He gave me the option to treat my concentration problems first or my breakdowns. I chose to manage my breakdowns so he prescribed Lamictal as a mood stabilizer.

I’m scared because I’ve never liked meds in the first place. I hate the possible complications, like it might treat one thing but make something else worse. I have such a sea of symptoms, I’m pretty sure something will get worse. On my good days, I am bright and cheerful, and I’m worried I’ll lose that.

I just have so much to lose. I live with a major trigger, I’ve been on the cusp of being hospitalized, and I’m in school. Stability is an absolute necessity right now, I can’t afford these breakdowns, and I know meds can make things worse before they get better.

206,scared of my diagnosis,"
Hi,
I (26,F) have been diagnosed with BPD by my therapist (not psychiatrist) 2 months ago. I suspected I had it long before the diagnosis, however now after reading some subreddits, especially the one dedicated to BPD (ex) partners, I feel really uneasy. People advising to run away from BPD partners, people saying that therapy is useless, that around 10 years of DBT group therapy is required and does not guarantee a result, that a lot of therapists refuse to work with BPD.. this morning I got a little suicidal after reading all that stuff. I argued with my therapist after he insisted that I took antipsychotics prescribed by my new psychiatrist. I said multiple times that I refuse to take meds such as lithium/antipsychotics since they impact physical health a lot (however I’m ok with taking SSRI and similar since I’m already taking them), and that therapist refused to continue therapy on my conditions. He said that I’m BPD with psychotic traits. Now I have to find another one. I’m in a 4 year long relationship with my BF. I had some episodes during it, one especially heavy that ended in my recovery (voluntary) in psych ward, but most of the time I feel stable. I was never diagnosed by a psychiatrist through a specific test, so I’m starting to have doubts about my diagnosis. I have some of BPD traits, but I don’t know if that’s enough, I’m worried for my relationship (although I have a very supporting partner), I want to get help for whatever issues I may have but I don’t want to be labelled psycho for life and be forced to take meds that physically destroy me and make me an apathetic vegetable.

Is this a bpd thing? I ask because I was technically also diagnosed with bipolar but never sought therapy for it because I was afraid of gaining weight from the meds I had been prescribed for it. This was almost a decade ago and I’ve been doing just fine without any meds so I guess this is bpd?

211,At boiling point in rehab,"So i've been in rehab for about 4 months now, and i was just starting to feel a lot better after i was prescribed stimulants for my ADHD.

Then past week it suddently struck me that this medication won't resolve my BPD problems, and i started to enter a bad mood-set before the weekend.

On saturday i received the news that a friend of mine had committed suicide friday night, and i happen to be the only one that knew he was planning it and why. The really tricky part is that he said that he would kill himself instantly if i told anyone and added that it would be my fault. I mentioned it to someone just a couple of days before his suicide, but i didn't mention his name so it couldn't possibly be related. His family or friends doesn't even know who i am, so i'm not invited to the funeral. I feel bad for being the only one with the answers to the questions they're all asking themselves, but he killed himself because of something he was too ashamed to share with anybody else, so i can't tell them either. Obviously this has made me pretty depressed.

On top of that, we received a new patient in rehab today who has been sexually harassing a close friend of mine in a pretty serious manner. It's common courtesy in rehab to let outside issues stay outside and allow people to work on themselves, but in this case, this is going to be a problem for me.

Is it hard to get prescribed meds through your GP? For example do they make the process hard for you or are they very helpful?

What mood stabilisers and anti depressants do you take and how have those particular meds been for you?

If you’re taking both or have taken both mood stabilisers and anti depressants would you recommend taking them at the same time or is it better to only choose one? 

How much does it cost per month for medication? (Or per quarter I’m not sure how long they last)

I'm barely getting any quality sleep and I've been trying to avoid falling asleep but I've just been so exhausted I give in. Everytime I'm asleep it's just that constant nightmare state. I find myself super tired during the day and it's really impacting my performance. The only good thing is it has left me too tired to lash out at people, I just don't have the energy for it.

Anyone else experience this? Is there anything I can do about it? I'm not doing any substances, only take what I am prescribed. I don't use melatonin or any medical sleep aids.",1674936191.0,False,4,2,ThatTemplar1119,:pride:LGBT+:pride:,10no2zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/10no2zr/dae_struggle_with_nightmares_and_sleep_paralysis/

222,Feeling still going through a break up 2 years later. Still hung up on my favorite person. (TW: medication-abused and thoughts of self-harm),"I feel like i’m still going through a breakup even 2 years after the real breakup.

I don’t know if this is because i’m a demisexual BPD and it’s hard for me to replace my favorite person, or whether i’m just struggling to be alone and be my won favorite person.

I feel like i have so much love to give and i feel hollowness in my heart.

I feel like it’s always up and down, certain days i seem 100% in acceptance of being alone and not ever finding someone to love and convince myself that i’ll be happy with own career, perhaps my own pets and if i really would like to have children, adoption is an option. I don’t need a romantic partner for it.

But when my favorite person is showering me with love and promises i seemed to forget about all of the above. Because being or the idea to be with my favorite person feels so much better than being on my own.

My favorite person barely has been replying me past few days and i felt so neglected. Had a whole night of splitting, and strong feel of selfharm. But i was able to stop it after taking my prescribed meds (though i took it more than i was prescribed - not for overdosing , but i just wanted to be off my head for a second).
I felt so much better though i woke up feeling a little hang over.

223,Recently Diagnosed - Abilify,"Hi all

I was prescribed Abilify and last night was the first time taking it. 

30 minutes after, I felt high like I had just smoked. I don't smoke anymore as it makes me feel to out of control of my body and gives me bad thoughts for hours (unaliving myself). I could feel every ache in my body, too, which normally happens while I'm high.

It went away like 20 minutes later.... Has anyone else experienced this???

I had a slight head-ache after. I went to bed around 9-10pm (I took my nightly 2 Melatonin) and woke up, heart racing, at 12:30am. I could not get to sleep until 3am! (I wake up for work at 6:30am :/)

This morning I felt so nauseous which I know is normal. But WHYYY did I feel like I just smoked?!?!? How could that be a side effect? 

PLEASE share your experiences with Abilify! This is the first medication I am trying out & it's so important to me.",1635443422.0,False,4,14,dazeydukem,None,qhsic1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/qhsic1/recently_diagnosed_abilify/

So I got a message from the office saying that they think it's more beneficial for me to get ""higher care"" with a psychiatrist. But they do the same job? they prescribe meds? like??? wtf. seeing a psychiatrist is no better than a NP cos theyre both skilled in the area.

225,Is this normal behaviour?,"My therapist years ago said I clearly display nearly all bpd symptoms and should be checked out to have a diagnoses so I could be prescribed medication. I didn't go to the evaluation because I'm afraid that I couldn't get a teaching job with a bpd diagnosis. (the government is shit, hates teachers and I'm afraid)
But I'm afraid I just convinced her that I was struggling to get attentionor idk. 

A few day ago, I was in a cafe with a friend, my fp called me (we were going to talk on the phone) and she let me know that she was too tired to talk. I started sobbing, cried for 20 minutes, got suicidal, called my best friend (while the other friend was still present) she listened to me cry for 10 minutes, I told her I felt suicidal, my friend who I was with started tearing up. We hung up with my best friend, I cried for another 10 minutes. 
The my mood absolutely switched, I was okay. 

I asked my friend if she wanted to go have a ride on the Ferris wheel. 
Her:no, I don't, I'm not feeling good,  I just want to sit here

226,I’m just a poor boy from a poor family,"…but I somehow made it. I just got done with a really intense interview practice and it’s not official but. They just quoted me the salary range. And it’s amazing. I went from being the poor kid in the ghetto, whose family couldn’t even afford tampons or pads - used toilet paper - to a salary in the six figures range. I’ve cried for the past 20 minutes and now I’m just on shock. 

I just wanted to share this to let you know that if you’re struggling, it can get better. You can do things. You can succeed. Keep up with therapy, take your meds if you get prescribed them, and keep up with caring about YOU. 

Even if I for some reason don’t get this job, I know now that I can interview for things like this, I know I can get far enough to hear the benefits package and be told the salary range. That’s more than I ever thought I could get. I’m proud of me.

228,Medications that help?,"Idk if were aloud to talk about this here but I was wondering if anyone felt comfortable talking about medications they’ve been or are prescribed to help with BPD symptoms. I understand that medications are different for EVERYONE. I’m just curious about your experiences 

I’m personally taking Cymbalta (daily medication for major depression disorder and anxiety), klonopin (as needed medication for panic disorder), Buspar (daily med for anxiety), and Trazadone (as needed nighttime med for sleep but is also an antidepressant and sedative). 

For me, Cymbalta has been the best antidepressant I’ve ever taken. But man, if I miss a couple days I feel very low. Klonopin is my lifeline. Kicks in very quickly when I’m in a panicked state. Buspar is my newest med as of 2 weeks ago so I can’t comment on that one as of yet. And trazadone is my miracle sleep aid but if I wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, it feels like my body weighs 1000 lbs and I can hardly open my eyes bc I’m so tired. 

Overall I think I have a good mix going right now. I work closely with my psychiatrist and recommend it to all my fellow BPD redditors. Also for those who do not want to gain weight.. ALWAYS make sure you ask if a medication they want to prescribe is “weight neutral.”",1605599422.0,False,2,3,arvanhanswyk,None,jvp2qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/jvp2qh/medications_that_help/

230,Dr seems to ignore my symptoms,"This is my first post and the first place I thought to vent or seek some help. I was diagnosed with bipolar at 13 at recently it is now borderlinepdisorder. 
About 5 months ago I started medication lamictal and progressed up to 200mg. 
My memory is so effected by these medication I can't remember almost anything. Consistently forget stuff I just talked about with my wife, if we talked about something a few days ago I have zero memory of this. I have voiced and voiced this problem with my Dr and she doesn't seem to take any of it into consideration. 
I am still not stable, have daily ups and downs left and rights even being on meds. 
Alot of the time, I kind of feel like nothing. No emotion. Today they prescribed Wellbutrin xl 150mg a long with 7.5 of mirtazipine. 
Is it just me or does my doctor just not get it? 
This has been going on for the whole 5 months with weekly reviews. I've voiced many times I want to try something else as a base because this was the very first one we tried. It works ok, but we went down to 150mg because I couldn't remember anything and it's been really destroying my relationships with people and making my job among other things extremely difficult. If someone has some advice or maybe a different way I should be looking this that would be well appreciated.
