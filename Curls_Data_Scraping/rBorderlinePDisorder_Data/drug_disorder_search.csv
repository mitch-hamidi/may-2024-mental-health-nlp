I've thought about this before and I'm just curious if any of you are like this. 

Throughout my life, I've had some physical health issues, and surgeries, that have privileged me to some of the most addictive painkillers prescribable.

I have watched some of these painkillers destroy, of hurt, people that I cared a great deal about.

But I never got addicted. When it was time to taper off, I had no problem. When it was time to stop, I had no issue besides lingering pain. Occasionally, I still need to request a bottle of some of these medicines, but they last me well past multiples of the prescribed term.

I have even tried illicit drugs (I'm a sucker for peer pressure, lmao) and tbh, never even really felt a high. I never felt a draw to go back. 

Whereas, I am extremely addicted to praise and attention. I used to play online games because I was good at them, and the praise that group after group gave me was ridiculous. I'd join failing groups and people knew my name and would be relieved.

I literally had to sell my character so I'd never go back.

I've always wondered where this small blessing came from. Is it related to whatever imbalance in my brain causes my epilepsy, is it related to my BPD?",1656949035.0,False,1,1,Affectionate_Fly3313,None,vra527,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/vra527/serious_question_about_drug_addiction_and_bpd/

22,My died dad was a drug addict,"Still so hard to share this with anyone, I’m 24F with BPD, had my share of therapy, DPT and made my peace with the fact that my father died in a car accident when I was 6years old and I can’t visit him where he’s buried because “it’s a dangerous place” or that’s what my family said.
2 days ago my 20y cousin was telling me about her abusive partner and parents and she gave me an example of my mom and dad saying that my mom told her “I got married to someone who was a drug addict & steals money and toxic in every possible aspect because my parents told me he was good and refused that I get divorce”
I didn’t show to her any signs that I didn’t know that so she doesn’t feel bad, but I was shocked, I didn’t know how to feel, I still don’t know, I always assumed there was something weird about him because my family always acted like he didn’t exist, My mom never told me anything about him that makes me feel like I know my own father, now I understand that she didn’t want to make me hate him and I understand how hard her life was with him, but I still don’t know how to feel about this, I was dissociated most of my childhood and teenage years “because everything was so bad and we lived with my mom’s family after his death because his family took our home” so I have no memory of him and knowing this now makes me question everything I have been told about him.
I have a lot of stressful things going on in my life right now, I don’t know if I have the mental capacity to deal with this right now, I didn’t even tell my fiancé because I’m too scared to talk about this with anyone.

(TW DRUG USE, SUICIDE)","I just want to start off by saying that the person i am discussing is the loveliest, kindest person and the only aim of this is to get help for him/us. Okay so I (23f) have been with my partner R (25m) for 4 years, but we have been very good friends for 10+ years. I have always been concerned about his drug use and mental health but in recent years it has become more of an issue. I have been trying to get him to access help for years but he is so deadest against it idk why. The reason I’m asking all of you for your advice is that I have been doing a lot of research over the past year or so into different mental health problems so I can try my best to support him make him feel validated etc and came across BPD and what it truly is. I don’t even know where to start with all of this so i really hope you guys can point me in the right direction for help and how to talk to him about seeing someone to get a diagnosis. R come from a relatively dysfunctional family, and has used weed every day from the age of 13 to cope with life’s stresses. He suffers with extreme anxiety and the slightest thing can push him over the edge. When he’s feeling any extreme emotion he has no other way of expressing himself other than rage/anger. When he feels like i am pulling away (not seeing each other as much, not wanting lots of physical attention etc) he gets very angry and upset. He has very low self image, and is his own worst self critic. He often says how sometimes he feels numb/ empty, and other than those he either feels extremely happy or depressed. He has unstable relationships/feeling with all his family and our friends, with the worst being me and his brother. To him we’re either amazing or the worst person ever. His brother often initiates physical fights with him or try’s to wind him up so his anger comes out. When his feeling change with me however I always remain calm and try to make him feel loved/validated regardless of how he talks to me but i still don’t really know his triggers or how to calm him down. I believe he self sabotages everything as a way of not failing, he leaves good jobs, doesn’t hold any job down for more than a year and has no idea the direction he wants his life to go. He drinks and smokes weed every day, using other class As semi-regularly which doesn’t help with his mental health.

31,Drug abuse and bpd,"Oftentimes, bpd comes with addiction issues. I've personally been addicted to cannabis for more than 15 years and abused of alcohol and so much and many hard drugs, I still wonder how I came out of this insane period alive.

It's only since I'm clean of everything, that I could start working on myself and make the difference between actual bpd symptoms and drug-related adverse effects. It's been a hard and long path to recover from drug abuse, and I have to take meds for the rest of my life to keep levels of depleted neurotransmitters up, so I can face reality without being constantly sad and on edge. I can still feel the damage done, some of it is irreparable, but I can function almost normally now, thanks to these meds and a healthy lifestyle. 

For those who struggle with addiction, and wonder how drugs affect their brain, I found [this article to be the most explicit and comprehensive](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/health-complications-addiction/chemical-imbalance). 

I will never insist enough on the fact that no work on bpd can be done within an addiction pattern. Weed being probably the most perverse of all drugs of this paradigm due to its soft and legalized status. Cannabis is not legalized because it is safe and cool, but because it brings billions in tax returns. Bpd pot addicts, you're being hijacked, and I guarantee you won't evolve a single bit if you're into regular use.

I got super obsessed over her after she ghosted me and left me in 2020 because I was too much to deal with and triggered her Bipolar 2.  She never said I triggered it but I feel like I did . She hated being around me especially when I was high and would dissociated and go completely mute.  Really no one else cared besides her. But after she ghost and left me I ended up stalking her tiktok she had over 4k followers and even was promoted in React YouTube channel.  Once I saw one of her vids on my notifications after having horrible nightmares about her I ended up going to her house at 3am and staying until the next morning where I cut myself really deep and ran to her for help she looked at me disgusted and then my boyfriend had to take me to get 10 stitches in my arm . So recently my boyfriend was in jail for failing probation for weed and I end up seeing her again . She deleted her social media account but I haven't even looked up her name online since everything.  But I really needed to smoke and I wanted to be with her and friends again. I really dont see anything wrong with me cutting so deep or wanting to end my life I just regret ever asking anyone for help again. I ended up going over too see her just for her to cry and say I can't be around her and she will either call the cops or get someone to ""handle me"" * She was a sex worker and knows pimps who would probably shoot me in the head*. At that point I just left and her sister ended up messaging me in Instagram saying if I saw her again she would file a police report on me and when I ignored her arguments and messaged her sister again without thinking she called me an abusive manipulator who uses other . I ended up just hanging up on her call as she started to go off on me. I ended up overdosing and my therapist I regret telling anything too called the cops to check up on me. So my mom ended up finding out about my ex friend and made me delete their numbers and never speak to them again. The cops didn't do much besides file a report on me and giving me a talk about how suicide is bad . Which is bullshit and a total lie. Luckily I ended up dropping my phone and losing everyone's phone numbers so I can never talk to her again even if I wanted. I probably won't see my boyfriend for another month or two so I'm hooking up with some men tonight and the rest of the holiday for weed and just affection I've been craving. I can't afford my therapist or my medication.  I only saw her once which was the day before my attempt but I dont get paid till January 1st and I can also get my prescription as well for my SSRI . So it's not totally bad. I just feel guilty for hooking up with strangers but I have no one to call my friend.  I hate living in Texas and just living in general. At least with sex with strangers I don't have to think about anything, besides how ugly I am compared to her. Which is one of the reasons I'm detransistioning .

37,A therapist told me I couldn’t have bdp bc i dont abuse alcohol/drugs,"I’ve discovered what bpd was about 6 months ago and have decided to try going to a psy to get some professional advice, since it seemed to really really fit with how I had been feeling for a long time.

So i went, started talking to her, and it was horrible.

I asked her about bpd at some point, and she told me right away it couldn’t be that, because she had known people with bpd and that they all usually were heavy drug and/or alcohol users, which i am not (for reasons related to my problems).
She also kept trying to minimize every problem i could describe, saying that i was only a little lost because im 18, or saying other people had it worse...

So, given that she pronounced it no more than 5 minutes after I had asked her, I’m kinda doubting her diagnostic (to say the least), but the question still lingers:

Im not asking for a diagnosis, which is why I wont talk about why I think I do have bpd. What I want to know is if there is any truth to what she told me.
Is age and drug/alcohol use such an important factor when it comes to bpd ?
Does it mean I should give up on that ?

38,Is it me or do many people don’t believe in mental issues without visible scars or drug abuse?,"My dad for example is an alcoholic and people aren’t really supportive, but they at least acknowledge it that he’s struggling and don’t expect him to function like a normal person.

Last point is of course crap, but it’s still acknowledged as an issue.

Edit: an example, that happens too often. When my dad has an episode where he’s really even physically abusive it’s because he’s an alcoholic and well, that’s the way he is.

42,Experiences with pharmaceutical drugs to alleviate symptoms,"Hey people. This is my very first Reddit post, so don't flay me if I goof up. 

I have had ADHD since, well, birth. I was prescribed Ritalin at the age of three and I've taken it my whole life, off and on in my late teens and 20's, less often through my early thirties until now. My psychiatrist told me that often ADHD turns into Borderline personality disorder, and so I was diagnosed with this several years ago, along with depression and anxiety.

Now in my life I've discovered a pattern of ups and downs that last for months to years at a time. I've got all the horror stories that are associated with BPD, depression and anxiety, ADHD, suicide, etcetera. What I want to discuss is the effects of drugs on mental health issues that many of us face daily.

I've been on many antipsychotics and SSRI's over the years in my quest for peace. I've been on Cipralex, Risperidone, Olanzapine, plus more that my addled mind can't recall without a list.

I've been on 150 mgs of Zoloft for years, and that's worked for many of my emotional issues like anger, which I had a very bad problem with. 

I have yet to find the right AP(anti-psychotic) for me, however.  The ones previously listed have not worked for me, and I gave them each almost a year to make really sure.

Currently I'm on 3mg of Risperidone, and 350 mg of Seroquel. Now, I have to say something about Seroquel!

I had a terrible experience with this drug! Initially, I was prescribed 200mg. In the end, I think I was taking almost 600 mg a day, just to escape my life...and it worked, too well. I gave up on every one and every thing.

On this high dose I also stopped caring for myself. A year ago, I was in great shape, healthy and attractive, I was modelling and acting. No more. I've put on almost 100 lbs and my teeth have rotted and cracked from not brushing and grinding my teeth.

I came to realize how bad I'd gotten when I ran out of pills before I could fill the prescription. I saw what had happened to me and fell into deep depression. My life as I'd known it was gone forever. I kept taking less and less Seroquel, and gotten to where I am now.

Withdrawal from this drug is HELL. So far, I've got some weird nerve damage in my hands and feet, I've had some really bad psychotic episodes (which I've never had in my life, previously), and symptoms you would associate with major heroin withdrawal.

I'm still fighting to get off the Seroquel, and it's working so far as I'm tapering off by 50 mgs a week instead of 200 mgs a day. My doctor has given me a prescription for Rexulti.

My research into this new drug is what led me to make this post. I wanted to know if anyone's had experience with Rexulti, and I wanted to inform everyone I can about the dangers of Seroquel.

Anyways. This is a long post, I doubt anyone's going to actually see it but I feel better having said it.",1575728842.0,False,6,2,MadMacDaddy,None,e7ew8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/e7ew8s/experiences_with_pharmaceutical_drugs_to/
43,"Hospitalized twice in a month, suffering from BPD after relapse on alcohol and drugs","So here I am in the hospital.  I have an amazing psychiatrist, who took the time to explain why I don't process threats the same way ""normal"" people do.  No one in my 42 years has explained it to me as effectively as he did.  I have known I had BPD for MANY years and even completed about 1.5 years of DBT and have had stints of 1 and even 2.5 years of sobriety in the past 15 years.  So I have been sober since 9/15/19, and the sobriety itself made it so my symptoms just like flew straight to the surface.  So the only effective treatment my doctor said would work is DBT, CBT, other support groups (like AA or NA), and intense therapy.  I am already really incorporating my mindfulness skills and I have my AA literature here in the hospital to read.  Bad news is that I live with an untreated dry drunk; my husband.  He doesn't quite understand what I am going through, but last night at visiting my doctor gave us an informative video to watch.  I'm sure it helped but not 100%.  I mean it's taken me like 20 years to get a grasp on what's happening, he's not going to get it in one day.  We have been together 5 years, and I've been hospitalized three times in that span.  I've been sober half of our relationship/marriage and not the other half.  

Some things that help me are sleeping well, eating a balanced low carb diet, exercise, attending AA meetings and working the steps, going to my therapy and groups, and making friends in recovery who are supportive and positive.

&#x200B;

So my questions to this group are:  What has worked for you as far as treatment/therapies?  What has helped your family members to understand what you are going through?  How have they best supported you?

46,BPD and cannabis? ,"Does anyone have experience with the use of cannabis after your diagnosis? 

I've been diagnosed since I was 23 (I'm now 31)and have been on prescription meds since I was 16 (pre-diagnoses). Have been in therapy since I was 15.

I was always very hesitant with cannabis and drugs in general, since I have a tendency to get addicted very easily. 

But since a half year I have been using cannabis and it had giving me more insights in my brain and thoughts than all the therapy and meds together. 
It has helped me tremendously and has made me a more calm person. 

I know I'm addicted to nicotine, that has never been a secret. But I don't feel the same about cannabis. 

Has anyone had similar experiences (or a negative experience)? I'm curious.

Edit. Maybe a totally new discussion idk

But 
why is it that the big farma can make ton of chemical meds with so much side effects and can earn so much money with it (+so many of these meds are also addictive), and somehow something natural (also with side effects, but in my opinion have less that prescription drugs) is illegal in so many countries?

I take a prescription drug that helps me sleep and it makes me foggy AF. I've taken it for half my life so far. If you are a little bit sane you know not to take it during the day or before you drive a car/bike/whatever. Same goes for weed.

My doctor prescribed me tradonal (a very addictive opium) for my menstruation cramps. I mean. How it that better?

50,"[trigger warning: drugs, self-harm] Becoming conscious of the person I am. Trying to carve a path forward through the feelings of shame. Curious if my thoughts resonate with anyone else. 27M","I thought I could live free of consequence. Carelessly dipping in and out of relationships, consuming copious amounts of weed and caffeine every day, not putting any real effort into anything that didn't result in immediate pleasure for myself. Treating others as disposable and becoming confused and crestfallen when I am treated the same. Devouring berry after berry, spitting out the seeds and the stems. I am evil, and I have been wearing a mask of innocence, naivety, and infantilism. Using my emotions to justify my actions in any way I can. I recognized this rottenness on LSD over a year ago, and still I made no conceivable effort to change. I just continued existing only in my shell, offering nothing to anyone, doing drugs daily, waiting for someone to reach in and save me.

And of course, someone finally did. But I became uncomfortable outside my shell. I began to thrash and spit poison. Existing outside of my shell requires contribution, it requires care for others, and upon this realization I did all I could to scurry back into my shell of effortless isolation, my shell of pointless existence. Selfishness under the guise of autonomy. 

Autonomy is not something I've ever earnestly sought. I wish to be alone, yes, but I wish to be cared for, to be waited on, and I do not wish to offer anything in return. I wish to use my time on this earth self-soothing, and receiving soothing from others, but I become hostile when I am asked to pay the price. 

Maybe I stopped taking adderall because it forced me to make these difficult realizations. It forced me, like psychadelics did, to confront and reckon with the person I've produced myself as, rather than the idea of myself that exists in my head.

They're confusing realizations to make. Becoming conscious of something I've been sweeping under the rug. I would rather assume I'm psychotic, I would rather assume that reality is false, and continue to live in my shell, my fantasy world which I deem to be reality because it is the one which soothes me the most. As a being conditioned to avoid pain, I will avoid reality if it is painful to witness. I will continue to choose false realities, stories constructed to reassure and self-soothe. I've continued so far down this path because I've continued to give myself the false reassurance that everything is okay, that it's all in my head, that no one is upset with me, that my actions could not possibly have consequences. I would rather accept that my feelings stem from madness than from the emptiness I've created for myself.

I cannot stress enough that what I'm experiencing right now is lucid reality. If I can accept, maintain, and live with this realization, can I change?

The challenge is that living with this realization is difficult, especially when I witness myself acting socially in a way which produces the conditions I would like to grow away from.

How do these behaviors manifest in social interactions, at a micro scale?

Not bidding for connection. Not making an effort to start conversation. I run through options of things to say in my head, and I end up creating a reason why every option would be weird to say out loud, would be prying, would be overinquisitive, would make me look like a fool. So I end up stuck in my head when I'm with others, consumed by an incomprehensible static spiral, only speaking based on an impulse that it is absolutely safe to do so—for example, repeating things others say like a parrot. If I witness someone else saying something, and it is received well, I can be sure that it is safe for me to say as well. An unwillingness to take risks in conversation, only a willingness to observe others taking risks, carefully following their path only after I can be sure that the path is safe, a way to get by socially without ever leaving my shell, without ever actually contributing anything of my own. 

I refuse to take risks as a self-preservation mechanism, but this is a misconception of how social interaction and learning works. What am I so concerned with with preserving? An existence which, through these mechanisms, grows more and more meaningless by the day? An existence which accepts my helplessness, an existence which can do nothing for itself other than wait to be saved? It becomes an existence not worth saving.

I need desire. I need drive. I need to understand completely that my actions do have consequences, that they do effect this world. For the past three years they've been mostly effecting it for the worse. I need a shift. I need to effect the world for the better. In my shell, the only possible way to do that is to end my existence. But if I can leave my shell? If I can abandon the self-preservation instinct? If I can abandon self-soothing, trading it entirely for the soothing of others? If I can find meaning in this existence from what I apply it to—from what I contribute myself to? Maybe I can convince myself I deserve to live.",1659889986.0,False,11,7,ohnoschizorat,None,wijtz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/wijtz8/trigger_warning_drugs_selfharm_becoming_conscious/

I have been thinking a lot about the past year and honestly it was hell.

Anyways i was dating a drug dealer and he was pretty addicted to drugs in general and i copped a lot of emotional and verbal abuse from him almost every day, he used to say he wished my family was dead and he would get mad at me over everything but then he would always make things seem better in the end and i was so attached i couldnt leave. After a year and a bit of these issues i told him and told my friends that if they couldnt involve me in things because i didnt want to do drugs i was going to leave and low and behold they didnt care and i picked up and moved a whole state away from my family and friends. Then after moving my nan passed away and things have judt gone downhill since then. I did meet my partner who i love but thats honestly the only good thing that came out of this year. Im so unwell at the moment. I have honestly blocked out so much from this year, when i look back at it i feel so detached from everything thats happened. I just dont know what to do at the moment, i have no friends here and my partner lives two hours away.

76,Is there anyone else out there like me?,"Diagnosed 6 months ago with BPD, CPTSD.

I read some of the comments on this group where people are saying they are gambling away lots of money, having unprotected sex with different people, getting into fights, getting arrested, moving job after job etc, having affairs, drinking, drugs and everything else.

Now I know these are mostly symptoms of BPD and in no way am i trying to judge at all, i'm just trying to understand myself better.

The below is me:

\- I don't take drugs (have in the past but don't now)

\- Don't drink - come from a family of alcoholics

\- Not promiscuous (however one would judge that)

\- Stable job / good wage

\- Not impulsive, i'm extremely analytical/massive over thinker

\- Don't gamble as have an addictive personality by default

\- Hate being around humans, human interaction stresses me out (not dependent)

However, I feel all of these feelings internally but don't act upon them, I am a walking shell of RAGE, I punch walls, self harm through an eating disorder, get obsessed with things (sometimes humans but rarely), terrible depressive episodes with daily thoughts of slitting my own throat, angry at the world and most of the people in it, black and white thinking, easy to split, mostly i internalize these thoughts, but I also lash out when alone, punch walls, scream, cry, shout but then there could be times where i am cold, removed, no empathy etc.

Again, please don't think i'm judging i'm NOT i'm just trying to work out who the [fu.ck](https://fu.ck) i am. I have very strong views on things and its hard to change my mind, very stubborn and hard headed.

And today I’m trying a new med he prescribed to me saying it’s not bad for the brain actually protects it whatever, but I still looked it up it’s called Quetiapine and even if it’s rare it can induce motor skill issues, concentration issues (reading and writing) short term, and long term use can induce cognitive and memory impairments.

I don’t know for sure, but I suspect my ex-boyfriend has BPD or some sort of personality disorder, and I’m having a hard time dealing with this break-up and am looking for clarifying answers. I’m not a psychiatrist, so obviously I shouldn’t diagnose, but I am an RN and work with psych patients on a regular basis. 

So, this person has a history of many years using drugs. They have been clean for a few years, but have regularly engaged in THC since. When he uses THC, he gets very paranoid. I know that he also has a history of “drug induced psychosis” for which he spent a month in a psych ward for (his words, not mine). But, this psychosis and paranoia continued off and on well past what I believed to be just “drug induced.” 

Frequently he was paranoid about people from his past, or paranoid that people at work were against him, or people on the street were looking at him strangely and judging him. When I would say, “what are you talking about?” he would tell me I wasn’t “reading the room.” I don’t believe he has hallucinations. There was also a lot of religious hyperfixation (twice), and hyperfixation on working out (once, but that has died down)

There was also a lot of hot and cold behavior with this person- one minute I was everything they wanted in a female, the next day they said they don’t like me. One day they told their parents about me and how serious we were, the next they would stonewall me and not talk for days. Early in our relationship he blocked me for 5 months and didn’t talk to me at all. He goes from 0-100 in terms of stress and aggression. Many times I felt like I was walking on eggshells with this person because I didn’t know if what I said would tip him off. 

Then there’s the job instability, lack of control with finances, and rash decision making based on emotions and not based on logical decision making. The final straw for me was another 0-100 behavior where he basically told me he never wants to see me again, but during that breakup was getting very aggressive and angry, and refused to look me in the eye and repelled when I tried to talk to him or touch him. I was afraid he was going to hit me. 

Does this sound like BPD? Is paranoia part of BPD? Why do people who have BPD push away the people who love and care for them? I really truly love this person, and am concerned for his well-being and safety. But, I’m also heartbroken.

97,My BPD wife left me 2 years ago after I was arrested over her drugs(meth in the car when I was stopped) and has claimed she wants a divorce but won't go file. Help me understand.,"2 years ago I was arrested after being stopped for speeding while we were on vacation in Florida.  During the stop the police searched the rental car and found my wife's meth in the console.  I was not aware it was even in the car. As a result, I went to prison for 18 months.  During my time in prison, my wife stops communicating with me amd starts running with a whole new crowd of people she met online. Has changed all her beliefs and bottomline who she has been for the last 25 years of our marriage. She is now claiming that our whole marriage of 25 years was horrible and toxic.  That she is so much happier now she is away from me.  When before all this happened she had attempted suicide months before my arrest bc she was worried I was about to leave her.  She has been saying for 2 years now that she wants a divorce but yet has not filed.  When I ask her why, I get reasons like I don't want you mad at me or there is to much tension between us.  She has rented her own place but yet she took all my personal stuff like clothes and things and will not give them to me now that I am out.  When I try to discuss all this with her to get my stuff back, to see my kids or discuss when she is going to file, she avoids me and won't talk to me at all.  Then weeks later I will get some message saying she has talked to an attorney amd is going to get it over with.   But it never happens.  She won't allow me to speak to my son or see him either.  I have tried to get her to meet me to sign legal seperation papers but she refuses.  So I am left wondering.  Is she not truly serious about the divorce and this is some form of punishment bc she feels I abandoned her when I went to prison?  That she can not accept that I went to prison bc of her mistake.  Or is she serious about this and just taking her sweet old time getting it done.  I mean if she really wanted it like she claims she has had every chance to file.  I even agreed that if she gave my personal property back we could do a no contest divorce to save all the money.  She has told me on several occassions that she is not involved or seeing anyone and that is the last thing she wants right now.  She will text me about the divorce after a few weeks of being silent amd when I stop messaging her and chasing her.  I can't help but feel she wants me to chase her.  Go beg her.  That she is not serious about ending a 25 year marriage but wants to punish me over going to jail.  Let me add that up until my arrest she had never worked a day in her life.  She is 40.  I worked, paid all the bills, took care of the house and kids.  She slept till 2pm every day then moved to the couch and watch TV while she colored in adult coloring books.  Always smoking pot amd using meth every few days.  So she had no responsiblity until I wasnt there to do it all anymore.  So what does everyone think.  Do I accept I have been devalued and split for good or is this her way to punish me and test me to see how much I love and want her.

100,"I had a bpd crisis today and fucked up after 5 days of euphoria and good feelings, so basically having a hard time rn","This week, Monday to Friday, I had a really good week, I was saying to everyone how good I was these days, I was so euphoric to just feel calm and having fun, talking a lot and feeling like my real personality was having control for once since a long time. Unfortunately I did drugs Thursday, just a bit, because I was feeling in total control and I told myself “just few lines, u deserve that”… I got lost in this euphoria and I did drugs until today’s afternoon, I had no sleep for +48h and no proper and real meal for 2days, so I fucked up what I planned for my weekend, I was just soooo high during all this time, so today all of this euphoria was completely destroyed and over and I started a crisis and a huge panic attack. Fortunately, my boyfriend was here and took care of me, I slept a bit until now and right now I’m cooking some nuddles and my bf is still with me to take care. 
These emotional roller coasters are here even when I don’t abuse drugs like that, that was just a big factor for the intensity of the high and low, and add some physical pain and weakness so I was basically extremely suffering mentally and physically at the same time.

I dont know where I wanted to take this, I just feel so bored and so lazy and nasty and stinky and unhealthy.

I hate myself for that fact. That’s why I hate the fact that booze is legal while drugs aren’t, I feel like it fucked my head so badly that I didn’t even have the chance to get mentally fucked by drugs like coke and xtc and whatever, since there was already no dopamine left to get from it and nothing left to break since everything was already broken. And I feel like I can’t tell anyone, which is also so annoying, whenever I tell people I started smoking at 11/12 they already don’t believe me, so why bother saying I started drinking wodka and whatever before I even smoked?

117,Getting over past mistakes of my partner,"So, I really like the girl I've been seriously dating for almost 3 years now.

I realized that the root of all issues we have is me not being able to trust her completely.
I always stalk, look for some sort of proof that she is not who she makes it look. 

Ive been insanely hurt in the past by a sociopath and a narcissist, who manipulated me, beat me up, gaslight me and lived double lives, full of lies about themselves and lies about me. My ex narcissist died of overdose. 

Now, she is not a perfect partner for me by all means. She has a baggade. And by that I mean, she used to be disrespectful to women, verbally abusing them, treating them like crap, she was an alcoholic and a very prolonged drug addict. She has been to rehab and did drugs for several years, she sold and she used. 

I'm terrified that it will come up in my relationship back again, I'm constantly feeling how I go from love to disgust and never feel safe. 
 Now, she is studying hard, hits the gym, gave up drinking and smoking cigarettes, never used drugs for 3 years and never had a hint of cheating or questioning her loyalty to me.
But I can't let go of all that information about her past. 
It triggers me to the point, I have nightmares in the middle of the night, like watching her being on drugs again, or beating me or doing something terrible. 
I can't get this out of my head, everything reminds me of things she has done in the past and everytime I remotely hear about such topics, I feel very scared and anxious.

I understand that I've lived with her under same rood for almost 3 years now and there has been no sign of her being like that again, but this haunts me real bad.

127,Anyone else get violent thoughts when angry?,"So ya I suffer from intrusive thoughts at times but they just kinda flow through, it's not that. It's like mainly if someone disrespects me il fantasize about killing them, like I want to do it, and or il fantasize about just killing bullies I'm general, like just destroying anyone who I see picking on the innocent. Once this emotion passes though I feel really shitty inside, like when I'm just in a normal mood I'm a kind person, I know that hurt people hurt people so I can look past disrespect/bully type people. As soon as I get mad though it goes out the window and I litterally love the thought of destroying them. On top of this when I'm angry it's like everything in my life changes, like my life purpose, I start to feel really impulsive and crazy, like I could go around robbing drug dealers just for the fun of it/anger release or just something messed up like that I've always hated hard drug dealers, they've messed up many I love. Then my reality comes crashing down when I calm down and I dont know who I am anymore and I feel disgusted/hopeless.

The truth is I protect the innocent, I've helped people escape death before, I really want to help this world but my emotion is like an out of control fire, so far I just self harm so I burn my self, still though I'm confused.

Also I have a almost constant battle of good vs bad in my head and where I fit in. Like an argument in my mind, but it is me, I think

I know people may think I'm disgusting or mabey I should kill myself and trust me I often consider that, it's like sometimes I think the only way to contain this fire is to let it burn me to ashes so it doesnt spread. I dno though I also have children who I love so much and I dont want to leave them in this cold world alone, I do think I bring happiness into their lives and others when I'm ""myself"" calm me vs angry me is two completely different  people, therapy doesnt seem to help much my rages are still intense as fuck, it feels like my head is on fire sometimes, and the voices go back and forth.",1703014346.0,False,4,4,Lopsided-Cherry-3188,None,18maas2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/18maas2/anyone_else_get_violent_thoughts_when_angry/

129,Do I have Borderline personality disorder?,"
I 22F am serieusly thinking I have a personality disorder, as a child I went to a psiquiatrist and I was not officially diagnosed with ADHD but I showed ADHD like symptons and I was obligated to test for a personality disorder as I was not considered ""normal"".

However I suspect that I have BPD as my behaviour is extremely unpredictable, impulsive, not thought through and also very destructive.

I have tried to get a official diagnosis but where I live mental health care is super expensive the medical professionals are not great either so I really feel stuck.

To give a indication of who I am as a person, I was bullied to the extreme from the time I entered school until I left and I never had any friends and stayed always alone, in general I was alwasy prone to have many conflicts with other people ( not that I want it to happen or that I am the one provocing but it always happens), my relationship history is pretty sad as I was abused and raped in my previous relationships and now that I am in a healthy one with a person that actually cares about me I feel like there are moment in which I love him so much and so intense and I do everything for him but the next moment what we have together just does not mean anything to me and I am not mean but I do respond him passive agressive while he did nothing to deserve that.

I want to point out that I am not in any way abusing him as I really love him and also care for him but I feel like my feelings towards him change by the day and it is really confusing for me.

I also want to point out that I struggle with drug addiction and smoking and that since I am with him I went from 40 sigarettes a day to a none smoker although I do smoke sometimes behind his back and even though he knows I take Ritalin or vyvanse I did snort it and take many doses without him knowing.

I have also always the urge to isolate myself and do illegal drugs, I have not bought illegal drugs behind his back but I am planning to.

I also have no idea who the f I actualy am and what I want in life, sometimes I want marriage and kids and then de next I just want to be totaly alone in my room and do drugs and be completely isolated from anyone.

I have constantly the urge to cut everyone off out of my life and I did cut my sister out without remorse for insulting my bf.

I feel like I am extremely instable and I have massive moodswings, I am really tired and when I do not feel strong emotions I dont feel anything at all and I also feel no satisfaction or feel any purpose in amything.

Sometimes I feel guilt for my bf being with me even though I do many things for him, I just cannot picture that I am stable or trustworthy in the long run and I also do not think I even want a relationship, I really do not know what I want or who I even am.

Due to my rape experience I was extremely traumatised sexually and I was unable to even have penetration let alone wanting to engage in sexual activities but when I became about 21 and separated from my narcissistic ex I began feeling atraction to men, women and even trans gender people but even that feeling that change so many times already, at the moment I identify as bi though as it is easier.

I also struggle with intense anger and agression and irritation etc.

Tbr I overdosed on MDMA and I was just indifferent if I would live or die and I still feel myself that way, I actually did regret not dying from the MDMA, fucked up I know but I guess I am afraid of engaging in things and then just not giving a shit if I live or die the next, I really do not think about my safety at all most of the time.

There are more things like my eating habits as I either eat insame amounts of food or eat nothing at all for about 10 days (while sober) but this pretty much sums up most things I struggle with and why I really think I am not normal and that there is more going on with my than just ADHD.

1 last thing, if it comes to money yea I just spend it impulsivly on things I dont need without even thinking and it is about a lot of money so yeah impulsivity and not thinking any action through.

If anyone might have a indication, does it seem I have BPD?

130,"I'm nervous about moving in with my partner who has BPD, Bipolar type 2 and Schizophrenia. ","I'm just looking around to find support from people who may understand. My partner of 10 months is a real Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde situation. She's a great partner who cares about me and my daughter and tries to work hard and get by but she also has episodes where she is yelling about wanting to die wanting me to die and will lose almost all impulse control. This has lead to her spending every cent on drugs and alcohol and makes the fact that she has gotten sober in her day to day really hard. She's scary when she ""switches"" and I'm not always sure how to respond. I hate the switched behavior but normally she makes up for it by being a consistently good partner. I just am not sure what to understand about this or what help I can get her for managing it. Especially when the episode subsides and she's spent all her money. When I move in is it safe to keep my wallet or car keeys unlocked. I really want to know what's the best way to manage these worst episodes and make sure we as a family are safe. Especially my daughter who she loves and is excellent with. 

Edit: she's also on medication and it helps. She's aware that she needs more help and maybe some different meds. These symptoms are predictable and occur 1 night every couple weeks.

131,I don‘t know what I should do,"I (M22) think I‘m in love and I don‘t know how I should feel about it. The thing is, everytime I‘m with her (F22), I just feel happy and I smile (I don‘t do that much normally), which is great, but I don‘t know if she has any feelings for me.
We both have Depression, BPD,ADHD and sometimes suicidal thoughts.

One thing that bothers me the most is, she cut herself bad last week and didn‘t want me to know about it and I really wonder why. My conclusion would be, that she maybe thinks I would see her in a different light now or that she didn‘t want to tell me, so I don‘t worry about her. 

And well, I’m really worried about her, not exactly for the cutting, more in general since she also uses a lot of alcohol and other drugs to compensate her emotions and I’m really scared that this could end her. 

From what I learned, she is a great person, always there for others, non discriminating. Just a big hearted person in a body and mind, that can‘t deal with anything at the moment, since her life is just really in shattered, which I think is one of the main reasons for all the drug abuse.

I really wish I just could be there for her and maybe show her, that life is sometimes actually alright, but since I found out about last week, she feels really silent to me and I fear that she will end the friendship, even before I can say anything. 

I’m just so scared and don‘t know what to do, on one hand I would really wanna show her, that she is loved and that people really care about her, on the other hand I fear that after saying this, she just stops the connection with me, which would also kill my only connection to a person I like.

And to add on top of my spending, my head is always like “it’ll nvr happen. What’s the point of saving when u know it’s nvr going to happen. U don’t even have anyone to go with. Ur anxiety is too bad, u will nvr manage to travel.” So these thoughts encourage me to spend because my mind convinced me it’ll nvr happen. I hate this damn disorder so much. I see so many people who have BPD with drug addiction & alcohol addiction but my addiction is spending & food. It ruins things for me & I want to be able to be normal. I want to travel. Enjoy the beauty of the world. I want to be free from all these damn restraints.

148,substance absuse issue,"today i had the most absurd and healthier epifany I've ever had.

history time:

In the worst days, I used to have an sleep medication addicion, it was so bad that I'd drug myself to sleep for 24h straight, drink alcohol and repeat almost everyday, bc I just hated myself so much.

in that period, I fucked up with my ex gf(not ex at the time) and I tried to kill myself bc I'd feel guilty and like a monster 24/7 (before her, I was getting over a 3 year long emotional dependency)

at that time, I was so bad that I was hallucinating, couldn't care for myself or any of my responsibilities.

I started therapy, started meds, slowly started to get better, got clean from alcohol, then stopped having hallucinations, got clean from not prescribed sleep meds, went off antipsychotics, started to actually live like a functional person. I still suffer from bpd, I still have the downs but honestly? being bpd is way much more manageable when you're not in an emotional dependency.

then I made a friend.

she's bipolar, and when I met her, she was in the worst depressive phase of her life. I helped her, talked to her, she got better and were still friends.

then she starts smoking weed, and I was like HELL YEA FREE WEED bc she'd buy it to smoke with me

then she got to cigarettes, wich I don't like, but let she smoke on the balcony, until I tried one, then two, then a whole box.

now everytime she comes to my house (every week for about 3-4 days) we smoke every day she's here, and that was nice and fine, I was on college break anyways.

now my classes started, she came here today, and despite knowing I have to study, I went and smoked with her anyways, we both had a bad trip, she slept through it but I couldn't. now she's at her gfs house, smoking there, and im at my house.

Im a very studious person, I love my field and my research, I am VERY passionate about everything I study, it was one of my motivations to get out of my rut.

As I was trying to study after the bad trip passed, while I was still dizzy, I realized:

>I don't need to go downhill with her just to feel accepted and loved

she's a great friend, she makes me feel good and loved, she cares for me and she's very nice when she's sober (wich she's not very often), and I have a very sweet spot when it comes to belonging.

but she's destroying her life.

she dropped out of college when she was doing real bad, and I dont judge her for it AT ALL, she NEEDED IT. But now? she's doing so much better, but shes self sabotaging, and make herself get way worse. She makes a lot of money from tiktok, so she doesn't do anything of her life, only abuse meds, use drugs, burn money with drugs, girls and other stuff.

she's self sabotaging so much man, it makes me worried about her.

but she can do whatever she wants to her life


BUT WHY THE HELL AM I FOLOWING HER?????????

anways, I realized this and the answer is that I hate myself and was in self destruction mode.

and then I realized again: If I hate myself, punishing me will only break me more, and I'll hate myself more. I need to get better to solve this problem.

TLDR: If u hate yourself, that's your minds sign to fucking CHANGE into smth you don't hate. self hate will only make u more broken, and you can't love yourself like that.",1710900973.0,False,1,0,magneticblood,None,1bj2ki4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1bj2ki4/substance_absuse_issue/

151,Smashed my bfs phone in bpd rage,"
My bf well now ex is my FP. We have a very toxic relationship. I didn’t want to be with him at first but I became very attached as a FP. So he would always do things to hurt me until I was too traumatised to leave.

He is always very emotionally violent and abusive. I feel like any time I speak to his friends I get my head filled up with more BS about him and it puts my bpd into over drive.

He’s cheated on me with a mother figure in my life, he’s always triangulating me with other women in his life and he’s been supplying me with free drugs and I’ve became a full fledged addict. 

The last time I seen him he started to annoy me and make horrible remarks. I was drunk and he kept doing it and looked at his phone. I threw the phone out his hand and there’s a crack on the screen and I smashed up plates because if I didn’t I would have smashed up my arms and legs. 

I have now blocked him but I am a mess and I’m withdrawing off drugs. I’ve always stayed really calm and harmed myself and he’s walked all over me for months. I finally had enough and that’s how my rage came out.

I feel guilt, shame and so many other emotions. He’s completely used me and trauma bonded me to him he claims he’s bpd but I feel he’s more narcissistic and the more I’m around him I feel I’m becoming so toxic and I don’t recognise myself.

I feel beyond shit and I’ve hit an all time low

I still have so much difficulty in marriage. My husband is a fantastic guy; he loves and cares for me very much. I am unable to act like a true partner. Our relationship is largely held up by him. My feelings, spirals, manic and depressive episodes take up so much space in our day to day. There is little to no space for his feelings and needs. 

I don’t know how to change this. I really want to be the partner he needs but I’m stuck not knowing how. Of course, the feelings of abandonment are at an all time high. I’m afraid he will get smart and leave me. If I were him, I would leave.. so I’m not sure why he’s still here.

170,how my old FP fucked me up and how splitting saved me,"(CW: DRUG ABUSE MENTION AND MENTION OF SH)
I want to share my personal experience, feel free to give me advices.
My old fp (let's call him R) was a complete liar. (Met him 14th of february)
He lied about where he lived, about his origins, he lied about being abused he lied about his relationship status (in reality he had a bf, but he like my ""borderline attention"" more). I had pics of him everywhere in my room, in my phone and diary, I always wrote love (more like obsession) letters. Anytime R ignored me I would track down his location, and magically show up there. R would provide heroine (I am 3 months and 16 days sober) and other types of drugs. Sure, it wasn't the first time that I would fuck myself up with drugs, but R forced me to take them. Sometimes R would cut himself in front of me (or send pics of fresh SH) saying that ""your borderline abuse did this"" (he even said he would k1ll me if I told him to stop). I never, not even once, did anything to him. I sure was toxic, but I was on drugs, drugs that HE provided and forced me to take. Speaking of SH, he would carve his initial on my wrist, because ""I love to see your SH scars they are so hot!"". Finally, the end of June arrived, and I splitted. I knew everything.

171,Split hard. Might have ruined my relationship.,"I think I may have fucked up my relationship beyond the breaking point and I don't know what to do.

For context: 

I have been with this person for almost 5 years. I have an engagement ring. I have not proposed yet, but we have discussed it. We also live together.

A couple of years ago I went down a massive fucking spiral due to drug addiction. It almost broke us, but I managed to break the addiction. 

Then earlier this year I lost my job. I was laid off suddenly, and lost my insurance immediately. I was left with out therapy until two months ago (after the probationary period for my new job was over). I started to spiral down again. 

My partner has several autoimmune diseases that seem to have been set off by a mix of past trauma and dealing with me during the drug-induced spiral. 

I've also just started some new medications. 

\---------

Today. 

I split, and I split hard. She was just trying to tell me that I was being passive aggressive and short with her all day (which was true, but it wasn't out of anger - it was out of me just being depressed). I tried to explain this to her, except by explain it to her, I really just started to yell that I wasn't mad at her and it was just cause I was so depressed, and it started an insane screaming match that resulted in me saying the following awful things.

1. You don't care about me.
2. You ruined my life.
3. You are the reason I want to kill myself. 
4. I will be dead if I stay with you.

She is, needless to say, extremely hurt and angry about this. I've spent the last couple hours trying various ways to communicate I didn't mean those things, but she doesn't believe me due to a problem I have with inconsistencies and not always being the most honest person. 

I don't feel like myself. I don't feel like this is me. The person that I've been for the last six months or so has been destroying my life and I'm so fucking done with it. I can't seem to snap out of it, but I don't know where to go. 

If we break up, I don't have a place to live to recover. I lose my job, I lose my insurance, I lose all of my support system. 

But more importantly, I lose her. I don't want to lose her. I don't want this fucking monster that seems to be inside of me to ruin the best thing that's ever happened to me. And she is the best thing that's ever happened to me. 

I don't know if it's possible to fix it at this point. But I will try literally anything at this point. ",1697932674.0,False,8,7,kilar277,None,17dg5ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/17dg5ct/split_hard_might_have_ruined_my_relationship/

We were talking about one of our neighbors and how the people who live there are always screaming at this little boy who lives there, which, that in and of itself was weird coming from him because they probably say the same thing about our house, but then he said:

*”Growing up in that house it’ll be a miracle if that boy doesn’t grow up to be a drug addict.”*

I’ve had a drug problem for 2 years and he’s never noticed or put the pieces together, but evidently he knows the signs, he has to because he just said that about someone else’s kid! Someone else’s kid going through the same thing that i did. 

Why can’t he pay attention to me like that? Why am i suffering so strongly practically handing him the pieces, but he’ll only notice when it’s someone else’s kid that he’s never even met?

190,Seeking ruin (contains some pretty f*cked up behaviors),"As a core symptom of BPD is this constant inner drive to seek out your self destruction, I was just wondering how this might affect others. 

There are countless ways to ruin and direct self harm is just one of those dysfunctional behaviors. Here is what I have done and still tend to do sometimes: 
When I was younger, I cut myself. I even attempted suicide a few times, but that was long ago. By now I am probably consuming way too much alcohol and other drugs, I engage in all kinds of addictive, self harming behaviors, eat a lot of fast food and drink unhealthy stuff like energy drinks. Sometimes I don't sleep for days. All of this while beeing absolutely aware, that I have a kidney disease, which will kill me eventually when going on like this. 
Additionally I tend to self isolate, spend weeks without ever leaving my appartment. During those times I often engage in extended doom scrolling, embracing my porn addiction by hour long gooning sessions and sometimes I just lie there on the couch or sit on the floor doing nothing at all while beeing lost in an apathic, semi comatose, delirious state that can last for hours, just staring at the walls or the ceiling. I think by now, I might have gone pretty far down the long road to ruin... But honestly, I don't care anymore. 

I was just wondering if others do better, worse or just differently. E.g. I knew a girl who had extensive amount of sexual intercourse with strangers, without protection or taking care of herself. She got raped several times already, but seems like she actively seeks out situations where this is likely to happen again. I don't know if she wants it to happen out of masochism, self hatred or something similar or if she just takes the risk and doesn't care. However she also tends to actively look for men that mistreat her, so she regularly ends up in toxic relationships, where she gets beaten or abused in other ways. She used to be a friend of mine. I tried to help, but all of this was invein. I gave up on her, a while ago. 

But there are many other ways I've seen and heard of how people try to destroy themselfes. A guy I know became criminal, ended up in jail multiple times (currently he is there again), has an extensive history of drug abuse, which ended up with heroin and generally tends to get his ass in trouble, whenever he can.
There is a girl I knew who manipulates and mistreats people until everyone hates her, and another girl I knew who repentently tried to literally set herself on fire until she finally succeded.
Compared to those people I get the feeling that I'm doing quite well again. 

But here's what I wanna know: Do you engage in self destruction one way or another? If so, how and where did it lead you by now? If not, how can you resist?",1713194489.0,False,5,2,Ya_average_Doomer,None,1c4ovt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1c4ovt8/seeking_ruin_contains_some_pretty_fcked_up/

I impulsively quit my job around 4/5 months ago, and I haven't been able to hold one down since. My finances are fucked. I struggle to pay for rent, or food, or transportation. I'm in love with my best friend who's not of the same sexual orientation, so my feelings can never be acknowledged. They (my best friend) asked me to hang out today, but they're with the person they've been seeing recently and I don't know if I can handle that right now. But I want to see them so desperately. They're all I ever think about. The only thing in the world I truly want.

Less than a month after I graduated high school, my mother started using meth. A lot of meth. She cheated on my father figure with the man she would smoke meth with. The two of them have been dating for several years now, and they have a baby together. Seeing as I was 18 and broke, I couldn't afford to get a place on my own, and there was no one in my life who had a place for me to stay, I had to move in with my drug addict mom and her drug addict boyfriend. He then lost his house (surprise, surprise) and we were homeless for about half a year. We eventually got a new place. Problem is, it's a one bedroom apartment. Five people live in it. My ""bedroom"" is a linen closet. It's 6ftX3ft, if even that. My ""bed"" is a blanket on the floor. I have no belongings here. There's no space for them. I wake up, scroll on my phone, smoke weed, and go to sleep. That's been my daily routine every day. I have no car or bike, and there's no public transportation here. Im trapped in this ""home"".

My moms boyfriend owes me thousands of dollars. He has zero intention of ever giving that money back. He forced me to max out my credit card, and ruined my credit. And today I come home and he's demanding I pay him $300 because my cat has ""damaged the apartment"". His dog literally ate the bathroom door.

I've been miserable and crying all day. I can't remember a time I've ever been ""well"". Spent a lot of time this afternoon thinking about if and how I should keep going. I know I should.

200,No empathy,"CW: Mentions of substances.

Does anyone else here struggle with a lack of, or having no empathy? I've been struggling with it since I got into my teens and I've noticed its kinda been getting ""worse"", in a weird sense. I'm self aware enough to notice it. I don't know if it's a BPD or ASD thing.

I'm really okay with using people for my own benefit, I only keep them around and treat them nicely cause they provide for me in some way. I'm also stealing, usually really small shit that no one cares for or notices cause I don't wanna get into trouble cause it's such a hassle, the thrill feels nice. I generally can't empathize or sympathize with people, I don't feel upset when my friends are upset or when something bad happens, but I can comfort people without there being any emotional attachment. I don't mind drugs or alcohol, I drink a lot and I wanna do drugs with little to no regard for my body.

I don't really have any strong morals or principles, I just do what aligns with my own compass. I don't care much for anyone else's and struggle to see peoples point of view most of the time. I know I sound like a complete piece of shit, and you're entitled to think so, but I wanna find the root cause of this. I also feel pretty numb and emotionally stunted most of the time. I still like my friends and care about them, so I'm not completely detached. I'd like other peoples experiences and input on what is going on in my head. I've gone through a lot of unprocessed trauma, much like everyone else.",1683481683.0,False,1,8,iloveeatingflesh,None,13axhpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/13axhpk/no_empathy/

I realize that's all a way to get out of reality. I don't like existing, and I want to stop existing.

209,Sometimes people leave for dumb reasons.,"CW: drug abuse, bad relationship, losing friends  


Hello everyone, I'm not a native speaker so there are probably some mistakes. 

My best friend blocked me a few days ago. I don't feel like the few people I told this can really  understand my pain, so I hope to find some uplifting words within this community. 

First of he's my ex boyfriend but this was four years ago. We had a rough relationship back then with hurting each other in different ways. I assume he has BPD too, at least a lot of symtoms. Beginning this year he got a new girlfriend, I was jealous at this time, but I finally got over it like two months ago. I'm free haha 

But to understand why he blocked me I need to tell the story about him and his gf. Their relationship isn't healthy. They're doing some dangerous drugs and keep selling it. She's homeless and his home looks like a mess, free living mice and it smells so damn horrible in there. When we met we both were were homeless and I'm still recovering from everything that happended during this time. We're the same age btw \[22\], but he didn't found the way out of drug abuse. I'm highly concerned about him but I have no clue how to help him. 

She disappears sometimes for days without telling him anything, one time I know she cheated on him. Last Thursday she did it again, left without to tell him anything. When he found her he got beaten up because ""he's the reason she's doing these drugs"". He's not, she did it for way longer. He called me at 2 am to come over. I did, but we didn't really talked, just sat together while he was doing his drugs and I was in my mind trying to ignore the depressing thing my best friend has become. 

Well two days ago he wrote to me he loves her and don't want another girl ever. I thought he was looking for support because she left him. I tried to comfort him (tbh I'm not good at words in those situations). But then he told me they're back together and he wants to marry her. And well, then he just blocked me. I didn't even had the chance to tell him he should think about this for a bit. I'm happy when he's happy with her, and I like her too. But this relationship isn't good. If he would still marry her after thinking about this I would have supported them. But no, he blocked me. I think she convinced him I would destroy their relationship because I want him as my boyfriend, I clearly don't, even if he suddenly become sober and change. I think this, because she once told me she was jealous for some time because of my past with him.

&#x200B;

It hurts a lot and I don't know what to do. He was one of the reasons I stayed in the town I'm living in (besides lack of money, no clue where to go and so on). I have some other ""friends"" here, but no one of them is really important to me. I feel so lost since this happened. 

I assume he will come back when she's leaving again, but I'm not sure if I want to be the kind of friend you can just block because of a small misunderstanding or because you can't take critic. I don't want to be the friend you can push away because you're high on drugs. I already accepted so many excuses in the past, I wasn't an angel too tbh. I'm not sure if I want this friendship anymore, on the other side he supported me during my hardest times. I feel guilty when I'm going to stop supporting him in case he comes back.

213,"Think I might have BPD, gonna go see a therapist soon","So I'm a 24 yo male and  last year I had a crazy drug induced psychosis that culminated in a moment of suicidal thoughts. I ended up seeing a doctor and met with him a few times and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder and drug induced psychosis. He prescribed me an anti depressant and advised me that I would likely need them throughout my life at the very least and possibly for the rest of my life. He also prescribed a small dose of an anti psychotic and advised me to take it for short period of time while I got sober from weed and booze and worked on my delusional and psychosis symptoms. Third time I saw him he also said that he thinks I have a perosnality disorder but that he would need to spend more time with me before making that diagnosis. Unfortunately I decided to stop seeing him because as soon as he said I had a perosnality disorder I got super triggered and defensive. I stopped taking the anti psychotic and because I got sober I was able to pretty much get out from under the psychosis symptoms. I still have some delusional moments here and there but I'm not like losing my mind at all anymore which is good. The anti depressants have been helping me so much with daily life. Since I started those I went from lazy and living at home smoking pot and doing drugs constantly to working full time, going to school and paying bills and taking care of my life. So now that some time has passed I realized I need to go see a therapist. I realized I can't run away from that perosnality disorder and I need to face it head on. I can be a bit paranoid sometimes but again that's only ever been when I'm on drugs and when I'm not partying and doing drugs Im good on that front. I don't think I'm a narcissist but I'm not sure if I'd meet the criteria for npd. I think I might be borderline.

I don't feel the emptiness or inability to have a solid image but everything else definitely felt accurate to my experiences.

It is extremely a weird situation to describe but I was in a relationship with this guy and he turned up to have another gf who has an STD. It happened 2 times within 2 years. Then I was convience he would change if I wouldn’t argue with him and it was going well at first but then I found out he was with her still. 

He was making me feel bad because I told all my family and friends what was going on + his mother. I’ve never been introduce to his family, she has. The way I find out is by his mother posting pictures of them on her facebook. 

No matter what he keeps lying and saying things. But it’s as if he flips a switch when I find out and stop contacting me and ghosts me completely. It’s driving me crazy. 

I went to his house last time I found out and told him to come downstairs and all of his family members seen. 

He’s making me feel crazy but i am the one he keeps taking advantage of. He told his mother i was a stalker even though we were in a whole relationship. 

He doesn’t even think i’m worth an explanation. he just drops me like nothing. 

Everyone is telling me to leave him alone but my feelings are genuine and it’s just fucked up when i’ve been loyal to him all this time. 

It really hurts and makes me feel disgusting and worthless. The fact that i spent 3 years bringing food to work for him and just doing the most for him, making time despite my busy schedule hurts. 

It feels like I am going insane and i’m scared i might hurt myself or do something to get me in trouble.
