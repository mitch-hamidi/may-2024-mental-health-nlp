0,Has anyone been diagnosed with BPD who is “functional” when diagnosed?,"Or does your life have to be a pervasive series of failures, washouts, suicide attempts and addictions at the time of diagnosis? 

One can meet all 9 of the criteria, but act functional to a level and still not be diagnosed. But it seems if you meet all 9 and you can’t function in society (keep a job, adult at all) then you get the diagnosis.

5,Diagnosed ,"I am still assessing whether my diagnosis is relevant or not/100% appropriate for me.

6,My therapist refuses to diagnose me,"I (22F) am meeting all the criteria for BPD (also my mom already have it) and in my heart I know I have it and its completely ruining my life, so I told my therapist about the symptoms, so that he can give me a diagnosis, or at least explore the possibility I have it, and yet he keeps saying that those things are normal. Like if I tell him about the emotional roller coaster I am experiencing everyday, he says that everyone has mood swings. When I talk about my very unstable sense of self, values and hobbies and the fact that it literally changes every day absorbing whatever is in the environment I'm in, he says ""trying to find yourself is normal."" When I say I'm struggling to control my emotions and struggling with binge eating and compulsive spendings, he says its just that my parents didn't teach me those things properly. Also he says that the brain isn't fully developed until 26 and that until then, the option of a personality disorder is completely excluded.

16,Recently Diagnosed,"I was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. My story goes back the last 8 months or so, and I just want to get it off my chest. I've never posted to reddit before, so bear with me.

For background, I am in the Navy and I was stationed on a ship in Japan. I was a respected member of the crew and very good at my job. I have always prided myself on being able to put emotion aside and do whatever needed to be done. I was reliable under pressure. But then I met someone. About a year after I reported to the ship, a new sailor arrived. We ended up spending a lot of time together and I fell absolutely head over heals. I've been in serious relationships before, but none can come close to how I felt with her. 

About 6 months into our relationship, I could feel her start to pull away. When I asked her about this, she said she had a lot going on with her family and was stressed with work. I accepted that answer and I did my best to be her rock through everything. I was there any time she needed someone and I did my best to make her feel loved. Eventually, I could feel my mental health start to decline. This wasn't uncommon for me. I've dealt with bouts of depression my entire life. I tried to confide in her and looked for her support as she sought out mine, as I thought a relationship was supposed to work.

About 6 months later (a year into our relationship) I found out she had cheated on me. I confronted her and there were tears shed, but at the end of it, I told her I was in love with her for the first time and she was relieved that I was willing to work on things. Two days later, she broke up with me. I cracked. I didn't understand and my mind plumeted. I fell into a lot of anxiety and my work began to suffer for it. It became increasingly difficult to function. 

A week after that, she was with someone else. This sent me completely over the edge. I felt like I was in a constant state of fight or flight. I couldn't sleep or eat. I lost 40 pounds in three months (we were at sea while all of this was happening so there was no escape from me). I had to watch her be with someone else and it drove me insane. My emotions were all over the place, going from rage, to pleading with her to change her mind, back to being angry. I began to have audible hallucinations, as well. I said some very hurtful things to her that I regret now. This was very new territory for me, as I have never lost control of myself in this manner. 

After two months of constant anxiety, I decided that I just couldn't deal with the storm of emotions and I tried to end everything. I did not succeed and was put on suicide watch for the remainder of the deployment. When we made port again, I went straight to inpatient care where I was flown back to the States for treatment. After I was released, I ended up living in a hotel for about three months until the paperwork for my transfer could go through. I also had to wait about three months for an opening to begin therapy. I fell into alcohol and other supstances to numb everything. I was going through a bottle of whiskey a day. At 4 months, I attempted again, and again did not succeed. I went back to inpatient where they diagnosed me with BPD and told me that I was going to be medically seperated from the Navy.

All this time, I sent emails to her, some of them were angry, and in others I pleaded with her to come back. I just wanted her to hold my hand as tightly as I held her. Everything fell apart so quickly and I feel like my entire life has been uprooted because I couldn't keep myself together. I gave that ship my blood sweat and tears and they just stuck me on a plane and washed their hands of me. She saw how poorly I was coping on a daily basis, but chose instead that I was no longer suitable to be in her life, that I clearly couldn't handle seeing her with someone else and that she never wanted to fix our relationship, so she cut me off and blocked me on all social media.

It's been about 8 months now and I am more stable, but still struggling. I have learned a lot about BPD and a lot of it makes sense and explains quite a bit of my behaviors and experiences all the way through childhood. Part of me wishes that she would talk to me again so I can explain to her what happened, not as an excuse, because now that I recognize what is wrong, I am actively trying to fix it. But then another part of me is saying she made her choice and clearly doesn't care, despite anything else she has said. (She did tell me several times that she never regretted loving me, but I never got a straight answer on her reasons for leaving). I feel as though I have been unraveled. I did send a final email to her explaining my diagnosis and apologizing for not respecting the boundaries she put in place. I also made it clear that I do not forgive her for her actions, but still care for her and wish her the best. I am still struggling with the storm in my head and every day I have to resist the urge not to give in to the torrent. I am ashamed of the way I reacted to everything before and after I left the ship and that all of this was triggered by one person. 

Sorry for the long post, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.",1708578071.0,False,8,4,Doctorc854,None,1awy1k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1awy1k4/recently_diagnosed/
17,Recently Diagnosed with BPD,"37/f here. I've had severe depression and some anxiety my whole life, as well as struggling with a crippling alcohol addiction. It has been recommended by my therapist (who I am not currently seeing at the moment - long story, but has to do with insurance) to enter into a DBT program. Part of the pre-requisite for the program is to have several sessions with a DBT therapist. 

BPD had never been brought up to me in the past, but during my last session the DBT therapist we read over the diagnosis criteria and I fit 8/9. I am taking this with grain of sand as he and I haven't been working together for that long, but it makes enough sense to me to look into it further.

Can anyone please recommend a good place to start? As with most mental disorders, I figure asking Dr. Google won't give me the most reliable results. Any websites with information or books would be a huge help, along with any tips you think might be helpful for someone just learning about her diagnosis.

20,*possible TW* has anyone else been diagnosed with an eating disorder along w/bpd? ,"If this isn’t allowed, my bad. I read the rules, i think it may be lol anyways I was diagnosed with bpd in 2021 when i was 28. About two weeks ago my psych diagnosed me with an eating disorder. She didn’t use a specific type of ED but said that’s what I’m dealing with. I’ve always coped with episodes and triggers with self harm and “rage spells” I call them where I literally destroy anything I can get my hands on even if it’s my own skin/body. And I’ve also always been very unkind to my body in regards to eating/self care. I’ve always loved food but despised eating it. I read on another post where one commenter said they can go days without eating and then they can also have days where that’s all they’ll do is binge/snack on food constantly. That’s kind of where I’m at. But tend to go without eating more often than not. I always feel like I don’t deserve to eat and when I do eat, even if it’s just some fruit or something otherwise healthy I immediately feel gross and regret it. I feel more in control, and I have more energy, I feel light and just overall better when I don’t eat. I drink coffee a lot at home and esp when I’m out to help curb the hunger so I don’t eat. I also will keep what I call “car candy” like suckers and such in my car so I’m not wanting to eat out. Does anyone else deal with this? It literally consumes my thoughts constantly and my therapist also said it’s common for people with bpd to have eating disorders. I never knew that before.

27,My Friend Was Recently Diagnosed,"I reconnected with an old close friend of mine last October. We occasionally hang out and text/call (not on a daily basis, but frequently). I was busy the last 2 months because of work so I wasn't talking to them as much during that time. I reached out at the beginning of this month to catch back up with them and offer support as they were heading into exam season. I'd noticed that their emotions and mental state seemed to fluctuate with more intensity but wasn't sure if it was stress or other factors so I would try and cheer them up or talk through things with them.

We had dinner together last night and they confided in me that their pcp diagnosed them with Quiet BPD. I've never met another individual with BPD or have much knowledge of it. They told me that they were prescribed medication and it did help when taken, but they do not want to rely on it in fear of getting addicted. Their pcp referred them to two general psychologists, but they haven't gone to any therapy sessions yet. They are in the process of looking for a therapist that specializes in BPD but have yet to find one.

I know the journey ahead of them is going to be a long and difficult one but I want to be able to offer support when needed. The only thing I am wary of is if they will become heavily dependent on me. They used to be very dependent on me before we stopped being friends. I stepped away because I felt that I wasn't taking care of myself and always putting them first. I think right now we have a good relationship where we are comfortable sharing personal thoughts and emotions with one another, but maintain certain boundaries at the same time.

I'd like to keep the relationship we have because it is most comfortable for me, but I wonder if it is comfortable for them? Am I being a bad friend if I want to keep our current boundaries up? Is there anything I can do to offer reassurance and support when they are going through low tides? Is there anything I should avoid mentioning in case it worsens their mental health?

28,"I'm new to this, and I need help-- spouse diagnosed with BPD","I love my wife dearly. We both believe that the other is the only person in the world that understands us. We are best friends. 

Recently my wife went on a trip for several months where she was isolated along with a small group of people as part of a job training program for a specific field. After she returned she disclosed that she had cheated on me, and shortly after that was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. 

This is the only kind of thing I cannot forgive, and yet... for her I want to. I think that maybe I don't really understand what it is to have BPD even after reading lists of symptoms. To be clear: I do believe she has it, and I do believe she's honest about everything. 

Somehow, during this trip she began to believe that I no longer loved her, was preparing to leave, and in a moment of extreme darkness and suicidal ideation, began drinking and had a sexual encounter with one of her coworkers. She said that soon after she realized what she had done, and that she had significantly damaged a relationship with someone who had been loyal and supportive to her. 

I had such a hard time understanding how she could feel this way until I decided I would stop trying to rationalize it, and just accept that the nature of this disorder simply has the ability to drive people to irrational conclusions because they can't trust their feelings sometimes. She took responsibility, admitted fault, and said she understood if I wanted to leave her. 

When my wife was single, she always coped with dark times by drinking, random hookups, or both. Now that she has relapsed into her old coping mechanisms, she feels like there is no hope for her and I have no idea how to help her or make her feel better. Frankly, it doesn't help that I was awful to be around for a month after discovering the infidelity. 

How do I give her hope and the strength to move forward when she wishes she was dead half the time? What do you say to someone when they say being alive is a painful, disappointing experience and they wish they could give up? 

And how do you forgive someone that has hurt you so badly, even knowing it was related to a disorder they cannot control? 

I'm sort of desperate for help, because writing about this personal stuff to Internet strangers feels pathetic somehow, but I need to understand this better and I need to do what I can to help. Tell me anything you think I should know, because I'll soak up anything you feel like telling me.

until very recently I had always been told, and believed myself, I had some kind of depression, but nothing more than that. However, therapy and antidepressants never helped me.

I read shortly afterwards that BPD is not curable, and the only thing one can do is to try and cope with the illness. 

This news has devastated me. I had always hoped I could be cured for good, preferably very soon. 
But now I don't know how to accept this, how I can still believe my life will be worth living. 
I guess I should give it a try either way but still... It all sounds so hopeless. Like I will never feel the relieve of finally being truly happy and content with life.

Well, in the past, i had a lot of problems, i felt that my father never loved me truly, he got divorced from my mother when i was 1yr old, and i moved with her in my grandparents house, after that, she didn't gave me a good amount of attention, the only one person i could trust was my aunt, she's a lovely person my mother isn't a bad person, but she did some bad choices on her life, and i try to accept that, but is hard, unfortunately, i started to feel more angry and suicidal. I tried to kill myself when i was 13yr old and at the same year my father passed away because of a disease he was fighting, i didn't knew how to react, i just felt strange, and after those years, i started to feel empty, angry and alone against people who i had stupid suspicions about them being bad friends, liars or even worse, i couldn't be around people, buy i always tried to control my emotions, it's hard.


In my 15s, I started to be more aggressive towards my friends, verbally, and unfortunately ended up losing a friendship, I just hope he's ok, i tried to find any help, but just in this year, finally got to understand what was my problem, i saw a psychiatrist, told her every important aspect of my problems, and she diagnosed me with BPD.




i will buy the recommended medication in the next week, and find therapy treatment too, those feelings just got worst from time to time, i had a friend, i had a crush on her, but she was already on a relationship when i came back, i was re-entering some social media, i felt that she wasn't truthful to me, and i started having intrusive thoughts towards her, when i talked about this, she said that she didn't had much time to talk with me, and she understood if i really decided to be away from her, well, now i just have reddit as a social media.

I just feel so much pain, anger, sadness and I'm not the person I wish I was. I'm just not a good person even though I try to.

70,I just got diagnosed,"Which is actually awesome, because it's just a formal comorbid diagnosis to the main one that I was hospitalized for (atypical bulimia).         

I wanted to have it on paper because I was struggling for the past year so much and my usual symptoms of borderline organization (which is just a psychogical term for a personality type, and not any type of diagnosis) got so much worse, I wasn't going to my doctor regularly and quit my meds cold turkey like 4 times, BUT GODDAMN I was making progress with self reflection, learning to recognize unhealthy behaviors and attachments, I did lose three people in the process (one long term friendship) and a shit ton of money but I am proud of myself for actually trying to get better in the last quarter.       

My doctor understood that I knew I wasn't a serious case and that I knew I wasn't ""sick enough"", she even told me with different criteria I may fit or not fit BPD and told me about future changes to the diagnostic criteria (which, frankly I knew about beforehand because I was playing my own psychiatrist many times) but she also understood that I just wanted recognition for actively trying to get better.

me and this guy have been talking and acting like we’re a couple when we’re not yet for the past couple months and i’ve grown to have an unhealthy attachment for him. i don’t remember how i helped it in my last long term relationship but it’s happening again really bad. i don’t know how to help it go away. i have no friends to rely on and to hangout with because ive focused only on him for so long that i don’t really talk to anyone else. everything he does or says determines how im feeling. he also has bpd (borderline personality disorder) so i don’t know how this future relationship is going to go. 

anyone know how to help with this unhealthy attachment? it’s causing me to have these uncontrollable emotions and thoughts towards him and to myself. 

he says he wants me to be attached but i know it’s really not good for me and my mental health and it makes it so when he doesn’t respond for a while i think of the worst and it makes things weird between us.

73,Any advice on getting diagnosed?,"Hey gang! I’ll try and keep this brief… so, I (33M) started following this community (and the BPD community) a couple of years ago as I started dating someone with BPD and I wanted to read people’s stories to try and help me understand a bit better (tbh, I had no knowledge of BPD beforehand and I wanted to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible). Anyways, the more I tried to learn to help me understand the person I was dating (who is now my best friend) the more I felt I was personally relating to some of the experiences, particularly when it comes to quiet BPD (where I seem to tick every box for each symptom). I guess I am curious about seeking a diagnosis but I don’t really know where to start, nor whether or not it is a good idea. A couple of my friends with BPD say that getting diagnosed was more harmful to them than helpful, though they were much younger at the time so maybe that played a part in how it negatively impacted them? I’m not sure, I feel a bit lost with it and I’m struggling to know what the best approach is. I know in the UK (where I’m from) that DBT is the go to treatment for it, so would seeking this therapy be a good idea without a diagnosis? Or do you think a diagnosis is important first. I’d be super grateful to anyone willing to throw in their two cents here, any advice or personal stories and experiences.

75,i just got officially diagnosed with borderline personality disorder,"it’s been such a long journey with trial and error honestly. i’ve dealt with such shit mental health professionals who refused to listen to me or take my symptoms seriously that i had to get help from a private psychologist that specialises in evaluating personality disorders. i live in sweden as well and here getting a diagnosis is free so the fact that i had to pay privately for a diagnosis i could’ve gotten for free had they just listened to me does feel bittersweet ngl..

at first he was a bit unsure and according to him he was conflicted between 3 personality disorders, that being anxious personality disorder, dependent personality disorder and borderline personality disorder.
so he read the criteria for all starting with anxious PD and i only related to like few minor things, same thing with dependent. 
when we went through BPD i checked every box, literally 9/9 of the criteria and he even mentioned that what i related to in anxious and dependent PD were overlapping symptoms of BPD, like inability to handle conflict and fear of abandonment, which makes sense.

but yeah i can finally say I AM DIAGNOSED WITH BPD without feeling like such an imposter cause for over half a year i’ve just had psychologist after psychologist telling me i show signs of bpd but no actual diagnosis.
it’s a shit disorder don’t get me wrong but it’s the only one that describes what i go through and describes me as a person in general.
like my friend who has BPD literally told me i need to get it checked out cause she 100% sees me having it. guess she was right :)

anyway i’m genuinely happy. i felt listened to FOR ONCE and now i actually feel like i belong somewhere finally !!

92,Best friend was diagnosed with used with Borderline 6 months ago-,"I love love love my bestie- but things have gotten more and more challenging and strained between us for the past year.

We live about 1000 miles away but have done so well keeping up with each other.

I recently went through a traumatic event- I felt like he didn’t show up for me. I went on leave from work because of this traumatic event.

When I said I was disappointed he didn’t make more of an effort to understand what I was going through (empathize I called it)- he was really cruel about something and I was already so low. I have never experienced that with him. For the last decade we have been friends.

It broke my heart. He gets mad m, like BIG MAD  and will block me, etc. then unblock. I feel like it’s toxic and childish to block a friend. It really stunned me the first time but that was 6 months ago. So this time he apologized after a couple weeks about not reaching out, etc. 

But then when I said how it was more how mean he was when I felt worse than I have ever felt- and I have had depression and anxiety since 1999 so I have felt really bad before. This was way worse. At first he completely denied saying what he said. Then admitted it was implied. But it wasn’t. He SAID what he said. 

It making me doubt my reality. Does he not remember? Why can’t he just admit he was wrong and say sorry? I don’t understand and really want to.

I feel like I cannot move forward with our 10 year friendship. My best friend I have ever had- unless he takes ownership. 

I feel guilty for exiting a 10 year friendship over something that sounds petty. But to intentionally hurt me when I have never felt worse (which he knew) is a lot.

I understand it is hard to admit when you are wrong. Does he genuinely believe he did not say what he said? I feel like I am being gaslit.

He is my person (I don’t have borderline so don’t mean FP) but I would do anything for him.
Anything except for be treated like that. But it feels like he isn’t understanding or doesn’t want to.

I’m so disappointed, sad about the possibility of this friendship ending.

To make matters worse- his partner whom he lives with heard us arguing on the phone and his partner called me to try to tell me to hang in there, don’t give up on my bestie.

Well my best friend found out we talked and called me screaming about betraying him. I didn’t even make the call. His partner told him that but he still sent me a brutal text this AM that I will not go into.

I really need help and advice because I am at a loss. I don’t have the most robust mental health so this has been very confusing for me. 

I feel like we have entered a whole other phase where truth is debatable and it’s making me question if it is mentally safe for me to continue this friendship.

I tried to understand borderline. Did some research back when he was diagnosed and I still don’t understand.

96,Newly diagnosed and it all makes sense,"Content warning for mention of sh, mention of neglect, and some general negativity. Mostly a vent post.

I've only been officially diagnosed for a year. Before my diagnosis, I was convinced I was broken. I'm only 20 and already I have experienced the ""stormy relationships"" more often than I'd like. Ever since I was tiny I've had a really rough relationship with my family. I know logically that they are trying their best, but I also know that their best often wasn't enough and their emotional neglect is part of why I am the way I am. From my first relationship in 8th grade I have experienced feeling out of control of my emotions, idolizing my partner one moment and despising them the next. Needing constant validation and touch one moment, then feeling like they were going to leave me and trying to push them away first. 
When I first met my current boyfriend, before we started dating, we watched ""Crazy Ex Girlfriend "" together. I remember crying when she was diagnosed and they went through the checklist... This was just before I heavily relapsed in sh and suicidal ideation and checked myself into the hospital for my own safety, where I was finally properly diagnosed.
I talked to my now-boyfriend about the diagnosis when I got out. I told him I felt crazy. He reassured me I wasn't, and reminded me that he had always said while we were watching the show that Rebecca (the character with BPD) wasn't crazy, she was just going through life without the tools to treat and manage her mental illness. He reminded me that I was still at the beginning of my journey and things would get easier.
Fast forward to now. In general, things are great. It feels like the only things that AREN'T great are my fault. I get insecure about the tiniest things. If he doesn't want to be touched, my brain doesn't let me reassure myself that it is just because his eczema is acting up, my brain immediately jumps to ""he is going to leave me."" I feel myself flip-flopping on my feelings for him, being unfair to him in the name of my own insecurities. Pushing him away and then desperately clinging to him. 
When he started dating me, he knew it would be hard and he promised me he wouldn't be scared off by my mental illness, that we would be in it together. He is keeping that promise, he helps me calm myself down and reassures me when I spiral. I'm worried that I'm going to push him away too hard one day and ruin it. And I'm afraid that BEING afraid of ruining it will ruin it. 
All my life I've been over emotional, couldn't keep friends, had shaky relationships with family and loved ones. It all makes sense through the lens of BPD. I've also heard so many people with BPD loved ones say how hard it is to love them. I've always felt alone, and now I fear I am hard to love.
I don't really know what the point of this post was. Maybe I just need someone who has gone through more of life with BPD to reassure me that it gets better. Maybe I need advice on how to have a better relationship with my boyfriend without letting my insecurities eat me. Maybe I just needed to vent. Whatever it was, thanks for reading. Maybe I just needed to be heard.",1705254512.0,False,1,0,pom3granatejuz,None,196lk5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/196lk5n/newly_diagnosed_and_it_all_makes_sense/
97,Officially Diagnosed Today,"It happened. After lots of sessions in therapy and discussing a lot of my personal life and relationships, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD and signed me up for DBT. My destructive and Chaotic relationships with online/irl friends were a red flag and I've suffered greatly on an emotional and mental level from people breaking things off or just perceived rejection that have caused disruption in my work and school life. The sort of emotional numbness I felt when I wasn't in a high/low mood seemed to be a big part of it as well, but the main thing is that I feel I finally have an answer for why I act and feel the way I do. 

But somehow, it feels shitty too. Like there's something fundamentally broken with me and no matter how hard I try I'm going to keep screwing myself over in my relationships and never be able to keep a stable one. I've lost so many friends and felt so many confusing and extreme things and while it's nice to have an answer, I can't help but feel distraught about this. 

There's no way for me to explain this to my parents. My sister and a couple of my friends are the one ones who know about my diagnosis but I'm terrified that one day my family will find out and think I'm making this up or lying. I've concealed these feelings for a long time but now that it's official there's no way I can explain it because they wouldn't understand at all. 

Worst of all, I can't help but have this dread that I'm never really going to get better and my life is going to consist of finding my ""best friend forever"" only to lose them. I've tried so hard to repair my relationships with the ones I love but it doesn't work and I hate that I feel angry or something towards them just because they don't accept it. I KNOW it's not my place to make them like me, but it feels almost physically painful in my body when I have a meltdown over it despite knowing it's their right.

107,"I was diagnosed, but I don't feel it's right.","First of all, I'm sorry if something is not well understood, I'm not a native speaker. And well, moving on with the story.

I was diagnosed when I was 20 years old. I reached my lowest point around that time with two suicide attempts. The self-harm is still permanent. I am from Chile, here there is the public and private system, in the private system the disorder does not enter in treatment so I was diagnosed when I was asking for help and left with nothing because I had no money for private. And leaving the private system to the public system was a condemnation.

The thing is that every time I have been able to, I have tried to verify the diagnosis because there are things I don't have. I don't feel that I have a fear of abandonment, I don't really have a distorted image of myself either (except for my self-concept, which is low) only these days I have had episodes of feeling that there are things in my body that are not mine. Yes I have anger, the urge to eat or spend money, anxiety, addictions, but.... I keep thinking it must be wrong, it's frustrating because every time I want to know if this is right to have the right treatment I'm told not to obsess about it, that it doesn't matter what the name is.

110,"Recently diagnosed, looking for connection/support/thoughts on subtypes and comorbidities","Helloooo, I posted in another BPD subreddit but didn't get any connection so figured I'd try here too. I was recently diagnosed with BPD, one day before my 30th birthday, a few weeks ago. In many ways this diagnosis has felt like a relief, because for years I was just being told I was depressed but I knew there was more to it - it was like the therapist equivalent of saying ""just drink more water!"" - so it felt really validating to hear that I have BPD. But it of course comes with some weight to it.

I'm curious about a couple of things right now and just wanting perspectives and thoughts on it. First of all, I'm curious about subtypes. I know there's 'quiet' and then a few others. I'd guess I'm the quiet type as I'm less explosive and more internally experiencing all the intensities, but I would love any resources (videos, articles, quizzes, podcasts, etc.) you guys know of to learn more about the different subtypes. It would feel particularly validating, I think, to learn more about the quiet type, since I think my BPD slipped under the radar for so long due to my being a ""high functioning,"" fairly social female.

Also, I wonder what other conditions you all have and how that impacts your BPD. For the last year or two, up until I started suspecting BPD a couple of months ago, I thought I had autism. Autism diagnoses feel much harder to get and not really a process I care to go through officially, but being on the autism spectrum has been beneficial for me to explore, too - or at least having sensory differences. I get frustrated really really easily when I feel I am doing things I don't want to be doing (which in the modern world is far too often) and that strikes me as more autistic than BPD but I'm not sure. I also get really impatient when things don't go my way, when things feel messy, slower than I want, etc. I benefit a lot from quiet, calm settings, sensory stuff like slime and light touch from others and having things to squeeze or bite. I also get overstimulated and shut down very very easily. Is the consensus that the two can just exist together - BPD and autism? Or that maybe one untreated can lead to the other?

I was recently (3 weeks ago) diagnosed with BPD. The more I've looked at it and my past behavior it definitely makes sense. I was hoping others might share their story of how long it took them to get diagnosed and what finally broke through.

We have been together for five years and she is upset it took me this long to find answers and get a diagnosis. 

I have been in therapy even previous to our relationship (now I see with an unqualified professional for BPD) and no one ever pointed out that I might have this diagnosis though she did point out there were problems with my behavior (anger outbursts, sexual impulsivity, constant need for reassurance) but I just never seemed to put 2 and 2 together. I feel like I've been trying my hardest, flailing, floundering, drowning, and could never understand what was going on or ""fix it"".

129,just got diagnosed and hoping for some support/advice/understanding,"heres a rant i guess but hopefully some folks can respond so i dont feel so alone or hopeless.

two years ago i was told ADHD and now as of a few weeks its also BPD. This is showed up more bc im in relationship and instead of running away, i actually want this one... Im searching since months for therapy and changing medication also, im searching to talk with BPD people and finding tools/books etc to help... I am so very desperately trying to get/be better

I still feel like im stuck, in loops, trying so hard to get help and all the while im suffering and tormented by the confusion i feel inside of me, im trying not to drive my relationship down and push my incredible partner away.

while i can sit here and say my partner is amazing... i can still feel this inner conflict. some days its all good and i can manage inner fears etc. some days i have panic attacks over perceived threat/fear of abandonment, some days i feel its toxic and i should leave, but truth is its only me being toxic really. i just feel like a monster. before i said there was a monster inside me and since the diagnosis i just feel that I AM the monster.  - i want him, i dont want him. he cant do enough, he does it wrong. i desire or fantasize  or mostly just think i want someone else and yet i die when theres an attractive  person on tv *let alone* being in public with 'threatening' women around.

if i imagine another relationship, like a solution to what feels like isnt working, i dont see how it could be better, because i know i have to work on my shit. my partner sometimes expresses his own struggles which may or may not be bc of my bpd but i always internalize as a 'youre not good enough' or some form of rejection and i can not control the way i feel which always perpetuates to the point where is supporting me and the spiral isalways so intense. i guess theres all this guilt and anger and confusion for myself but also for being 'selfish' and just fuck me idk what to do.

i havent felt so confused about myself and disconnected to myself, while i also see that for the last 8 years ive been isolated from people and kind of ignoring or not seeing shit. ive moved away from a lot of different self destructive behaviour but now i do this classic self harm stuff and almost daily feeling the suicidal tendencies.

sometimes i think i should leave him bc he deserves more than what i can give him, and that until ive worked on my stuff more, i shouldnt be with anyone... i see a lot online about how hard it can be having a relationship with someone like me, or that before im working on stuff i shouldnt be in a relationship but of course, the idea to leave is soooooo hard. 

everything is effected, i feel im bad at everything - confidence, love, sex, knowing myself, comparisons, stability, just everything. I always thought all my difficulties were related to trauma - being bullied heavily at school, told to look different by SO many people in different roles in life - partners, bosses, feeling like a burden to my mum, my father giving me drugs at 13, sexualising me with his friends, my mum putting me down, never enough, never enough, when enough - just a sexual object.

i feel my entire perception of world is so heavily skewed by trauma and apperently the ADHD and BPD inside me. and to know BPD is this *heavy serious 'disorder'* that haunts you for life.

130,I've been diagnosed a month ago. help!,"Hello. I'm 28 years old and I've been diagnosed with BPD a month ago I'm new to the BPD world and I'm trying to learn how to navigate and people to relate to so I don't feel so alone and helpless because I feel very misunderstood by those arround me I allways did. So I'm seeking help here.
I have a few questions for you guys.
I have this voice in my head that is not mine that me and my therapist decidee to call Jack, jack is very mean to me but wants me to be the best at any cost and if I don't comply to him I hurt myself. Yesterday I burnt myself with a cigarrrete and I don't recall doing it. Is this normal? This already happened to me in the past. I just remember feeling week and helpless and it's like this other part of me took over. I have a lot of crisis and thoughts about death. My mood shifts pretty easily and I'm easily triggered by people's comments about myself. I've been trying to live a healthier lifestyle like working out eating better but it doesn't seem to be enough to make the thoughts go away. I'm going to start working soon and I'm afraid something bad is going to happen and I won't have the tools to deal with it so any advices would be appreciated. In th past 12 years I have struggled a lot with drug and alcohol abuse now I'm 6 months sober and taking care of my BPD. I have a lot more to say. But maybe it's not important. And for all of you that are willing to write to me and even those o don't. You are loved and appreciated.

That information seriously would have came in handy 20+ years ago! I'm 46 and just now realizing my normal is not really normal. 🙃 

The meds are great. I have wayyyy more energy than I've ever had. I've been cleaning my house (it was always clean...now it's Spring Cleaned) and doing self-care. All the things I kept putting off. I feel like Kevin in Home Alone when he finally got his shit together and started shopping and taking care of the house. 😂

Anxiety is upped most every day, and I've completely lost my ability to multi-task. Zilch.

133,Recently diagnosed,"Hi all! 
I’ve recently been diagnosed with BPD. As I am learning more about it, I am also recognizing the unhealthy patterns in my behavior. There is one thing I am struggling with a lot, and that is being mistrustful of my s/o. I will look at him in the most negative light, and everything will just spiral. There’s a voice in my head saying to calm down and ignore it, but I can’t help but act on that thought and believe he’s totally deceiving me. And he doesn’t understand why im upset and wonders what he did wrong. We’ve been together 5 years and he proposed last year. I’ve told him plenty of times, even before my diagnosis, that he doesn’t have to stay because I know I’m very difficult to be with and I don’t even know what’s going on with me. But he continues to stay. And I continue to feel unworthy after every time I go off. I fear every time will be the time he decides he’s had enough of me. What are some tips when I go into an episode? Do I need time alone to distance myself? Should I just not give into these feelings when they arise? 

I am currently getting professional help, however im on a low income health insurance here in California and things do not move along as swiftly as I’d wish. The waiting for treatment has been so frustrating, and I’m literally crawling out of my skin when I have these episodes because I just want help and don’t want to keep damaging my life. So please let me know any tips related to my situation or related to BPD in general that you think would help me navigate a way towards healing.

135,Diagnosed today. Feels weird.,"Hello.  I'm 39, nonbinary, from the USA. I've always had depression and was diagnosed with ADD about 6 years ago. Recently, I've been getting lower and lower and I finally told my husband I needed help. I've just started an intensive outpatient program that lasts for about 4 weeks. I'm out on leave for my job while doing this program. This morning, I met with the psych NP and she immediately put it together. 

It is as relieving as it is scary. I don't know how to feel about this. But reading about the signs and browsing this sub has me certain it's correct. I thought I was alone in feeling so empty, always trying to find a feeling or meaning somewhere. It explains a lot. To think that I've felt this way and had these symptoms for nearly a decade and was just raw dogging through life...

137,32 F Newly diagnosed and in denial,"The past 3-4 years have been incredibly rough. COVID certainly didn’t help anything. I had a core friend group and had a major falling out with my FP. At the same time as this I had been fuck boi’d and left to pick up the pieces of falling for a narcissist. The falling out with my FP was related to this and made things all the worse. 

At the same time I was kicked out of my apartment and had to live alone for about 5 months. This is when I really started to lean into drugs, especially Xanax. Eventually I was doing all and any kind of drugs I could. Using alone at home and looking for any opportunity or excuse to go out and get fucked up. 

I finally decided that I HAD to move in with other people because I could see the path I was headed down. I moved in with 3 other girls and was doing better, but was still using a lot, this time in a ‘social’ setting. 

During this time, I somehow managed to graduate from nursing school and pass my licensing exam. How, I don’t know. The night before my exam, I was up doing blow. 

I had become very close with my roommate’s chihuahua. Less than a month after she moved out I got my own chi, which I was 💯 not ready for. Around this time was when I started Effexor. 

I got my first nursing job and it became my life. I was overworking just so I didn’t have to be at home. I needed the job to give me purpose and to stop me from going down that spiral. Anyways, I was terminated from that job and my next nursing job. My substance use had decreased a lot, but I was still really struggling. 

I went to work in the vaccination clinic for a year, which I did pretty well at. After it closed I was faced with returning to bedside. I had accepted 4 different jobs and withdrew my acceptance to all of them. After the 4th one I had a breakdown and told my roommate while sobbing uncontrollably that “I would rather die than go back to bedside.” 

Around this time, my FP moved out and bought a house in another city. I had also had a falling out with my other FP related to her substance use.  I went to hospitality where I continued to have interpersonal problems at work. Yet again, my job determined my self worth. I was overworking and just wanted to do well and didn’t want to be home because I didn’t really have anyone after my core group went their separate ways. 

After hospitality slowed down at the end of Summer, I knew I had to seek other work. I got a nursing/social work role and had started to get back some stability. I was making enough money to live and had health insurance and a pension. About 3 months in I started trying to taper off Effexor. I had really only stayed on it out of fear of the withdrawals. I got down to my last dose and had a mental breakdown on NYE. 

This is really where it started to fall apart and I knew I couldn’t come off meds then. We then started to explore PMDD as my anxiety, panic attacks and bouts of rage became to affect my interpersonal relationships again. I was put off work and started Zoloft, which was hellish. When I returned to work I had increased my dose and my symptoms were ten fold. I was put off work again and discontinued the meds. I felt amazing for about a month. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, my contract was not renewed and I no longer had employment or any stability (as is the pattern in my life). 

I was able to get employment insurance sickness benefits and have been on them for about 4 months now. About 2 months after stopping Zoloft, the depressive episodes returned. I had been adamant about not restarting meds, but after 3 months of depressive episodes, panic attacks and isolation, I knew I needed to start up meds again. 

I started Prozac about two weeks ago and so far things are okay. I received my diagnosis on Wednesday and went out and made some poor decisions, which I then felt the next day. 

When they told me my diagnosis, I felt like I was in denial. Even though I meet the criteria and when I look back on my life, the pattern is truly in line with BPD. I didn’t know what to expect in my assessment, but it wasn’t BPD. It really got me down. Why can’t I just be depressed? All the hope I had of getting back to a state of normalcy and stability has really lessened. Seeing things that say it takes YEARS to potential recover and that DBT programs are 6 months to a year long. 

I’m sure I’m just going through the stages of grief. I still kind of feel in denial, but definitely anger and sadness. That I have dealt with this my whole life and am just finding out now. It pains me to know that all this time I haven’t been able to reach my potential, but also validating because it shows me that I’m not lazy or incompetent or a bad person. 

And although I really was not in a good place to get a dog, he really did have such a positive impact on me and has really led to a change in priorities and lifestyle. I would say he is the biggest reason why I have stopped using substances, at least all the time. Now, it’s maybe 1-2x/month, if that. I very rarely stay out later than 3am because my sleep and ability to care for my pup are so much more important.

138,Just diagnosed with BPD/PTSD/depression,I got diagnosed with borderline yesterday and it’s feels like such a relief but still so terrifying. I have had a feeling for a while and have talked about it with my therapist before so I knew it was a big possibility for me so I wasn’t too surprised. I now am thinking about how the rest of my life is going to be living with this. I’m aware it is manageable through good habits and reminders to myself but I struggle a lot with regulating my emotions and was prescribed Zoloft too. I’m looking for words of encouragement/personal stories. I think I am choosing the narrative for myself that this isn’t a death sentence and just another journey that will inspire my art and life.

139,Diagnosed BPD - but am I?,"So I see people writing about relationships and BPD. My experience is I was raised by a dad who was a narcissist (didn’t realize this till 2 years ago) My first relationship at 16 was very abusive. This is where the cycle started for me. I’d leave and go back. Over and over again. My first love. I held onto him up till 4 years ago. We were never together again after he finally said it was done when I was 19. But we always kept in contact and were each other FP and ran to one another to talk about what was going on in life when things were hard (because I felt like he truly knew me because I lost who I was with him). I stopped that cycle 4 years ago. Than I had in between relationships through out my adult years that never had issues walking away from. My son dad I kept going back and forth but that was due to the fact I held a lot of weight on me about my son knowing his dad. It was not a healthy relationship with him. I have went no contact with him 4 years ago when my son said he wanted nothing to do with his dad. Than my twins dad. He truly was I felt my healthy love. I stayed in that relationship for 3 years straight till he cheated on me and as much as I loved him and wanted to make it work the cycle started again with me back and forth than the girls came into the picture a year after he cheated on me. They are going be 7 end of the year. I’ve done the back and forth with him but because I need help with the girls. I’ve changed since having them. I love them so much but my son got the better version of me as a mom. Than my last relationship, 4 years on and off. I loved how he was with my kids. He came into the girls lives when they were 1.5 years old. He was very abusive emotionally, mentally. I’m a shell off who I use to be since we spilt for good last October. Trust me I want to go back because in my mind I feel I was the happiest with him. But it was my girls that were the happiest. My son within 2 years because he is 16 now saw what he was doing to me. He was arrested last October and no contact order. When I say I’m a shell off who I use to be, I truly am. I’m depressed, I can’t feel or I feel too much. The girls dad is back around I didn’t want this but my girls were hurting so much emotionally that I needed to fix it for them. They still talk about my ex not as often as they use too but still do. They have their dad back in the picture. They aren’t the happy girls they use to be. I’m broken and don’t know how to fix myself. I’m trying so hard too. 

So when I was diagnosed with BPD it was 3 years ago when I was back with my ex. I do know that when I truly fall in love, I become extension of them. I pick up traits because in all honesty I’ve never ever felt like I knew who I was since I was a child. Always felt like a outcast when I’m around anyone even my own parents and sister. Till this day I’m like this. I will make sure I’m not in a group setting with friends or people because it’s just too much for me. One on one I’m better but I still feel out of place even with my best friends. 

So my question is, does this sound like BPD? I start to think I’m the issue because how could every man I been with end up messing me more up mentally, emotionally? Even the girls dad who I thought was my everything hurt me in the worse way imaginable. Every time I’m in a new relationship I always stress honesty, trust, and loyalty is big for me. Once any of those are broken I can never get it back. Which I can’t. As much as I want to feel that love with the girls dad like I use too I can’t. 

My friends who see me tell me Im happier alone, I do better on my own. But since meeting my ex and the abuse he put me through I don’t feel it. I feel like I’m struggling everyday. So I would run back. Now that I can’t (which is good I know not healthy and he wasn’t healthy but back of mind says maybe I was the issue) but now I’m left in this darkness trying to pick up the pieces of who I am. Or at least the person that was able to put a mask on and get through everyday life. 

Always needed a nap since I was teen. Never understood it. But now realize I was so overstimulated with getting through the morning I have to nap to get through the rest of the day. So I been looking a lot into Asperger’s. When diagnosed she said you don’t have the typical symptoms (self harming, anger issues) but clearly have abandonment issues. Thank you for taking time to read. My mind is always racing and I want to be who I was before I met my ex. Though I was already a mess from what the girls dad cheating on me when. So when I met my ex it wasn’t hard for him to work his way into my life till I was in a trauma bond relationship once again like my first love.",1693935855.0,False,1,0,twinmama82,None,16autsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/16autsy/diagnosed_bpd_but_am_i/

141,How do you handle conflicting diagnoses from different doctors?,"Ugh I've always thought my psychiatrist was kind of shit, he apparently worships Reagan and only spends like 10 minutes a session with me and keeps asking me if I'm religious and when am I going back to church??? (Left the church years ago having been raised in it and never looked back)

I hate that he doesn't advertise himself as Christian focused but does this to his patients. Anyway... my lovely psychiatrist left and I was handed over to a new one in her office a long time ago. And I feel too over it to care. He gives me my meds, I want to take them at this dose, he agrees whatever. 


But a legitimate psychologist (my therapist) who I find to be very sane, thoughtful, caring, and intelligent has recently diagnosed me with Borderline. I brought this to my psychiatrist of 10ish years and was met with the standard, ""you dont have that, those patients are very hard to deal with, you're very easy to deal with, you dont want that."" I think it's relevant that I'm relatively quiet, with high social anxiety, avoidant, and a  high-functioning variant of Borderline, meaning I can hold a steady full-time office job and a relationship of a couple years. But it's the first in my life longer than 3 months where he isn't abusive. And it really only started being functional after I restarted medications, which I've quit cold turkey several times in my life during depressive episodes.

Ok, first of all, as if I chose to have this disorder. Second, does having BPD necessitate breaking down in front of the psychiatrist and telling him to fucking hurt himself or something?? Does it necessitate a history of alcoholism or inpatient or cutting?  Has he spent more than ten minutes with me in a session in this whole year? Did he give any thought to the diagnosis other than to say ""well, I don't want to deal with another one, so I'm going to deny that's even possible and hope things stay the same""

Like wtf man is it because you think I have a dumb female therapist, Mr. Christian Republican know-it-all? She is a licensed psychologist who has been practicing for decades and has also treated borderlines before. Ofc, he didn't care to find that out, just hurried me out of his virtual office. Fucking making bank off being lazy and careless with patients like me. 

So idk if it's even a conflicting diagnosis, because he seemed not to even look into it or even want to acknowledge it. But my therapist has diagnosed me and we started going through DBT. 

I want to know if any of you have dealt with having your reality questioned by doctors, and how common it really is to be misdiagnosed with BPD, maybe if you really had something else going on. 

I've only heard that it's common to be misdiagnosed with bipolar, but in my case my mood swings are very clearly shorter and attributed to triggering events, I'm def not bipolar. My past diagnoses are complex PTSD, GAD, panic disorder with OCD features, and some mild depressive episodes. 

Anyway, what are your experiences with misdiagnoses?

I feel like I’ve lost my sense of self tbh but I’ve seen a lot of negative stigma with BPD but I can’t help but wonder like, am I this big manipulative fraud? I also have adhd so masking also comes to play but in the passed I’ve been told like ppl feel manipulated by me and maybe I have been super manipulative without meaning to?

143,Please Help. Diagnosed yesterday and so overwhelmed,"First, I’m really glad I found this community. My mind is blown, it feels unreal to relate to anything this much. I don’t feel so alone anymore. I’ll try to be concise, but it’s taken me the entire day to organize enough thoughts to make this post, sorry if I ramble. 

Basically, I have struggled with my mental health as long as I can remember. My childhood was kind of rough, I’ve experienced some trauma throughout my life, and I’ve always had a hard time coping, accepting, letting go. 

When I did start confronting my mental health in my teens, a few different doctors and counsellors speculated that I likely struggle with depression and anxiety. I was never diagnosed, just kind of accepted that they were probably right. 

I struggled for a long time with things that I now recognize as symptoms of BPD. With some support, I kind of just built my life around these struggles and learned to manage them enough to function most of the time. I always had at least some control.

It’s been a perpetually sad, cyclical, exhausting existence. I never felt like I had a choice, because if I did, I would not live it. I only stay alive and make an effort to keep my life together because I don’t want to hurt the people I love. Every goal I ever made was based on pleasing anyone but myself. I have always felt that, and resented it.

I’m at a very low point in my life that has caused me to spiral mentally. I’ve lost so much control over the past year without even noticing. I’m not managing or functioning at all, I know I should, I just can’t. I did things I never thought I would do. I’m aware but can’t stop. 

The last bout of depression was the worst I’ve ever had. It lasted so long, and I’m scared I won’t make it out of the next one. Since then, the last couple weeks, I feel like I lost my mind. So many emotions cycling so fast. Chest tight, stomach in knots, pure rage, feeling unsure of everything, like I never actually knew anything, just so many things.

I honestly thought that I was just having a hard time coping. I went to this psychiatrist expecting an antidepressant or something. I didn’t expect this. It’s given me some understanding, but mostly questions, and I feel terrified. I’m making myself physically sick with fear and I just can’t calm down.

145,Diagnosed today,"So today I was officially diagnosed with BPD, and I think a part of me is relieved but I honestly have no idea. 

My husband has bipolar disorder, so for the past few years we've been focusing a lot on improving his mental health. But recently I decided that I wanted to get actual help. I spent about 13 months getting high almost daily, on the weekends pretty much all day, which was something that I was actually hiding from my husband. Recently, I came clean which obviously hurt him a lot. He felt like me doing that meant that I couldn't be around him unless I was not sober, which is a valid way to feel. But when I did finally tell him I decided to stop all together, so I stopped smoking weed, and I stopped vaping. 

When I finally went to my doctor originally they wanted to diagnose me with depression. So we increased my meds, but the first intake appointment I had with the therapist she told me that I most likely had BPD, and today I was officially diagnosed. 

Logically I understand that if I continue treatment I can get better, but I don't know if I trust myself enough to do that. Which is why I think I'm confused about how I feel.

i just have a question about a couple of symptoms i haven't seen much of, wondering if others experience any of this.

the first is paranoia. for as long as i remember, every time i go for a walk/on a bus, etc. i think people in their cars or walking behind me are watching me. not following me, just watching me. sometimes i think they know what i'm thinking or can hear what i'm listening to in my headphones. it's not pleasant but im honestly almost used to it.

the other is this thing i do a lot and have done for as long as i remember as well. i guess as a kid it made more sense because i could write it off as just a kid having imaginary friends except that it never went away. i kind of go to this place in my head, usually with characters from tv shows, and kind of live this second life there. its a comforting thing but obviously not 'typical'.

He’s referring me on for DBT but the waiting list at the moment is over a year, but in the meantime it’s all come as a bit of a shock and I don’t know but I seem to be so overwhelmed by the whole thing.

I feel so lost. I don’t know how to describe it. I had doubts about having DPD, so I feel heard and to an extent relieved to have what I feel is an accurate diagnosis, but I also cried a lot after. Like ugly sobbed because I feel like this is a disorder so stigmatized, difficult, and misunderstood that I feel hopeless and that I’ll be f*cked up forever.

I feel like I’m spiralling down and going to act on things that I KNOW are bad simply because “well I’m borderline so it’s not my fault” - even though I don’t necessarily want to (eg, going back to a terrible ex boyfriend for casual hook ups - this man is genuinely evil but I still can’t help but wish that he love me).

I have only told 2 people I have BPD. They are coworkers who I consider my friends, and I know they love and care for me. My friends from high school will never know - one had a friend years ago who was diagnosed with BPD and they had said awful things about her. I don’t want that to happen to me.

The psychiatrist wasn’t to informative on what was BPD besides pushing me into a group which I’m so busy to even attend and even if I wasn’t busy I don’t want to attend a in person session. They gave me 0 information on how to help and handle Bpd and basically told me to follow up with my doctor who I’m unable to see for months. This then made me do a deep dive into what BPD is and that made me even more anxious, more so about my relationship but more due to us having on and off fighting which put me in the “am i the problem” thought. I’ve struggled with self harm, depression, anxiety, and constant mood swings all my life.

156,I'm struggling. Work trouble. Newly diagnosed.,"Having trouble at work. New girl decided she doesn't like me, but everyone lives the new girl. New girl perpetuates a lot of microaggressions towards me. Nothing I can really call out. Just little slights. Things she can pass off as misunderstandings. And if I get upset or get irritated or show any negative reaction to her, she then plays the victim and complains. Ya'll! She literally tattlled on me for rolling my eyes at her. I knew the exact conversation it was. I dont remember rolling my eyes, but I probably did, tbh. I remember being irritated as fuck with her because she got really snotty with me over something and even though she was wrong, I didn't want to go back and forth, so I just did it myself. I got called into the office and talked to about rolling my eyes at her! They told me that I need to be more mindful of my facial expressions (keep in mind, I also have RBF, especially when I disassociate.) And that I have to miss minimize my body language because it's too intimidating and I'm too animated. I left work and cried, gard, full on sobbing for the entire night. I was inconsolable. My partner felt so helpless, just trying to convince that I am enough. I'm just so tired of being too much, and not enough at the same time. And now I just feel so unwelcome at work. Before she came, at each of my quarterly reviews, I was literally told I was the perfect employee. I'd ask for constructive feedback or what I needed to improve on and they'd tell me nothing. Don't change anything. Everyone loves you and looks up to you. You're a leader. And now it I'd weekly meetings telling me what I did to offend the new girl and what I need to change about my personality. My Dr (boss)still keeps telling me I'm the smartest and best technician he has ever worked with. But I just feel like everyone hates me now. And I'm terrified that at any moment I'm gonna be fired for having the wrong facial expression or for using the wrong tone of voice when I'm feeling stressed. I'm in the middle of starting treatment for my bipolar 2 and ADHD. I've been unknowingly in treatment for borderline as my therapist has been doing multiple behavioral therapies with me, including DBT and CBT as she had settled on my BPD diagnosis awhile ago, and was just waiting on my ADHD assessment and was trying to decide between cyclothymia bipolar and BP2 to out them all together and present them to me. I NEED my insurance because I need treatment. I'm afraid for myself without it. I'm just fucking drowning. And it's not just the work stuff, but that certainly triggers a lot of downward spirals. Every time I experience one of her microaggressions, it just devastates me. Just makes me feel unwelcome, unlikable. It triggers so much self hate and I just feel like the world is better off without me. And then I get more angry at myself for being so pathetic that I'm 47 years old and still crying about mean girls that don't like me. Wtf is wrong with me? I tell myself just go in do your job, go home. You don't need friends. But then eveyone is laughing and joking, dicking around, and I'm just doing my job with my head down. Always annoyed that I'm always the only one working while they fuck around. Eveytime I hear they whisper or laugh, I'm paranoid they are talking about me. I know they probably aren't and I'm not that special, but I still feel like it. (Again, wtf is wrong with me???) And I feel like an outsider, outcast. I've always been the outcast. I've never fit on anywhere. And I just really do not like myself.

159,My GP refers to diagnoses as 'labels',"It's really starting to bother me.  :(  I spoke with her a couple of years ago when life was a dark pit of endless misery to tell her I felt I had BPD; she was immediately dismissive because I've had the same bf for multible years most of the time she's known me.  I'm really grateful the psychiatrist I spoke with, the first thing she did in her doctor's note for my chart was validate me, she didn't have to do that.  BPD is painful af, I've tried everything short of street drugs and joining a cult to try to cope with it.  Receiving treatment for the wide range of symptoms I experience piecemeal has never worked; the pieces only started coming together for me with a comprehensive diagnostics-based strategy.

Now the same problem continues to impede what I feel is appropriate care.  I'm now fairly certain I have ASD and severe ADHD.  The ADHD in particular is hard because I only ever feel comfortable and able to keep pace when I'm jacked up on coffee, or massively stoned on a nice indica.  Don't I deserve some autonomy and quality of life in these areas as well?  What does she think it's like to live with uncontrolled ADHD, or to be deep enough on the spectrum I use going nonverbal as a coping mechanism??

I've been gaslit and manipulated from a young age, which has made me oversensitive to being dismissed.  And the reason I keep pushing the issue is because it's bothering me a lot and want help, but instead being blown off as just normal because I like coffee so much.  Fuck OFF with that attitude, I've been getting blackout drunk since I was 16, and drank and still drink coffee like it's a way of life, yet my concerns should just be blown off????

I'm trying really hard not to split on her or the whole pursuit of appropriate care.  Sometimes I think of her as a helpful medical dog who knows the way to the clinic to help me not get angry while working with her office in general.  I really think I would experience a profound benefit from one of the extended release ADHD meds.

i've had suspicions for years that i'm borderline and nobody believed me and my parents wouldn't pay for a psychiatric evaluation because i had one at 7 (diagnosed with ADHD) and one at 13 (diagnosed with anxiety) and was diagnosed with bipolar 1 at 16 after a manic episode and that was enough (i'm 21 btw). the only reason i got another eval is because i'm currently in long term treatment for substance abuse and trauma and it was HEAVILY recommended by my team.

how do i cope with emdr while also coping with all these fuckin issues while also coping with not using drugs (10 months clean btw) while also holding a job and maintaining the relationships i've built here???? i really love and adore the friends i've made here and obviously my long term partner but i struggle so much with keeping people around and trusting much of anyone :/",1706890126.0,False,1,0,motheraangel,None,1ah781c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1ah781c/recently_diagnosed_with_bpd_and_also_started_emdr/

180,Female (24) just diagnosed with BPD and struggling.,"I’ve recently got an official diagnosis of BPD (I’ve speculated this was the case for quite awhile but didn’t want to label myself). 

Last year, I went through a very intense break-up that I still haven’t fully let go. I did go a little “crazy” about it. For him, it seemed very easy to get over the loss but to me it was devastating. We debated off-and-on getting back together for about 6 months post break-up, only to cut all contact by this past Christmas. He seemed completely unbothered by this so suddenly, when directly prior to cutting contact, he’d still been telling me he loved me and missed me. 

This “abandonment” has sent me into a spiral and I’ve made a few mistakes like drunk calling too often, sending a few angry texts that go answered… I eventually knew I had to block him for my own sanity because I couldn’t let it go, I always desperately wanted him to reach out again so things could be ok. I couldn’t understand why I felt as strongly as I did, why it hurt so much, when the break-up itself was my idea and all while knowing we aren’t exactly the most compatible people… until finally getting my diagnosis. 

I’ve always been severely triggered by all break-ups, to the point of suicide, even if the initial decision was my idea. Now all I want to do is reach out to him and let him know that something was actually wrong so he knows I’m not just “crazy.” I know, deep down, though it doesn’t matter. He doesn’t want to have any type of relationship with me and I’m desperately trying to respect that boundary. Also, if he could dismiss my concerning behaviour, as simply “craziness” after two and a half years of a very stable and mature relationship (my symptoms remain very dormant until a perceived abandonment/break-up so this wasn’t really an issue until AFTER), living together, everything… that’s not someone who really cared in the first place. Logically, I know this, but I still want his attention back.

How can you get rid of obsessive thoughts like this without closure? My mind keeps thinking it can’t be over because I’d “feel” it. I have an idea of who he is, what our relationship was, and I can’t stop thinking about how there’s no way it’s fully over because of the idea of him I’ve created in my head, even though it doesn’t line up with reality. My brain thinks now if I could justify to him why the bad things happened at the end and show him that I’m working on these issues, he might understand and come back. I don’t want to think this way, I know it’s probably not the case, and I don’t want to keep hurting myself by holding out hope.

182,"22M, recently Diagnosed. Crippling abandonment anxiety keeps ruining my relationships","I don't know how to deal with this. I've had this for a long time probably but was just diagnosed and I'm hoping to maybe have someone understand

I fall in love, way too fast.

And idk about others but for me the thing is sex just feels like the genuine best thing on earth. That and cuddling with a female lover. Because of the overwhelming euphoria of feeling loved. 

But I'm so addicted to that feeling I smuther my partners in love , so fast they end up pushing me away, which makes me have crazy anxiety and worse than death level fear that they'll just leave again and I'll have no one to hold and love. 

And I seem to attract bpd women too, which makes them in need of a strong man, further having them leave once they realise all I crave is the bliss of feeling at peace when I wake up with someone next to me in the morning. 

The need for someone is so strong is makes me suicidal when it's been over a week. 

Without a parter I feel empty. 


I've had a fair amount of sexual partners for my age I beleive (8) and it's always amazing my favorite part of it is almost just seeing how much they love what I , and only I am doing to them and it's why it feels so special.  I'm not afraid to say I'm an amazing lover under the sheets, but my insanely high Laredo often rooted by insecurity always drives the ones I truly fall for away. 

To be honest without it life doesent feel worth living to me and that feels so wrong. I want to be able to be happy without having a crippling addiction to love, not just sex but the feeling of love in general. If I'm not intimate in some way, even spooning.

191,"Newly Diagnosed, Un/Re-learning Everything, At My Wit's End","I really don't know where to begin or how to continue after that or how to end this.

In 2013, I was diagnosed with Severe Depression and Anxiety ^(TM).

In 2015, I was diagnosed with Manic Depressive Disorder aka Bipolar Disorder.  
For nearly ten years, I was treating Bipolar with a fucked up cocktail of medications--both doctor and self-prescribed. 

\*a la ""My Favorite Things""\* 

*Zoloft and Celexa and Paxil, no not that one /*   
*How about Wellbutrin? Maybe that will be fun? /*   
*Throw in some Abilify, that would probably help /*  
*Oh, those all made you want to kill yourself?*

Operating for the past few years under the impression that I was treating Bipolar Disorder, something never quite fit. I was in and out of therapy the entire time, treating things that happened over the previous two weeks, but seeing very few results that were indicative that progress was being made. 

In 2021, we tried one more assortment of medication. I took the bullshit genetic test of my liver enzymes and found that the Wellbutrin & Abilify were basically tic tacs I'd been taking for 5 years. My liver didn't even register them. So we tried LamoTRIgine & Lurasidone. And still I felt...fine? But couldn't tell you if that was a result of the medication or just my own cognition and tools to take better care of myself.

2015 I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.

I now ask you to jump forward to July 2023. I've moved. To a **huge** city--especially compared to home. I LOVE my new home. LOVE it.  
In the first month of my move, I meet a woman and fall for her madly.  
We start going steady in March.  
In July, right before I start therapy again, for the first time since the move, she breaks it off.  
It ruins me for a minute.

And then I go to therapy. I explain how I'm Bipolar, how I received the diagnosis in 2015, the onslaught of prescriptions and holistic and other ""treatments"" I've tried. And then explain my relationships with people, my ex being the most prevalent and recent, but my other exes. And my other friends, limited in the new city, but plentiful back home.

And I begin to explain that relationships are hard for me, regardless of capacity. Things that I'm attributing to Bipolar Disorder. And my therapist is listening to me. For what feels like the first time since I started going to therapy, I *feel* listened to. I feel *heard.* 

I'm going on and on about this part of the relationship with ex A or that part with friend B or how I wish I was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ but I also don't feel I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I'm just tired of wanting \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ or whatever.

""You said you have bipolar, u/HamletsScottishKing? 'Cuz it sounds more similar to BPD.""

And everything clicked. Things lined up that hadn't ever lined up before. 

*Things made sense.*

And for that, I'm immensely grateful.

BUT

I AM SO TIRED OF STRUGGLING TO MAKE MEANINGFUL, FULFILLING CONNECTIONS.

I AM SO TIRED OF WANTING SO BADLY TO BE LOVED BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO TRUST THAT THE PERSON WHO LOVES ME MEANS IT.

I am sick of feeling like I'm unloveable; like no matter what I do, the things I actively work to correct in my line of thinking aren't going to change. That I'm unworthy of it.

I hate the volatility I experience in my self-image that spills into how I connect with other people.   
I want to feel *safe* and know that I'm not driving people away or being a burden or that things are okay without having to be told *constantly.* 

I want to stop making things harder for other people.  
I want to stop making things harder for myself.

I just want so desperately to have love and give love and feel love and be love.

I just want a person to see me and all my scrapes and bruises and cracks and flaws and know that I am trying so hard to be better. I want to feel like I'm making progress.

I want to be held by the one who knows me and wants to hold me and will tell me they love me every time I need them to.

I want all of that. 

And I also want to not want all of that as badly as I do and to be just as content with myself and my own company. I want to be more than okay by myself.

The psychiatrist who diagnosed me told me to read ""I Hate You, Don't Leave Me"" which paints a very negative picture of my future. It implies that I am doomed to fall into a never ending cycle of abusive relationships. It compares people with BPD to blood sucking parasites that suck the life out of everyone around them. It makes it sound as though you had to have a really traumatic and abusive upbringing in order to develop BPD (I had a good child hood and loving parents although I was bullied almost everyday for 14 years in school). It says people with BPD are incapable of retaining happy memories (I have lots). There's more but you get the idea, it's a horrible book that was honestly traumatic to read. I have since gotten a different book/workbook that is much more positive and encouraging and I'm feeling much better about my diagnosis but I still can't get what I read out of my head.

i was never told anything other than anxiety, depression, and adhd; not even if they were considering different diagnoses (i’m thinking they might have been considering bipolar disorder but not trying to diagnose that since i was under 18). i definitely was exhibiting many signs of borderline that i can now recognize with confidence; i even vividly remember first experiencing the feeling of emptiness at age 7.
now after seeing my current psychiatrist, they initially thought bipolar as well, but at my most recent visit i asked to be screened more closely as that diagnosis did not sit right with me (as in all the symptoms i had been researching for months did not line up with the way my brain works lmao) but now here we are with the diagnosis of BPD, it feels the most accurate and i was honestly relieved because after years of not feeling anything was accurate and knowing there was something else going on, treatment and working on managing my symptoms feels so much more doable. thank you if you made it this far 🙂",1649772075.0,False,7,5,jessedarko,None,u1ztco,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/u1ztco/anyone_else_experience_vague_unclear_diagnoses/

It wasn’t until recently that I had an episode (after years of being “normal” and maturing) that I realized perhaps my acting out is not normal. I am feeling all sort of emotions, but starting to accept the possibility of being diagnosed. I am looking forward to an official diagnose, but I do not know how receptive I am to treatment. I was told I might be put on medication for it. I personally feel like I am at a normal in my life right now and need therapy instead of medication.

I'm in the low lately and I've just enter a mental health clinic to be hospitalized.

Talking about that BPD suspicion with the psychiatrist of the clinic, he told me I should take a rorschach test in order to get fully diagnosed. 

I was quite astonished by this. Not only rorschach test has been proven to be quite BS in general, but using it as a tool to diagnose BPD seems completely crazy.

Have you ever heard of it? Did you get diagnosed this way? Am I wrong to think it's BS ?

208,"Wife with BPD (diagnosed, treatment not regular) will it get any better?"," 

I have been married for close to a year now (no kids) and recently my wife was diagnosed with BPD (by two separate psychiatrists). She is in denial about her condition, and blames me for taking her to the wrong doctors and influencing them. I have known that she may have BPD for almost 9 months now, and have put in a lot of time and energy to understand her condition and not do things that will trigger her (but unknowingly i have triggered her many times). She has shown all the text book traits, attempted to kill herself( 5 times, excluding the times she only expressed desire to end her life) physically assaulted me when i was asleep. Accused me of having an affair, that i don't care enough about her, i demean her emotions and feelings etc. She threatened to divorce and end the relationship almost every 2 weeks (i tried to help her deal with these thoughts of constant abandonment but they still persist)

She became aware of her condition only 2 months ago she is on Anti-psychotics and anti-depressants. I do no know if she will ever be able to accept her condition. In the past month the intensities of fights and arguments have reduced, and she is slowly getting back to a routine, i still have to follow-up for everything her meds, bills etc. She still hasn't started regular therapy (took me 6 months to convince her that she needed professional help, and she needed to be hospitalized for attempted suicide, that is when she was first diagnosed with BPD.

So now that she is aware of her condition (albeit reluctantly) she is trying to set things right. But i feel completely drained and still walk on eggshells around her. I am thinking of divorce, but also hoping that she will be able to find some sense of normalcy. I still do love her, but do not think i have the energy to deal with more of the mood swings and accusations.

I was recently diagnosed with borderline (last week) and I honestly haven't had this much hope in a long time. I was diagnosed with major depression, generalized anxiety, PTSD 14 years ago and have been in (cbt) therapy and on medication since then. 

In February I lost all hope of learning a normal life and was so ready to give up because I have had this treatment for so long and nothing is changing. I am fighting for my life everyday and that is so exhausting I couldn't imagine continuing my life like that forever. I started seeing a holistic doctor in hopes of finding something physically wrong that could explain the symptoms. Then I began looking into other diagnosis that might fit my symptoms in hopes the treatment plans would better suite me. Once I started talking to my psychiatrist about BPD all the symptoms started to align. I am on a new treatment plan which includes starting dbt and a new med. This new diagnosis has given me hope that there is help to not fight daily to live. It will be a long road ahead for sure, but at least something is giving me hope.",1623004425.0,False,11,13,gsofa93,None,nts9z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/nts9z2/recently_diagnosed/

I am beyond gutted and broken by all of this I feel I am screaming and no one hears/ sees me. I don’t know what to do.... I was also really surprised with my diagnosis, I understand I have had a very traumatic life up to 21yrs (now) but I had no idea I had a mental illness. Any advice would be so appreciated I feel so alone in this world right now. The only person I have is my boyfriend but due to work he is living abroad for 1yr plus and covid I can’t see him. He tries so hard to understand what I’m going through but I feel no one gets it and this unbearable pain inside me. I have struggled with addiction in the past and after finding out I don’t have any help I’ve gone back to using. I’m so disappointed in myself but I can’t live with this pain it’s too much bare. Group therapy can’t be useful I told them I’m not comfortable to share my past with strangers and they just said pay for private then even though I’m on a typical salary of a 21 year old so that obviously not going to happen.

214,Just diagnosed,"So I have only recently been diagnosed (once last week, and affirmed again this week), but I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for a while since A. One of my older sisters has BPD as well and B. I’ve had concerns for myself for about the past 2 years or so. 

I don’t know, I guess it felt important to reach out to fellow people with BPD and sort of embrace it now that I know it’s probably the case that I do have it. (It’s still early to tell for sure, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I actually have Dependent or Obsessive instead of Borderline; concerns of bipolar are also there)
I had to cut out the aforementioned sister since she’s been emotionally abusive to me my whole life and has her own mental health to sort out, and until she does, it’s damaging to my own to tolerate her behavior toward me. So it’s not like I really have many people with BPD in my life. 

If anyone is ever interested, I’ve written quite a few songs and poems about my experiences and love life, and as time went on, realized some of it was lining up pretty closely to BPD and similar experiences. (One song was even written during the time I first got really concerned I had it and was undiagnosed and treated for it)

I’m on mood stabilizers now and they seem to be helping. I used to be on antidepressants for 3 years awhile back, but got off of them around late/mid 2019.

It went away like 20 minutes later.... Has anyone else experienced this???

219,Bipolar. CPTSD and just diagnosed with borderline. Any helpful suggestions?,"Hey guys. So I've been fucking melting the fuck down in the last couple of years. I finally found some really good Healthcare workers that are dedicated to helping me. I was just diagnosed with borderline, and have been diagnosed with bipolar in the past (with genetic testing backing bipolar), and CPTSD. I would like any useful advice!! I will write a bit about my symptoms here, skipping the trauma that led here! 

The last couple years I've been tailspinning in fear of abandonment and honestly lost touch with reality. I self harmed alot, from cutting to bludgeoning and actually broke my own arm, and also rebroke it worse and now I have permanently lost about 20% function in it. I starved myself so much that I lost 140lb and became anemic with a vitamin D deficiency. I have tendonitis from my foot to my jaw. I've been a fucking MESS.

I am on prazosin as an adrenaline blocker and it's really helpful and has made me feel human again. I've been hesitant to start on mood stabilizers because before, it made the world feel so GRAY. No highs or lows. It was terrifying! My husband says that's likely how life feels dull relative to my extreme highs I experience. My brother confirms this is reported in psychology. Have any of you experienced this, or have useful insight?

Another measure I've taken that's helped is I deleted social media from my phone. I was constantly distracting myself from real feelings by posting slutty pics and then having mixed sexy and trauma dumpy conversations with people where I was using it to gage my self worth. Since cutting out social media I've been lonely but able to enjoy things again.

221,How can BPD be properly diagnosed?,"Honestly, I really need this. I need BPD or any other Personality Disorders. The more the better. I'm not saying I want it. I'm not a lunatic. But I have destroyed so many relationships. My closest friend now hates me. We've had a friendship that was pretty broken some time ago(Broken thanks to what I did), and then it somehow got better, but just a day after it got better, she talked about her liking this other guy more than me and how she's more comfortable with him than me(She's not my girlfriend by the way. Just a special female friend), I got so stressed out, then I got empty, then I had immense regret, then I got angry and resented her, then I missed her, then I feel happy, then I feel at peace, then I feel neutral, then I feel whatever happened never existed and that I just came into existence, then I started questioning how good of a human I am and how good of a friend I am(I mean, has she never realized how much I cared for her? How much fun we've had together. How much good I've done for her? I keep buying her food without asking for anything in return. I keep asking for her reassurance that she won't prefer other guys over me, she said she doesn't do that, she doesn't compare male coworkers and that we're all the same. And she knows I have issues of her having fun with other guys yet she just outright explicitly said she enjoys him more than me, more comfortable than him with me, more fun with him than me. I think she even knows I have a mental disorder but the only thing she can tell me is buck up and deal with the fact that she's gonna spend a lot more time with him than me, and even if it's just the 2 of us, she's always gonna prefer the other guy over me) ... and those thoughts just keeping changing between themselves, like they're taking turns, and all this stress led me to do another thing and now she hates me. Absolutely hates me. Extremely worse than the first time I broke it. Now how I see her and how I see myself are violently switching even more. I want her to love me as much I love her. I want her to hate me as much I hate her. I want to fix our friendship. I want to destroy her life. I want neither and only want to improve myself to show that I'm superior to her and the boy she likes more than me. These feelings keep switching. That girl was my Coworker, our boss knows about this, but now I think the boss is starting to get fed up because I don't know anything anymore... (There's a lot more to this story by the way)

Please, I need to know if I have BPD or any mental illnesses. Because there's so much chaos going around between me and the ones I love. All this chaos, it has to be because of a serious disorder or I'm just naturally a terrible person. Something like this, how often do you hear about a boy liking a girl(Not romantic) and then getting jealous even when she's just smiling at another guy when the guy says something, or when she's talking with a smile on her face to this married guy? This is ridiculous! I'm no expert in the history of mankind since Adam & Eve, but how often does a story like this pop up in a gossip or a casual conversation? Seriously, so much chaos, I'm actually thinking about committing suicide. And not suicide as in, suicide of stress, but suicide because of how big the hole in my heart is. First time in my life I see suicide as a legitimate exit. And then I keep punch my wall out of anger  and my knuckles are swollen. I need a disorder. Either I'm unwell or I'm evil, and I'd rather it be the former.

So how do I find out? How do I get diagnosed with a mental illness? What type of doctors are involved? If I find a doctor, do I just go ""Hey, Doctor. I think I have [Insert Mental Illness]. Test me,"" or do I just start telling my story? What if there's another disorder? What if I have a disorder and it's disorder that I've never heard of? Then I hear BPD is hard to be diagnosed because it overlaps with other mental illnesses, but what if it actually is BPD? What if I have BPD but the doctor says I don't? Do I just go to another doctor?

————————————————————————


Hi, I’m 22 (F) and a lot of my friends had pointed out the fact I might have bpd and I kinda agree.
From what I’ve read it seems logical. 

I’m seeing a psychiatrist and I think I’m going to talk about it with her tomorrow. Here’s something I’ve wrote and I’ll read it to her.


« When we met for the first time you asked me “why are you coming to see me?” And I simply replied that I didn't know. 

Actually, yes, I know. I just panicked. The reason why I came the first time and why I am still here today is that I am firmly convinced that there is something wrong with me.

Let me explain. I have a joyful personality, sincerely outgoing and willing to share. I like people. But on the other hand I have this anger and this emptiness.

Both are intense, suffocating, deafening.
It's like wanting to scream with all your strength until it tear your vocal cords out, but all into the void, without even succeeding.

No one hears you, you exhaust yourself but it does nothing except accentuate those sensations, even if it seemed almost unthinkable that they could take up more space.

It’s playing a role. All the time. And sometimes you forget before, without really knowing why, it hits you in the face.

You are there, but you are not. It's empty or it's too full. It's nothing or it's all. And when it's good, it's just the commercial break. Then it starts again.

I have obsessions with things but it generally passes quickly because I can't do it and I get discouraged very quickly then it comes back in phases when I have the feeling that I can do anything.

It's the same with people. I have people who obsess me. It can be sick. It's sick. I would do anything until they no longer obsessed me.

Until I tell myself that I am a bad person, that I take advantage of them, that they do not deserve what they are going through and are going to go through because of me.

Indifference, silence, anger, irritability. It is often sudden. But I can't bear to put up with them, when they reciprocate (maybe I think they fake it and I can't stand the lie, or I want to avoid the pain of abandonment so I provokes in order to be able to control it). It’s as if I had been pretending all along, as if I wore my mask so well that I had convinced myself.

In the end, I can never figure out if I'm lying so well that I'm deceiving myself or if I was sincerely obsessed with them to the point of seeing only the positive, to the point of wanting to give up everything for them, to the point to change myself for them.

I have this irrepressible need for validation when a person obsesses me, they HAVE to love me, I HAVE to make them love me. I think about this person and let them monopolize my attention. And it’s often when it becomes “healthy” and stable that I lose interest.

I'm hurtful, brutally honest sometimes. Often, I don't think about the consequences of my actions or my words because if I think about it too much I feel ashamed. Ashamed of myself, of what I am.

Why am I so selfish? Why make them love me and then abandon them. I rarely have the courage to bake up with them and I make myself hateful so that they leave on their own.

I feel like I'm irresistible and yet I never believe them when they say they love me. “It will pass, it always does.”

The more time passes and the more emotionally fragile I feel, the less I am able to ignore this part of me, this bad part. I no longer feel good with my partner but he gives me security, he loves me, he loves me too much. And I don't love him enough. It's always unbalanced.

I don't want him anymore but I want others attention sometimes. I don't cheat on him physically but verbally. I flirt with strangers on chats sometimes. I’m ashamed to admit it. But yeah, it happens sometimes.

I also reconnected with an ex as friends but, yeah, is it obvious to say she still has a thing for me ? I won’t lie, I did though about returning the thing. I was scared to cheat on my boyfriend too. It’s a thing he’ll never forgive me (understandable). Thankfully I didn’t lose all self respect apparently because a distanced myself from her even if I liked her company and she almost became a favourite person.

The attraction to my partner seems dead. He became my best friend again, and that's it. I talked about it with him and he made it clear, he’s won’t break up so I have to break up with him if I don’t love him anymore. I think I'm afraid of making a mistake, of misinterpreting my emotions, as if I couldn't trust myself 100% because I know I'm self-sabotaging.

I’m also scared to lose my best friend as I breakup with him. I also love his family. It’s not easy like all my previous relationships (it’s also my first long term relationship, they lasted a month or two for most of them, the longest lasted 6 months before this one. Approximately a year and a half) 

We also talked a lot about “what if” few months ago. And the what if I die happened. It was clear. If I die his love life ends with me. He would no longer touch love, he would no longer love.
I can't understand this and it worries me. Why stop because of the loss of someone, why be so closed off? Why pretend to love so much.

I don't know if I envy him for that or if I pity him. But one thing is certain, I hate being the subject of this tragedy.

I am full of contradictions. I want passionate love without hurting, I want to be the obsession but not be a prisoner of it, I want everything and I want nothing. I know and I don't know. 

In fact, I believe that stability scares me because everything in me is black or white, one extreme or an other. Stability must be the biggest unknown in my life and I'm starting to think, for a long time, that unfortunately it risks to never really being part of my journey.

I am impulsive, I tend to make compulsive purchases, to change something in myself physically to feel good. Always more when things are bad. Feels bad.

I fear ending up alone, but sometimes there is only solitude to relieve me.

I feel terribly empty and at the same time too full.

My emotions are out of control sometimes. Often. I have the feeling of having my hand on it and then it cracks and in the end I realize that I never controlled it, they just didn't have the fuel to unleash themselves again.

I know that I have a strong tendency towards self-sabotage. Through sex, porn, alcohol, drugs, sometimes willful endangerment. Each time it’s so I don’t find myself alone with my thoughts, so I can feel alive and “normal”.

I've had suicidal thoughts since I was about 8 years old, as long as I remember. Jumping out of my window, drowning, stabbing myself, etc. I have thought about it often, very often. From the age of 11 it became daily. Became worse after my first relationship at 15 (he sexually abused me, manipulated me and of course, raped me).

I sometimes dissociate, experience derealization. I'm far from understanding everything that's happening to me and why, but I'm trying and I hope you’ll help me understand.»",1710797775.0,False,0,2,Plastic-Inside-8535,None,1bi2q6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1bi2q6c/im_not_diagnosed_but_a_lot_of_people_are_saying_i/
227,"For anyone who suspected they had bpd and then went and got diagnosed, what were your next steps when you were in this position?","I’m so sorry if this type of posting isn’t allowed. To start off, I (21) am very nervous writing this post. I am not sure if I have bpd, and I am not asking readers to evaluate whether I have it, but more so how should I go about being evaluated professionally?

The background shortened is that I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, EDNOS, and ADHD. I’ve self harmed since about 5 and have felt depressed since about 9, although my mom refused to get me real help until I really started to act out more than before at around 14. I’ve I then got diagnosed with social anxiety at around 16, and then my eating disorder at around 17.

I guess I’m concerned because my ex has bpd and I found myself relating to her and in the past I had had a friend that really believed that I have it. I’ve been confused because all this time I thought I had a huge severe rejection wound, but the way I act on it has always seemed so extreme in comparison to others with social anxiety. For years I’ve just walked around feeling disgusting and crazy and like there’s something else wrong but I don’t know what. I’m wondering who I should bring all of this up to? I’m thinking a psychologist/psychiatrist so they can direct me to what kind of therapy or even medication I should try whether it turns out I have it or not? And do I go into my life story or the highlights? Feel absolutely free to ask me about more details about the symptoms that I thought matched my ex, I just didn’t want to go into detail because it’s a lot ",1714602893.0,False,3,6,bitchcraftmra,None,1chzh37,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1chzh37/for_anyone_who_suspected_they_had_bpd_and_then/
