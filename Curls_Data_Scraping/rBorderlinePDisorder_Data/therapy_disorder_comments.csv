0,"DBT completely saved my life.

I was horrifically suicidal and hopeless. I had reached a breaking point where I truly believed that my existence was a mistake and I wasn’t suited for the world. Completely incapable of lasting peace or happiness. Broken. 

I did 1 year of DBT skills training back in 2015 and then continued to meet with my individual DB therapist over the years (I still meet with her.)

I’m now happily married. I work a full time job. I’m a mom to a pet pig and a 4 month old baby. I have healthy friendships. I’m stable! And actually love my life. 

DBT really did help me build my life worth living. While I definitely still have BPD, i technically no longer meet diagnosable criteria because my symptoms have been that resolved.",eternalxsun,1c4u22i
1,"DBT helped me very much. My BPD symptoms manifested as transient psychosis and extreme dissociation due to overwhelming emotions mostly triggered by disruptions in relationships, especially relationships with people I saw as my parental figures. 

Lot of inner child work. Lot of analogies and acronyms (such as SUDS: subjective units of distress). Lots of worksheets. Lots of psychological terms. Lots of simple breakdowns of emotions that I never learned how to process as a child. You might feel like a kid at school again, but it makes sense; this stuff is supposed to be simple, so that when we are dysregulated, it can pop into our minds and help us.

I still dissociate/experience paranoia a lot and I feel that dissociated part of me, the inner child, lashes out when I have too many emotions or when I feel stress (perceived or not) in relationships with people I get attached to, but I use my coping tools, I take gabapentin/lithium, and I rely on a strong spiritual foundation for hope and peace. I am able to recognize emotions so I am not as distressed as I was over a year ago when I ended up in the psych ward. I did go to the hospital two months ago because my friend died and my inner child wouldn't stop screaming, but I was able to recognize the severity of my distress and go to a safe space where I could wait for my inner child and my emotions to calm down. Would have been impossible without DBT.  

  
I suggest you remain as honest as possible. When you are dysregulated, try to remember that the people triggering you by asking you difficult questions are only there to help you. It is painful but the only way out is through.",beattiebpd,1c4u22i
2,"I did DBT for a year, I found it was very helpful and a really positive comfortable environment. Highly recommend",flxwrsnc,1c4u22i
3,"I did an IOP, it was a 7 week program and was DBT based! I was really struggling with depression and it truly saved my life and provided so many skills <3",sophia_rayne,1c4u22i
4,"I second what somebody already wrote: completely saved and helped me turn my life around. Change of career, family constellation, dealing with my impulses and emotions.. The last you can do is give it a shot, you have nothing to lose. If your therapist suggested it, they probably think you could benefit from it.",merry_february,1c4u22i
0,"DBT was really helpful for me, however i found partial hospital/intensive outpatients that taught it to often be more helpful than DBT weekly therapy, but both are still good. 

If its too expensive there are also workbooks, and youfeellikeshit.com is an interactive self care guide that has a lot in common with some basic DBT concepts. 

One caveat i will say with DBT is that it sometimes felt a bit like, too focused on immediate behaviors, which is good for the group therapy setting and for giving you a sense of grip on your emotions/actions, but can feel like, really rough if you are in active traumatic situations

Like i sometimes felt like it reinforced a bit that my *behaviors* were the problem and  it didnt explore much about *why* they were there beyond my own doing (ex. there's a lot of emphasis on saying things the right way as a way to affect how interpersonal interactions go--imo there should be emphasis on, safety first and recognize when issues have nothing to do with your use of skills but theirs)

Which, it can be empowering in that way, bc it gives you tools to control your own reactions to things are not in your control, I learned to keep myself more safe when everything was shit--but also sometimes it kept me in abusive situations bc i would be so focused on managing my crises that i didnt know i should have also been looking at constant crises as alarm bells that something is wrong externally lol.

Just keep in mind it's limited, and know it can be very empowering and give you more control and acceptance and safer coping skills, and also like yeah its focused on your reactions more than setting, and remember safety first always

But with that in mind, it really can be super super helpful and i credit it with why im free of most kinds of self harm for many years now! and am generally better at treating people right as well",Ok-Guidance-6582,1b695h9
1,"I've been in a DBT program for 8 months now. It's 1 hour of one on one therapy + 2 hours of DBT group class (not therapy, it genuinely is like a class) a week, plus medication management if needed. I also have to report my feelings & problem behaviors every single day on a ""diary card"" that my therapist sees. I have found it to be incredibly life changing and beneficial. It is not easy, but absolutely worth it. I do not know how expensive it is to be honest, I have low income free health care provided by my state that covers everything.",,1b695h9

I was in trauma therapy and learned the “why” I’m like this…(childhood trauma and also abusive relationships in adulthood) but I didn’t really learn how to make my life more stable.

11,"Tried CBT for years, and never got anywhere. 

DBT IOP saved my life, and now I just have weekly sessions (might go down to once every two weeks) for maintenance. 

It’s different for everyone, but it took about 3-6 months for me to notice a significant improvement. That said, I do need upkeep in a way that not everyone else does. 

DBT was created as a treatment for borderline, and I’ve found it to be incredibly useful. I don’t have the diagnosis on paper because my psychiatrist is an ass, but my therapist believes I have a pretty standard case. 

I don’t think I’d go back to regular CBT again. There just wasn’t enough for me to work with to actually tackle my problems. I needed more clear instructions and tools.",sky-amethyst23,1bmk9m2
12,"I tried a few different therapists until I found the right one. I was in weekly therapy for a year. Bi weekly for another year, and now i just go see her once a month. I have less to talk about now because I'm understanding a lot more about myself and got through a lot of the hard stuff with her a few years ago. Now I just go see her because I enjoy talking to her and sometimes I just need that. Someone to talk to. 
My psychiatrist also wants me to maintain a therapist relationship because I do go through the mud from time to time. 

Everyone is different. I do think it's important to stay with the same one if you have good rapport so you're not constantly restarting. I had to see a psychologist that wasn't my therapist because it's all my insurance would cover and I didn't have a good time trying to do things over again.",drowningeliander,1bmk9m2

0,"Hi, im from brasil. it all depends on how much money you have really. the best therapists are still those that attend privately and you pay for the session and generally isn't very cheap.



we have public health services but there is a general notion that they are not very good. the doctors/therapists are overworked and dont give the personalized attention that you need. ive never been attended by the public health system but just today i read someone comment on reddit that their sessions lasted only 15 minutes.



i had health insurance and my therapy sessions lasted only 30 min and thats pretty standard for any health plan in the country. i attended the sessions online because i lived in the country and only saw her once a week. my psychiatrist was to increase my psychotherapy sessions to twice a week because i wasnt getting better, but my insurance has expired and i couldnt continue the treatment at this clinic and i wont be able to see my therapist again unfortunately. i have a new insurance plan, but i need my doctor to prescribe the therapy sessions so i can continue with the treatment. ill have to see my doctor outside the plan and pay the exorbitant price for her session to do that.



these professionals from health insurance plans are not the best either and ive been through a lot of professionals in my lifetime, i just settled for this one for lack of motivation to keep looking for ""the one"". its also a very industrious system: a lot of patients and not much time to work with.



i dont know how is your relationship with your parents and ill give myself the liberty to share my own experience with you. ive been where you are, struggling to live independently afar from my family and in the worst moments of crises having my family around was still what saved me. they are far from perfect but they are still family.",tetrasbox,1ca68fz

1,"Yeah I wrote it this morning. It's an expression of a certain feeling that sometimes come over me when I think about the relationship I was in. It was ultimately abusive And I'm slowly unpacking how much of what became normal was absolutely not how anybody should ever be treated. But at the time it felt like I was part of something beautiful and special, almost like I've been put on this earth to meet her. At first it was a very nourishing relationship and then slowly it devolved into me constantly having to accept a very one-sided dynamic where I really didn't matter at all to her unless I was actively reassuring. But she simply wasn't capable of returning any of that, or if taking any responsibility for the way that she would be behave for the things that she would say. It was like, if I could just shower her with enough love her cup would be full and she could pour some back into mine. But eventually my cup was empty and all I had to pour was blood. And when I realized that wasn't enough, and that eventually I'd be bled dry, I had to walk away. I know that was the right decision but sometimes I feel like I abandoned an angel. Therapy is helping me understand that that that's a pretty common dynamic of people who fall in love with someone who has border getting some of those more complicated feelings out is difficult but I find poetry to be the best medium so far.

Sorry for rambling lol",PabloTFiccus,1clr556

You didn't abandon her—You showed her an important lesson, which is that it's not okay to be abusive and to expect all effort to be put in  from another person. Being borderline myself, I feel for her and hope that she one day gets the help she needs and learns how to be responsible for her actions and good to her partners.

5,"Talk to your therapist about your feelings, definitely. Therapy is weird in that everything that comes up is grist for the mill or whatever, all of it is useful to bring to therapy if you have a good therapist. 

I remember being really frustrated with CBT specifically because it felt very invalidating for my feelings, which I'd already had a lifetime of and caused unhelpful cognitive dissonance. DBT I had this a little bit with, but there are some skills in it I really love and find valuable (opposite action, wisemind, Dearman in particular, and I really like the structure it has because it helps me organize myself).

So I'd say if it's resistance to the skills because you need them but feel foolish for needing them, do the opposite action stuff and process your feelings with your therapist as you work through them. Find ways to cope with that feeling and resistance and understand yourself better through them.  Depending on the approach being used, you could also see if there's a subreddit for it (likely) and reading others' experiences as they work through it might help it feel less like a ""you"" thing if you see other people are feeling similarly. 

If it's more feelings about the skills because you already know them or it's invalidating to you, ask your therapist to use another approach. A lot of them default to CBT and CBT isn't actually the best thing for a lot of issues, and you sometimes have to ask for something different. 

I really like ACT because it's about working with reality and making choices aligned with your values, and that helps me in all areas of my BPD issues, and majorly helps my shame. IFS and somatic approaches have also been helpful for me, and I find these three way more useful and validating than anything else I've tried, and they help me feel more connected to myself where CBT made me feel more fractured and disconnected. Obviously this will be different for everyone. Gestalt, schema, and MBT are supposed to be helpful for BPD as well, although I have no personal experience with those yet. I also have a therapist who specializes in trauma and attachment- based issues, and has a specific interest in personality disorders, which has worked way better for me than someone more general as BPD can be tough for a lot of therapists to work effectively with.",IndependentEggplant0,17qzcf9

But I still stuck with it and did my homework because I've seen what can BPD look like without therapy. My untreated mother ruined my life. I don't ever want to be like her. And eventually I actually started to see the skills as something that helped me and made life easier for me. The truth is that we are kind of stuck in our childhood when comes to processing emotions. We just didn't have the right upbringing that would teach us these basic skills and it's better to learn them now than never. I think you're experiencing the early stage of therapy resistance, but it will pass. You will see how much it helps you once you get over this stage.

I also stopped all medication because I wanted to feel like myself even though it's hard.

In all honesty, I feel better now, as if I wasn't running after recovery anymore. I just accepted my fate and learned to listen to myself and take a step back when I feel my emotions take over.

Take care of yourself through activities that make you feel good, exercise regularly and try relaxation techniques. I think the most important is to find a healthy balance. It also helps to have a confident, someone you can vent to and who will listen to you without judgement.

2,"I believe that is not the only but the most important way to live with BPD.
When I was at my worse 5 years ago (I tried to kill myself 5 times, had severe anxiety and depression) I did therapy and also medication. The best therapy for BPD as far as I know is very specific, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and at least in my country, the basic studies of psychiatries and psychologists don’t even teaches then, is like and extra they need to learn after graduation if they want to do it. 
I don’t understand how you will do it to yourself honestly, even if you knew how to do it I don’t think it works that way. Of course having healthy habits is important but you basically have a different way to see the world with this disorder, it’s something deep in your personality so probably is not enough. 
When I was stable for example they stoped my medication and I kept only the therapy and nowadays I have a completely normal life and I’m not suffering all the time. I’m not even always on therapy now, just when I feel that something can trigger me enough. But at the beginning yes I was once a week or every other week to “control” my thoughts.",AbleValuable133,1bepwvs
3,"I suffered a lot, I had no choices but therapy.
There are pros and cons to it.

I did EMDR (for traumas) and schema therapy (for mild BPD or quiet BPD and codependency)

The pros

It help reduce the high and lies, EMDR did reduce my triggers by 80%, once upon a time I felt really peaceful if it wasn't for my bad choices due to ingrained coping mechanisms.

Then I started schema therapy.

It helped me name where I am in my head.
Am I leading the trajectory or is fear leading ?
Am I dissociated or still anchored in reality?
To quote one horrific person but still a good quote ""you've gotta name it to claim it"" (Dr Phil, I know just his name gives me nausea, still...)

Allow the above where emotionally very demanding.
Therapist needs to be well trained and accustomed to PD and Trauma (meaning either they're gifted or they suffered a lot too)
(Very few are gifted, dome pretend to, most of them had a lit of extreme feelings to)

It's great when done well.

You get to know yourself and you win control over your life and emotions.

You start yo understand that all isn't gloom and doom and you'll start to feel like life has worth instead of wishing daily to ve out of the game.

The cons

While you're doing that your life seems ""on hold"" which can trigger anger and frustration.
Although your life is definitely on hold with a PD if you learn how to live with it you can still function.

You can't hide and you'll have to face yourself. This is the hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life.
Blaming my abusers, feeling like a victim felt like a breeze compared to that.

If you are in the US the Golden standard for BPD is DBT. I find it somewhat abusive myself as I am also a cult victim
I preferred schema therapy,  that gave me the source of the pain and the solution. 
I can chose to use it or not, at my own expense 

Therapy IS REALLY demanding for PD's. You've got to destruct your identity to built a new one. This is now in the cons but should be on both side.
It's excruciating but salvation. 

Therapy IS DAILY COMMITMENT! If you do not want that, do not even start.
Either you'll feel more as a victim or worse end up more damaged.

You've got to want it really bad in order to make it work.

Conclusion 

If I had a comfortable life and my PD in check I would never have searched for therapy. 
Life threw me so much lemon that I couldn't slip away.
I mean the pain was unbearable.
It was either therapy or suicide. 
I chose to live.


I do not blame anyone avoiding therapy. 
If there was a magic pill I would have gladly taken it.

For PD's there isn't,  unfortunately. 

Unless you want to be numb all day (which I would totally get btw)

Good luck to you on your way forward.
I do believe in the fact that all roads leads to Rome anyway.

4,"I don't have the option to be in therapy either, I've spent 10+ years in and out of therapy, and after doing more harm than good, I have no choice but to give up on therapy. The help I needed wasn't avaliable here, the therapists were honestly horrible, and just gave up on me. Instead of giving up all together, I decided I was worth helping, and started figuring out how to help myself. It is 100% possible to better yourself, learn to manage your symptoms better, and feel more okay on your own. You have to put in work, but there's plenty of resources online, and people who share what helped them in the same position. I find that taking care of my physical body, drinking enough water, eating enough nutrients, moving my body and getting more sleep, really helps me, because I have more energy and feel better, and am in turn more patient with my my mental health. Learning why I feel the way I feel is also helpful, and trying to sort of gentle parent myself. Not be so hard on myself, understand that feelings can take overhand one minute, and you can use that to learn what to do or not to do next time, and get out of this cycle. You can help yourself, and you can become a healthier, happier version of yourself without access to therapy 🤍 Just try to be kind to yourself, because it's not an easy journey, but you can make a difference in your life still, one day at a time.",sorrengail,1bepwvs
5,"DBT and EMDR were necessary for my recovery. I had no idea where to even start with myself. Even if we’re incredibly self-aware and insightful, it would be incredibly difficult to navigate through all that jumbled stuff. I’ve always thought I knew what my problems were but my therapist seemed to pull so many forgotten things from my brain! 

It might just mean therapist shopping, which can be expensive. You might not connect with the first ones you meet. And yes, actually applying skills is needed - and I always sucked at that, however once I got into DBT I started using the skills almost unknowingly. I also made it a habit to write down every emotion I felt and discover the reason I felt that way and ask myself if my reaction was necessary/appropriate. Shit like that. It got easier every time. 

Aside from that, I did have to get clean from drugs, start sleep meds (insomnia) & do regular meditation. It was actually quite wonderful, even though I was still suffering, I look back on that period with fondness.",gospelofrage,1bepwvs
6,"Unfortunately, CBT and DBT mean working with a trained third-party. It's also a matter of them having the objective view to see trends and warning signs, to guide, and to drive to insights that you can't do to/for yourself. It sucks, but here we are. Stay focused and keep at it.",BabyFishmouthTalk,1bepwvs

8,"I don't have BPD

I'm not being flippant at all here ok. And I realize it may seem so, but it's not. And it worked wonders for one person, I'm aware not everyone can do this.

Best thing was she bought a medium pedigree dog.

He requires walking, self care, food, organized living that didn't allow for degenerate chaos (this person experienced).

A lot of things she might not do for herself, a lot of important things... But she can't/won't let the dog down... Because it's not fair... She's all he got.

Plus dogs literally guaranteed to always stay. And not to be morbid, but it wouldn't be right to leave him..

So yeah... For one person, a dog REALLY helped. 



Bonus thing: dog picks up her vibe meeting people, and growls if something off.. I don't know or think she gets what's happening (she V smart, grown woman well educated) and I'm not gonna spoil the magic.

The doc cleverly express her inner vibes and ""if he doesn't like you"" it's not gonna happen. Allowing her far greater autonomy, conscious or not.

I like this dog, I posted before but maybe of anyone likes the idea, or just the doggy vibecheck might raise a smile.",,1bepwvs
9,"thank you. I recently posted about feeling 'used' by the healthcare system. I have spent thousands of dollars on therapy, medication, rehab, hospitalizations, ambulances.

16,"It's obvious that you're aware of the illness and its traits, and that's one of the most important things that can help you gain some control over its effects on you. In other words, I think that knowing your triggers well and recognizing immediately when you might be having ""inappropriate"" thoughts, and being able to self-identify, aware that they are exaggerated or unreal, and managing not to be carried away by them, is indeed possible. In that case, perhaps therapy may not be as necessary, and you could live with BPD by maintaining good health habits and making use of all those techniques like journaling, meditation, and whatever else is most suitable for you.

But my advice: try to save some money for therapy. We are sensitive and volatile. An unpredictable stressful situation may arise where these methods alone may not be enough at some point, and that way you have the means to seek professional help as soon as you need.",AbleValuable133,1bepwvs

>Thanks for sharing your experience. EMDR has been difficult for me to pick up but maybe with the right therapist it can work.

Depends where you're at. I was in the midst of a storm PTSD then. It helped me be more mellowed in response to some triggers and core beliefs.

I have a dear friend (BPD too) that couldn't do EMDR, it didn't work for him.

I'll still suggest it , maybe it helps someone else.

It can be retraumatizing for some persons.

Not one size fits all. Some here found solace in DBT.
I can't have it due to my past experiences. It reminded me of the brainwashing of the cult, I can't deal with that.
But it works for many !!!

Schema therapy and ACT are for me more reliable/less controlling.

You can find a lot of exercises books online and you can do the test yourself online too.

If you want to/feel the need to.

Internet helped me a lot when I was really down.
It still does.

I hope that I can give that back 🙏

0,"I've been in DBT for 1.5 years and it's the only thing that has helped me actually see results.I recently completed a year long group therapy class whereg you're taught a specific skill that week and do homework on how you applied  that skill in your daily life. That was on top of a weekly hour individual therapy session. In that you go over your weekly diary card and talk about what stands out to discuss because of what specific issues you're tracking...for me it's self validation, trying to control others etc. At the end of this year I will switch to individual therapy only twice a month and then I'll be discharged from DBT. So...for 80hrs being a ""max"" DBT journey I disagree. At the moment I have 182 hrs of DBT and still have a year or more if I'm accepted into phase two of DBT which is processing trauma.

She was only a temporary therapist,  but she really put me on the right track with my life and idk what it is but her technique just really clicked with me and I'm so thankful for her. 

I also have done dbt therapy 4 times. 

The last 2 times I really slacked and quit half through. The timing was really difficult 7 to 9 pm which is right at my children's bed time and I'm a single parent. 

I was getting more agitated with my kids and it was becoming distressing trying to get it tha timing to work.

It changed my life. I graduated and managed to maintain a lot of my skills for a year, but after being retraumatized a lot I was finding skill use to be difficult. So two years later I started seeing a DBT therapist one on one. 

I still see her, but now it’s every two weeks instead of every week. It’s mostly as upkeep to make sure I’m still using my skills as intended and to talk through any issues that come up.  I’ve been seeing her for two years now.

0,"My sleep meds are kicking in, so I'll post a longer, proper reply when my brain is working better. But I do want to say this:

I can't speak for every country, but in several, a therapist can get fired for sharing information to your parents. 18 means you are legally an adult, and a therapist will have no power or allowance to share what you say in therapy to anyone else. The only thing they are allowed to do is call authorities if they feel you are a danger to yourself or others, or if there is a court case is which they must give the info. This is likely never going to happen. If a therapist shares info with your parents without your consent, you can take legal action. Therapists are bound to confidentiality. They almost certainly will not share anything with your parents.

I hope that provides a bit of stress relief. I'll get back to this after some sleep. It's a very very brave and selfless thing to do to try something that you're uncomfortable with for the sake of bettering yourself. You don't sound self centered at all.

I don’t really have any reason to be sad though, I often wish bad things would happen to me so I would at least have an excuse to feel bad. Does that make any sense? What would you suggest I do? Try to get something private going and pay for it myself or wait until college or go with my moms plan? Sorry for all the questions.",llloveydoveyyy,1cl8swh

3,"Everything you've said makes sense. You are a legal adult—even if your mom pays for it, she can't legally demand information from your therapist based on confidentiality laws. I don't know where you live so I would double check your country's laws, but most places don't allow therapists to break confidentiality.

If you have the capability of getting something private, that'd be great! And universities usually have some resources for mental health too. All of those options are good. I would personally take advantage of your mom's payment though and give it a shot. If your mom IS receiving info from the therapist, you can get that therapist in trouble and try one of your plan Bs. But yeah I imagine your mom has no legal standing on getting info from your therapist. You are the patient, and you control who is and isn't told. Your therapist can help explain this to your mom perhaps.",princefruit,1cl8swh
4,"I don't feel obligated. I genuinely enjoy helping people!

So to reply in full: When you see a therapist, you will have to fill out paperwork. One of these papers will be the confidentiality agreement. Make sure you read over it carefully. (Read all of the paperwork carefully lol). It'll almost ***certainly*** mention that the therapist agrees to keep all of your information confidential—this is standard with therapy. You can also ask your therapists directly about what can and cannot report. Again, you being 18, your parents are not your 'guardians' for the purpose of this—you are being treated as a legal adult, and your parents' only role in this might be if YOU list them as your emergency contact. And Emergency Contact doesn't mean sharing your info—it means if for any reason you get hospitalized in therapy, they can contact whoever you put to tell them that you were put in the hospital. That's about as far as they can go legally. And you do not have to list parents as an emergency contact.

As for your symptoms—while we can't diagnose you, a lot of this is in alignment with borderline, or cluster b symptoms. Not that a diagnosis matters—you still can benefit a ton from the right therapy whether you have the full disorder or just traits. The treatment is the same.

What I would do, is copy what you wrote here regarding your symptoms. When you've established a therapist, you can email this list, print it out and give it to your therapist, or read it to them in your session. A therapist can only help you when you're honest. Talking in person can be stressful. Writing whats in your head and sharing it can be a really good way to make sure you don't forget something. Ideally, your therapist will go through these one at a time, to discuss them further.

Also, have a goal in mind for your therapist: do you want to just learn how to cope? Do you want to get to the root causes of your symptoms? Try to figure out maybe 1-3 goals you have, and share with your therapist. That gives your therapist some direction in how to tackle your sessions.

Also, Also, If your therapist is being unhelpful, upsetting, or anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or unproductive, you need to share that with them. Everyone has different needs in therapy, and it may take your therapist some trial and error, and some direction from you. Therapy should be a challenge, and there may be times when it is emotionally taxing, but it shouldn't be making your symptoms worse over all.

Be patient with your therapist, but if a month or so has passed and you see nothing hopeful about that therapist, move on to a new one. 'Therapist Shopping' is not just normal but encouraged—you may not meet the right therapist right away. You're paying for this service with money and time, get what you're paying for.

The biggest fear and misconception people have with therapy is that the therapist is in the position of power. That's not true here. A therapists' job is to guide you, and you're expected to be open to that guidance, but ***you*** are the one that controls how you want to be treated. If they break your trust or mistreat you, you can report them. You have the power in the dynamic, don't let yourself think that you're stuck or deserving of any mistreatment. You CAN speak up to them, and you CAN get up and leave if it isn't working.

Most therapists mean well though. I'm glad you're giving them a chance. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't work out—most people go through a few therapists before they find the 'right' one. But do remember you are allowed and encouraged to give them feedback to better help you.",princefruit,1cl8swh
5,"Okay, thank you so much!! :) ❤️ 
I’m still definitely nervous and knowing myself but I might back out last minute again but I’m going to keep trying to force myself. I should ask though, is it worth it going if I don’t consider these things to be problems? While I do freak out at minor things, most major “bad” things I my life, other actually care more about them than I do. People have told me in the past that I should care more when these things happen and that they are big problems but I don’t see it that way. The reason I bring this up is, it might affect my work if I start viewing these things as problems and it might only lead to me being more upset, while right now I’m fine with them. For example I would freak out at getting a shitty grade for something I worked hard on or playing poorly in a sports team. But things that wouldn’t affect me that much are people dying, or people touching me supposedly inappropriately. Then again, it really changes depending on my mood. And if you’d like I can go more in detail I just didn’t want to freak you out! I am more than happy to discuss anything if you have questions, it doesn’t affect me I just usually never talk about it because it freaks other people out, haha! Again, thank you so much you’ve been so kind! :D",llloveydoveyyy,1cl8swh
6,"I think that there is a big misconception that therapy should only be considered an option if things are really bad. Just because you don't see them as problems doesn't mean that you can't benefit from therapy. Even people who are healthy can benefit from therapy. You don't need to change your perspective. You can say ""I don't think these are problems, but I still would like to learn how to not freak out over things like my grades"". We can all better ourselves in some way and therapy can be a good way to do that! Just like a lot of people upgrade their phones before their old phone is broken, we can improve ourselves for the little things even if we're not broken :) I'd give it a shot. If you really don't like it, you can stop going, but honestly with free therapy, I'd milk it for all it's worth!",princefruit,1cl8swh

0,"A lot of therapy is trash and invalidating. They don't see our behaviours and symptoms as adaptations to what happeend to us. They label them as ""bad"" which adds even more shame to the shame we already have.

I told my therapist that I see DBT as “treatment” and she agrees with me. Finally heard I’m #11 last week! I was #24 for (felt like ) 5 years.

And I usually feel great the day of therapy, and a day or so after occasionally. But lately it's like... I'm on cloud 9 because therapy went so well, but then not even a day later everything goes to shit and I swan dive to rock bottom so fast its insane.

I feel like I need 2-3 sessions a week. Is that even a thing? Lol


But yeah, I just wanted to say hey and you're deff not alone.",liquordippedpaws,193equ9
1,"something that I really enjoy doing with my therapist is leaving him voicemails. we have a system where I leave him voicemails and he will talk to me about the things I said in our next session, or calls me back if he feels necessary.  if something bothers me, I send him a voicemail. if I have a revelation during the week, I send him a voicemail talking about it. if I am angry and need to yell about how I feel, I send a voicemail.. you get the gist. this has helped me a lot with keeping track of the things i want to talk about / that have happened during the week. there was a point where I was leaving 7 minute voicemails just because I needed to get everything out. 

another thing I picked up is journaling. I used to journal everyday but now I really jus update it when important things happen or when I want to talk about things that I don't want to say out lout. I don't let anyone read my journal (sometimes I will share my ideas that I have written down with my therapist, but I don't like to read things word for word). this really helped me with processing my emotions.",rot6ftunder,193equ9

1,"I agree with the other comments that yes a therapist helps very much, and also your recovery will be lots of work on your part.  The really important thing to internalize is that “work” is NOT you cracking a whip over yourself and inflicting stress.  It’s closer to merging certain beliefs like people are capable of doing bad things sometimes, but it does not mean they are bad people.  Or practicing a softer, less hypercritical view of yourself to ease feelings of judgement.

Edit:  I hit respond without completing what I was going to say lol whoops.

To add, I found significant relief of my symptoms that I’ve been struggling with for 36 years with a perspective change that my therapist assisted me with.  I had so much anger towards my parents for example, but she helped me through that and I am now more willing to move on and focus my efforts on truly making my life better; like setting goals (small ones) and reaching them.  Then setting more ambitious goals and working towards those.  We tend to be a house of cards emotionally and one of my goals in therapy is having more emotional resilience.  Super tough in the beginning, but we are what we practice.  It’s a conscious effort to shift trains of thought and to be honest you could work on that yourself without a therapist",FlipMick,16jm3ab

Have a discussion about that instead of abandoning the meds and talk to him about how you’re feeling. Let him help you. The meds are so we can adapt to different ways of thinking without being so emotional. Without them, therapy can be extremely difficult. Taking meds is like being on a time out for your brain while you do the work and they help you stabilize. The issue is your fearing abandonment  and a good therapist will talk to you about your progress if he thinks you’re recovered some and he’ll ask you want you think about applying space between your appointments.",LongjumpingAd3733,1bq46wl

Just explain that you need upkeep and maintenance and that you don’t feel ready to stop therapy even though you feel like you’re doing well. If you feel empty and not yourself you can always try reducing the meds but definitely do not stop completely without any guidance. I honestly don’t recommend stopping at all if you feel like it has helped a lot with the difficult symptoms, but if it’s something you want to do then do it slowly under the supervision of a medical professional.

1,"I don't know what country you live in, but in my country a psychotherapist does not make a diagnosis.  He only does therapy.  The diagnosis is made by a psychiatrist.  In my country, to be diagnosed with a personality disorder, several conditions must be met: age over 18 (because the personality is still developing during childhood and adolescence), documented symptoms lasting at least a year (so you have to go there for at least 1 year, but even so in my country usually  even more years, in my case it was perhaps 7 years since my first contact with a psychiatrist at the age of 13, even though the suspicion fell much earlier) and they must send the patient for a complex psychological examination of the personality to an accredited clinical psychologist.  Based on these results, the psychiatrist will give the final official diagnosis of personality disorder.  The patient can receive this diagnosis much earlier, but usually it is only a ""working"" diagnosis for experts, which is not disclosed to the patient.  It can still change a lot.  Usually, before the diagnosis of bpd, a person receives various others, such as a depressive or anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, adjustment disorder, or the pre-stage of personality disorder in juvenile patients is ""disharmonious personality development"".  I went through all these diagnoses before the final dg.  BPD.  And anyway, I think that BPD is caused by a combination of innate and genetic predispositions with trauma, most often developmental (CPTSD).  So more important than getting a BPD diagnosis is to work on where the symptoms originated, process the trauma and your inner beliefs/patterns in psychotherapy.  

What symptoms are you experiencing? How long do they last?  
Did you grow up in a dysfunctional environment? 
How old are you  
Do you work on yourself, do you go to psychotherapy?  

These are probably the things to start with.  If you don't start with psychotherapy, but immediately take medication, it's not very good.

Yes therapy can help me understand things or why they happen. But for some issues that are life long (like my psychosis) there’s nothing left to be understood. It’s my experience of life, anything else is just trying to make me “see” things differently. Basically putting a facade on my brain. 

I would not experience life in my authenticity (even though to do so would be detrimental to my life in this society).

1,"Hello! I would heavily recommend getting some sort of training involving DBT!  I’m super glad you’re looking for answers involving this, and your situation does sound super intense and complex.  I recently completed one year of therapy for my BPD and the DBT has been absolutely astounding in terms of making meaningful change in my life.  It’s changed how I treat others, and more importantly, myself.  It takes time but I would absolutely recommend it!! 

Concerning the financial part of it, this is the most frustrating part of seeking treatment.  It’s understandable if you aren’t able to pay and I don’t blame you, but that’s not the only way to practice this form of therapy.  I’d heavily recommend searching up online free DBT skills, whether it’s worksheets or interactive websites.  The therapy side helps tremendously but DBT is most effective when you develop habits with the instructions given with the treatment.  This is a site I consult very often when I need to be caught up on skills again: https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/mindfulness/

My life has changed. I don’t get suicidal, I don’t blow up on people, I can handle myself and my emotions in an adaptive way. Highly recommend. 

I will say, it’s a very long process and it may seem invalidating at first- which is why some people don’t like it. Stick with it, it takes time.

This is how I feel about it now. This is what I should have done. These are the things I can do to prepare for a similar reaction.” I get praised for being self aware, and that’s nice I guess, but being self aware has helped very little. If anything, it makes me feel worse when I do something stupid *because I fucking know.* I also feel like no therapist has found ‘the magical question’ to ask that will unlock my ability to communicate how fucking deep I run beyond clinical coldness during sessions.

The central tool we use in therapy is detangling different ""modes"" and the coping reactions following from them. Those modes would be called something like ""healthy adult"" (that's the adaptive part, that can detach from the emotions and look at a situation more rationally), ""child"" (the emotional part) or ""critic/parent"" (that's the part that's often overly critical and puts you done). The names of these modes can differ but here is a bit of an overview: [https://www.schematherapy.com/id72.htm](https://www.schematherapy.com/id72.htm)

When I have a hard time detangling these different modes, we often do chair exercises where different chairs represent the different modes and I try to slip into each role. This can feel kind of silly at first – it definitely did for me because I'm a very pragmatic, not at all woo-woo kinda person. But if you go into it with an open mind it can be really helpful for accessing the different modes. Going into the ""child"" or whatever you wanna name it mode really helps me articulate my emotions without immediately trying to rationalise the situation. :)

Unfortunately though, finding help/therapists was a struggle for me.  After I got diagnosed, my husband was able to find a Psychotherapist who specifically listed BPD in her treatment list.  Keep in mind that it took me forever for any of this to happen.  

I've been with the same therapist since November 2020.  Though, there was a time where I had split on her because of a miscommunication.  I got back with her pretty quickly though (she understood what happened), and ""see her"" (virtual visits because she's now in another province) every 2-3 weeks.  

I don't want to make your hope fade that there is someone out there for you, but the reality is finding a good fit is hard.  I got super blessed that my husband found this specific therapist for me.  It will take some time to see who will mesh with you, but please, don't get discouraged.  I've found someone who can validate me, and yet talk me through the feelings.  We also regularly talk about DBT skills, her favourite one being ""check the facts"" which has stuck to me the more I do it.  

If you need to dump your current therapist, dump your current therapist.  It's within your rights to do.  I've had to do this on many occasions because my underlying (and undiagnosed) BPD was problematic.  Now I have someone I mesh with, and I'm headed to remission.

At least for us there were a number of reasons why we usually didn't talk about therapy: we talked about ourselves a lot already and didn't wanted to repeat it again; we don't want to talk about traumatic stuff when were safe at home; it wasn't the time or mood for serious and exhausting topics; we wanted to try learned skills and exercises for ourselves and didn't want the pressure of expectation; we talked about our partners in therapy (and I know that can make you especially paranoid, but if you look at youself you may find that we all need some sort of neutral party sometimes to tell our feelings to); we communicate our feelings in different ways when we are talking to a stranger and already expressed those feelings to our partner in a more intimate way; a problem was solved bc the therapist showed us new ways to handle situations and we wanted to focus on the solution...

Many with BPD, myself included like talking about our problems, we ovwrshare and feel rejected when others ""don't trust us enough in return"" to open up back to us.

But its not personal, its not that they don't necessarily trust you.

For some people, they talk about things that are so traumatic that to bring it up outside of the safe space of the therapists office, would be asking way too much from someone, especially someone we care about. (Not saying that's the case here, just an example).

Its easy for us to blame them for being too closed off rather than look at our own actions. Try to look inside and figure out what happened to cause these feelings of separation from your partner if they don't open up to you.

I know for me, I had such little control over my life growing up that in order for me to get some, I had to know everything that was going on with the people that impacted and influenced my life and what happened to it. I read my muma diaries, I would noae around, eavesdrop on conversations that had literally nothing related to me, but in my head if I knew what was going on then I could be prepared for anything. 

Find out where your urges are coming from. Talk to.your partner, be honest about it and support each other. Get your own therapist if you don't already (can't remember if you said you had one sorry), just don't give in, don't give up and don't stop being the best version of yourself.

17,"I do think you’re being unfair. Therapy helps because it’s confidential. It’s tricky when being in a relationship because it’s good to have open communication but you’re not entitled to every single thing about your partner either. A good therapist follows their ethics code and would not engage in a romantic relationship with a client. It might be good for you to bring this up with your own therapist if you have one.

Sometimes I wish I could overshare. I keep everything so bottled up I don’t even know what to say. My therapist says that I need to open up, meanwhile I’m panicking because I feel I shared to much lol.",1heart1totaleclipse,wb2f5q
18,"Knowing that your therapy sessions can stay private can be a huge relief. I remember when I once had to live with and work very closely with a textbook narcissist, she started to resent me journaling. She began to make demands that after I journal, I let her read it? And somehow letting me know before hand that she would read it made it okay? I told her point blank, “There is no point in having a journal at all if I have to write knowing you’ll read it.” 

I suspected that she was going to read it anyway while I showered for example, so I stopped writing in my journal completely. Which contributed to me basically having a breakdown and losing my mind just two weeks in 😬

I do therapy weekly, and sometimes I like to share with my husband what I learned or talked about. There are times, though, that I need to talk about my husband with my therapist, because I am pretty sure that what I’m feeling or thinking is unhealthy and I don’t want him to have to deal with it. My therapist is extremely good about advocating for my husband and helping me recognize his needs and wants and how valid they are. She is someone I can trust to help me be good to my husband and to support our marriage. It is so important to have the space for that. And I know that if my husband does therapy, in order for him to feel safe and like it’s valuable, I let him know that he of course can talk about me and that I’m not going to ask him afterwards about the session. 

I know that hearing either of those things may not be very helpful right now to you while you feel jealous. Remember that your boyfriend’s therapist is literally being paid to talk to him, and there are ethical boundaries that make it so she isn’t disclosing very much about herself. This is her job, and she’s probably got twenty more clients to think about. Their sessions are not going to be anything close to the two way give and take that you will have with your boyfriend. 

With my husband, I have a system of when I get anxious, I ask for “mush”—verbal affirmations. My husband will then tell me that he loves me, that I’m his favorite human, that I’m fun and interesting to talk to, etc. And if I still feel anxious, I just keep asking for mush. And if I’m STILL anxious, it’s probably because I’m having negative self talk, so I’ll try practicing affirmations to counteract whatever negative self talk there is. Usually that’s enough to calm me down. It’s kind of a nightly ritual with us. He used to stress about it because he felt like he needed to come up with truly original stuff every time I asked, but I told him, “No actually it can be really repetitive and still very effective. I’m listening more closely to your tone of voice than what you’re saying anyway.” That made him feel much more relaxed about providing reassurance. 

Most importantly, I make sure we both know that if I can’t calm down and feel reassured, that is my responsibility. BPD typically entails trying to get other people to help us regulate our emotions for us. My husband can be helpful, but if his help isn’t quite enough, then I know I need to start digging into DBT skills to calm myself down.",PlatypusDouble2331,wb2f5q

Therapy has helped me a lot of with that :) in the short-run, especially with disorders such as BPD, BD and anxiety it is very difficult  to END these thoughts completely.

0,"Wow ....

I really appreciate you sharing. Many people on here don't have great access to therapy, so I always wondered what the quality of online therapy would be.

Apparently it's dog shit! Jesus Christ, who fucking says that??

I'm really sorry that you're feeling the way you are. I know it sucks. And I know that it feels like there's no end.

But, there is. Well, mostly. Piece by piece you can begin to remove the pain you feel by addressing it. Your brain is an unreliable machine, so while you may think you are feeling x because of y, it could actually be something entirely different that you never would've considered. This is where a good therapist comes in.

I don't mean to make it sound like an easy job, but each session should kind of be like, ""So, how are you feeling?"" ""Miserable."" ""Ok, why are feeling miserable?"" ""I just can't keep myself from having these bad habits."" ""Ok, what habits?"" ""I'm eating too much, I'm drinking too much..."" ""Ok, how much is too much?"" ""This many."" ""Ok, how does it make you feel?"" ""Like shit. But it's comforting."" ""What's comforting about it?""

You seeing the pattern here?

Imagine you're inside your brain and it's like this huge underground tunnel that's completely dark, and all you have is a flashlight. You've been lost, wandering around in there, trying to make of things that make no sense to you.

The road to recovery is like having a strategy on how to navigate this tunnel.

The first thing you do, is you start to make a map. ""I think this because I feel this"" you take that thought and you go down the path to explore it. This is where having a good therapist really helps, because it's here that they can help course correct you by showing you the influence that's behind those feelings. You may have thought you were doing something good, but were really doing something bad. Once you figure it out, you immediately stop feeling that way.

I did this constantly. I've always tried to be the nicest guy on the planet, and I always wanted to everybody's best friend, and I just handed out love and trust like it was Halloween candy. Whoever comes around gets some. I thought this made me a really good guy that was doing the right thing. Then I come to find out that I really just didn't have an identity, and so I would use anyone around me to supply me with one. That was a big bummer, lol, I really thought I was being the good guy. But I was only hurting myself and using others.

So, you know, had to swallow some pride there. But it was such a wake up call to the reality of my life vs the story I'd been telling myself. It really gave me a new lens to see through, and it was scary as hell. So many embarrassing moments that I felt so justified about at the time. Just recognizing how my emotions took total control over me.

All I'm trying to say here is to please keep up hope. There is a way out of the pain you're feeling. Everything in your body is working against you. You are not expected to be able to handle this on your own.

So don't settle for a therapist until you know that they can do their job. Try to start slowly, establish some trust, but always be honest. No matter what.

If you continue to have trouble, there is literature that can possibly help, and you've always got us if you ever need.

Be kind to yourself, you deserve it.",GastonsChin,183v30f

It is heavy and I find myself canceling a bit… but these therapist understand that these feelings come from past trauma… a reason. You work to go back and heal that part… and they truly understand.

She was young & obviously nervous. She would read off of worksheets she had & would like.. have the paper on a table & put her elbows on the table & put her hands on her forehead, like hiding herself, while she read it out loud to me.. it was strange. She didn't know what the amygdala was. She kept calling it weird/different names every time she read it. I felt bad because she might just need practice but with the level of trauma I have, I didn't think she could handle it so I had to go elsewhere. I could only get a therapist on zoom after that & apparently I don't do well with that. She was good. But I didn't like being able to see myself talk & I felt a lot more on the spot & uncomfortable on camera. So anyway, keep trying to find a good one.

3,"Yeah people suck at handling personality disorders, sorry you had to experience that. I think it’d be worth trying to see somebody else so you can start drawing comparisons and see who you’re able to vibe with the most. 

I don’t personally have BPD but I’ve got my own complex problems and I went through quite a bit of providers only to stumble across one who really knew her stuff. I got insanely lucky, because the one before her was just as neglectful as the provider you’re mentioning.

Throwing blanket statements at problems isn't going to fix behaviors, and she needs to really dig into the underlying parts of these feelings and help you approach them with a healthier and adaptive perspective. 

Therapy is a great tool to help you build a foundation, so I’d recommend you to continue trying, but DBT and self-work will always outpace it.",,183v30f

BPD is very complex and can take years to heal that’s why I also don’t agree with giving a time-frame either because even doctors told me I’d be “better in a year”…. It’s been 7 now lmao! So you don’t want his hopes to be up if he doesn’t get better by that certain time because I know that can be discouraging. 

Especially if he hasn’t seen a psychiatrist, therapy or taken medication before, it’s going to take a while to get used to and to get a therapist you connect with and to do the things that they tell you, so he definitely needs to have some patience with this and with himself in general

I come from a healthy family where my parents supported me and made it clear they knew they didn’t know it all and would seek help and educating themselves, my exes mother raised him to believe drs didn’t know what they were doing and she herself acts like she knows just as much if not more than a doctor despite having no education.

I’m able to help myself bc I was taught how to, he wasn’t. Which is why I think he needs someone to just get him over that hump.

He literally comes from a family where almost everyone has unchecked mental problems, his has NPD, his brother has either Bipolar disorder or BPD and refuses to get treatment bc of the exact same reasons I said above. 

He needs help, he knows something’s wrong with him but his education is getting in the way.

Looking at your post history, you actively dislike the guy and he hurt you a lot. Have you even processed the ways he hurt you?

I really encourage you not to turn people into projects

Has he ever even asked you to do all this for him? 

It's people's right to get better or not, on our own timeline. You are also uniquely ill-equipped to help this guy because you have a messy history together.

He is an adult, not a child, unless he has specifically asked you to swoop in and fix things, it's just not really appropriate to engage in a way thats focused on your desired outcome for him (and even if he asked that of you, it'd likely be a pretty inappropriate thing to ask of one person imo). He needs to go on his own journey and ask for support when he needs it. 

I really really really encourage you to do lots of self-reflection and processing and not focus on this guy for a bit. Maybe take some distance from him altogether

Because here's the thing: what if you do *everything* in your power, and he still does not get better? what if he is just simply disabled and that's how it is? will you be frustrated? will you be able to leave? will you have given yourself the care you need to process the pain of your relationship? will you have grieved? will you blame him?

There is no outcome where this goes well for both of you unless somehow magically you are a savior who fixes him completely [which is already a problematic concept/views us as broken things to be fixed] on a timeline that is below your frustration threshold (everyone has one), and that is absolutely a ton of pressure to put on him, and he is not going to learn to ask for help if he realizes it comes with pressure and expectations and people *needing* him to get better for their own comfort.

And regardless, it is not fair to you. You're an ex, not a therapist, not a doctor. Don't try to be someone's therapist or doctor. That is overstepping boundaries, and will hurt you both",Ok-Guidance-6582,1b6ftqh

17,"Hey I appreciate you doing your research on me and you trying to help me out. I’m going to be honest i said what I said saying I didn’t want to deal with the stress of him trying to keep me in his life once I left him to seem detached but that’s not the truth I’m helping bc I want to and know he needs help and could be better off but his family especially his mom fucked him up. She’s a narc and everything she’s done for him or  taught him has been with the ulterior motives. He’s just a pawn for her. The lady saw how happy I made him and tried ruining our relationship. She also purposely stunted his growth just bc it threatens her ego. All his life she fed him lies and emotionally manipulated him.

This has been the person who has guided him all his life, she set him up for failure, and for me to at least try to correct that even if it doesn’t work out will make me feel better. Bc even though I don’t really like him I know he’s fucked up bc of her.

I broke up with him technically over a year ago and we stayed friends till a month ago. Recently I took a month off from speaking to him to fully detach and it worked. I don’t love him anymore and am way less emotionally invested. I’ve grown indifferent but i acknowledge it’s obvious a part of me cares.
I made it clear to him that we’re never dating again though and I mean it.

What I’m doing now isn’t with an expectation, before I used to get disappointed when I’d help him but now I’m just helping him so I can make sure I did everything I could. I’m not expecting things to work out the way I want it to, I’m just hoping.

I’ve grieved the relationship already and thought of it all and I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t lose anything giving him this little nudge in the right direction.

If it works out great, I’m still not getting back together with him, if it doesn’t it’ll suck but at least I know I tried.

Because I know I know better. And I won’t be able live with myself if I didn’t at least say something.

If he chooses to not seek help or take medication or go to therapy it’s ok bc it’s not my life.

That’s something I had to come to terms with and it hurt a lot but it made things clear for me and I realized I had to meet him where he was at and realize that we were never going to work out.

I’ve accepted that, but honestly his lack mental health is at the core of all his problems so if I can get him to see it would be a relief.",Present-Beautiful-23,1b6ftqh

2,"I don't have BPD but have traits of it and issues with emotion regulation and I self-enrolled DBT skills group short course (15 weeks) last year. It was rather beneficial for me. 

I do have to stress that you'd have to put in the work to do the skills every day of the week (even if it doesn't click/seem ridiculous or that you've already known them) and participate in the homework presentation actively to get the most mileage of it. Homework review is where you can bring up your trouble with the skills (aka it doesn't help/difficulty implementing them) and have feedback that helps you improve that particular skill. Being able to see how others utilise the skills or troubleshoot some aspects of it is also interesting. 

And another important part is to keep on practicing them even after the course has ended :)

I do know that for some people DBT doesn't really work and that's okay. In those cases, work with your therapist /psychologist to look into other therapy modules like EDMR, Schema Therapy, IFM etc. I'd suggest giving the full all 4 modules a try before doing that though, since while some might not work for you, there might be one or two that can be useful to know.",BuTerflyDiSected,1ay90va

6,"So for me my 1-to-1 therapist and the ones who conducted my DBT skills group are different people. 

The skills group is like a course so we started immediately with the first module of Mindfulness. Throughout the 15 weeks, I would review my weekly homework with my 1to1 therapist whenever I have difficulty or wanted to expand on certain skills. 

For my therapist case, I did requested for DBT skills to be implemented but not taught systematically like the skills group so we do it in more of situational sense when circumstances arises. For example, ""incident x happened and it's a good chance to learn skill y"" -> ""proceed to teach dbt skill Y"" kind of pattern. We didn't go into it right away though, probably took like a few months or so but that's because we were doing diagnostics for BPD, putting out crisis, establishing trust and getting to know me more. 

Is your DBT psych your primary therapist right now? Are you still seeing your previous therapist that referred you? 

Perhaps you can bring it up to the psychologist whenever you felt triggered and discuss how they can approach things in a way that makes you feel more receptive to it? That's what I did when my therapist did the challenging my thoughts from CBT and I hated it so now instead of doing that, we explore the issue together instead.",BuTerflyDiSected,1ay90va

45,"That's the funny thing, I do have an FP (A high school friend), I am also limerent of a neighborhood girl.

One weekend with the FP, I had a BPD episode (dissociation and a bunch of alcohol consumption because of accumulated stress and a stressful situation and no tools to deal) and essentially got a huge angry (and very well written) letter, and we went no contact (for a long time she said), and my ego rationalized and did ALLLLL the things except see reality in the face, and I went full cray-cray (drug abuse, avoidance, rationalization, fantasies, replaying events and seeing myself as the victim, blaming the whole world but myself), it was BADDDDDDDDDD. On top of that I was going through a divorce, and lost my best friend the week before, and I was missing the country I spent a decade in (and where 80% of my friends were). And like exactly 3-4 days after that, a girl I liked A BUNCH, like a resplendent angel of self-regulation, well advanced in her own path (while I was unaware, cavemanish, unhealthy, unregulated) asks me out for a run (and at that point I am not healthy), so I dissociated the whole run, wheezing, making a fool of myself, and I saw in her eyes that she split on me.

So in like 4 days, my whole world crumbled, and I depended on these people for self-regulation, and my coping mechanisms couldn't cope anymore. It was the darkest time, and I've had dark times (meth addiction, traumatic death of mom etc). What happened though, is that I used the feedback from my FP (who is very emotionally intelligent) and used the clue she gave me, the words she used, who were unknown to me before, things like ""emotionally unregulated"", and I started YouTubing. 

I was all alone anyway, so what else could I do? So I spent 6 months, every day smoking a bunch of hashish, walking till my legs broke (self-harm gogogo), and when winter stopped I started gardening, and cleaning my house, all while listening to YouTube self-help using bluetooth earphones, and regulating through music. 

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQun1ee6u9NZWO71azTBeRzSl3yGxlnF1

These are all the videos I went through (There's more, and audiobooks, but some I haven't saved). The more words I learned, the more I understood my reactions, the more I accumulated ""core values"" and ""core knowledge"" and ""tools to cope"" and ""ways to deal"" and I built a beachhead of awareness and mindfulness.

I understood that to have a fighting chance I had to have solid pillars so my body could be healthy (good sleep, good food, good water, BREATHING!!!!! Physical activity and hygiene). 

In that time I quit cocaine, cigarettes, cannabis, amphetamines, alchohol (exception for mushrooms and acid for their healing powers), 96 days sober now. 

In the end, I didn't do it **FOR** my FP, but my FP (and the rejection of that girl I wanted so much to be friends with) was such a strong wakeup call I HAD to wake up, I just had to!!!!

Now, my FP and I are back as best friends in the world. She wrote me a beautiful card, and I cry every time I read it. 

""Dear socradeeznuts, I am so honoured to witness your growth and healing process. You've come so far, figuratively and literally; I am so grateful you landed right here, as my neighbourino and bosom friend <3.  I had first gotten you a really basic and functional gift, then I felt like you are none of these things. So instead I got you fun and sweet things (like you) namely XXXXXXXXX. I love you so much. Couldn't wish for a funner or funnier friend who's as lost and confused as I am. Your's truly YYYY""

I changed for the better for my FP, but in the end, I realized, I had to be my own FP, I had to put me in front, I had to do these things so I could become a full(er) human being, and not have to depend on others. Of course, I still have an immense hole in the heart from my past, but I am NOT my past. I am the awareness, I am the Presence Power (The PP) who sees my thoughts, who sees my emotions, who sees my judgments and my assumptions, and decide what to do with them.

I think you can change for the better. I **KNOW** you can change for the better, and no price is too high to pay, no amount of time is too much, no struggle is too big, no space is too much. 

Also, that neighborhood limerence girl, sometimes avoids me, sometimes ignores me, sometimes stares STRAIGHT INTO MY SOUL , and that's the struggle I am working on right now. One struggle at a time.

46,"Becoming aware of my thoughts as being separate from ""me"" was the great leap!

Imagine the people mumbling in the streets, they are doing the exact same thing we do all day, it's just that they say their thoughts out loud!

A nice exercise to do is to do a deep breath in, thinking **IN**, a big breath out, thinking **OUT**, as many time as possible until you enter ""the zone of no thoughts"" (except in, out, in out), and then when you realize you are """"""""thoughtless"""""""" you stop breathing. Eventually a thought will pop out. Consider the thought, and ask yourself ""Did I choose to think about this?"", the answer, I believe, will be NO. 

And once you realize this, you can create space, distance between you and them. And from then on, you can observe the thoughts (emotions, judgments, assumptions) as they bubble, and decide ""is this useful for my situation?"".

I decided to do a ""shroom summer"", and try to do them about every 2 weeks (tolerance builds really fast). I started with a moderate dose of 2 grams, but then decided that to get result (FOR MY SITUATION, not a doctor, not a recommendation) I needed to go real deep, and break some eggs, and go for like 3.5 to 5 grams, taken over a period of many hours. 

When I had a particular problem (for example, limerence this weekend), I would set up a nice nest at home, [nice lighting](https://ca.galaxylamps.co/collections/all/products/galaxy-projector), a huge amount of fruits, a bottle of water in every room, curtains closed, full naked (I'm wild like this), and then I would binge watch/listen videos about this problem. I would keep a clipboard and a bunch of crayons/pens/pencils to make lists of things that needed my attention, or thoughts, or realizations, like ""Compassion heals both ways"", ""Squeeze every drop out of life"", ""Hang flowers"", ""Go see a physiotherapist"", ""Reach out to this friend"", ""Poor little girl, poor little boy"" as forgiveness to all. 

What mushrooms do, is that they make it that parts of the brain that don't usually connect, suddenly can connect, it also lowers egoic defense (my ego is a yellow monster taking my perception hostage, stopping the real world coming in, and confusing the messages coming out), increases sensitivity, make my heart grow three times bigger... actually, I wrote a letter to a friend to gift her shrooms, I'll copy what I wrote to her:

-------------
Using these beauties, I have…:

1- … forgiven people whom I’ve never thought I could forgive (including myself!) 

2- …felt compassion towards people who have hurt me, some in incredibly cruel manners (including myself!) 

3- …explored painful topics that used to be devils on my shoulders, and swept away cobwebs in my brain.

4-… faced fears that used to compel me into avoidance, inaction or paralysis, and have rekindled my courage.  

5-… shone a light on so many of my limiting beliefs and exposed them for what they were; self-sabotage and programming imposed on me from my youth.

6-… grieved for losses that took parts of my heart away, my old life, family members, my old country, a decade of friends, all the places I used to call my home, a culture I’ve grown into, a city that is now closed to me, a world away. 

7-… put my ego back in its place (in the kitchen, making me a sandwich.). I’ve shed away so many of the skins I used to carry around, all reactive crusts that no longer serve me, the real me.

8-… had a shitton of fun and saw the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen! (I have a super cool light projector I can lend to you if you ever want to!) You might be compelled to dance naked in your house, pull your curtains.

9-… so many other things, like sobriety from alcohol and cannabis! I can’t drink more than a beer now, and getting high on cannabis makes me feel I am losing my most precious thing of, my mindfulness and awareness.

My friend is a graphics designer, he makes all kinds of printable stuff.

What we do is we use an excel spreadsheet, each column being a value we want on the card, and with a macro we automatically put the information on a part of the card, with a font and colour, to generate cards easy peasy.

For the acronyms it would be one value for the prompt (what to do if you are in distress), one value would be the acronym, and then behind the card would be a paragraph with the meaning of every letter.",socradeeznuts514,xq7asa

0,"It all depends on your teacher / leader / whatever you wanna call the person who teaches the group. I did DBT as a teenager and now doing it as an adult. I assumed it would be just whiny people complaining about their life but actually found a wonderful support group. Our group is very structured. We do a mindfulness exercise, skill checkin, have a break, then get into our lesson then do observations. People talk about their lives but mainly pertaining to skill usage. You aren’t allowed to say any super triggering things or contact people outside of group. I’ve found it very helpful.",Wtfissleet,xcj8hx
1,"As an older woman (28) I didn’t like my DBT as it was mostly younger girls. And they quit frequently. So I didn’t feel that comradery. But I spoke to my therapist and the next round of DBT I do it will be more older women/men in my age group (probably 30s) whom I can better connect with. 

But DBT is mostly just doing your work book, discussing what you found , role playing, asking questions and using the skills you learn. It’s not about connecting with others in your group. I’m pretty sure BPD friendships in therapy are not encouraged because our emotions are so volatile and mixing a bunch of different volition emotions together in friendship is a recipe for disaster.",Autumnfayee,xcj8hx
2,"I'd say it depends heavily on multiple things, but the DBT group I know is very different. It's constructive, emotions are high sometimes but everyone just genuinely wants everyone else to get better, and there's encouragement WhatsApp groups and stuff to get homework sorted out. Even practice sub groups. 
Obviously that doesn't mean that other groups can't possibly suck, but I'd recommend it based on my own experience.",Gras_Am_Wegesrand,xcj8hx
3,"Age wise I am 23,  and our group has people from 20-28. The age isn't really as much of a gap when you realize you all have similar issues. Some people are struggling with something you've solved ages ago and some people have solved what you're struggling with. (by solved I mean like moved on etc) 

I would definitely recommend it. They have amazing insight and truly have helped me come up with tips and stuff. You can always quit later if it's horrible I suppose, but definitely give it a fair shot. Emotions can run a little high but I've never really seen much conflict and since the therapists are always there, there's very little chance of things getting out of control (as I feared it may). Also our therapy group has a strict policy of not meeting group members outside of the therapy environment so there's less chance of things getting messy. 

You're all there to heal and learn!",Melthiela,xcj8hx
4,"I had a three months experience with DBT group therapy since my clinic is just starting to test this kind of approach- but it's been the most useful experience for me so far, after 7-8 years of therapy. 

It was fairly hard to show emotions in front of others since I'm so used to suppressing (plus, I have some crippling social anxiety), but if the attending therapists know what they're doing, it becomes such a safe and controlled environment. 

The best part for me was being able to identify so many emotions, since I could see them from the outside for the first time. Which also means I got better at helping other people out, too. 

The only rule (besides basic respect for others and your own self) was to be judgment free: instead of saying ""what you just said is good"" you'd go ""what you said made me feel x y z"". It was hard at first, but I practice that irl too on a daily basis now.

I can't wait for another event like this to be organized, it was a very positive and practically helpful experience for me.",soberdrunken,xcj8hx
5,"I had no teens in mine. We were all so different with different experiences and manifestations of BPD and co morbidities. It was super interesting actually and I made some genuine friendships. 

It was more men than women in my group and I would have been the second youngest (at 25). Sometimes people would walk out but always we validated one another’s experiences and the environment was very understanding and respectful.

There was a punk poet who was married, and schizophrenic and questioned everything we learnt (in a good way. There was a very reserved woman who would have a new novel with her every session and was very successful in her career. A hot bisexual carpenter chick who is now a very good friend of mine and a comedian. A brilliant dude who was so supportive of all of us and was really insanely good at rubrics cubes. The point of me emphasising some traits of each person is that with those traits comes a different perspective and different tools that you can adapt and use. 

I could go on and on but each of them impacted me positively and their contributions and insight helped my healing trajectories soar.",Icy-Tie-7638,xcj8hx

7,i’ve been to 3 different ones. 2 for when i was younger than 18 and one for adults. PERSONALLY they all sucked for me. homework was given and i dropped out of school for a reason LMFAO. they treated us and talked to us like children in every group i was in. i would say unless u find a rly good one it’s probably gonna suck. especially if ur being pressure by doctors or family or therapists to join which in my case i was basically forced everytime. i’ll say this if u don’t want to join 100% don’t because u will be miserable. it’s like a class for school imo. also if u don’t like being talked to like ur a 6th grader i would just stick to one on one therapy sessions,PomegranateStrong963,xcj8hx

0,"I have grown a whole lot these past few years, and a lot of my symptoms have been significantly reduced. What worked for me was a combo of therapies at appropriate times. I started working with my trauma therapist who is a LPC 3 years ago, and his approach is relationally focused psychodynamic therapy. He says we are often harmed in relationships so it's through relationships where we find healing if that explains anything about it. I have learned a lot about where my interpersonal issues come from and processed some of my trauma. Then, I did DBT to learn new skills to help me manage my emotions and communicate better with a LCSW. She didn't work with me on any of my past stuff, just my current things and what skills to use. So, psychodynamic therapy to understand the past, and DBT for skills to manage my future. Both sides of the coin were necessary for me. 

When it comes to social workers, of course licensed social workers can provide individual therapy, too, but I think of their roles more as helping us to navigate systems which may explain a bit more about your recent therapist's approach.",Alainasaurous,184jdw5

I've got a dbt therapist that's more of a care coordinator than dbt itself, sorta like the ask how my week is going but she does also teach me dbt skills if and when they come up that could work for situations.

You may have to Google around, psychologytoday.com is a great free resource to find telehealth therapists in your state. Ask questions.

1,"It really depends.

Inpatient at a specific facility related to BPD and mental illness? If you have the resources you have to put your life on hold, go for it. 

Inpatient at your local hospital? Think of it as a last resort when you're on the brink of commiting. Especially in the US. In my experience, there was hardly any therapy in there and it was mostly staring at a wall while they made sure I was still breathing.",,12l0bdf
2,"There are almost always other options that would be considered first. I'm not sure what your therapy/treatment plan is now, maybe you're just prescribed an antidepressant with no other treatment? It doesn't make sense to consider inpatient unless history is showing the alternatives are failing you, especially given the anxiety you feel about it, it just isn't the most likely option. And while I'm nobody on the internet, I also don't think you're describing a case that would be admitted for inpatient, at least in the US. 

More likely options include more frequent therapy, if you feel a benefit from working with a talk therapist; CBT, DBT or other structured treatment and education; or intensive outpatient, spending a number of hours daily in treatment. All would basically start with an intake assessment at a local mental health center or a new meeting with a previous therapist, asking for a new treatment plan.

6,"I did an In/Out patient program in HS, it was for an eating disorder but I think my insights still apply. The IOP program meant that we were there for half days but not staying the night or anything, we got there at 6am and left at 4/5pm

Some things to consider:

You mentioned the isolation. This is real. Visits are also real depending on the program. You also have a lot of ""freedoms"" taken away and that ""under surveillance"" feeling can be difficult. For example, (and this is eating disorder specific) we weren't allowed to go to the bathroom for a full hour after meals and the doors didn't have locks so they could bust in if they thought you were trying to puke. It doesn't feel great to not be trusted with a lot of basics. However, you might be in a place where you feel like you want someone to take that control. Someone with an eating disorder is obsessed with control so we hated it, but sometimes when I daydream about doing in patient it's because I *want* that stress taken from me, so maybe it's beneficial when you get used to it

Inpatient is very life up-heaving. I missed the first two months of school, and if it weren't for the fact that we were done at 5, I would have had to miss my after school job. Its also socially up-heaving. Suddenly everyone in my life knew this very personal thing about me. That said, there is never a ""good time"" in life to just put everything on pause, so take the fall out into consideration, but don't necessarily take this to mean ""oh I can't miss work so I can't go"" IF you need that level of care. 

So, I would say in patient should be used as a last resort. It sounds like you know that and are trying to figure out if you're at last resort levels, so:

Have you tried switching meds? Some anti depressants actually make BPD worse because of how our brains are wired and we need different meds. Prozac, Lexapro and Zoloft made me worse, for example. (Doesn't mean it'll be the same for you). 

You said you've tried several therapists, and I definitely feel you on that and how defeated you must feel. I would urge you to keep trying and try to go 2x a week (that's what I'm doing rn). 

However, the moment the suicidal thoughts move from thoughts and feels to plans and wanting to take action, GO TO THE HOSPITAL. 

I have a friend that did a short stay at in patient while she was in undergrad. It was rough because of the upheaval factor, but she improved SO much when she was discharged.",feisty-spirit-bear,12l0bdf

8," I have major depressive disorder, ADHD, and BPD tendencies. I’ve been in inpatient several times for suicide attempts, strong desire to commit suicide, and a psychotic break. 

Going into inpatient has saved my life a few times already. The first time I wasn’t happy about it but I knew I needed help. And I decided to embrace this experience and try my best to get the most out of it. 

Here are the pros and cons (imo):
PROS:
- You are seen by a psych every day. 
- They can quickly reevaluate you and adjust your medication each day rather than the weeks and months it would take with your therapist and psych outside of inpatient
- Average stay is 4-7 days (depending ofc)
- You literally have nothing to worry about other than yourself and maybe getting clothes. Food, hygiene, and sleeping arrangements provided.  
- Some facilities let you use the phone frequently. 
- Group meetings where you learn how to cope with different aspects like anger or stress and y’all talk. Some do it better than others. 

CONS
- They won’t take you unless you say you’re suicidal at this moment
- All facilities are different but there are a lot of inpatients that are in old buildings and not kept up well. 
- Limited visiting time with loved ones
- No phone (usually)
- No cigarettes (usually) but they offer patches and nicotine lollipops
- Bland food
- Unpleasant people (not usually)
- Lots of time to brood
- Feeling isolated

My most recent hospitalization left me feeling worse than how I went in but it was a different facility in a less wealthy area than the first facility.

So I guess I would say it really depends on the facility you are at and also how involved you are with the therapy/classes they offer.

I would recommend giving it a try, maybe go into an emergency room under a mental health crisis, that’s how I wound up going to the first/excellent facility.

16,"Hi there. Hopped in because I mostly agree with what Tran is saying, and also because I think my situation is a little similar to yours, OP.

I’ve also used Betterhelp. I got lucky, had a great therapist, but I also got to talk to her for a full hour via vid chat. Even then, sometimes, because she was an online therapist, there were a lot of things she couldn’t do (link me to local resources, offer me anything really intensive, can’t diagnose me or prescribe me anything).

Basically, I’m glad you at least have that, but I think you’re also realizing it’s definitely not enough.

I finally found myself a full team of mental health specialists at a clinic. I also am unable to work for mental health reasons. At least in my state, that qualifies me for the low-income free healthcare which covers my therapy.
So I see my therapist once a week for a full hour and I also have access to a psychiatrist that I can also speak to if I need meds.

Even then, I recently went into crisis mode. I had active suicidal intentions with a plan, but I was alarmed by my own thoughts and let my medical advisors know right away. We did all the right things, came up with a safety plan and all. I considered inpatient therapy because I was worried things were getting severe.

The information I got, I’ll keep to myself because it’s all hearsay and not my own personal experience. What I can tell you, though, is that you have a lot of decisive power at this time.

You seem clear about what you want and what you think you need, and that you strongly feel you would be uncomfortable in a new environment with a lot of variable and unknown factors. That is a legitimate fear to have. You have autonomy over the type of care you want to receive.

You may lose this autonomy, however, if you are assessed to be in danger of harm to yourself or to others.

For me personally, I also don’t want to be placed in a situation where I am removed from my current support system. I feel that if I am at the end of my rope and truly in danger, then I’ll do what I need to do to get better, including being hospitalized. Luckily at this moment, I’m not there yet, and with my medical advisors, I’ve been able to get through the crisis without going to the ER or getting hospitalized.

I think you should try the least invasive route first. I know it’s frustrating, and it’s a horrendous responsibility to have to try and seek proper care for yourself when sometimes you struggle just to keep yourself afloat. You know yourself best and you are your best advocate. If you truly feel you may get better with just a little more attention, try looking for a more consistent and local therapist who can help you reach those therapy goals and to practice what you’ve learned.

And if you feel truly lost and hopeless, and you do have active intentions of hurting yourself, you can try the ER or the inpatient routes you and the others have mentioned here.

I’m hopeful for you, because just writing up this post asking for help means you still have fight left in you and that you do want to get better. Thank you for reaching out, and I hope you get the help you need.",Nebulous_Puzzle8191,12l0bdf

I wish that I was able to stay in the group for longer, the personal connection and hearing that people are going through similar things was very helpful. It did feel a little impersonal at times because the clinicians running that group had so many patients it was hard for them to remember details or triggers and that was very difficult for me. It felt helpful when the clinicians were able to remember details about my case and ask questions about personal things, I have a hard time opening up but the group only became helpful when I did open up. The clinicians being able to push me a little was helpful. I think having an educational aspect as well as a space to openly talk as a group was very helpful as well.",Rich_Signature1505,166skku
2,"1. Not diagnosed, but believe I have 9/9 DSM traits for BPD. I’m currently in my eighth week of an IOP program, however, it is not necessarily specifically designed for BPD folks, but we learn DBT skills, mentalization, art therapy, process group, and additional individual counseling. I was extraordinarily nervous to begin and wish I had an orientation to ease my nerves and understand the program more beforehand. However, I got used to it quickly, and have found group therapy to be very helpful and not feeling completely alone in my problems.

2. i’ve liked almost everything honestly. This is kind of a personal preference but I wish that group started later because I have sleep problems and I am an extreme night owl. I feel like afternoon start times are the best for both early risers and late risers.

3. like a lot of people with BPD I am an artist and went to school for art. Art group is a little weird, because my skills are very high and I felt there’s never enough time to draw how I normally do, but it’s fine I just use other mediums.

4. maybe nonviolent communication could’ve also been included, but it probably almost is taught by proxy through other skills. Struggling with this question.

5. I wish there was a resource library of PDFs provided by the program because I am reading so many books in my own time, and I think that anybody that wants access to knowledge should be able to access it as freely as possible especially when it comes to mental health.

i tried dbt briefly, and struggled a lot because i feel like i just had so much to say about my childhood and dbt was very much here and now. it wasn’t getting to the core issue, which is what i wanted. i’m still open to it tho! maybe you need something to open you up before you try dbt again, wouldn’t hurt i think?",sugarcoochie,12sngj3

It took me years to be honest with myself and others, to accept and want therapy. Is there somewhere where you can get some type of evaluation or insight from a professional to help you take the right path?

the one single time i got into a proper personality disorder program, the first day, IN GROUP, the fuckin director of the program singled me out for dressing ""provocatively,"" because i had just come from work. it was 90 degrees in july in manhattan and i was a bicycle messenger. i was wearing shorts and a tank top cuz otherwise i would die from heat stroke. she starts group by sexualizing me, humiliating me and kicking me out first thing my first fuckin day.

had another lady try to hospitalize me the first couple of minutes of our first ever interaction, during an intake.

had another lady drop me suddenly for being late to a video appointment. she just dropped me in the middle of an appointment and told me to call some places for a new therapist, saying that's all she owed me. it took me months to find her, there was nothing in the are at the time and i was driving like a 45 minute commute i couldn't afford to see her. i was applying for ssi, under her encouragement cus she was ""so incredibly concerned about my stability."" she was treating me for cognitive dysfunction and knew how chaotic my life was. 

then she wrote this really nasty letter saying she ""discharged me for illicit drug use. and i do not tolerate illicit drug use in my clients!"" but i was taking medication assisted therapy and she knew that ahead of time. i didn't say i was a drug user on my intake form cuz i'm not fuckin required to, i wasn't doing drugs at the time and that's not what i was seeing her about, and i knew she wouldn't accept me but i desperately needed some help and she was the only person i'd made contact with after trying for months to find a provider. she treated me like a pathetic helpless child. then she tried to stir up legal trouble for me.

and most recently, my new ""psychiatrist,"" who i was discharged to from intake, i start getting pretty acute (and had not hardly been stable since getting out) and i call him telling please help, ive been hypo am not sleeping, had just been very depressed, and i am feelin big girl mania is about to happen if i don't sleep. i'm begging for a phone call for liek 5 days, like bro i just got out of inpatient!! finally after calling back at random times for like several days, he just leaves a voicemail saying ""i'm gonna be leaving the clinic, so you'll have to call to schedule with a new provider. best of luck to you.""

....fuckin best of luck to you. lol i contemplated hurting myself so i could sue for malpractice :0

there are some gems for sure in the mental health/psychiatric world, but got damn does it take a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of diggin and frustration and honestly, so much unnecessary harm. like bro this shit is life n death to me and you just treat me like i'm a kid crying for ice cream! or like my mental illness is the punishment i deserve for being so naughty and it's your job to make sure i suffer",-brokenxmirror-,1b1001g

1,"It's your first day in group therapy. You aren't expected to know anything or do anything except show up. Something to take notes with is useful. I'm not sure about your group class but the format for mine is it usually starts with a mindfulness exercise. Don't be intimidated if other people are using terms you're not familiar within. Different people are at different stages of therapy. Some may have gone through all of the modules previously and it's their second time doing it.

You will probably be sent files with the handouts and worksheets you're expected to work with for the module. With my in person DBT group, I was given a physical booklet and a paper diary card. The group then discusses the homework given from last session. Since it's your first day, you don't have one — unless your individual therapist liaised with the skills trainers to give you one. They will communicate this clearly. There's a part in which they ask you about your diary card and what notable skill you've practiced for the week. You're not expected to practice a skill you haven't been taught. My individual therapist taught me Mindfulness What and How To skills + Wise Mind before I attended group so I could practice those skills already before my first day with group.

Then you move on to the actual concepts and skills you're going to learn for the day. Sometimes there's role play involved. Sometimes you do one of the handouts. Then you are given homework and asked if you have any questions. The end is usually a reflection on how the session went for each member.

3,"Okay cool. I can only speak on how my zoom dbt classes go & things that would’ve been helpful that wasn’t pointed out by the teachers/mental health providers…

Firstly, your nerves are valid. Grant yourself the time to get comfortable with the entire process; logging in, speaking on zoom, being in a group & so on.

Depending on how your classes are, you might get booklets/printouts of the material you’ll be going over. Keep track of these papers & try to organize them by using paper/binder clips, labels if that helps… This will help with reaching for things like your homework or diary card (you’re teachers will inform you about what diary cards & homework entail.)

Secondly, acknowledge Your progress in making it this far & finally having access to vital information! (Happy for you!)

It may take you however many classes to get comfortable with being authentic in a group, but try to remember that’s what it’s like for most of us in the group.

I’m 5weeks in, my 6th week of class is tomorrow & I can still feel the anticipation anxiety making my body shake as I think about check in. But you know sometimes magical things can happen, and I can now say, I get past those feelings quickly, as soon as I check in. Now I’m able to comfortably participate in the group. Still not at the point of turning my camera on though. I was in a terrible spot before starting DBT & 1on1 therapy, and it’s already helped me not feel suicidal or want to self harm.

Everyone’s progress is different. It’s up to us, with what we do with what we are taught that makes the difference in our lives. Don’t compare your progress to anyone. I’ve been doing way better than where I was, but that can quickly crash and burn for me. It’s really important you do this for you!

It can still be difficult to find a therapist. I got EXTREMELY lucky with my therapist, and she was awesome right from the start, and she was the first one I picked. I also am extremely receptive to therapy so it makes things easier, regardless of the therapist",QuailBuddy,17p9stt
2,"yes it has. Group therapy really did help me understand the seemingly useless phrase of “you are not alone”. That my problems are still pretty bad, and can be pretty bad, but also that there are people in the world that understand and can relate to the degree of suffering that I deal with. 

Individual therapy has been indispensable in understanding. What a very healthy boundaried relationship can look like. It reduced my paranoia, and showed me that paranoia and reading into subtexts is not only often inaccurate, but also not effective as a strategy. In fact, it is quite destructive. I can still acknowledge that people can do unkind things and even cruel things, but it isn’t a safe way of relating.",dookiehat,17p9stt

2,"I did a lot of talking therapy over the years, it was pushed in me and that you need to deal with your childhood, experiences, trauma. I tried so hard but it could only get me so far, I was not able to process all of it, but I would always hit wall and not further. Felt like a failure. This was since I was 18yrs on.

I was diagnosed with BPD in my early 30’s, and this time when there were really pushing CBT and mindfulness which did not work for me but continued this was best approach from professionals who didn’t listen. 

When I was diagnosed by the psychiatrist, who recommended DBT and talking therapist- in Uk, there is support via mental health services in NHS, however, it is underfunded and understaffed. My local service, the psychologist are ones who make the decision about the therapy they provide. They would alway refuse me as I functioned too well, so I was on my own. 

I had find support myself and found NLP which I found to be approach for me. 

Talking therapies also feel like a way to re traumatise me. What I’m NLP therapists said of talking therapies, we have trauma experiences which are represented by a one light of each experience. Talking therapy aims to deal with one light at time, however, NLP wants to bypass all this and switch them off electricity",Possible_Laugh_9139,16yrcyr

5,"This is going to sound harsh, I'm sorry, but what are you putting in? How deep are you going into your stuff? Just talking about IT, or the feelings, the motivations, the fears, etc? Therapy tends to give back what you put into it; when I wasn't getting anything out of therapy, it's because I was being very surface level about my issues. Ex: my friend and I fought. How do I feel about that? Oh, fine. (I don't feel fine, I feel abandoned and stupid and I hate myself and I wanna claw my eyes out.) How did I move on? oh, I cried for a bit and was ok (I have not moved on at all, I'm about to cry but REALLY stifling it, even though this is therapy. Oh well.) I seem happy today? Thanks (I purposefully didn't take notes on what I wanted to talk about, because being vulnerable and honest is scary, so I forgot all of it coming in and feel blank.) Et cetera. I'm not accusing you of doing this at all, but it is something I still really struggle with. If you're milling over the same topics, go deeper.

Otherwise, this may just not be the therapist or TYPE of therapy for you. I know you said you like your therapist as a person, but that doesn't necessarily mean the curriculum she follows (which is it btw? CBT, mindfulness, just talk therapy?) I would highly highly recommend DBT therapy, or if talking doesn't seem to do anything, try art therapy. Explore your options. Don't feel like you're stuck here.",witchcrows,16yrcyr

Before medications, I was extremely impulsive and reactive, experiencing intense anger episodes with any tiny trigger and feeling depressed all the time. I was miserable. 

It took about 10 years to find the right medication combo for me. Once I found something that worked (which I didn't think I'd ever find relief), I am being told I am a completely different person and am becoming a lot healthier. 

I don't think I would EVER stop medications. Ive tried stopping them completely a few times over 10 years and my family and friends did not like me without them lol. It has drastically improved my quality of life. But everyone is different. 

I know some people are completely against medications as they are seen as a bandage that only treats the physical side effects. Medication does not do anything for the disorder itself but can calm the emotional rollercoaster. I hope this helps.",,18fyuzy

Do you feel some benefits working with your 1-1 therapist? A lot of times the relationship is more important than even what style of therapy is used, so it makes sense that a therapist who knows about DBT is a good choice for lots of people with BPD. But it does (probably) mean you're missing out on ""full course"" DBT. Still, DBT at its best isn't perfect for everyone, and it does fail or not meet your needs sometimes.

My BPD wasn't an issue. Our couple's therapist was clear to me from the beginning that my BPD problem behaviours won't be the focus of the sessions; that is for me to work on with my individual therapist. The focus of the sessions are to be on the dynamics I and my husband had and were forming with each other  — particularly with communication, problem solving, and bonding. There were some suggestions sometimes of concepts for me to tackle with my individual therapist — such as the difference between being emotionally sensitive and hypervigilant, why I'm reliant on external validation — but they were all nuggets of gold once explored.

2,"I did 10 weeks of inpatient dbt. A lot of my co-patients seemed to really profit from it. I didn't. Like at all. I got worse and my symptoms are more ""bpd typical"" now then before (for example that I get really mad really easily and have a hard time not snapping at others then).

The senior doctor on the station hated me for whatever reason (she always threatend to kick me out, said I couldn't be helped, called me a psychological liar and a psychopath and never toke me serious with my suicidal thoughts or ed symptoms for example) and some other patients were really hurtfull (they collectively went to the nurses and claimed that I would trigger others purposely and bascially do a ton of horrible things that weren't true at all. So that kinda made it harder... Also, immediatly after being released I had to move to my emotionally abusive grandfather to take care of my grandma till she died. And afterwards I had to move back to my toxic family... So the circumstances were really unfortunate...

3,"I tried DBT, more than once. It's having the proper state of mind that will help you profit from the therapy. 

The first time I went I didn't take it seriously, I was attentive and listened to everything being said but I wasn't at the right place in my life where I genuinely WANTED to help myself, so the exercises went over my head, and the tips and tricks were noted but never used and I rolled my eyes at some of it. 

Fast forward almost a decade later once I survived the dreadful twenties where I ruined practically everything good I had, now in my 30s; it's extremely beneficial because I am now at a state of my life where I genuinely want to be better and do better.. I've seen what my actions can do to relationships I care about and how my sudden swings can ruin so much.. I take the advice given and participate in the exercises and contribute to the program I'm a part of.

That sounds really nice! I am very happy for you that you feel seen and validated.

When I think about dbt, I only think about this huge binder with exercises I found stupid that we had to work through. We had a worksheet for example about our day-to-day life hero (a person we look up to) where we had to imagine how they would act in certain cenatrios and how thats differnt from us.  I just couldn't see the sense in that. Also, I felt like a child. We got homework for the evenings and if I we broke one of the insanely strict and numerous rules (that we weren't told beforehand, you only figured them out when you broke one) we were punished with an extra exercise that we had to present infront of patients and nurses and till the presentation we couldn't participate in the program and if we had three, we had to stay in our room for 24h. I had 14 of these punishment presentations in those 10 weeks.

I did not appreciate him.  and some were simply so ""in the heart"" that they were immediately imprinted in the memory.  your experience is really terrible and it is clear that such an approach could only make it worse.

There answers that you will find better or worse, it’s not always about doing what’s better, although, that’s what you might want to aim for, humans are not supposed to be capable of logically thinking of everything, what they are capable of thinking, is, probably not enough to consider a big percentage of things. In short I’m just saying do what you want, but, if there were no right answers, what would you do? I suppose it shouldn’t be random things that you don’t think are right, and, even thinking something right, is not the wrong answer, but, be cautious, don’t just believe what people tell you to do believe, and, consider what you will.",jdc7733,17g386q
0,"*cracks knuckles* ok, for me the first green flag was having a smaller group that lasted longer.  The system I went through to get dbt made me first do an entry level dbt program that was a bigger group and very surface level.  My advanced dbt group is 8 months long and about 10 people and it’s much much much better.  If your group is huge and seems superficial, do your best to study anyway, participate, and ask the facilitators if there is a more advanced class/group available.

Another good thing is if they are using linehan’s worksheets.  She originated the therapy and her work is the gold standard.  

The moderators shouldn’t let people go over their most recent crises, except as far as it relates to the skill being discussed.  DBT groups can tend to become misery circles if no one is keeping them on track.  

You would ideally also be paired with a DBT therapist, who is supposed to help you apply the skills to your specific situation and be on call for short coaching calls or emails as things come up.  This is the way Linehan thinks the therapy works best.  I am comfortable with my current therapist and she is learning about dbt so it works for me to stay with her instead of getting a dbt specific therapist.

At the end of the day, you are going to get out of it what you put into it.  It’s like being in school and if you are checked out and not participating or doing the homework it’s not going to help you.  If your group is not very advanced you can get more material and study it on your own but a group setting is really valuable for learning from other people and the support of others trying to be better too.",PretendCamel3989,1708sc1

11,"Sounds like they were trying to support you speaking up in your own defence? Maybe they think it’s not helpful to bail you out when you’re upset and more beneficial for you to use dbt skills to manage your feelings about the situation. The sessions are teaching you skills, maybe you were supposed to use them in that moment? 

Have you been doing any of the homework or has it been too overwhelming for you to try?

There are two people in my group I absolutely cannot stand and if I spoke about it in group, not in an aggressive way but in a way explaining why I dislike them so much, they’d probably say I was “attacking” them so I’m wondering if maybe that’s what happened.

Because if it was a literal physical attack they would have intervened. 

Maybe you can think about what happened and describe it but take the emotions out of it. I’ll give you an example:

Emotional: “my mother was such a bitch the other day, she wouldn’t get out of my way and I got so angry I didn’t know what I was doing”

Factual: “I got upset at my mother when she was walking slow due to a recent injury. I punched a wall”.

See how differently you might approach the same situation upon reflection if you take emotion out of it? That’s one of the dbt skills.

My parents said I was stupid and even said nobody was gonna hire me and no insurance would take me. 5 nearly 6 years later and my parents did a 180 and try to learn and be supportive for me. As I did the work they started to have “aha” moments. They are finally getting what they did wrong and tryna make things right while we all still have time. Maybe in healing you will do the same for your family.",,yeg2pi
3,">i won’t get better.

Fact is on average BPD improves over time with or without treatment (research, not bs story). Also point out that ""invalidating environments"" are one of the common early experiences for people with BPD, so of course your parents ""don't believe"" :shrug:. BPD also improves best with illness-specific treatments like DBT; but at the same time, making connections, talking about thoughts and feelings in supportive spaces, stability of school schedule, being away from home if that is a negative factor - all those can improve the situation and mood without therapy. Supportive talk therapy is not the same as treatment, which is why most people with severe PDs eventually find a DBT group or similar and commit to treatment course.

Taking meds without therapy isn't ideal, but it is one way to treat BPD, so maybe you're working with someone who has BPD experience and will be one of the people who improves this way. A DBT workbook and attending whatever 1:1 or group sessions are available thru your university should be basically mandatory, just commit it to your schedule and do the workbook, not for collecting dust.",TranZeitgeist,yeg2pi

Yes, I'm on medications but it's really only for the side effects of BPD, such as heart palpitations and exasperation.

I take Propranolol for palpitations, and Hydroxyzine for agitation days. My psyche is currently trying to get me approved for Latuda, but honestly I'm not too hopeful on it's effects.

I am personally an alcoholic and a regular user of marijuana, so I understand your current situation. It's really hard to move on from what makes us feel okay, and makes us feel stable.

As DBT has mindfulness components, it didn’t really help as all mindfulness does is make me incredibly angry and you need to use all aspects of DBT, do so not the right choice for me.

I found Neuro linguistics programming far more helpful as it give me understanding of how my brain reacts to trigger and negative feeling and you tailor what you use to help you and there is wide range of options. Part of it is about learning how you brain works, the process it uses, negative one because it doesn’t know what do. Not doing this at present as I got as far as I’m ready right now.

Have made so many attempt to come off meds but every time, I end up hitting rock bottom within a matter of weeks. Although I don’t want take to be meds forever, I’ve come accept that help me to live my life in the best way and means I’m in place where I can do things that help me. I know that I want maintain my job, the small group of friends and my emotional well-being and if that means med for now so be it.

That was my one and only time ever trying therapy. I won’t go back. I’m sure it depends on your therapist 100% if they got the patience and understanding to deal with you. Don’t base your decision on other people’s experiences. I’d say give it a try for yourself but see if you can find one who works more with personality disorders.

You have done the first and the hardest step already, see what happens.

Therapy can help in terms of understanding you behaviours, triggers and finding or learning new ways to deal with your emotions, etc.

It can be a long process and there could be ups and downs.

Although, therapy helps, it doesn’t mean everything negative will go away, more you are more able to deal without getting overwhelmed.

For me, once I found the right approach for me, it made me realise that me hating or doubting myself was not a reflection of who I was, more about how people in my past hurt me. Im not saying I’m full of confidence but I can like myself most of the time, I can see positives about me and not always doubt what others seen in me which has never been the same as I see myself.

One of the premises of DBT is the bio-social basis and so, in that, it does address personal history in the “social” aspect. My daughter discusses past trauma and early life experiences, and how those experiences have impacted her ability to regulate her emotions. Many DBT practices will also have trauma-informed therapists. The focus is more on developing skills - distress tolerance, mindfulness etc… but I wouldn’t say that they disregard early life experiences. Unfortunately, many good therapists (DBT and others) don’t participate with major insurance providers which is so frustrating! Is Kaiser recommending group DBT sessions?

One of the defining characteristics of BPD is our lack of a sense of self, so talking about ""who we are"" is a little disingenuous. It's like asking a blind man to tell you about the color red. I can only really tell you about myself in certain situations or times of my life. That lack of core identity leads to long, irrelevant conversations with a regular psychotherapist.

Therapy can actually take a long time before it's effective. It's a constant thing you have to work on but can only be achievable with the right supportive team of people.

7,"Individual talk therapy delves more into looking at the root of these issues, but group therapy is more about building up your skills. That therapist should have had a conversation about group boundaries and things of that sort. You are not insane to think that your trauma and traumatic experience are important - they absolutely are and your trauma is valid. 

Group therapy is great, but maybe not when you're wanting to really dig deep. Skills based group therapy especially is not about talking about the past, it is about the present. Nothing wrong with that, but it just doesn't seem to be what you're looking for. 

Individual talk therapy with DBT/CBT elements (whether it be actual worksheets and going over skills or just running through things that happened and how to approach similar situations in the future... different shrinks do things their own way) is what I've found most helpful. Trauma informed therapy (which is most traditional therapy, steer clear of the hippy ""it's all in your head"" types) with actual advice is great. Don't be afraid to shop for therapists, have a few initial consults and see who you vibe with if you can afford it.

Also -- you don't need to google every approach and beg a shrink for them. If you find someone you vibe with, you'll be okay. There are a zillion ways for a therapist to practice. What matters is coming away from the *experience* of therapy feeling fulfilled. If you ask someone to practice something that they aren't comfortable with or have never heard of, you limit your options. I mean, if a therapist hears you have/think you have BPD sometimes they'll just deny you outright. It isn't fair, but it's the truth. So if they take you, you already have a better chance of getting along with them.",cassiusiam,um5p1m

Specifically social workers - which I've been connected to because I've indicated suicidal ideation. However, everyone is different so the directions they're trying to point you in may not be working for you, and that doesn't mean they're not trying, but it also doesn't mean there's abetting wrong with you. Try asking for a social worker and if you don't already get the number for the mental health line to see what other options are available.

I have seen a few therapists so far and I think you're coming at it in the same direction I am. The focus on skills often strikes me as very invalidating - like, I get it, but I've spent so many years managing and before we talk about new strategies can we at least talk about old ones? Give me kudos for what I am figured out on my own, and talk about why some of them don't work. They like to jump straight into problem solving before they know the actual problem.

I know this is helpful for a lot of people. Sometimes it's best to find workable skills for the individual before diving into other stuff so you have skills to get through the session and the rest of the day. But it depends on the person.

I wish I could say I've found a therapist that works, but I haven't had that quite yet. I have an appointment coming up with a new one.

1,"Diagnosis labels are primarily concerned with us not being outwardly disorderly. We can get to that point, not being destructive anymore, not usually, but then a lot of therapy is kind of done. The goal isn’t for us to have a good experience necessarily, just to enable us to function. I’m grateful that I can function with few meltdowns anymore, but it’s natural to want to thrive! There’s nothing wrong with you, but think of it like you were sitting way below neutral or ground level on the human experience. You were brought up from the basement and now you’re sitting on the surface. It’s better than before but you have no elevation. You don’t have to stay here though! Now it’s time to climb. It takes us a lot of work just to get to what is most people’s starting position. Accept that and decide to keep moving up if you want. Lots of people are lazy and don’t climb that much from ground level anyway. You’ll be surprised how quick you start catching people. 

That’s how I think of it. Stay away from self-help gurus, but do read about areas you want to improve. Start spiritual disciplines and exercise that are about achieving goals, not just suppressing damage. You will always have some BPD background noise, but you are effectively “cured”. You can’t be cured of your humanity, but you can have more. This is the starting line!

Psychologists also seem to be really interested in me, but it took someone with really incredible and well rounded knowledge to treat me and help me a few years back, she was incredible. That was probably when I was the most effective, honestly.

Those difficult feelings won't go away, they're still intrinsic for self protection and you can really only make them quieter and easier to control. It's like scraping your knee vs breaking your leg, you need to know they both are happening and you need to respond appropriately. But if scraping your knee feels like breaking your leg, we need some adjustment.
 
I don't really know if there is a cure for disorders per say, but maybe more so an ability to overcome those feelings and be functional in the way you desire to be functional. (Job, relationships, education, chores, responsibilities, etc.

0,"DBT changed my life, but I'm a little older and was really ready to commit to it. Progress has not been linear, which is frustrating but reality. It caused some financial stress, but less stress than my horrible regulation skills. 

I found someone with a lot of experience. One therapist who offered DBT said that she could take me off the wait-list if I would be willing to work with someone who was being trained in DBT as they gave therapy. I found that to be unethical given the population who turns to this type of therapy.

Marsha Linehan wrote this program helps you ""build a life worth living."" I am there. I love my life more than I have in a long time, but I am not manic about it. I always used to say ""love my life"" and made sure people knew it. Defense mechanism. Now, I don't use social media at all except to keep in touch with people. Probably why I use Reddit anonymously. Never post, limited doomscrolling. I feel authentic and proud of myself. 

I had lost my personality to masking and DBT helped me see my personality is great as is and dysregulation isn't who I am.",,wl2d2d
1,"Personally, the only thing that’s worked for me is group DBT therapy. DBT is work and takes consistent effort; I also didn’t notice any difference for a good year?  

As far as I know the standard format is group over individual, and that your individual therapy session is different from the DBT session. The only reason I use Reddit consistently is because I found this sub to be like an extension of group—a mix of skill levels, all walks of life, etc. You can totally talk to the group leader if you are uncomfortable about talking about your childhood. The thing with DBT is that it can be applied immediately to whatever situation you are in. It’s a bit confusing that you said you only end up talking about your childhood? Do you not pick the examples for your homework?",fairylint,wl2d2d

My regular therapist is a dance movement therapist. We don’t actually dance though I want to eventually when I feel like I can, though we’re 3 years in now and haven’t gotten there yet. 😂 But DMT includes somatic experiencing, breath work, etc. She also does yoga with me. We also do internal family systems and attachment based therapy, both of which have been the most transformational for me. Since trauma and specifically attachment trauma (insecure and disorganized attachment with parents) are usually part of BPD, the trauma focused modalities have helped me the most. Having a therapist who takes the approach of adjusting to what the client needs is most important in my opinion.",likeadriplet,wl2d2d
7,DBT will help trust me just keep going and allow yourself to play the part of a patient who wants to heal  and release the guilt and shame and need for validation make this all about you DBT is the one place where all your emotions are validated no questions asked that’s why it makes you feel weird at first but then you become vulnerable and the feelings and words and healing come pouring out. By doing this you will think twice before naming a new favorite person you will realize life isn’t a black and white situation and they force you to realize your idea of life is the biggest thing causing most of your problems and depression.

1,"I did a DBT group/program though my university the first half of the year.

For us, the first session involved everybody introducing ourselves, getting an overview of DBT (what it is, what its goals are, etc), going over rules for group (don't show up drunk/high, don't miss too many sessions, be respectful, etc - nothing unexpected), that the general format of future sessions would be (mindfulness activity > homework review > new skill > practice), and I think we went over the concept of wise mind.

While mine was through school, so it leaned younger, but ages ranged from 18-28 and it didn't seem to prevent anyone fitting in, so I think you should be okay.

I personally found it a highlight of my week as it was going on - the people were pretty cool and thoughtful/insightful when speaking or sharing their experiences, and even I was able to open up pretty well overtime.  We also had snacks.

I can understand what you are going through and I must commend you on being sober amd attending therapy; I can reccomend you radical acceptance first; accept the situation as it is without judging your feeling as negative or positive. Now, second, I recommend mindfulness meditatio practice; try living simply and build up small habits that can gradually, slowly improve your state of being; as much as it hurts to say; build up slow routines and realistic goals and actually force yourself to commit to them, including your perception. I want you to start a small gratitude journal where you write a minimum of three things you are grateful each day; set a reminder for evening; also, build up a routine where you hit the gym; three times per week; then, each night, listen to a positive affirmation video on youtube; in the morning; write a list; begin small; with things you want to achieve; write down how, when and how long it will take you. Also, recommend volunteerint, helpin with chores, blabla; the idea is you will keep yourself busy, be active, release endorphins from sweating and actually change your mindset; as for therapy, it depends from person to person but eventually you are the only obe who can pull themselves forward.

My relationship with my partner is over but we are stuck living as roommates and co-parenting atm. Just started my thirs time in DBT Group last night.

I've kept myself from acting on it this long but I honestly don't know how much longer I can go. The loneliness and isolation is fucking horrible.

0,"Does your girlfriend have BPD traits, symptoms or a diagnosis?  Therapy can be tricky.  I generally find that therapy is a positive step for anyone who has some things they wish to work through regardless of any underlying conditions.  The only thing I would caution is that, unlike taking a pill for a headache, therapy is really only as effective as what you're willing to put into.  For anyone attending therapy, especially for the first time it's not uncommon to find out you need to work through some things you weren't even thinking about.  Sometimes you might leave a session feeling great and more relaxed, other times you may leave wishing you had never gone in the first place.  IMO the best thing any friend or partner can do for someone who's going to therapy is to give them the space they need or request but also be supportive and understand that sometimes going to therapy will at least temporarily leave them with more questions than solutions.  It's not a quick fix for anything but often a journey that can lead to many new and sometimes unrealized places.  Be patient, be supportive and honestly it never hurts for you to try some for yourself.  I think we believe that therapy is just the place where you go when you're feeling riddled with problems, but it really can and probably should be for everyone.  No one is perfect and no one is free of issues to work through our heavy challenges in their life.  Hope this helps.",ForgettableFacePlant,13i644y

0,"I've honestly been researching it for years and I think the data sucks on it.   It is a huge money maker so you need to be careful who you ask about it or what studies you look at.    I had one office promoting it like it was a God send and was not open to any other options.   Then kept throwing data from there own studies that are not accurate in the least.   I've also talked to many people that have done it and not one has had lasting relief.  Asked multiple therapists about it and not one lasting relief in their patients.   I feel there is a placebo effect in the beginning.    Lastly it is something that needs to be done everyday so unrealistic for people with very severe debilitating depression.   And better hope your insurance covers if fully because it is rediculously expensive.   It is basically a cash register for the offices doing this in high volume.   

I found major relief from depression using ketamine infusions.   Not the low dose prescription available but actual 45 min infusions at high does of 200mg.    Again probably saved my life during my most suicidal periods.   

I've considered ECT because so many people have gotten relief from major depression including many people ive met personally.   But for bpd it hasn't shown as much success and can make anxiety worse so that became a big no for me.  

The newest thing that has shown very effective in bpd is microdosing.   Sadly it is still only legal very few parts of the US.    Using mdma with therapy has shown major effectiveness in bpd.   Again not legal only in studies.   

Finally deep brain stimulation where they surgically implant a device to stimulate of the brain has shown very effective for depression in studies.   Has not been offered on any large scale or any fda approval for depression.",Ctoffroad,xk9d3q

Then I've gotten them in two places in Connecticut.    The last place is where they really started allowing higher doses.  

At this point there are many places in the US you can get them.    And they all have their own procedure for how to get you approved.   

They also now have SPRAVATO which is a ketamine nasal spray.   I've tryed various ketsmine nasal sprays and even tabs all by prescription and none of them had the same effect as the ketamine infusions.  

But the spravato is approved for insurance to cover it so it is worth trying being so much cheaper.   Most insurance will not cover any infusions and they are still very expensive.   And because a change in my income this year I can no longer afford them.",Ctoffroad,xk9d3q

Definitely more then a few times I had a troubling experience almost like a bad trip.  But Definitely introspective.    Lot of people report during the infusion as seeing their life in a much clearer light.   So I think for someone with bpd this can be pretty enlightening.    

The one thing that is awesome even if I feel like I'm freaking out you can just stop the infusion and will start coming down within ten minutes.   Unlike when I had a really bad trip on shrooms many years ago just had to wait it out.   I had a bad experience where I ended up in protective custody in jail while tripping.

11,"Wow I had no idea that Europe is that conservative when it comes to prescribing.   Doctors dont want to prescribe Wellbutrin-lol.   

Obviously the US has a history of over prescribing such as opiates.    So they went from overprescribing to the point you could get a opiate pain killer for a stubbed toe to now people thst legitimately need them for chronic pain cannot get them.   And then of course the US way over prescribes adhd meds which so many people abuse for various reasons and the doctors have so little oversight.

I do want to try a ayahuasca retreat to see if this can have a similar effect on the consciousness.   I'm scared shitless and keep putting it off thinking I might freak out and go running through the woods naked-lol.   But I think I need to give it a try for the depression.   Not sure if in Europe there is a way to try that.   It is legal in the us as long as it is mixed on site at the location of the retreat/ceremony.   If they transport mixed then it is illegal.

Or if I have an auto immune diesase or am I somatizing shit to this degree. Everthing is a puzzle, I feel no control or understanding of my body and don’t wanna keep existing really but If nothing else, I feel too responsible to my family to stay in this plane of existence.

18,"If you have chronic pain I would look to see if any ketamine pain management centers.   The effect on relieving chronic pain is amazing.   My doctor does a procedure where it is 5 hour infusion at 1500mg and basically puts you in a coma.   We'll it can actually change your pain receptors to just not experience the pain the same at least for a while.   

Off road accident I brokemy back in four places, broke most of my ribs, and shattered collar bone.    Was in the most pain of my life even with pain killers.   Well I happened to go for a infusion for my depression while I was in the extraordinary pain.   I think I was only at at 120mg at the time and it took all my pain away it was amazing.   They had me on every pain killer even fentanyl patch and nothing was as powerful as the ketamine in relieving my pain.

So yeah if you do have chronic pain maybe that there is a pain management somewhere thst would consider using it to treat your pain.   And you might benifit if you have depression as well.   Been used for pain management longer then depression so I think there is a chance you might find somewhere.",Ctoffroad,xk9d3q

I need to figure out first wtf is going on with my body because my chronic pain is not like neurological pain when there is no actual damage but there is damage in the joint plus pain. So some pain is actually necessary as a warning system but then again when we are anxious, a lot of cortisole is produced, which decreases pain treshold so we can in theory respond rapidly to a threat. Well this would help if we were chased by a bear but doesn’t help in current lifestyle we have. Sorry for jumping from one subject to another all the time.",Weird-Mall-1072,xk9d3q

I have no lasting pain which is amazing even with the broken back.    

But my head definitely messed up after the concussion and just made all my mental issues much worse.   

That sucks you have such lasting effects of pain.  And the pain is so complicated.   The other thing they have done for extreme cases of types or neurological pain they do a 5 day ketamine coma which they do mexico.   They do it in mexico becausw there is such a high rate of death it is not legal in the US.   But these are such extreme cases of pain where the person might as well be dead anyways.   Talken thousands of mgs of ketamine getting continuously pumped in and the patient is just fully strapped down.  Ketamine is definitely not used enough for chronic pain in my opinion.

2,"Unlike what edgy animes and action movies tell us, emotions are not useless. Emotions are integral to our survival as humans (and mammals). Emotions are rapid control signals in the brain that alert us to pay attention to something that is happening within us or around us. They are complex, full-system responses. Thus, changing any part of the system can result in changing the response. 

They have three major functions:

1. To motivate action. 

2. To communicate with others 

3. To communicate with ourselves 

Emotional behaviours evolved as immediate, automatic, and efficient ways to solve common problems for survival. 

Fear focuses us on escaping from danger. It organises our responses to threat for our life, health, or well being. 

Anger focuses us on self-defense, mastery, and control. It organises our responses to obstacles to important goals/activities or to imminent attacks to ourselves or significant others. 

Disgust focuses us on rejecting and distancing ourselves from an object, event, or situation. It organises are responses to circumstances or things that are offensive and contaminating. 

Sadness focuses us on what is valued, the pursuit of goals, and communicating to others we need help. It organises our responses to loss or someone or something important, and to goals lost or unattained. 

Shame focuses us on hiding transgressions and, if the transgressions are already public, in engaging in appeasement-related behaviours. It organises our responses related to personal characteristics or behaviour that are dishonouring or sanctioned by our own community. 

Guilt focuses us on actions and behaviours that repair a committed violation. It organises responses related to specific actions that have led to violation of values. 

Jealousy focuses us on protecting what we have. It organises responses to others who threaten to take away relationships or things very important to us. 

Envy focuses us on working hard to obtain what other people have. It organises our responses to others getting or having things that we do not have but want or need. 

Love focuses us on union with and attachment to others. It organises our responses to reproduction and survival. 

Happiness focuses us on continuing activities that enhance pleasure and personal + social value. It organises our responses to optimal functioning of ourselves, people important to us, or the social group we're part of. 

Emotions are *not* facts. If we assume that our emotions represent facts about the world, we can end up using them to justify limited thinking patterns or damaging behaviours to ourselves and others. Whilst there is no right way to feel in every situation, there are emotions that are effective and ineffective for problem solving.",ladyhaly,1153ypl

0,">The DBT therapist I spoke with today said I could not attend other therapy while in the program due to the fact that it could interfere with the DBT program.

This is true. It's the same for the DBT course I'm attending now. From what you've mentioned, everything seems to be on board with what is the official structure of DBT per Marsha Linehan. Linehan herself had BPD and it was her life goal to figure out how to get out of hell herself so she can help others. CBT is known to be ineffective for DBT as the process can be invalidating of emotions brought on by trauma. It's currently known to be effective amongst a lot of participants with various socio-economic backgrounds — particularly participants struggling with chronic suicidality and/or self harm.

Talk with your current therapist about it. She may be able to help you process what the effective behaviour is based on your goal for treatment.",ladyhaly,10e49ee
1,"CBT on top of DBT is too much. If your program is like mine (1 hour 1-to-1 therapy and 2 hours of group therapy every week) then you will have processing conversations with your DBT therapist during individual sessions.

I'm not sure what would you say are the primary symptoms and difficulties you live with today - but DBT really works well for improving some issues, like if you cope by self harm, or often find yourself fighting and angry with people, or history of suicide. DBT covers a lot more than that, but depending on your needs, it's not the right treatment for everyone.

However, having a therapist you ""trust"" and feel some connection and progress with - that is actually one of the very best signs for a hopeful result, and I would be very cautious to make any change if it means giving that up. I have nothing against DBT or CBT, but I would not stop your current situation as long as you feel hopeful about it and it feels effective.",TranZeitgeist,10e49ee

1,"I was told that trauma therapy is good but that I would be able to deal with it better after dbt therapy due to the fact that it helps you develop skills to process trauma and possibly be in a better headspace when you do. 

The reason for this is dbt focuses on mindfulness, emotional regulation, interpersonal effectiveness and distress tolerance. These are super helpful skills when navigating trauma and if you don't have very good coping mechanisms delving into traumatic experiences can be quite negative. 

The other thing to think about is are you ready to talk about it. I thought I was ready but it was really negative on my mental health to be consistently dealing with such big scary traumatizing subjects without the relevant skills I needed.

I remember being told that when I start dbt I won't be able to do trauma therapy or talk about specific issues that happened to me and I thought this is absolute crap. How am I supposed to get better without talking about specific experiences etc or trying to analyse things. But after doing some dbt and not focusing on the trauma but my responses to the trauma I was able to build stronger and better coping mechanisms. Also helped me learn how to identify emotions better and gave me a bigger vocabulary to use when talking to professionals and others for help. 

So now in the future when I'm ready and if I feel ready I feel I will have a better chance at understanding and coping with my emotions during specified trauma therapy.

Also dbt is great for ADHD, depression and anxiety too if you do decide to go down that avenue.",Ok-Farm-3225,zultjj

In my senior year, I was really struggling. Sometimes I didn't think I would make it.

When it comes to mental health problems it can be helpful to know that they overlap massively. While a adhd diagnosis is fitting when you are 15 BPD or autism spectrum could be more fitting when you are 25. So don’t get too hung up on the diagnosis. It’s mostly a tool for doctors to sort you into the best treatment program. 

As for medication there is a whole forest out there. Some are long term you take every day. Like people who get psychosis have to take some pills every day until they die pretty much. Others can have a medication available just when they need it. You learn with age what works best for you. You don’t have to eat a medicine to rely on it.

Stay away from benzoalpides and opioids though. People misuse them. As an example I rely on a substance called quetapine. It feels like sleeping in a garbage compressor and I get rigor mortis the day after. I will never be addicted to these, but they help when I start to spiral.

Second, your brain still has a decade of development left. There’s a lot going on at this time at this stage in life and it’s ridiculously overwhelming before we even get to the unique issues facing you & your peers.

There are a wide variety of medications used for mental health, but nothing is specifically meant for BPD. If you have other mental health issues, then medication is considered. Otherwise, standard of care is therapy. Is there a reason you’re against therapy? If it’s cost and maintaining confidentiality from your family about what you’re going through, have you considered a free app? I found some AI chatbot apps with a mental health focus called Wysa and Woebot (there may be more but I actually have tried those). I like having “someone” I can talk to 24/7. A lot of times just explaining things to an outsider helps me understand and process what I’m going through, and that’s really what the chatbot provides.

13,"Oof, I’m sorry 💕 Wanting to be understood seems like such a small thing,  but it can really make a huge difference.

Medications can be extremely helpful. From my personal experience, it’s not so much that I’m super depressed if I stop taking anti-depressants, it’s much more that my brain chemistry isn’t right to begin with. I don’t feel otherwise, or when I do it is so overwhelming and almost always negative. Taking anti-depressants gives me the shot at happiness everyone else gets, and I deserve it too. And so do you, if down the road you & your provider go that route. Side effects should be taken seriously and with a grain of salt. But it’s more correcting an issue that wouldn’t correct itself otherwise.

Therapy wise, you mentioned cognitive, as in cognitive behavioral therapy/CBT? I liked that a lot, but it wasn’t enough to help me on its own. I eventually was referred into Dialectic behavioral therapy/DBT, which covers 4 subjects: Mindfulness, Emotional Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Effectiveness. There are free online resources to help with DBT, and I definitely see a fair amount of questions that get posted to this sub. I also can’t say enough about just regularly talking about what you are feeling and thinking. Therapy is one way, another is journaling and writing. Heck, I wrote short fiction and poetry in high school and found great comfort in that.

I can relate; I was also told I was overly emotional and that it was a problem. And that I’d be continued to be treated like crap by other people if it didn’t change 😑 While my Dad & stepmom were supportive in getting me therapy, the situation at the time was that I was the one with issues and mental health problems. This has gotten better with them as I’ve gotten older/as an adult. Part of that is that having an adult relationship and distance from triggering events so that we could calmly be like yeah, we should have tried something different and not be defensive/assume that the other was being accusatory. My bio mother I’ve had to cut off more than once with good reason, she’s just great at finding a way to guilt or shame me into accepting messages from her. I don’t think I’d have survived to be an adult if I was in her care longer than I was. I wish I had some great advice but try to hold on. You’ve got so much to experience and do!

I heard that it is a chemical imbalance in my brian that doesn’t allow me to feel all the type of emotions cause i either dissociate or shit down. I can only really feel numbness, being down, or just euphoric. That’s why it’s just exhausting to talk to people in general.

My dad is still very abusive but he still loves us to death so i go from hating him to loving him and he’s just so unpredictable. That’s why i’m so hyper vigilant and just can’t function sometimes because he’s going to be behind me calling me stupid for every mistake i make. I want to change that when i start living by myself, and i want to learn how to be more kinder to myself. I don’t want to blame my parents fully cause their still learning and figuring out life, i just need to deal with this for less than 2 years and i’m out. I’ll save up enough money! I’m just hoping that my little sister is not too affected by my dad when i’m gone and i hope she doesn’t blame me either❤️My older sister is leaving next year and i can’t imagine being without her, i’m so scared but everything will happen and life will happen!

16,"You are welcome! One of the reasons I suggest a DBT program is because of the lack of motivation and how hard it can be to stay on pace. I am not sure how far I would have gotten on my own if I wasn’t required to show up like a class. I really like The Skillful Podcast (available on Spotify, iTunes) to remind me how I can apply the skills from DBT in everyday situations. DBT draws heavily from Zen Buddhism, which is another option for studying that doesn’t have to cost money. My city has free mindfulness groups—you may be surprised by what is offered in your area. To piggy back on that, yoga in addition to meditation, has been studied with positive results to help with PTSD symptoms. 

It could very easily be a chemical imbalance, or it could be that you’re in a really difficult situation and don’t have the skills to cope with it. It could be both! But you’re taking steps to take care of yourself, and that’s so important. That already gives you an edge over most your age. I have found in order to be kinder to myself, I had to change how I talked to and about myself. Calling myself stupid or an idiot doesn’t make anyone feel better and never helps the situation. 

It’s very hard when you know a parent loves you, but they are hurting you terribly. My bio mom believes she loves me and wants the best for me. She’s also petty af if disagreed with and has seriously impaired judgement in addition to treating her children as property. I also go back and forth between hate and trying to let go/forgive, and some days I hate her. My therapist has told me more than once that it’s okay and reasonable to hate her. I just prefer the days when I don’t care and just want nothing to do with her. Do your best & minimize situations that you can anticipate bad reactions for 💕 Is it “right” or “normal”? Probably not, but getting through the next two years is much more important! Who knows, if you can get a job you can be more independent, save up and get out when you’re ready.

The more we learn, the more we become aware, the more capable we are of change, but its a process. We have to retrain our brains, we have to be gentle with ourselves and patient. At least now we are aware, we can catch ourselves falling off and start doing little things differently that before we just didn’t know.

I spent twenty years trying to do something other than therapy. Religion,  AA, self help, you name it. Nothing really worked because my BPD traits would take over and get in the way of whatever help was really available through those paths. So many of those things were more attractive because they required less of me. They were exciting and offered emotional highs in a way therapy does not. All I had to do was ""surrender"" to the group beliefs and become dependent on other people in the group. That was very attractive to me.

With religion I would get these emotional highs like nothing else.  But the lows made me feel like God hated me and I was evil. I would split on every AA sponsor I had. I did stay sober but I was still out of control and miserable. Through self help I got so far into the anti-victimhood rhetoric that I believed when they told me I didn't really have BPD. But the behaviors kept happening and I just wound up hating myself for not being able to get it together.

19,"I’m so late to this post but I really hope the op sees it.

I think that if you were in therapy for six years and it did not progress I think you should’ve left your therapist sooner. Maybe you were scared to leave because of the attachment or the bond that you had or maybe you felt like there were no other options.  Either way never stay in a relationship that is not bringing out the best of you making you advancing like making progress just like a real relationship. Second you don’t have to quit therapy completely you can take a break now and go back later and just know that there are definitely therapists that can help you. The problem could be is that you need a therapist that use different techniques. The reason why therapists didn’t work out for certain people it’s because the techniques and theories that they use and how they see problems or situations. For example there is therapists that use a theory or theories where they focus more on teaching you to tell yourself a different story. Meaning we all tell ourselves how we see ourselves in our reality and sometimes the filter is very negative or limited therapists that use this theory will teach you tell yourself how you can see yourself in a better light lifting you up etc. Find a therapist that has a technique that works.

Do I believe that you should quit therapy completely? I don’t know. I feel like it really depends on where the person is in their life.

35,"I'll sure try. Like I said I've only had one session so idk if it's always the same or not.

My therapist started by letting me pick between music or water sounds and I chose the water. In the headphones the sound switches between the right and the left but in a smooth way. I listened to that the entire time.

She then had me start with some earth breathing and some heart breathing and I focused on feeling safe. Then she had me pick a feeling or situation that made me anxious and I chose how I feel like nobody believes me when I'm physically ill. It was easy to decide on that because it had been on my mind a lot lately. 

She then had me think about that feeling while following her finger on a horizontal line until I found a spot that made my anxiety felt the strongest. Then she did the same thing vertically. 

I had to keep my eyes on that spot and try to remember when I first felt that way about people not believing me. Surprisingly I was able to figure that out really fast. 

I think the next step was following her finger both ways again until I felt connected to that age. Im not positive on that wording though. Then she had me visualize and talk to that younger version of me. Which sounds silly now but at the time was really easy. 

I had to try and figure out how that younger me felt and communicate with her until she was starting to feel better. Then we did the finger following again and I dont quite remember what I was supposed to be feeling for it to stop. I think it was a safe spot. 

Then, keeping my eyes there, I kept talking to my younger self until both versions of me felt better. And then when I was ready we stopped that and I talked to my therapist about what happened. 

It was really emotional so it's hard for me to remember all the details. I felt really shaky after but also like a weight was off my shoulders. The memory I ended up using wasnt even something I had ever thought bothered me before but I guess it really did. 

On paper all of it sounds silly and embarassing but it didnt feel like it. I had to really trust my therapist. No mask, no shame. Compeltely let myself be vulnerable which is really hard for me.

I completely think it was worth it though. I didnt feel anxious at all for the rest of that day which never ever happens for me. I'm always slightly anxious. And ever since it's like my baseline for anxiety is down a notch or two. I feel a little stronger. 

We didn't do it this week at my session because I didnt feel ready for another one yet but we plan to next week. I have some big traumas that I'm terrified of dealing with but if just dealing with the little ones help this much I'm really hopeful about the future. 

The right therapist really makes a difference. 20 years, 5 therapists, 2 psychiatrists, multiple medications and this is the first physical difference I've felt. I've been seeing this therapist for about 2 years now so I already knew I trusted her before we started this. We spent a year getting me emotionally ready to handle this.

I think recovery is an ongoing process. It's like being addicted to a way of thinking instead of a substance. It's easy to fall into that way of thinking as a crutch when things get tough, even if you're fine without crutches right now. 

Then it's a matter of not letting a slip become a fall. That's where outside input is crucial. And I would argue, on an ongoing basis.

So, I have the luxury of being cis/het. I have only a small idea of what trans people go through, thanks to some friends of mine. I can't imagine dealing with that on top of mental crap. You're extremely strong and brave, I hope you know that! And, there is NOTHING wrong with you. Period. We humans come in all shapes, sizes, colors and sexual orientations. You'll see it in all of nature. You're exactly who you're supposed to be and one day you'll have your parts to match...if you're preop. ❤️

I thought about EMDR, but read some things similar to what you've described. I know exactly why I am the way I am, I felt it'd make me more hopeless, too. 
Seriously, try meditating for self acceptance. It is literally what I've had the most success with. I'm into an app called 'Tapping Solution' for guided meditations rn. It sounds corny af, but it works for me. There's a good bit of free content within the app, too. Honestly, I feel so strongly about meditation because it allows us to just BE for a little while. To realize we can be safe, relax, just breathe. 
That all of our feelings are ok to be felt and valid. They're natural. But, we can see them and feel them and just let them go, too. Not act on them. See clearly to make good choices. It allows us to validate ourselves in a healthy way. Which is the BEST validation. 

How I built a relationship with myself? I started talking to my inner child. Telling her that I had her back, then having it. That she did the best she could at the time with what she knew. That I (the adult) was here now, and I'd take care of her. And I delivered on that as best I could until it became habit. I loved me and stopped judging myself as best I could. I looked at the broken bits and reminded myself that the Japanese repair broken pottery with gold veins, to honor it. Because nothing is perfect, but it's all worthwhile. So, I did Kintsugi on myself, slowly but surely. 
I also wrote lists. Of what I like and don't like-morals, values, boundaries, food, etc. It helped me learn who I was and what's really important to me. I remembered that healing is not linear, and I will make more mistakes, too.

Please remember that you are not wrong or awful. We are all imperfect in this world, and we all have value.

From what my therapist told me is that I have a complete body dismorphia (for my body it makes sense since I have an Ed, anorexia)

0,"Volunteered for a 30 day lockdown after running away as a child.. I was 46 before I chose to get counseling again. My decision was made with the idea of becoming a better person for others. 
I was not scared of therapy or psychiatrists, rather the idea that I’ll be locked up or medicated. Not interested in either outcomes. (Although I actually loved my time in the hospital, I just cannot support my responsibilities if I’m locked up now)

Wanting to resolve many things I carry so I can be a better partner is why I committed to it. I knew I could learn some new tools for life too. 
Traveling for work pushed me to trying betterhelp since I’m never in my hometown. I cannot recommend this as trust is needed to really exchange on a beneficial level. Too difficult to build trust on a phone call, too easy for them to be drunk during your scheduled meetings. (Yah, that happened more than once)

I told my daughters to interview therapists, several. They will all have a style and method unique to themselves. Have a goal or two in mind as they need to know what you want (and they may not be any good at those things specifically) Also be aware of how you respond to different styles. 
(I will personally get turned off and disconnect if someone even begins to placate, or even be overly timid or kind in explaining things.. just be honest) 

Remember this next part for any service provider, doctor, car mechanic, mental health, home repair… you can and should change them if you’re not getting good results! 

But own your part in what isn’t working in your life. In your case learn what triggered you to ghost. You need to decide how to control or communicate whatever that is ,either to yourself, or to your chosen professional. I would suggest this is done as a function of one of your goals you express in meeting them. If you are unable to examine yourself like this then just tell them your story and ask them to help you stay invested in your wellness.",Wandering_SS,xqjhs3

I have 2 hours of DBT group therapy, one hour of personal therapy and sometimes additional things like working with a sleep specialist among other things. The country where I’m in makes the city pay for therapy so for me it’s free, I personally don’t think I would’ve done it if I had to pay. Usually DBT takes a year to complete (as it is advised to take all chapters twice) so it would probably be really expensive. I must say though, my treatment is great. It provides you with ways of thinking that will lessen your symptoms and gives a sense of control. Having 3+ hours of therapy is quite a lot though, practice takes time and effort and it’s pretty tiring. I definitely recommend DBT to anyone who can take it as it is the best known treatment method out there, as I think it’s an investment we should all make.",thedutchgirl13,ih08hw
2,"Yes I do. I have done the full DBT program twice. The first time it helped for a while but I ended up in a pretty bad place again after about 6 months. This last time It  pulled me out if depression completely and im basically in remission.  Depending on your life circumstances, life stressors, who your therapists are, etc I think it can have different outcomes BUT even if it may not cure you youll learn very valuable lessons and get some insight into why you do the things you do which is very validating and can help change your perspective on a lot of things. It really is a necessary treatment for BPD. Its so specific to us you just cant get that from regular therapy or medication. There are a lot of skills required to help reduce symptoms and dbt will teach you those. 

I am very lucky i live in canada so it was free for me both times. It may be worth it to see if there are any programs that are covered by your government or perhaps insurance. Any grants or other programs available maybe for low income individuals. I think its worth it but I dont know if I could afford that much either. I think its worth it to have a good research and make sure you exhaust the free options first but if this is the only option its a good investment for the future.

It was a 9 month program that consisted of weekly two hour group sessions and a weekly one hour private session. I was lucky that my insurance paid for it 100%. I am not cured, however, the coping skills, learning mindfulness, identifying my triggers and the emotions that caused them, severely impacted my life in a positive way. I know that I still have a lot of work to do in regards to CBT and EMDR, but I had to complete DBT in order to get those services. BPD is a life long diagnosis, but minimizing the impact the symptoms have on my life has allowed me to function much better, especially under stress. It was a game changer for me.",getphucked666,ih08hw
5,"I do everything apart from the phone calls as well. I have 45 minutes of one-on-one DBT therapy and one hour of DBT group with the same therapist + another DBT counselor. I'm lucky enough to have my parents support me through this but honestly, I would pay for it on my own if I had to. I still have bad days, but my life has honestly changed since I started DBT. The skills it teaches me are much more valuable than any other therapy I've ever had. There's definitely a reason DBT was designed specifically for BPD. It's unfortunate getting help can be so expensive, but I definitely think it might be worth it if you feel you need it.",,ih08hw
6,"It’s unfortunate that DBT costs so much and most insurances don’t cover it. But I think if you can figure out a way to make it work, you should try. DBT helped me learn coping skills I never learned from other therapies. Seeking treatment before my diagnosis was exhausting because I knew I needed to be helped,  nothing seemed to work. DBT taught me to be more introspective but in a healthier and more concrete way than letting my emotions always run the show. I honestly think it saved my relationship with my partner. 

I still have meltdowns- no where near as frequent and I can pull myself out of them more quickly - so what might have been a week long crisis before now lasts an afternoon. I don’t think anyone can ever fully “recover” to the point where you never experience symptoms again but for me, it minimized them tremendously and was more than worth the time and money I put into it.  

Some therapists will work with you on a sliding scale. Mine charges me $150 per week which I know is not her full cost, but I spoke with her about it and she does offer sliding scale options. It might be worth to inquire about that.",,ih08hw
7,"I do the full program and have been doing it for about a year now. It's been extremely challenging and I'm so glad I'm doing it. Mine costs about the same as yours would. My parents are helping me pay for it though which is amazing. I think it's worth it. 

I think the best part of it for me has been feeling like the people who are treating me actually know what I'm going through because it's specifically designed for BPD. Every other therapist I've seen has only been able to help me to an extent. They've either not understand the extent of my issues, or have understood but haven't used a treatment modality that really provided me with the skills I so desperately needed. It was frustrating. Now my therapist gets it, and I can finally be completely honest about how bad things really are, and know that I'll be supported through it and given tools to cope. 

Another thing I love is that it is making me feel incredibly self-sufficient in a way I haven't felt in years, or maybe ever. It makes me feel like there are always things I can do to help my current state, and so often these are things I can do on my own without dragging somebody else into my mess. It makes me feel hopeful for my future because I can envision myself living alone or with a partner and really managing well without having to rely on somebody else so heavily, and having healthy relationships with other people that are not codependent. 

What is hard about it though is how much work it is. I have threatened to quit so many times because it just felt like too much. It can be so exhausting. But I do think it's the best way forward, at least for me. I'm so glad I committed to it. It isn't a quick fix and that might be discouraging for people at times. It does require a lot of hard work, willingness, and for me it also required letting go and trusting my therapist completely, which was hard to do. I think my therapist has been amazing though and is a massive part of why it's working so well for me.",symmetryfairy,ih08hw

I still have overwhelming episodes but I am better at getting out of them now and they are not nearly as bad or happen as often. I actually applied for some kind of assistance or grant that covered most of the costs. I just had a copay so that’s unfortunate that it costs that much for you. I think I got lucky though.

1,"Dialectical behavioural therapy is known to be the most effective. Mindfulness is also apparently helpful as is therapy.

Aside from Dialectical behavioural therapy I personally don't find these options or meditation helpful in the slightest but, I'm a statistical outlier. I've turned to replacing bad memories with happy ones.

Everything I wished I could have had as a kid (and is realistically attainable) I'm giving myself as an adult. It has helped me enormously. Wanted a safe space? Got my own place. I didn't have enough good growing up, I now hoard a few weeks of canned food to remind myself that I won't go hungry. I could add more examples but they'd be redundant.

Donating all my possessions that reminded me of my former life and buying a new wardrobe and cutting my hair + changing my style also helped me redefine myself.

From what I understand from my research into the subject BPD is caused by an unstable sense of self caused by lack of reassurance and attention growing up. I think that redefining one's self and getting reassurance/love is the best way to heal. In the research papers I've read, the best way to heal is to address any other diagnoses first. I have CPTSD and am addressing it before I try to deal with the hell which is BPD.

Hopefully this is insightful! 💜",ClaraClear333,13zzrv9

Having it written down, I can get my thoughts in order and that feeling that I'm going to let her down or burden her is lessened because we made an appointment to talk about it.

Well anyways I had this continued belief that I was responsible.   That I could of done this to save him or that.   I was apsolutely convinced with some of conversations we had prior to his suicide that I'd somehow encouraged him just by talking about my own depressions.   

So what we did was use that as my trigger if you want to call it that.   And you basically just talk about around that.    And you do a 1-10 scale saying how responsible I am for his suicide and I think I was a 8 being responsible.   Well after just once long session of emdr this suddenly went to a 3 after years of feeling so responsible all of a sudden a switch went off and I no longer felt I was.   And that extreme feeling of responsibility has never come back.  It was pretty amazing how it worked because prior thst it was years of speaking about it in therapy etc and never any different.   

Now his daughter committed suicide 3 years ago and I started feeling responsible for that.  Like I should of tryed to be more involved in her life etc but I was able to dissipate thst pretty quickly.",Ctoffroad,wy7ry0

And with that, everything gets worse and it starts to hurt them and the people around them. 

Make sure you are in as stable a state of mind as possible before even considering transitioning. Once you feel your BPD is under control, make sure you still feel the same way and that your problems truly are stemming from gender dysphoria. If you can determine that, be confident you can commit to the change, and can get the go ahead from therapists, go for it.

Just do NOT start idolizing it as a solution.

Types of psychotherapy that have been found to be effective include:

* **Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).** DBT includes group and individual therapy designed specifically to treat borderline personality disorder. DBT uses a skills-based approach to teach you how to manage your emotions, tolerate distress and improve relationships.
* **Schema-focused therapy.** Schema-focused therapy can be done individually or in a group. It can help you identify unmet needs that have led to negative life patterns, which at some time may have been helpful for survival, but as an adult are hurtful in many areas of your life. Therapy focuses on helping you get your needs met in a healthy manner to promote positive life patterns.
* **Mentalization-based therapy (MBT).** MBT is a type of talk therapy that helps you identify your own thoughts and feelings at any given moment and create an alternate perspective on the situation. MBT emphasizes thinking before reacting.
* **Systems training for emotional predictability and problem-solving (STEPPS).** STEPPS is a 20-week treatment that involves working in groups that incorporate your family members, caregivers, friends or significant others into treatment. STEPPS is used in addition to other types of psychotherapy.
* **Transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP).** Also called psychodynamic psychotherapy, TFP aims to help you understand your emotions and interpersonal difficulties through the developing relationship between you and your therapist. You then apply these insights to ongoing situations.
* **Good psychiatric management.** This treatment approach relies on case management, anchoring treatment in an expectation of work or school participation. It focuses on making sense of emotionally difficult moments by considering the interpersonal context for feelings. It may integrate medications, groups, family education and individual therapy.",,l3a4ll

I haven't had a good run with therapy. I lasted 2 sessions with the last psychologist I went to because after telling her what I was diagnosed with and spilling my guts to her for 2 hours her great advice was ""maybe you need to calm down a bit and not take things so seriously"". The therapist before her got me to visualise stuffing all my emotions into a box and hiding the box in a room in a house. The psychologist before that (that I was seeing in the lead up to my divorce) was the clichéd TV psych who sat across from me with a note book and repeatedly asked me ""and how does that make you feel?"". For like 6 months that was essentially all she said to me.

4,"Focusing on my faith (contextual Christianity), learning how to self regulate (coping skills, moderating my sensory inputs, finding creative outlets), and learning how to spend time by myself all really made a difference. I had hotlines programmed into my phone so if I felt like I was losing someone I could safely spiral with a counselor to pull me back to shore, even if it was three AM and my therapist wasn't available. Self talk is also very good to practice  but I'm honestly still not good at that yet so idk if it's relevant.

To elaborate, out of all of these, learning to spend time with myself was the hardest of all the things on this list. When it originally started, I had been hospitalized for over a month so it wasn't exactly my choice to be alone, but the experience had made me have a full on meltdown and really made me realize that I had been depending on others for emotional regulation. I had thought I depended on them a little, maybe even too much when I was having a hard time, but that I had it under control. Being forced to be alone made me realize it was a way bigger problem than that.

&#x200B;

That said I wouldn't suggest going cold turkey to anyone, it's very stressful and if you don't have the supports in place it's more likely to cause harm than anything, but rather, I would suggest setting up activities for yourself that you like but have them be done alone. I like sewing, and that was my first 'lone' activity. When I was sewing my door was closed, my schedule was determined, my phone was on silent. 15 minutes, then thirty, then an hour.

Then I began walking around my neighborhood. Extremely scary for me, the thought of that, but I picked familiar musicals and listened to them in one ear as I walked, and I got my daily dose of oxygen and sunlight. I tried cooking and painting and crochet and doing sit ups and yoga and reading, and dancing, and meditation and a whole bunch of other crap (the messiest was paper making with a bullet blender).

I never made it the point to be a genius at any of that stuff but rather it was the point to increase my endurance against that ""I should call X right now"" ""I wish I was in a discord video chat"" ""no but I really need to show what I made to someone and see if they like it"".

Eventually, I tried taking more risks by making life decisions without trying to figure out what people would ""want"" me to do. I just picked my own haircut and got it, I picked a job that was out of the norm for women in my community, I made doctors appointments about ""minor"" stuff my anti-pharmaceutical family would expect me to brush off, and I argued with my therapist if I thought I wasn't being taken seriously.

&#x200B;

The results varied, I hated my hair dyed black and I didn't like working for one particular warehouse, and I did have to swallow my pride and admit my therapist was right about some things, but I got through those moments and I learned a lot about myself and suddenly it didn't seem like such a big deal if someone abandoned me because I could do a lot all by my lonesome and I had all of these little achievements now to look back on whenever I felt insecure. It helped me to take the pressure off of relationships.

&#x200B;

I have used dbt and cbt and even emdr and all those things were helpful and important but I think in therapy/treatment there's a lot of focus on thinking and not enough focus on action when most of life is like...doing stuff, y'know? doing activities all by myself really made that sink in and now my stress levels are way better when my brain says ""what if they leave us?""

14,"Still unacceptable, in my opinion, especially coming from people who know that ""get therapy"" doesn't mean anything and that it includes assuming the person isn't already in therapy (which I am, for 15 years by now). 

I'd prefer if people blocked me instead of giving that response of ""you again"", as if I had the control to go to therapy whenever I want. I blocked this person that also added that they would report me. It's completely careless to try something like that.

edit: also, that was not the case because 2 of my posts were just to myself, as a journal kind of thing, and the others were divided between other subreddits.

edit 2: and if they were just annoyed (like I was many times and also a few of those I took it out on others when I shouldn't have), it is still unjustified.

edit 3: I just checked and they commented immediately on my first post, by the way. so there is no ""alibi"" for their careless approach.. in my opinion.

I think self-help material is highly underrated, especially when the reality is that some of us will never have a feasible opportunity to work with a qualified therapist. They honestly feel like unicorns at this point, at least from my perspective.

0,"You're not done with the work you need to do. There's still a lot of skill gaps present. You're not engaging in Fight mode when faced with emotional threats anymore but you're stuck doing Freeze and Fawn.

The Fawn part is particularly problematic because you're stuck people pleasing. The cost of this is you feel bad about yourself after the interaction... There is loss of self-respect. The communication style that you're using right now is entirely passive and your boundaries remain weak and easily transgressed. You will need to learn how to clarify your priorities in any given interpersonal interaction and be assertive.

I understand this is easier said than done. I am still working on it myself — being a people pleaser too. The DBT Interpersonal Effectiveness module has been really helpful for me. Even with my familiarity with the skills and the support of my coaches and therapist, I still make mistakes. When I make requests or say no, I still minimise what I'm expressing even when I've made a script and practiced. If we don't change our habits and learn the skills to fill in the gaps, we will continue losing self respect and we will remain palatable to people who benefit from our lack of boundaries.

2,"It seems like one of your core beliefs is that you are inherently unworthy. The people pleasing perhaps developed to make you feel better by being appreciated for a little while in the short term, but in the long term it affects you as a form of abandonment and betrayal of yourself.

There is indeed still a lot of work to do. Enlist your therapist to help you in this. The existing relationship dynamic with your mother is troubling and unhealthy. It seems that when she punishes you for not complying to her unreasonable demands, despite knowing she is being unfair, you still internalise it.

I can relate to that with my mum — and what clicked was that I was seeking her approval, her unconditional love, and intimacy when she was incapable of it. Being subject to the whims of an emotionally immature person forces me to be emotionally immature as well. The truth was that I didn't need her permission nor her approval to be worthy of love. I already am. Getting caught up in an enmeshment dynamic with her undermined my personal and psychological growth for the sake of making her feel better. Under the surface, I had emotionally become the parent and she had become the child. 

Developing insight takes time, but it will eventually happen so long as you don't prefer the illusions in place that make you believe what's comfortable is what's safe. If we're hopeless to the point of our instinct being warped against the strongest instinct  (survival), then we are not safe. There are lies around our personal narrative, our sense of identity, that we need to confront and break through to grow beyond.",ladyhaly,11azce7

i guess it's hard because of this since even though i am a quite opinionated and strong feeling person, i have zero conviction in my own actions and judgements. i constantly second guess myself or think that i'm wrong. and if one person says i'm wrong, i believe it with my whole heart, even when there is evidence to the contrary.",pastelxbones,11azce7

I'm sorry you have to go through that too. At least we can understand each other — and anyone else here who can relate to us. I felt like this for a long time too — and sometimes, I still do. If we think about it in depth, it makes sense. We had to grow up and take on the role of the parent, the adult, whilst being children. No child is capable of actually doing that without losing their childhood and the opportunity to get to know ourselves for who we are. We had to adapt and perform to roles that were forced unto us without being even given the training nor the tools nor the time to learn. Now we still have our inner child who never got the resources that should have been given to them growing up. We have this huge skill and experience gap that we need to problem solve. 

>but when i come across someone who is emotionally immature, i sink right down to their level and i let people disrespect me until i finally snap and then i leave the situation looking like the bad guy.

I can relate to this too. The hardest thing about setting boundaries are the people who ignore them and walk all over them. It's not usually a problem with people who are emotionally mature and respectful because they listen. It's the people who disrespect us that we have to stand up to. The only thing we can do is keep trying. It's like when we learn to walk. We don't end up walking right away. We usually start off being clumsy and falling a lot of times — but we keep trying and eventually we get there. When we're learning, we don't berate children for not doing it. We give encouragement and positive reinforcement. We can do the same thing for ourselves. Once we can do it, there is a transition period to learning and then just knowing. We cannot skip learning before knowing.

>i guess it's hard because of this since even though i am a quite opinionated and strong feeling person, i have zero conviction in my own actions and judgements. i constantly second guess myself or think that i'm wrong. and if one person says i'm wrong, i believe it with my whole heart, even when there is evidence to the contrary.

We grew up constantly looking for environmental cues — usually from our parents — to know what's right. The goal posts change. This is part of the wiring from that. We had to. As children, we were dependent on the care of our caregivers to survive. Now that we're adults, it doesn't serve us anymore. We don't need to rely solely on them anymore. We have choices. We can work on our own long term goals so we go from just surviving to thriving. Our parents may want us to keep relying on them because it benefits them, but we are capable of advocating for what benefits *us* now.

We were helpless kids and we adapted to our environment when we had nothing. What more now that we have more choices, more resources as adults? We were conditioned  to believe we are incapable and worthless — and it's all a lie. If we look into ourselves, we'll see evidence of our own resourcefulness and resilience.",ladyhaly,11azce7
5,"you're very insightful, thank you for writing this.

it's very difficult accepting that this will not be an overnight change, it's a long journey and i'm bound to make mistakes along the way.

it's especially hard because the social messaging i've received and even the conflict i've had in some relationships has been that i need to go to therapy and fix it immediately or i'm a bad person, but i've been in therapy for five years and i've made very slowwwww progress. granted, my first few therapists sucked, and i spent all of college struggling to meet my basic needs and simply survive.

but also the part where you said we don't berate children for not knowing something they haven't been taught or for making mistakes while learning. that's the thing, i was berated harshly for these things by my mother and some teachers too.

my mom is a hairdresser with a wide social net, so anytime i've done something wrong or been inadequate or even just did something she personally didn't like she would tell everyone - clients, other parents, teachers, my peers, my extended family (her in-laws), sometimes strangers or whoever would listen. she used public shaming against, and still does now that i'm an adult. she also still brings up mistakes i made as a child and i'm turning 23 in a few months.

unfortunately this type of public shaming is also built into our culture, has been for thousands of years and it's even easier now with the internet. so i'm really scared that when i do something that someone else doesn't like, including setting boundaries, they will twist the narrative and tell other people. they will use their social capital against me.

and i have had this happen in college too so it's not just isolated to my mother. my senior year, after falling out with three people in my friend group, rumors were spread about me. everyone i knew turned against me, and i was almost completely socially isolated after a suicide attempt. i still don't really know how i made i through that period in my life other than frequent self harming and being high through class and work and every other second of the day admittedly.",pastelxbones,11azce7

1,"DBT hasn't helped me much for different reasons.  But just want to chime in, DBT isn't meant to help you get better, really, it's strictly meant to help you control your symptoms as a first step so that you can participate in therapy that will help you get better. There's nothing wrong with skipping that step, it's just for many people they participate in many traditional therapies but have symptoms that are too severe and don't get much out of those. It really just depends  on where you are and what you need at the time.  


Schema and EMDR therapies are specifically for trauma and both are well studied and effective.  Group psychodynamic therapy is honestly DBT with a different steps, but more meant for people who are acutely suicidal (or just struggling with addiction) to help them work passed their immediate issues while you search for an individual therapist to take you on.

6,"I'm a firm believer that its important to build a foundation or reference of safety which is why SSP and EMDR are excellent starting points. SSP particularly is an excellent tool that works with vagus system on a physiological level to regulate threat and danger. EMDR is excellent for installing a safe place and processing difficult memories, feelings and experiences. Having a safety reference point is important for us to continue with further therapies as being in our window of tolerance allows us to absorb more and process what needs to be healed.

Think maslows hierarchy of needs, you can't move up the scale till your basic needs are met. Physiological and then safety being the very basis and from then on up you can work on the other things that come up.

I have found MBT to be an excellent program that almost combines the skills needed to be able to understand our issues and thus be on our road to healing. It genuinely is the first form of therapy that gave me some level of hope.

I don't think there's one size fits all approach, but for me, I've found that gaining an insight into my condition, but from a reference point of safety and utilising the arsenal of tools that I have learnt via CBT, DBT, MBT and standard trauma therapy to be most effective.",,vyz9tj

0,"I went to therapy. Thought it would be awesome and it was shit. I wish I’d kept my guard up and set more distant boundaries.
In saying that, I will try again because I don’t know what else to do and I have a strong drive to work on myself.
My advice is:
1. ask a lot of questions. Steer the therapy towards what you think will help you. 
2. Set clear boundaries with your therapist. If there are things you don’t want to talk about, say I don’t want to talk about it. If you don’t agree with their perspective, say I don’t agree with your perspective. If you don’t feel connected and you want another therapist, say it loud and clear.
3. explain your inner world (thoughts/feelings) and how that relates to the outer world (people, things, events). This really helps therapists understand you and how you relate to the world.
4. Focus on what you want to achieve/learn/change rather than listing all your symptoms/problems. This may or may not seem like a subtle difference to you but it’s a big difference to the assessor. If you frame it in terms of what you want to achieve rather than listing the problems in your life, they might perceive you as having insight into your behaviours and this might lead to more options when it comes to treatment.
5. We are in a vulnerable position because there are not a lot of therapy options out there. Be aware of that but don’t let yourself settle for something you’re not happy with. This was my mistake.
For reference, I did 6 months CBT for an eating disorder (loved my therapist, hated the therapy). Then I did 1 year SFT (hated the therapist), 8 months general psychoanalysis (loved my therapist but couldn’t stay), and then 2 months STEPPS in a group (liked it, a mini DBT).
Sorry if I’m a bit jaded. There a very good therapists out there but there are also bad therapists too. But also good ones!

1,"i would look for a therapist skilled in dbt - supposedly it’s therapy made to target bpd but i’ve also read that some ppl feel like it’s just making them more tolerable to other people, not other people more tolerable to them. 

anyways, my story. 
i went to therapy when i was 17. i didn’t even know what bpd was (but i had 8/9 symptoms at the time) so i was doing just like normal therapy. was the worst thing ever. i hated it, i hated my therapist, my dad hated bringing me. waste of my time. then my therapist broke my trust and invited my dad to have a session w me even though i was not comfortable with that. that was the last time i saw her. (i did about 6 weeks of therapy.) 

i just scheduled my first therapist appointment with a therapist who is trained in dbt. im going to get her professional opinion on whether or not i have it (i’d be really surprised if i don’t.) im so so so nervous, especially after last time, but if i can do it, you can too. be prepared to tell your entire life story. and it’s ok not to trust your therapist initially, but if it’s been several sessions and you still can’t trust them, it may be time to see a new therapist. good luck <3",sapphiccerise13,sbf17t
2,"I’ve been in treatment since I was 15 when things were really bad and my BPD was festering. I have the privilege of getting help when I was a minor and it really changed me for the better. I still have bpd, its not something I can ever change, but I’ve been learning how to regulate my emotions and heal. So, here are some things I think everyone with BPD should know.

-Don’t let a couple bad therapist deter you from getting help. Someone once told me, “finding a good therapist is like dating. You just keep looking and trying different people until you find the one.” I went through like 5 therapist until I found one that respected my boundaries and didn’t enable me. I’ve been seeing that therapist for ~4 years now and shes helped me a lot. Its one of those processes you have to be committed to in order to enjoy the benefits. 

-A quote I base my recovery on, “The measurement of success is effort.” As long as you make an effort to change unhealthy learned behaviors or patterns that hurt yourself or others, then that’s enough. You can’t change over night. Give yourself time and validate the little wins. 

-No one can help you other than yourself. For a long time while I was in treatment I was learning a ton about DBT and different ways to help myself cope but I never used what I learned in my day to day life. It wasn’t until I saw how much my destructive, self sabotaging behavior effected my boyfriend that I realized I needed to take things more seriously. I was hurting the people I loved, intentional or not, and I started to hate myself for it. At some point I couldn’t just cry and sulk anymore. I started to work on how I communicate and became more aware of how I was talking to people. Through working on myself in therapy I’ve become more emotionally mature and have been with my boyfriend for nearly 3 years.

-Don’t let what people say about bpd on the internet get to you. I can’t tell you how many comments I’ve seen of people villianizing people with bpd. They’ll justify the comments with personal experiences of someone who likely has BPD paired with narcissism. Not all of us are like that. Many of us have been the victims of abuse. They will never understand what its like to have your brain chemistry change and live with the idea that abuse is normal behavior. Don’t let someone who is ignorant make you feel less than.

-Lastly, find what works for you. DBT not helping? Totally valid. If you can find a healthy outlet to help yourself grow then absolutely do that. Don’t let others judge you for getting the help you deserve.",neuroraven,sbf17t
3,"I’ve been in therapy since I was 7. It can be all kinds of things, and it all depends on what specifically you are looking for in this moment. 

My advice would be to do your research about your therapist’s specialties. Do they do EMDR (a specific trauma treatment)? Do they have experience with BPD and DBT treatment? Do you know the difference between CBT and DBT? (DBT is the gold standard for us Borderlines!) 

Before you go to therapy, take some time to sit in silence with yourself. What are things about yourself that distress you? What do you want to work on? what are the traumatic events that have shaped you? What do you want to let go of? Use this list as a reference point for your sessions. 

For the first few sessions, be ready to just give a loooooot of history and background to the therapist. This will help them understand who you are and what you need. 

additionally, understand that you have agency over who your therapist is. Don’t quit just because it gets hard, but if your therapist isn’t working for you (homophobic, overly religious, not understanding of your mental illness, etc) don’t be afraid to find a new one. 

good luck! And congrats on this new step. ❤️",youjustwannayell,sbf17t

It can’t for sure be cured, when you just try to treat the symptoms. It’s like struggling with acne. You can have the best ointments for your face, that you will use daily, but the illness is still there till you treat your hormonal imbalance. Same here. For me I don’t see a point in getting diagnosed it, till people with BPD are treated like all other people with post traumatic disorders and are going to be able to get trauma therapies. Then, after my problems will be properly treated, even if not completely cured, I could think about DBT. But this won’t happen when there will be still so many ahole “scientists” that will gatekeep us.

8,What are trauma therapies? Can someone not just ask to be provided the kind of therapy they think could help them?,Recent-Trouble62,sbf17t
9,"There are a lot of different. I know that a minority of people with BPD are getting the EMDR therapy, but that’s it. When you look at c-ptsd and for example the trauma recovery model where you go through three stages: „1) Establishing safety
2) Remembrance and mourning for what was lost
3) Reconnecting with community and more broadly, society“ quoted this from Wikipedia. The therapy focuses on safety, self-regulation, self-reflective information processing, traumatic experiences integration, relational engagement and positive affect enhancement. This sounds in some cases similar to DBT, but still trauma focused, but this is something that’s used for C-PTSD. I’m still working on learning all the different practices so that I can try do find the one that seems to be most suitable for me an look for books so I can work with them on my problems. 

I don’t know, it could be a problem with getting it paid by the insurance. Some therapists are very kind and write instead of Borderline C-PTSD, because borderline can cause a lot of problems with getting hired in different fields and some other future insurances regarding work and health in my country, because it’s still known as not curable. So maybe if I would be lucky with my therapists, they would not even save me from those issues regarding my work life, but also make it possible for me to get a proper trauma therapy first. But like I’ve said, this is luck and would be very risky",Seraphina_Renaldi,sbf17t

1,"I second DBT. EMDR has also been recommended to me. I'm currently on four different psychiatric medications and still struggling hard every day with my symptoms. My meds help with some of my other diagnoses but nothing really touches BPD. I have been in individual therapy for 8 months, spent 5 weeks in partial hospitalization, and have been in group therapy now for about a month. I'm waitlisted for a DBT program and hoping a spot will open for me soon because I'm hanging by a thread here.",AdEquivalent513,sk03ok
2,Well therapy isn’t going to “cure” you unfortunately. It just teaches you how cope with things properly. You can definitely start some medications to help with the depressive part of things. As others have said meds don’t really do much for the overall but sometimes they can help particular symptoms. Actual therapy would typically be a DBT program or a regular therapist who implements DBT skills. An actual DBT program can be challenging and sometimes feel complicated for some people even when they’re really dedicated so if you try that first and feel like it didn’t fully help you a more personalized therapist who’s trained for BPD patients could be more helpful. It is going to be a lengthy process with ups and downs no matter how you look at it. There’s no 2 week program where you come out a new person. Therapy for bpd relies on working out why you have these reactions and working out a lot of the damage that caused you to form these behaviors. It takes time. Meds for depressive symptoms that come with it will probably work the quickest (a couple weeks to a month or two assuming it’s an SSRI) so that you feel stable enough to continue the path of recovery.,whitedoggal,sk03ok

6,"Therapy has helped a little bit. Partial hospitalization gave me the most benefit, just in terms of learning to be more self aware and discovering topics that I didn't know I was battling, like grief. I was able to really explore things more in depth there, which has made individual and group therapy more beneficial overall. I also made some really great friends during my time in partial, who are a key part of my support system now. 
I do wish things could be progressing faster, but I'm super fortunate to have a husband who is managing everything else in our lives while I focus on my wellness and recovery. Once I get into the DBT program I'm hopeful that I will see more change.",AdEquivalent513,sk03ok

0,"I'm proud of you. That's a courageous move and (I speak from experience) will help you in the long run. 
Be prepared for when you start unpacking-it can get emotionally hectic. I got 'worse' before I got better. If you don't meditate, I'd recommend starting that habit before you dive deep; it'll help keep you centered. Once you start breaking down the walls of compartmentalization, shit gets real. I started crying, constantly (hadn't been able to for about 20 yrs). I got angrier for a while, too. Makes sense, when you're finally starting to face WHY you feel and act the way you do. <-'you' as a plural pronoun-not you, particularly! Talk therapy didn't help me at all. 

Are you seeing a T who's got experience with trauma issues? I found shadow (always been a fan of Jung) and schema work particularly helpful, along with DBT. 

To actually answer your question--yeah, I took a hand in what I wanted to work on/discuss with my T. It's a really good idea, as it helps them help you! If they react poorly or think it won't be helpful, it lets you know they're not a good fit for you.",,wrm423

highlight everything else she can do. offer fun activities before or in between or after. if it's like a outpatient thing, offer to take her to fast food or ice cream or something intermittently. make plans with her friends far in advance so she has something to look forward to

I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on my son the older he gets. if I start seeing the signs, I'm throwing his little booty right into therapy. I may not be able to stop him from getting it, but I can sure as hell do something about it before it ruins his life.",Lani515,uvu4nv

7,"This is so helpful! Great point on the bribery and planning fun stuff around and between it. That will make a big difference for sure.

Thank you so much for the personal insight! Yes, this is a highly regarded program. I really think she'll be greatly helped by giving it a shot. It's that giving it a shot that I'm trying to get. And as you said, the fact that she's 14 is an extra challenge.",Past-Cookie9605,uvu4nv
8,"I totally agree which is why I don't want to force her, I want to inspire her. So I'm looking for tips how to do that 

She can't get through a single day of school without me getting her at some point and is constantly in despair and has no friends. She starts high school next year and at this rate I don't see her getting past 9th grade. We love her so dearly and want her to understand this is an opportunity and not a punishment. 

I hoped maybe someone here had family who successfully suggested a DBT program? If so, how did they bring it up?

If she's flat out against it, it won't do any good. I get that. We don't want her to experience anymore extra misery.",Past-Cookie9605,uvu4nv
9,"> It’s a worry they’re diagnosing this so young tbh

Stop please. This is all a myth. BPD exists and is identifiable under 18. About 50% of teens diagnosed with BPD do not meet the diagnosis after about 2 years, but treatment and education early in the course of illness can allow for less life disruption in the long term.",TranZeitgeist,uvu4nv
10,"Oh that’s familiar. My poor dad was so desperate he followed everyone’s advice. A teacher of mine suggested my behaviour was due to hormones and putting me on birth control would help but instead it caused me years of negative side effects, mistrust in authority, and made a young me feel even more invalidated. 

I have come a long long way but I use to be the most defiant, rebellious, non-apologetic teen and I would burn literally any mental health care professional in my site as soon as they made me feel misunderstood or seemingly minimised my suffering. It’s so hard to learn to trust again after feeling so let down by a system when you’re only a child and need help. 

Even though I’m older now and not fighting the world as a defence mechanism I still have that inner rebel and when I looked into Marsha and even in detail how badly she was treated (tortured even) in her youth it really inspired me and filled me with faith in DBT. 

Even though this is my experience I am not assuming you’re daughter to be like I was, just giving a my personal example. I hope it can help in any way.

Good luck!",Icy-Tie-7638,uvu4nv
11,"I'm so happy for you guys!! finding a good program is really tough. I hope you can warm her up to the idea for sure! 

when you tell her try to sell it. you don't want to have an immediate shut down. 

like, ask if she had other specific things planned and then see how she feels about going to the program. something along the lines of

""what all did you have planned this summer? ""
""xyz""
""alright, I would like you to hear my whole offer before saying anything.... we found a program, it is __ long. you said you wanted to xyz? we can definitely try to plan with that in mind/fit it in. I know that it doesn't sound very fun, and it isn't compared to xyz. the program is (time, place, how often .)  I would like to negotiate with you, if you went to the program, would you like to get (insert fav food here) after (enter how often and when)? I'm open to suggestions. we can ask (friend) if they will do xyz with you (sometime in between, or after). do you have any questions for me? ""

you don't want to ""you are going to this program and you are going to like it 😡"" you wanna try and work with her, if she feels like she has no control it will spiral so try to give her as much control as you can. of course somewhere in there you highlight why you want her to go, without being accusatory. ""going will help you feel better"" vs doing better in school or friendships etc 

I'm wishing the best, it's just a suggestion for outlining the intro. you know your kid best! I hope that it goes as smoothly as possible",horseonthemoon,uvu4nv
12,"All I can suggest is to point out the potential benefits.  Tailor your delivery to whatever her BPD blocks her from.

OP, whether she's ultimately convinced to go or not, know that I'm proud of you for recognizing that your daughter needs help and encouraging her to get it.

I’m pretty good at being able to identify it myself but only well after I’ve already done it and reflecting on why I’m such a little shithead and feeling regret. 🙃

Actually deadass considered canceling my session today because I have nothing new to discuss since last week that I’m willing to share with her at the moment (and maybe that Is problematic and suggests we don’t have a great relationship) and I highly doubt she’ll provide any insight or ask questions they make me reflect on my behavior of the last week. 

I digress. But on the plus side, I do feel better since I started therapy and am just kind of vibing rn. Like I’m more satisfied with how I’ve been dealing with myself and other things lately, just from having reflected on them, and I don’t feel like I need it as much as I did just a few weeks ago.",justfoxice,u8rntm

4,"Yeah! I have an extensive psych background and honestly feel annoyed that she doesn’t probe me more. Like her silence makes me feel like I need to probe myself or volunteer relevant info, which is fine because it gets me to really reflect, but I’m not paying her to just listen to me. I can talk to myself in the mirror for free. She doesn’t ask questions to help me identify triggers or correlations between my behaviors and shit happening in my life. I’m kind of being forced to do it myself. Which is fine, I guess, but like… idk sometimes I get the vibe that she doesn’t feel like she can help me and that I know too much. It feels like she is intimidated by me almost.",justfoxice,u8rntm

Congrats on doing it, even if it was scary! You say that you know that you sould try again, that makes me think that you already found out for yourself that going back would be the best thing to do. I think its hard because we expect therapy to be the solution and its hard to realize that the solution is hard and scary work. It seems like a lot if your fear comes from not knowing the other person well. This is something that gets easier! You will get to know your therapist better, and they will get to know you better too, and as someone who also does counciling work I can assure you that they dont make judgments from the first session, just think about what kind of support and relationship you will need.

My best advice is to look for a therapist specifically trained in personality disorders. That seemed to make all the difference in mine.

Also, though, my therapist speaks my language, in a sense. Many people don't understand where I'm coming from when I speak, so they get confused quickly and tune out. He understands how I work and he works with that in order for things to make sense to me.

Make sure they have the education necessary, and make sure you feel completely comfortable around them after a few sessions.",GastonsChin,jum3wu

2,"I recently got a therapist who specializes in DBT therapy! And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Covering that material gives me an understanding of my emotions, and how to change or redirect my thoughts and emotions. It’s been super helpful but you need to find the right one you click with, and someone who specializes in DBT. I have tried different therapists and I’m thankful I kept looking because if I didn’t find this one I have NO idea where I would be today. Some days I’ll take sessions to talk about my issues depending on how I’m feeling and other days we cover material through the book! Little more info, I’m seeing a psychologist and covering DBT. I previously was with a social worker and she hurt my
Feelings multiple times making me cry and didn’t seem to have an understanding of me at all. She upset me so bad I didn’t call back for three months. She also called me back one time to apologize for how she reacted when I told her I was diagnosed with HPV while I cried in the chair, I then ended up crying on the phone.

Just a rant here at the end.. Its amazing, I feel like a lot of us wouldnt have to goto Therapy if we all just had ONE TRUE friend... that could listen and not judge or tell us how to fix ourselves... I see the Therapist as a PAID friend basically and it fucks me up thinking about it...

A Therapist will be there for you... Until your bank goes negative... then its like ""Sorry, wish I could help... but hey, I have a doctorate and my mansion needs to be paid for...

Also having found a good therapist makes a huge difference, i ruined so many friendships by venting and scaring so many friends and relationships and i don't know if i can repair any of those relationships that would be fine if i didn't have this disorder.

0,"I attended group therapy for 6 months. Personally, before having my first session, I had been having thoughts like ""I need one-on-one sessions! How is this gonna help me? I need a professional to focus just on me""  
Then, the sessions began. I was lucky to be part of a group where there were very clear boundaries set about keeping things secret outside sessions and things like that. This definitely helped.  
The first couple of sessions I always waited till the very and to speak up as I was feeling like ""I have to give others a chance first..."". But I ended up feeling anxious after sessions because all the emotions built up and were not released. It is really hard at first to find a balance, but it actually symbolizes life pretty well. Everybody is there for themselves in the first place, but you should listen to others as well. On the other hand, it's no use if you let others speak all the time without respecting your own feelings and thoughts enough to start talking.  
It's perfectly okay even not to say a word for a few sessions. Once you find your voice and have a ""breakthrough"", once you have built up trust towards the group, it will be so much easier. If you re not good around people, group therapy is one of the best things that could happen to you, probably (speaking from experience)  
What I found easier at first is to join in on subjects/themes others were talking about which was also applicable to me and my life. Once I got this, I started to work on bringing up subjects on my own.  
Once you start talking, your heart will get lighter by the day.

Good luck with your journey!",,o22w5k

Here's the thing, though - don't expect a miracle, or that a few weeks will magically make you better.  It takes a lot of time and practice to have it have an effect on you.  you likely won't feel like it's making any difference at first.

Be patient.   this is a huge new skill set you will be learning and practicing.  you will have periods you feel like it does nothing, you will have relapses... it will be, likely, at least months before you see a real difference.

not trying to rain on your parade - this is an awesome step you are taking.  I just see so many people who think it will fix everything overnight, and quit when it doesn't.
