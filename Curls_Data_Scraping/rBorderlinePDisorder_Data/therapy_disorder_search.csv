4,Therapy im Brazil ,"Hey all

I'm(24m) currently living in Germany. I've been struggling with borderline, ptsd and depression since I was 11. I've been hospitalized 3 times ans in therapy for like 6 years or so. 
Last year, my parents decided to return to Brazil. I was born there, but have been living im Germany for 22 years. Even though my life here is...let's say it isn't the best, but I have all my friends here and from a therapeutic standpoint it wasn't the best idea to leave with my parents, so I decided to stay.
I've been trying to manage most things, like I found a place to stay and all the bureaucratic stuff, but it's just so exhausting. In addition to that, nothing works out. The bureaucracy is terrible in Germany. They can't do anything right, they take ages to address your issues, but if you can't meet their deadlines, you get with jail. 
In my private life, nothing is working out aus well. My whole plan I set up to build up a life in Germany on my own has been crushed to pieces within few weeks. I just feel like everyhting is weighing me down and...okay I'll stop ranting and get to my question.
I'm close to deciding to go to Brazil. Not because I think life is much better there, but because I feel like I've ran my course here in Germany. Maybe I'm not suited for this environment. Maybe I can handle things better when I'm not constantly being pulled down by everything.
But as you can see, I still need therapy. So I wanted to ask, if anyone could tell me how life is in Brazil with mental health issues and how easy it is to get good therapy there

6,A poem post therapy ,"I found an angel with a broken wing.

She told me the sons of man 

Had taken her,

And hurt her

.

But that I was pure.

That I could fix it.

That broken wing.

.


‚ÄúI can carry us both back‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWhen I am whole I am strong‚Äù.

Enough to carry

We, to heaven.

But it wasn't men-

Or sons of men.

She had jumped‚Ä¶

.

I couldn't fix her wing.

So for this sin

She carried us 

To hell.

8,Advice needed: Is therapy the only way? ,"Hey, I have been reading a lot about BPD treatments and every source says that therapy is the only treatment for BPD. This is really frustrating for me because therapists are not professional or trained enough to treat BPD in my country (India). I have been in therapy for ~8 years on and off, and I have made the most progress only when I have been seriously working on myself. 

In my experience therapy is just a small part of the treatment. diet, exercise, sleep, applying skills in real life, self reflection, etc also play such a big role. But to go into remission, you really have to work on the root causes of BPD, which is what DBT is for. For me, therapy becomes a crutch and I stop working on myself when I am with a therapist. So is there a way to continue therapy, just without a therapist? 

Is it possible to go into remission by taking therapy into my own hands? Instead of relying on a therapist to guide me, I will structure and execute my own treatment. 

are there any dangers to doing this? I have been to 4 DBT therapists for several months to two years. but i feel really frustrated starting over every time. I also really can't afford to go to the certified and trained therapists right now because I can't pay for it myself and I don't want to ask my parents to pay for more therapy. It's almost like Russian roulette when it comes to therapy, because you never know if someone really even knows DBT (or therapy at all)

She said she offers discounted sessions but that they are all full right now and won‚Äôt be able to comprise on price even though I pay out of pocket and not through insurance.

11,Getting discouraged by therapy,"I have diagnoses of bpd, autism, PTSD, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I have described my therapy journey at length here in a previous post. Let me summarize the last three therapists I've seen and their attitudes towards my diagnoses:

1.) Did not believe I was autistic because I didn't come across like I was ""funny about textures""--I am, but why would I share that if not asked?--and also did not believe I could have bpd because I'm too self-aware.

2.) Definitely believes I'm autistic, but doesn't believe I have bpd because people with bpd, per the dsm criteria (according to him, and he's wrong), must attempt suicide to manipulate people.

3.) Believes I have autism but that it doesn't matter, and I don't think believes I have bpd but won't say anything because I've complained that the first two were so invalidating. Insists on doing CBT with me now.

I had a follow-up with my psychiatrist yesterday; it was two months after she reaffirmed my bpd diagnosis. I was disappointed to tell her I'd gotten nowhere in therapy except three therapists telling me that I'm either too self-aware for bpd or, I guess, not evil enough to have it. She was frustrated on my behalf and encouraged me to find a therapist to do dbt with me. (Naturally I can't pursue the therapist she recommended or the group he runs, because we know each other for personal reasons. Thanks, small towns.)

I do have a recommendation from a bpd friend for a telehealth therapist, but I'm getting so fucking discouraged. Should I just expect *him* to tell me I'm too good and smart and self-aware to have bpd, a disorder reserved only for wicked witches? I also am having a hard time, as a b-story, coping with the implication that all these three therapists have given me, which is that bpd is a disorder for ""bad"" (i.e. not self-aware, deliberately violent) people, and therefore I can't have it. I already hate myself and feel I'm the worst person in the world. I don't need that extra stigma.

15,"Honesty and therapy, a breakthrough. ","Long story short.. I started being more honest with my therapist. I recently started working with her after an insurance change, and she specializes in BPD and complex trauma. She worked with my previous therapist as a supervisor and runs the DBT group I‚Äôm in (on hold due to issues with living situation), so she‚Äôs already a bit familiar with my case. 

Remission is my goal. No longer hurting those around me as a result of my illness and fixing this shitty inability to take proper accountability is my goal. But that meant I needed to do something I haven‚Äôt done in the 15 years I‚Äôve been in therapy. 

I had to be honest. Brutally honest. And I hate it. 

I told her about my manipulative tendencies. I talked about how I wanted to control the people around me, and how I see it as a way to both protect myself and limit my stress, despite it always being at the expense of others. I talked about it in detail, even though I felt like a monster while talking about it. 

I started talking about the death threats. The suicidal manipulation. Violence. Self-harming and how I‚Äôve used it to control others. The emotional blackmail. The financial abuse. The extreme codependency. The horrible splits, discards, and hoovers. The obsessive tendencies. The impulsivity. How I‚Äôve cyber stalked my ex lovers and friends. I will be telling her more of this as our sessions continue, and it‚Äôs incredibly difficult. The shame and guilt almost make it feel impossible. 

Part of why I went so long without a diagnosis was because I would omit these details. I would describe situations in a way that only made me out to be a victim. Sometimes I still do this, because I will genuinely convince myself that I‚Äôve done no wrong even though that isn‚Äôt true. 

We talked about where this behavior came from. A mix of my dysfunctional family and an inability to properly cope with stress. I‚Äôve started to identify patterns in my behavior. I infantilize myself and deflect whenever I have to take accountability. I try to use my trauma as a way to justify my actions and behavior. 

I talked about the bad stuff. The part of me that I hate. The part of me that takes over when I feel shame, invalidation, fear. The part of me that‚Äôs extremely dysregulated and abusive to my loved ones. 

The next step is finding ways to cope without hurting myself or others. More effective communication skills. Better emotional regulation. 

I‚Äôm considering showing her emails and texts I‚Äôve sent while splitting too. But that really scares me. I‚Äôll bring them up if issues arise in the future. I have to remind myself this isn‚Äôt for validation that I‚Äôm right or that I‚Äôm a victim. It‚Äôs to gain new perspective and shine a light on these hideous parts of myself, so these patterns can be properly addressed. 

Gods, I hate it. But it‚Äôs gotta be done at some point, right?

I‚Äôm really grateful for my therapist. She‚Äôs very patient with me and doesn‚Äôt show judgement, even when it would be more than understandable for her to do so. 

I have to remind myself that I‚Äôm here to get better, not to convince my therapist that I‚Äôm a good person. 

And that‚Äôs the hardest part. My ego wants me to be a good, innocent person so badly. But I‚Äôm not. There‚Äôs so much work to do. 

The real work starts with that discomfort.  ",1715845389.0,False,7,1,BamBamYangGang,None,1ct7j6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1ct7j6u/honesty_and_therapy_a_breakthrough/
16,How do I move forward with therapy?,"Hi! I made a post here very recently discussing a problem I was having and got a lot of recommendations to go to therapy. I was very very against it and always have been but it was oddly nice hearing people feel sympathetic towards me and if that‚Äôs what I can get from therapy then I‚Äôm willing to try I think :)
I want to hear how I should approach therapy to not get scared away and to use it most efficiently. Also I want to hear what I should and shouldn‚Äôt tell my therapist, especially because my parents will most likely be told what I tell the therapist.
Real quick I also wanted to discuss some things that I do, just to see if this lines up with BPD. I‚Äôm not claiming I have it, or are even mentally ill but I‚Äôd just love to hear opinions on it. ‚ù§Ô∏è I can discuss more in detail in comments as well if you have any questions I am very happy to answer! :))

To start off my mood swings very rapidly, from being incredibly joyful and smiley to then being very down and not having motivation to do anything at all. I also have moments of ‚Äúheroism‚Äù I guess you would call them? This is where I‚Äôm suddenly very cocky and get an almost savior-like feeling, and often sign up for work to help others and then regret it later when the feeling ends.

I would much rather spread love and joy rather than be sad of course, I‚Äôll often try my best to hide the sadness so it doesn‚Äôt affect others. Though I think this is normal haha.

I sometimes forget who I want to be and can‚Äôf seem to remember what my personality is. I keep in my notes on my phone different things to help keep me in line. These could be characters I like from different media, moments in my head that I remember where I acted well and was praised, and just overall attitudes that I will make myself feel even if I‚Äôm a little out of it at that moment. 

My mood tends to switch very rapidly to the point where I‚Äôll often wonder which one is the real me and I wonder if I was faking the other emotions earlier.

I don‚Äôt have motivation to do things if it‚Äôll negatively affect others.

I like the idea of being a big brother to someone, but I know I would be a bad parent.

I find myself switching between wanting to help hurt children and wanting to be the hurt child. (sorry this sounds dumb I meant this in a metaphorical way.)

In my head I like physical touch but when it comes around I hate anything physical or in particular sexual. 

I can‚Äôt look in the mirror or it ruins my day because of how I look, despite the fact that I oddly do get asked out on dates.

I can‚Äôt ever be in a relationship. 

I feel uncomfortable around my parents though I know they love me deeply.

A hug from my mom makes me feel gross.

My doctor has recommended DBT therapy for me. Of course, it comes at a high cost. The lowest level of care is gonna end up being almost $9,000. I just quit my job in a blind rage most likely caused by BPD. I could obtain this amount of money, but it would require borrowing, begging, pleading, and fighting with my family to convince them that I have this and need help. I do believe I need the help desperately because I‚Äôve tried so many other things and nothing has worked. So I guess my question is - has anyone ever participated in DBT therapy and saw any kind of results? I‚Äôm just so worried I will never lead a normal life if I don‚Äôt get this help.

This is a mini checklist to help understand where thoughts are coming from and how legitimate they really are in terms of actual reality. It can be really hard to tell the difference between your own thoughts and your intrusive ones when your perception of that reality is so real to you but no one else. 

1: When was the mood shift? What thought caused it? 

2: Once you find the thought, ask ""What evidence is there for this thought?""

37,hiding. even in therapy,"Ever since I was young I have a tendency to hide my real traits and thoughts and feelings behind self-awareness and very logical thinking that does not reflect me in real life.

I've been in therapy for 10 years. I've never once confronted how extreme my emotions can be, and some of the ways I act as a result of it. Instead I twist, downplay, and hide how I actually am in relationships with other people to either justify how I am or hide how I am. 

I tried confronting it genuinely during my current round of therapy. No matter how hard I tried, I could not convey the seriousness of my problem. It's almost like being self-aware makes it harder to be honest. I try to say, well, ""I experience x trigger, and do y and z as a result"" and I just get a lot of kudos and reassurance. It's like I cannot convey how utterly messed up my life is because of my thinking and my emotions SOLELY because I'm good at recognizing it and articulating it. 

I'm certainly not good at thinking through things when I become literal Godzilla towards the people I love since every little slight or indication they don't like me or will leave me feels like searing hot pain. And that I will do everything from lash out, to manipulate, to beg just to fit that person back into the mold of what I want them to be.

42,Starting therapy,"I‚Äôve recently sought therapy again which is long overdue, and unlike previously where I had been struggling with a specific and recent event/crisis, this time I‚Äôm not really sure where or how to begin. Now I‚Äôve submitted a BUNCH of info in the form of journaling but those have and will probably always be chaotic. They rarely stay on subject as my brain refuses to focus on anything ever. I‚Äôve identified a few goals but they are broad and multifaceted. So far my therapist is kind of just gathering some information but it almost seems as if she‚Äôs allowing me to lead and then when I fail to go anywhere or have nothing left to add to an answer, she asks about something completely left field or about something that isn‚Äôt (in my opinion) even in the top 20 of obvious issues or struggles..

When I brought this up today, she even told me that she was allowing me to go wherever I wanted to go with this, and I flat out said, well good luck following me and my train of thought, cause you‚Äôll be exhausted trying to keep up and when you finally do you‚Äôll realize we actually went nowhere. 

I have ADHD and a lot of OCD tendencies (never addressed these to even be diagnosed but they are there and loud and dysfunctional at best) sooo like I‚Äôm not the best person to be leading this. Factor in that my mood at that time will absolutely be a contributing factor. 

What is your guys experience with therapy and how did you really address your issues? I feel with these diagnoses it‚Äôs inherently left a path of distruction and chaos throughout your life‚Äôs history and will continue to do so until something‚Äôs done about the present process of the brain. 

Like I know I‚Äôve got to be patient and allow her to kinda get a big picture but I‚Äôm not a patient person and I gone over and over everything I‚Äôve experienced more times than what should be humanly possible and get more confused the more I do it. Like if she asks about a specific relationship- that‚Äôs really dependent on the present standing, my mood, and even then, I struggle to really put it into words. I feel as if my emotions lately do less taking turns idolizing and then devaluing, and instead have morphed into doing both simultaneously to where I‚Äôm just confused/indifferent and it comes off as ‚Äúeh..‚Äù but that‚Äôs so far from the extreme love and extreme hate i feel it is not translating well.. 

Please just share your guys experiences with beginning therapy and what worked and what didn‚Äôt. The good, the bad, the terrible, the best‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to stop because I‚Äôm truly truly going out of my comfort zone even doing this, but I can feel myself pulling back hard BUT I NEED HELP.

Having a child and her about to turn one was really the hand that forced me because this year went by way too fast and im embarrassed at how it‚Äôs really played out.

43,What are some non-DBT therapies y'all have found helpful?,"I'm about to start therapy again in April after a 2.5 year break. I live in Canada where healthcare is free from the neck down lol (dentists and optometrists aren't free, and any type of mental healthcare is only free if we're talking psychiatric care, psychological services are very very rarely free, and there's a long wait list). I forgot that I was put on a wait list December 2022 or January 2023, but I finally got a call which is so quick I am in shock. Anyways since this was a referral from my psychiatrist, this psychologist knows I have BPD. But I feel like in the last year especially, I've genuinely grown and my needs are no longer BPD specific so I really don't wanna be doing anything like DBT. But I don't really know what's out there in terms of therapies, psychological philosophies etc. and I just want to do some research before meeting this person, so I can better verbalize what my needs are and what kind of therapy I would find most helpful.

Edit : I'm asking here because I have learned about schema therapy from someone with BPD and they said that was helpful. I had never heard of that before. I would like to know about more things that people with BPD specifically have found helpful, because I still do struggle with things in relation or that are common with folks with BPD, but DBT is no longer what I need imo.

45,Experience i had with online therapy,"So i had today a session with a new therapist online. I had two sessions with her prior to this where i explained a bit of my past, family, current situation etc. 

 I told her about my constant intrusive thoughts about self harming again, that i feel like everyone hates me, that  i start crying multiple times per day because of my constant, overwhelming negative thoughts and that it's affecting my work, my relationships etc. 
 
She basically ignored all my issues with regulating my emotions and basically said that i should not care about what other people think, that it is their problem, that maybe i am more depressed because it's winter, etc. She keeps offering advice and fixating about a small issue i had with my coworker, which i told her didn't trigger these feelings but they fueled the negative emotions. 

I also explain that i self soothe with food and alcohol, that i binge eat and i have been drinking almost every day. 

I can't talk about how i feel without crying so basically i just cry the whole session. She ends the session saying that i am very beautiful, even now that i cried so much(wtf) and that i shouldn't be this sad (wtf#2) , that there are bigger problems in the world, like war, famine, kids dying of cancer in hospitals etc... WTF. 

I basically have no words. I really think that that was inappropriate and invalidating. I feel like no one can help me, no one undersrands.

Before I had therapists who would not try to work on my SH with me and would just ignore it. They would also tell me things like going no contact is good. Although I agree to an extent when it comes to my mother, I felt like it was a cop-out for the shrink to not have to help me.

74,Ketamine Infusion Therapy ‚Äî HUGE improvement,"Hey guys. 

I just wanted to say that I‚Äôm more than halfway done ketamine infusion therapy, and so far it‚Äôs been the most helpful thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life. 

I‚Äôve gone through DBT so I have the framework, but talk-therapy just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt do anything. 

I was on Lamictal until it made me suicidal **and** gave me a life-threatening rash. 

I was switched to Trileptal and it was alright, but it made me gain a lot of weight and made my hair fall out. That made me feel worse than not being on it, so I stopped taking it. 

I was rotting in bed for weeks because I‚Äôm still suffering from losing my FP 6-months ago when I came across a recommendation for ketamine therapy. 

I talked to the doctor who ran the clinic and it didn‚Äôt seem woo-woo or sketchy or anything so I decided to go through with it. It‚Äôs not like life was getting any better anyways. 

I‚Äôm on 4 out of 6 treatments so far and nothing in my life has ever made me feel so‚Ä¶ normal? It feels like being on mood stabilizers without the hair-loss and numbness. Nothing is as big a deal as it has always felt like it‚Äôs been. Everyone isn‚Äôt out to get me. I don‚Äôt feel as envious and possessive of everyone I love. I was able to go to the park today and just write about my feelings in my journal for a couple hours‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve literally never been able to do that in my **entire life**. Like, not only could I identify what I was feeling, I was able to look at it objectively and describe it and not let it consume me. 

The other night I went out with 2 of my close friends (and their boyfriends) who are also close friends with each other and occasionally they would exclude me in conversation (they went to college together and I didn‚Äôt). I was able to recognize that it wasn‚Äôt on purpose and it wasn‚Äôt a reflection of their love for me or of my worth as a person??? Normally that would trigger the **fuck** out of me. But, like, I was able to realize that when there‚Äôs 3 people hanging out who haven‚Äôt seen each other in a hot sec, each person will want their one-on-one time. Like, I was slightly jealous when I wasn‚Äôt in the conversation, but I would just talk to someone else and then the conversation would naturally flow back so I could be included, and sometimes it would flow where one of my friends would be slightly excluded and that wasn‚Äôt me being manipulative or vindictive, it was just‚Ä¶. conversation! Lmfao! (I think everyone with BPD can relate to this and anyone without BPD reading this might think I‚Äôm insane.) 

I have co-morbid PMDD and I‚Äôm currently PMS-ing and, yes, there‚Äôs a dip in my mood and I‚Äôm a little tired and irritable, but I don‚Äôt want to throw myself off a bridge. 

However, the caveat is‚Ä¶ at least the place I‚Äôm going to‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs expensive. 6 sessions (the recommended amount) is $3300. Insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it. I‚Äôm paying out-of-pocket. 

I also don‚Äôt know how long this normalcy will last‚Ä¶ but my brain REALLY feels different, I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. My thought patterns aren‚Äôt the same. Usually at night I want to ruminate and dwell on every single upsetting thing that has ever happened to me, but the impulse is‚Ä¶ gone? 

Even if I have to get a single infusion yearly ($550) for the rest of my life‚Ä¶ At least I‚Äôm living life. 

And tbh it‚Äôs cheaper than talk therapy, which has never actually worked for me because I just wanted the therapist to like me and I would always charm them and they would never actually make me feel better. I‚Äôve been trying to find the right therapist for literally 20 years, and I haven‚Äôt had any luck. I know exactly what‚Äôs wrong with me. I just can‚Äôt (couldn‚Äôt?) control my emotions. I physically felt too terrible all the time to ever use my DBT skills to make myself feel better.

75,My gf will finally go to therapy,"Almost a year of support, that's what I gave her and I don't regret it, she has BPD but is the most wonderful, smart, nice person I know. It wasn't always easy but we made it and last week she told me she agreed to go to therapy and I'm so happy for that, I'm getting ready to support her and go through this with her when she needs my help, because I know it won't be easy for her (she already gave up on therapy once). But, at her rythm, we're gonna beat BPD together.

At the beginning she told me to run away from her, we went through tears, anger, joy, all the emotions possible, I had to learn a lot about BPD, learn how to react and how to talk in a way that wouldn't hurt her, she even blocked me once during a crisis, but I couldn't lose her, we spent hours talking that night and everything was fixed. The only thing needed is patience, but being in a relationship with someone who has BPD is totally worth it, she's so pure. And I just think that when you learn about BPD and take time to understand the emotions people who have BPD go through, you just discover a new world and as a bf, it's my role to bring her the happiness, the support and the love she deserves. Sometimes listening is all it takes, when she needs to talk about her problems or something that triggered her, I'm here, and seeing her smile when she's done talking, because she feel better, is all I need.

I'm gonna pay for her therapy but I can't do this alone, it's gonna be very expensive, so if you want to help I share with you the link of the crowdfunding I made for her treatment.

Thanks for taking time to read this, if you have BPD, I know it's not easy sometimes but don't give up, there are people out there that just want to help you and, step by step, when you let them do, they can change your life in the good way. If you're in a relationship with someone having BPD, it's not gonna be always easy, but be patient and take time to learn about this, and you'll experience the purest kind of love you ever had.

77,DBT group therapy (Your experience?) please help,"Hi,

  
Making this post to hopefully gain some perspective and understanding.  
I was admitted to a psyciatric hospital last year, due to an attempt and was diagnosed with bpd. The diagnosis explained a lot for me, and I finally understood why life had always been so painful for me. I've now been in both individual and group DBT which has been running consistently besides each other, for almost a half year. I'm done with the modules by the end of this year.  
I feel like some of it has helped me a lot, as far as self destructive behaviours, fact checking, and crisis management but I feel like I'm far from feeling healed and everyday still feels like a battle. Group therapy has been a struggle lately, and it has been like that (on and off) since I was halfway trough it. I don't know why, but at some point I started dissociating in there and now I do it pretty much every time. I had one session where it was my turn to talk about the homework we had done that week and I felt like I was about to go into a full blown panic attack. I still don't know why that happened to me.  
I do know that I keep having negative thoughts while being in there for example: ''Nobody in here likes me'' ''I can't contribute with anything'' ''They are probably judging me'' ''If I say this does that make me sound stupid'' and it keeps on spiraling from there. I get so incredibly anxious and I feel like I'm reminded about past times in my life. And then I dissociate. It has made me feel like I'm not gaining anything from group therapy anymore, because I'm simply not there mentally and I'm struggling to bring myself back with mindfulness as soon as I've already dissociated. Lately I feel like many of my symptoms have swung back on me, and I'm starting to go home from therapy feeling worse than when I went in. I feel like such a failure and that I'm probably an expection. Therapy won't work for me and I won't ever get better. I feel like no one else in there shares this particularly struggle with me. I feel like a lot of the traumatic memories are not being processed at all and I don't know what to do when the therapy ends, and they let me go.",1700758716.0,False,2,1,Striking_Bet_8326,None,1825low,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1825low/dbt_group_therapy_your_experience_please_help/

86,Went to my first therapy session...,"I went to my first therapy session today. My husband has been telling me for years that I need to start going to therapy. Recently we have been going through a rough patch and decided to get couples counseling and individual therapy as well. The other day when we were talking about things we need to work on I mentioned to him how I feel no empathy toward other people and how it's very hard for me to understand other people's emotions). He looked up things that can cause no/low empathy and we came across BPD. 

I started researching it a bit and realized I have almost all of the symptoms. I also started listening to this podcast called the BPD Bunch and realize I can relate to a lot of their stories. 

In my first session today I went in and was talking to my therapist. I didn't tell him anything about me thinking I had this or that (I also think I have anxiety and ADHD). About halfway through the session he asks me if I've heard of personality disorders. It was randomly interjected into the conversation when I was describing stories about my relationships (family, friends, romantic) with other people. He then said I meet the criteria for BPD. As the session progressed, he pointed out more and more the things I was describing were also symptoms of BPD. 

I was surprised he was able to see it so quickly. I don't believe it's an official diagnosis. I've never been to official therapy before this (I went when I was in foster care and I did better help for about a month before my trial was over but neither were like the traditional therapy where you sit and talk to someone). I think I'm just a bit speechless because it's one thing to think you have something but another thing to have a professional tell you you do/might have it.

My third therapist went on vacation with no warning, leaving me with no therapist for three weeks, then when she returned she told me she intentionally didn‚Äôt let me know just to see how I‚Äôd react. All of the therapists I‚Äôve had always  sit down with me in the beginning and tell me our plan and that they‚Äôre going to give me handouts after every session that we‚Äôll go over the next session and they literally never do anything. My last therapist just listened to me talk/cry for forty five minutes everytime without offering a single piece of advice on how to cope and constantly said ‚Äúoh gosh it‚Äôs time already, I hate that you have to leave do upset,‚Äù yet never changed anything about what she did. And my current therapist spends half our sessions talking about how I need to talk to my dr about my meds not working and when I didn‚Äôt show for our appointment today (I genuinely thought it was Thursday and didn‚Äôt get the appointment reminder and can‚Äôt stop crying because I needed therapy so bad this week and now I‚Äôm fucked), even though I have never been a no show, never even canceled or rescheduled, and she didn‚Äôt call to see why I didn‚Äôt show, just charged me the no show fee. I get they have to charge for no shows but she could have checked in at least. I just don‚Äôt feel like she actually wants to help me and that in of itself is triggering to me.

I'm constantly reading how it's your fault if you don't try to get better and you shouldn't have relationships until you can work on yourself. 

I do try, it just doesn't work. I have several severe mental health issues. Some of them make it hard for traditional methods of ""help"" to work. I have taken every conceivable type of medication and suffered some horrific side effects for no gain. I've been to several psychiatrists, but at some point there isn't anything else to try. I have been to several therapists, counselors, social workers, community support etc... Some of them I have stuck with for multiple years, it's not like i'm quitting after 2 sessions. I have been to multiple treatment programs. I have too many concurrent issues for them to be able to take care of me. I'm still struggling from the last one I went to.

I really feel like i'm going crazy because i'm trying so hard just to hang on and I only get blamed because i'm not trying hard enough.

I do not have any healthy relationships. There's nobody who I like being around. I'm unable to work or do much of anything. I try to leave my apartment and do things, but I rarely enjoy it. I've tried a lot of things over the last 2 years and I usually end up feeling like it was a waste to have gone out and tried.

95,Stubbornly avoiding therapy before it even starts (again),"Well, I was going to start therapy again. But, I've been dealing with a very inefficient referral system, with clinics that do not know anything about the government agencies that are referring me to them, and knowing nothing about how to interface with them in terms of the care plans involved.

So, I got a call from an intake clinician. And, they told me that they called the government agency that referred me to them, which had told me they provide funding. Then they asked me to provide them with the referral document, which I do not have, which the government agency had told them is required. So, I just defeatedly told them ""don't worry about it."" The intake clinician tried to tell me otherwise, but I jus angrily said ""I guess they were lying to me, goodbye."" And I hung up. And then they sent me a text saying that I could access their service if I provide them with the document. But, I don't have the document.

The main issue with this is that I could have just told them ""I don't have the document, can you contact the government agency and ask them for it, as they have it on their system and they were organizing the referral for me.""

Probably the worst part of this is the hopelessness, and child-like helplessness and lack of personal agency, as well as the emotional lability that makes childish behaviour like this feel necessary.

I'm stubbornly not going to call them. Because, to my mind, they're just like my parents, etc. There's just this constant projection of the past onto the present. They're depriving, withholding, etc.

she would be late to our sessions, and i‚Äôm not talking like 5 min late, i sat there like an idiot in the waiting room waiting for this bitch for 40 min only for her to come out and tell me she forgot we had a session booked :) 
talking to her made me feel like shit. she interrupted me constantly and every time she did it i wanted to either walk out or throw a chair at her. i never walked out mid session but honestly wish i did. every positive thing i said, she managed to turn negative. after every session i felt intense rage to the point of crying over how uncomfortable she made me feel.

she even diagnosed me with an absurd diagnosis called ‚Äúmild intellectual deficiency that requires care and assistance‚Äù or idk how to translate it to english. but basically this is a diagnosis that first of all needs proper assessing, second of all this diagnosis is for people who are actually special needs. like they can‚Äôt shower without assistance, they‚Äôd have gone to special schools not public schools.
thank fuck this diagnosis is off the system cause when some psychiatrists reviewed my records they immediately removed that diagnosis which i‚Äôm so thankful for..

on top of all that she even managed to cause me psychical issues when it comes to medication. i requested to change my SSRI antidepressants from paroxetine to sertraline due to libido difficulties. 
prior to changing medication i had been using paroxetine for a year. this doctor told me to stop using paroxetine and immediately the next day start taking sertraline.
the paxil withdrawals on top of added symptoms from sertraline were insane. i‚Äôve never felt so awful. dizzy 24/7, constantly feeling like i‚Äôm gonna faint, insane headaches etc. i called and called and texted this bitch and i didn‚Äôt get a single response..

101,Finally going to get therapy,"
For the longest time I knew I needed therapy and that there is something wrong with me. I‚Äôm in my mid 20s and my father is a narcissist and I guess things in my life messed me up. I have been messing up in life a lot and I don‚Äôt know what will come out in therapy. Am I a narcissist? Psychopath? Borderline? I guess I‚Äôll find out. 

Spoke to a general doctor and they know I‚Äôve called in before regarding depression and anxiety and had a little chat with my doctor. She said it could be something to do with my personality because I have a loving girlfriend and good job. 

The only reason I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a psychopath is because I can be very anxious. I‚Äôm up and down a lot when I‚Äôm down im socially anxious and quiet even awkward. But also I can be very charismatic and good at social interactions if I put my head into it and I feel good about myself. 

I have a lot of vulnerability, I‚Äôm scared of being seen weak, incompetent or worse compared to a different man especially when it comes to women and my girlfriend. She needs to think I‚Äôm the top man. I‚Äôm very scared of being abandoned or betrayed. But at the same time I don‚Äôt think I have much guilt or empathy. I‚Äôm scared of being hurt in that way but I can do it to someone else without feeling awful about it. I might feel shame, disgust in regards of myself and I realise I‚Äôm treating others badly but I wouldn‚Äôt say I feel actually bad for doing those things just feel disgust but I‚Äôm not sad about it. 

I always seem to be able to make people feel for me. I‚Äôll do some bad things and then make it out like I did it all because I‚Äôm sad and miserable and that way I get peoples sympathy so that they try and stick around. 

Like with my girlfriend I want myself to be her everything I don‚Äôt want her to get any attention. The only attention she gets I want it to be from me. I want me to be the main thing in social events not her. But then I want attention from other girls but I get very jealous and paranoid about her with other guys and accuse her of wanting attention from other men even though she says she‚Äôs never been like that. My happiness depends on how I view our relationship but also this relationship is so one sided, she does everything for me I do nothing for her. That‚Äôs why idk if this could be BPD because I‚Äôm just so obsessed with myself and when I feel like we are good and she loves me I am happy but also I‚Äôll just talk about myself and feel good about myself. 

But also I‚Äôll get a kick out of getting compliments from other people and if I feel bossy at work and important as if I‚Äôm the boss I‚Äôll feel great about it. I feel great when I‚Äôm adored by others, feared by others and more powerful by others. 

I realise I might be an awful human being, I‚Äôm manipulate and stuff but I don‚Äôt even care about it. I‚Äôm just scared about myself being to hectic and impulsive like if I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôll just start drinking or doing drugs and end up doing bad things like breaking car mirrors or breaking windows to show others how much I‚Äôm hurting. 

I have moments when I feel like I‚Äôm the lowest human being, I‚Äôm unable to be successful, I‚Äôm worthless, I won‚Äôt achieve anything everyone‚Äôs better and I‚Äôm just so weak. But also I get moments when I feel great about myself, feel like I can achieve anything, I will be successful others look up to me and want to get my approval.

102,Online vs. In-person DBT therapy. Advice needed.," 

Hi. I (59M) was diagnosed about five years ago with BPD and a co-morbid of Bi Polar Disorder II. It explains a lot as far as how I've reacted to situations in my life. I've recently quit taking Xanax after 23 years of daily prescribed use, and reality is hitting me in the face and I'm not quite sure how to block its punches.

When I was diagnosed, my shrink told me she couldn't help me and that I needed DBT. I think she's right. However, I'm uninsured and online DBT therapy is half the price of in-person therapy.

So, my fellow BPD'ers, what has your experience been for in-person vs. online DBT therapy? And, ultimately, is either method better than none?

And maybe I'll make some minor changes in my life. Idk. It's probably going to be an hour long conversation that is summarily: ""hey, did you act different?"", ""no"", ""well, maybe you'll figure it out this week."", ""maybe. Here's $x""

Am I the only one who is totally isolated, unable to connect with anyone, and simply desperate to share my extremely shitty past and present life story of abuse and trauma with an expert to help me understand why I am the way I am and to better navigate the world as a result?

I do not feel any personal progress at all. I still think of suicide daily, I‚Äôm still depressed, anxious, and isolated. I don‚Äôt get anything out of therapy. I‚Äôve known my entire life that I‚Äôm a genuinely terrible human being inside and out and I deserve to have bad things happen to me.

I was told that therapy would help and it doesn‚Äôt. If I don‚Äôt believe someone who I trust the most in the world (my mom, for example) that things will get better, why should I bother with someone who is only telling me these things to get paid?

126,Couples Therapy Wrecks Me Every Time,"I‚Äôm the one with the diagnosis. Starting in 2018, after a couple of real difficult years, I began individual therapy with a clinical psychologist. He is very good and we did some good work together, to the point that we agreed I could step away and live my life. It got easier to deal with a lot of my reality but of course, like an alcoholic (which I also am) I will always have BPD, even though my experience of it may improve. 

My wife and I started going to couples therapy about six months ago. It was okay for a while, with some unsurprising turbulence. I even thought I was getting some understanding from my wife and validation for my feelings. There have been many times when I fucked up in our relationship of course, but as I got better, I noticed that she did the same, just with different results because we are different people. She‚Äôs a great person, albeit highly assertive, forceful and determined. Even stubborn and intransigent to a fault. Nobody‚Äôs perfect, right? 

Here‚Äôs the thing. I can‚Äôt get the validation I believe I deserve for the stuff (yes, there is SOME stuff) that I know to be true, the things I‚Äôm actually right about. She says basically anything she doesn‚Äôt like about my behavior or my attitude, thoughts and feelings is mental illness. Or I‚Äôm just an insufferable asshole. I try to shed light on the stuff she misconstrues and the whole time I‚Äôm talking, she and the therapist are exchanging looks, he‚Äôs rolling his eyes, she‚Äôs shaking her head and smiling, gesturing toward me like I‚Äôm a hopeless child who‚Äôs lost his mind. Of course as soon as that starts, I get anxious and it gets incredibly uncomfortable and I get lost in the confusion of it. 

Every one of the last 5-6 sessions has left me so hurt and upset, I don‚Äôt even want to be in the car with her. I feel so mistreated. Today, we got lunch afterwards and I couldn‚Äôt look at her, or speak more than short replies. Driving home was torture. A couple of times, it‚Äôs been a shit cloud for an entire week. I hate it.

127,Getting high and watching bluey has helped me so much more than a lot of therapy.,"Some background, I (28m) was diagnosed with bpd about 2 years ago. Since then I have undergone dbt. I found dbt incredibly difficult, I found it hard to be in a relaxed enough state in order to apply a lot of these. So when in a more relaxed state I tried to practice them, to some level of success.

The thing I found while high was I was able to reframe what was being taught to me. One thing that helped me understand was trying to understand trauma. How I interpreted it to make sense to me was that your brain categorises memories with emotions. Trauma are memories that haven't been categorised and thus still bounce around and all we remember is that it was upsetting but somewhat unsure how to process it.

While high I started watching the Australian preschoolers show Bluey. Watching Bluey made me recontextualise a lot of my childhood memories and realised a lot of things I never emotionally processed. And helped me with through things that I didn't realise were still unresolved. It helped me resolve simple things that I never resolved as a child because the still challenges real world issues that I was just never taught to deal with. This show feels like it's undone so many years of damage.

I have a few more left before I can start attending groups. It is a one year long program. I already have a therapist whom I do CBT with. I‚Äôm mostly processing trauma with her because I have a lot to process. The DBT therapist I spoke with today said I could not attend other therapy while in the program due to the fact that it could interfere with the DBT program.

139,Therapy vs. career (when we can't have both),"I'm currently struggling because I honestly don't know how my life is supposed to continue and I need some advice, or maybe just someone who understands me.

Little backstory for clarity. I'm 24f, and I've been severely mentally unwell since the age of 12. I've spent my teen years in and out of treatment and engaged in several really dangerous, self destructive behaviours in the past. Over the years there were good and bad episodes, I've been really stabile during some of these times, but crisis always managed to slip in, some minor and some major. I've been diagnosed with BPD at age 19, and I've been to inpatient DBT treatment twice since then. It has helped me a lot, but I've never completely finished a treatment cycle of 12 weeks because it always got to overwhelming for me during the end. The last time I tried was in late 2020, and unfortunately I haven't had any outpatient specialist treatment for my BPD since, because there's just no access to it in my area. 

A lot has happened since then. I've not SHed since 2020 and I'm not actively engaging in ED behaviours anymore. I'm able to live a seemingly normal adult life now and I've worked 9-5 since 2020. Even during difficult times I haven't relapsed anymore and I've now been clean for longer than ever before. But below the surface there is still a lot of shit I need to work on. My last two relationships have been pretty toxic and I had to deal with all of it by myself even though I would have really needed specialist help during those times. I'm still struggling, but it's all happening internally now.

Now, here's my current tricky situation:
I'm back in my home country after I've lived abroad with my (narcissistic) Ex BF for the last 1,5 years. I'm currently looking for a job, and over the last weeks the idea of going to the police academy developed in my head. I never thought I could do it in the past because I was to sick, but now that I'm in recovery my body is in great health (doctor confirmed) and I have no long term side effects from my ED that hold me back. I actually started working out and became pretty fit during the last two years. I really wanna do this, but there's still a lot of doubt in my head if I'm good enough for such a job and if I can do it. I also signed up for inpatient DBT again, and both the police academy and treatment would start in September. 
I'm not sure what to do now. I really wanna go ahead in my career and chase my dreams, but it would also mean that I couldn't go inpatient (aka have treatment at all because inpatient is the only option where I live) for the next 3 years. I'm also scared that someone with BPD as severe as mine is just not able to be a good police officer, even tho I really wanna try it at least. If I fail, at least I know I did the best I can. 
On the other hand I really wanna work on myself and continue to improve my mental health. I'm doing the best that I can by myself (reading books, using skills, bpd workbooks, meditation ect.) but I know that there's only so much I can do alone without professional help. If I start treatment in September it would be good for me, but it would also be another time where my mental health stopped me for chasing my dreams. I've lost a lot of opportunities to this disorder, and it still hurts to think where I could be in life today if I had taken them.
If you wanna share your perspective on this with my I'm very thankful.

Every conversation feels like it's the last one or that they're about to say goodbye forever or that they will never talk to me anymore.. I find myself worrying about what seemingly normal words meant and if they had any meaning between the lines..

Now, this is not something completely new because I also have OCD, but this time I feel a melancholic stress that reaaally hurts.. I feel that people aren't worth investing in because they can be gone by the next second.. I see no point in interacting with anyone.. I became so disappointed that I can't feel motivated enough to endure the pain of missing someone. In fact, I don't understand why it hurts so much to miss someone. I just think of how alone everyone is in this world and it freaks me out..

And I don't want to feel alone.. but I do feel and it hurts even more now. I became a jobless loser and I know that I have (or at least had) the potential to be so much more than what I am now.. But I feel powerless. I now feel overwhelmed with obstacles in my way.. and there's never anyone there for me..

142,DBT Therapy,"I started my recovery journey about three years ago and now I can finally say I am feeling a bit more in control & aware of myself & my emotions. I honestly feel recovery, healing, has been hard work and continues to be so. I have made my mental health and my recovery a priority, something I have to work at every day. By working at it every day is the only way I feel it is possible to create a life worth living by being capable of handling distress. It's the only chance at real healing and change. And how did I learn it had to become a priority? Because I noticed that every time I started feeling better I would neglect my individual homework, my journal entries, I would stop being mindful and I would easily relapse into old patterns of thoughts and behaviour. I felt I was starting over & over again constantly. I would go from being motivated, actually being functional to losing everything by leaving it lost and becoming depressed. I felt stuck.

At the beginning, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) can be tedious. Don't get me wrong, yes, it is interesting to learn more about Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), to work on accepting & understanding it, but it is also, going to therapy twice a week. It is a lot of unpacking, unlearning, processing & identifying, in my case, 26 years of traumas, patterns of thoughts, reacting a certain way, handling things a certain way, etc.

At first, it was really a lot to handle, I payed attention, I was learning, but I wasn't really committed 100%. The reason I couldn't commit, is because at first I was always reacting, I had no control of my emotions, the work does stir up a lot of trauma. So as much as I wanted to recover, I would shut down and go numb from time to time. As time went by, I could start to see the little changes, I started to feel different and good about myself in some areas. I was going back and forth constantly, from handling one crisis well to being a total mess that couldn't even get out of bed. I had to work harder on my truths, I had to not only listen but apply the skills I was learning. I had to fill in my diary card, I had to do the homework, it just really has to become a way of life.

This week I started my third round of DBT, and I thought it might be cool to share this journey with all of you. We are always seeing recovery processes of people already in control, feeling whole and content, why not see the nitty-gritty too?  I really think DBT therapy has saved my life and I finally feel ready to give it my 100%. I want to be as hand-on as I can in this round and learn, heal and grow as much as possible. I want to graduate.

DBT is based on¬†Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)[,](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/) but it's specially adapted for people who feel emotions very intensely. It aims to help with understanding and accepting difficult feelings by providing skills to manage them. It also allows you to take control of your life and effectuate positive changes. ‚ÄòDialectical‚Äô means trying to understand how two things that seem opposite could both be true. For example, accepting yourself and changing your behaviour might feel contradictory.¬†But DBT teaches that it's possible for you to achieve both these goals together. We must accept the good and the bad together. It focuses on distress tolerance, mindfulness, emotional regulation and interpersonal effectiveness. The treatment plan is long-term weekly individual and group sessions. After that, if you do the homework, if you do the work, you graduate, like I mentioned before.  Once graduated you are able to participate of the ""Graduate Group"" which is a support group for clients who have completed Stage I DBT skills and who want to continue to strengthen and generalize skills in managing distress and problems of daily living, with a special focus on behavior activation and increasing compassion towards themselves and others. The group facilitates working towards their life worth living goals in areas such as work, education, relationships, spirituality, health, sobriety, and however you define it.

Has anyone here done DBT? Any thoughts? Advice?

I'm about to embark this journey very hopeful, I hope its my last round. I want to learn more about myself, I want to apply the skills, I want to achieve everything I thought I couldn't.  I want to work towards feeling whole & content with who I am.

Let me know more about your journey, when did you find out? have you received help? do you combine it with medication? what do you feel have been your biggest obstacles? Would you like to share your thoughts? Assignments? Favorite skills to apply? We can form like sort of a study group along the way, keep me motivated in the process.

But I've gained a lot of insight in so little time.
And now I am mostly able to stop and think, not instantly react. I am a quiet borderline with depression and anxiety.

So my therapist wanted to know why I think my first depression came to be. And I told her, when I was in school in 11 th grade (in Germany that means next year you will do your Abitur and qualify for university). I actually liked going to school somewhat. But when I got up, looked in the mirror, I just noped out for the day, like their is no way I could put make up over that (I never had pimples blemishes, it was my features).
I felt that I couldn't go out like that, I felt extremely disfigured.

So ffw 10 years, I had my main problem my blepharochalasis removed and now I have a harder time with identifying what I see when I look in the mirror. At this point she told me how minor this was and that I will grow into it.

She told me that what she sees is a beautiful young woman.

160,Does Meditation Really Work? I Need Some Anger Management Tips Outside Meds and Therapy,"I recently had a severe set back. I (25f, living outside of the US) was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in late 2021, and later diagnosed with bpd in early 2022. I‚Äôve struggled with the symptoms for most of my life and also noticed that the symptoms are present with my father and his family. 

My dad (54) and I had a very contentious relationship throughout my childhood to the point where our fights would be explosive. I‚Äôd get disowned often, threatened to be killed, the works. As he got older and I started living with my mum, our relationship has gotten better all things considered. But now I‚Äôm having friction with my mum (52). 

She‚Äôs always been generally abusive but hers was mostly directed at my older sister. Now that she‚Äôs married and moved out, I guess the only person that was left to take it was me. Needless to say, I have some very deep seeded anger issues and I‚Äôm working on getting it under control. 

Unfortunately, I had an explosive fight with my mother a few days ago over my little sister who was extremely unwell and being neglected by her. She wouldn‚Äôt even buy her basic meds even though she has money to spare to plan spontaneous trips to see sick relatives in different provinces and stock them with medication. Apparently COVID-like flu symptoms aren‚Äôt enough to warrant that level of concern. I flew into a bitter rage and now I have to move in with my dad. I don‚Äôt want to get back to the way things were before so I‚Äôm exploring options outside therapy and medication (which I have been doing since 2017) to help manage my anger. 

Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not gainfully employed so living alone isn‚Äôt an option. I also have a child that needs to be supported so I need to make this work. I can‚Äôt really get a proper job because I‚Äôm still dealing with the severity of my bipolar symptoms but I‚Äôm working hard to iron that out. 

I‚Äôve never had any extreme problems in the workplace and when I have had some issues that were my fault, I‚Äôd go out of my way to make sure that I apologized if possible. I‚Äôm making progress with my anger issues but it‚Äôs slow-going, as these things normally are. 

Which brings me to my question: does meditation actually work? Does anyone have any recommendations of any help I can get, be it virtually or physically? Any diet and exercise recommendations as well? Any thing can help, I need to stabilize myself for the sake of my child and become fully independent once and for all and that will only work if my dad and I can live in harmony.",1696100122.0,False,2,3,TheUndrachiever,None,16weqg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/16weqg1/does_meditation_really_work_i_need_some_anger/

167,Coming back here after 2 years of therapy,"Hello,

This post is relationship related, mainly for the people who think they have BPD, but have not been diagnosed however are showing BPD behaviours and tendencies which leads them to believe they have the disorder.

I used to post fairly frequent here about 2 years ago (or maybe it was another bpd related sub) when I was in a terrible mental state showing borderline tendencies and behaviours in my daily life due to relationships, albeit not actually being diagnosed with BPD - I just thought I had it, which I know a lot of people here think they have it. After undergoing extensive therapy regarding relationships I hope this post can relate to some of you. A bit of context, the therapy was attachment therapy.

Now, I see so frequently about people posting their events with bad relationships, why is my partner doing this, why are they doing that, why am I like this, how can I fix it, why don‚Äôt they love me, so forth. There is a term coined ‚Äúmasochistic borderline personality disorder‚Äù, that occurs when attachment styles of partners do not match up. Example; anxious dating avoidant which can lead to people with anxious attachment styles exhibiting BPD traits and behaviours. This was the exact context and situation I was in 2 years ago. 

While getting therapy, my therapist gave me a book called ‚ÄúAttached‚Äù by Amir Levine. This book underlies everything most of you could relate to when it comes to relationships as I believe most of the people in here are of the anxious attachment style. I will not exaggerate, this book is a BIBLE and will really pick your brain and help you understand why you are showing such tendencies and behaviours, and help you develop a toolkit to help cope with these things.

2 years later, I am still reading this book and coming back to parts of it. I am now in a new relationship (1 month) AND it is long distance at the moment. I never in my life thought I could commit to a LDR again as it truly fucked up my mental state last time which became the onset of my ‚ÄúBPD tendencies‚Äù.

I haven‚Äôt stressed once, none of my old behaviours have slipped out, I am extremely content with this relationship and we are both very happy.

70% of my success I feel comes from this book, again, ‚ÄúAttached‚Äù by Amir Levine. It is a bible, the god damn holy grail and ancient script of why our relationships fuck up and always turn to shit. I can guarantee you if you are open minded and willing to learn, this WILL help you and help you understand why these patterns of bad relationships are happening and why your behaviours start.

I am more than happy to share the book with anyone who is interested as it genuinely makes me sad coming here and finding posts people are making , that I was making 2 years ago.

Much love

Take a walk, work out, cold shower etc. If I want to get aggressive with someone, I instead approach them calmly, explain how I feel and why.

189,Medicine & Therapy - Should I try?,"I‚Äôm F(20), and I feel like something‚Äôs missing for me to function like a ‚Äúnormal person‚Äù (if that makes sense).

I was diagnosed with BPD last year when I had a manic episode and I lost control of my life. I lost a friendship or two over it (probably 3 or more). I damaged many relationships for sure. I was in and out of hospitals like you change your underwear. As I was in each hospital, I never took the meds. I didn‚Äôt think or believed I needed them. I didn‚Äôt think I had a problem. I saw how the meds were making other patients feel and dictate, and it was not the way I wanted to be. 

When I returned home, I was having impulsive feelings to do whatever I wanted and go wherever I wanted. I did this to the point where I didn‚Äôt know how much it affected my parents and sisters. I eventually stopped going out on my own terms (literally). I took a break from college (I still haven‚Äôt gone back & don‚Äôt plan on it); I isolated myself from friends and family (even when family came to visit, I hide in my room until they leave or not text my cousins); and I had to be forced to go outside, whether it be to go shopping or get gas with my mom (little rides here and there). I developed social anxiety to the point where I don‚Äôt know how to speak to people (and I used to talk to anyone and everyone, I would be the one to start conversations with strangers). 


Growing up, I was always against medication. Never liked it, I always thought home remedies were the way to go. Even if I had pain, I never used painkillers or anything to heal it. I always stuck it out until it got better. But sticking out the pains of BPD aren‚Äôt helping me.

Even though a side of me is still scared to try pills, the other side of me wants to try them.

As for therapy, I miss having someone to talk or vent to, but then again, I would need to find a therapist that I‚Äôm comfortable with. I know this post is out of place and there‚Äôs probably information missing or things don‚Äôt make sense, but feel free to ask away and share suggestions.

191,"Well guys, I'm going back to therapy","TW: suicidal thoughts

So, a little backstory. I (23F) have been diagnosed with BPD, Chronic Depressive Disorder, bulimia/anorexia (depending on the time of diagnosis) and c-PTSD. I have been out of therapy for a little over 7 months after intensive treatments for five years, which did help a lot. However, I've been noticing my mood spiraling down over the last few months and I've been smoking increasingly more weed, experiencing panic attacks for the first time in over a year and I've been having extreme suicidal thoughts, both impulse and planning. 

That's not the reason I'm going back though, it's mostly because my mood getting worse is ruining my personal relationships and my school work. One of my best friends confronted me three days ago with the fact that I've been dominating conversations with my ""safe topics"" and kind of pushing my friends away by ignoring them when we get together. She was right and she had an extremely hard time telling me, so we went on about the topic and ended up talking about how my defense mechanism when I'm in a bad state is to always veer back to some ""safe topics"" to talk about so I don't get emotional, but I also get extremely distracted so my friends don't get any depth from our relationship.  I have been apathetic when I'm alone, resulting in poor self care and a pretty big delay in my school work. I can't see a way out honestly, but I can't keep hurting the people around me like this, so I'm going back to therapy.

Just wanted to share because it feels really horrible and terrifying, I've let myself slide back far enough that I know it's going to be one of those uphill climbs that might very well take twice as long as it took me to get back down to this level.

193,Therapy has made me more palatable to others but I'm still suffering,"i had a conflict with my upstairs neighbor two days ago that has really shaken me up.

basically, some days they have been repeatedly bouncing a ball and running around for hours at a time. i don't mind noise much in terms of music or talking, but my ceiling is their floor.

when this first started, i tapped my broom against the ceiling. two days ago, i did it again except a little louder this time because i assumed they didn't hear me before. less than 30 seconds later a lady was at my door screaming at me and being very disrespectful, saying i was what is wrong with this country.

i can concede that it would have been more polite to have tried knocking on their door first, but i have social anxiety and i didn't think it was rude to tap my broom against the ceiling. regardless, she had no right to treat me like that.

in the past i probably would have lashed out, cussed her out or otherwise retaliated in some way. but i didn't. i apologized profusely, even though i wasn't in the wrong. i diffused the situation. eventually she somewhat calmed down after going off on me for what felt like forever, we shook hands and she left. they continued to be loud for the rest of the night.

and i fucking regret being the bigger person! i know that if i retaliated, she would probably harass me more. she would probably start committing noise warfare. this woman is clearly off her rocker herself. it would have made my own life even worse.

but i wish i fucking stood up for myself! why did i let someone treat me that way, in my own home?! and then admittedly my thoughts turn dark, both towards her and myself. but i just hit myself in the head until i bruised and my eyes were swollen all day.

i know i shouldn't let it get to me. for fucks sake, i argue with my brain all day every fucking day of my life telling myself to let it go and stop thinking about it but i physically cannot stop myself from ruminating. no one understands how much i fight myself on this, how hard my logic brain tries to make me stop and goes through all the reasons it's pointless over and over and over.

but i can't. so i spent all day yesterday in bed, hitting my dab pen, and not eating much of anything even though i'm under doctor's orders to put on weight.

i hate that i let someone make me feel so small and unempowered. this keeps happening, i do the right thing and i be the bigger person. they get off with no consequences for treating me like shit, and then i fucking spiral.

i've spent the past decade fighting to get to a point in my life where i feel safe and secure at work and at home after having a fucked up childhood and extremely chaotic college experience. and all it took was one stranger to upheave everything and send me spiraling again.

i can keep my calm and composure now, even when my mom is insulting me to my face. i never used to be able to do that. but my own suffering remains the same, and both my mental and physical health have been declining as of late. the gnawing pain in my left trap has been worsening. my sleep has been inconsistent, either going to bed at 3am or waking up at 3am.

i try my damnest not to hurt others anymore. i make myself small and stay out of the way. i have dulled my outward reactions to other's behavior, i don't put up a fight. i torment myself every day with all the terrible things i've done in the past. but i am in so much pain still. no one understands how much it hurts me to be alive. i feel like an exposed nerve, i feel like i don't have skin. i don't think i'm meant for this world.",1677265893.0,False,7,6,pastelxbones,,11azce7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/11azce7/therapy_has_made_me_more_palatable_to_others_but/

So I've been going through therapy to help cope with my abusive household and to help regulate emotions and the whole DBT exercises. And I was abit down cause I felt like nothing has changed. I still felt a mess. I haven't found a job yet so I can move it ( it was my major goal set in therapy). And I was feeling Abit down cause of the amount of job rejections and got a scam offer for remote work. Talked to my friend about how I was feeling and she told me I did change. I have shown progress but I didn't believe it because I couldn't see it. I was just only concentrating on the major goals. 
Until today.

I started a new relationship, usually I would create an unhealthy bond and attachment and be super emotionally dependant but with him I didn't.  I was more cautious. During the dating process I wrote down little things that just seemed off to me so I wouldn't forget and be blinded by the whole he's my fp he can't do no wrong and let my strong emotions control me etc etc.. with that it helped me assess today's situation, yet another confusion and I realized this is an unhealthy cycle that I no longer want to be apart of. I don't want to be apart of toxic cycles just cause they're nice sometimes and how they make me feel in the ups only, and keep making excuses. I don't want to go through poor communication (where it gives me panic attacks cause I'm beyond scared) and me begging for clarification and dumb witty comebacks. I no longer need those unhealthy bonds to feel okay or fill this weird void my inner child has. So I left him. And I'm happy. I'm proud.

203,"Therapy troubles, advice needed","Regular talk therapy does not help me. Until about six months ago I hadn‚Äôt gone to therapy in years bc all that was available to me was cbt. This year I discovered trauma based therapy and since I have cptsd as well, I started seeing an emdr therapist. Who never brought it up other than to say some brief things our first session, until I finally brought it up after the sixth one and she told me I basically wasnt stable enough to do that and talked about my meds all the time and said I wouldn‚Äôt be able to process therapy until I was evened out/properly medicated.

I just started seeing this new guy that she actually referred me to because he‚Äôs certified in dbt, teaches group classes, and does transference focused therapy.

But we don‚Äôt. 

Talking doesnt help me. I have no problem talking about my issues. I actually talk too much and have so much to talk about that once I start talking I go all over the place e and feel like I need someone to wrangle me back on topic and I told him that our very first session and apparently it doesn‚Äôt matter.

204,"Who else here has gotten more ""intense"" after/during therapy (formerly detached/quiet to borderline personality pipeline)","TL:DR  ;   therapy made me ""more""  borderline,  in the sense that everything that used to happen inside of me but remained hidden while I was depressed and secluded, now is external and very intense.

Just checking in here to see if anyone has a had a similar experience as I did.


----------------------

I've recently been diagnosed with borderline, but to be honest it was a long time coming.

I should add I started therapy pretty young, when I was just 18, although for very different issues then now. I basically spent my teenage years extremely (and I mean extremely) detached from the world, myself and other people. I was cyinical, depressed, and had no idea of who I was or what I wanted. I socialized but I was never ""myself"" and as a result, didn't appear very emotional or intense to people.

Then since I started therapy, I've learned to recognize my own emotions, wants, and to stand up for myself, and how messed up a lot of my childhood really was; no major traumatic incidents or anything but just a very long period of total emotional neglect and isolation. The thing as that since I started this process, it's like all those years and years of repressed emotions are coming out and just don't stop coming. I've been in therapy for over 7 years now, and the sucky thing is that I've become so much more emotionally intense as a result. It's exposed some very deep rooted abondoment issues I have. I used to take everything out on myself, with the self harm, developing an eating disorder, you name it. Now that I don't do that as much anymore, a lot of my feelings end up going outward towards others.

As a result, my friends, relationships, and even family have seen a different side of me. The side more typically associated with borderline which is why I have the diagnosis now. My emotions are very often at 100, even in mundane situations. I get extremely in love but also extremely angry or even hateful, fearful and I cry every day even though I'm not depressed. I've had all my inner thoughts and feelings since I was a teen but it didn't ""come out"", now it does and it's sadly ""too much""  for a lot of people. I've lost a handful of friends, and put serious strain on my other friends and relationships, and made me loose several jobs. I ""freak out""  and I feel so guilty afterwards.

If anyone here has gone through something similar ,, and hopefully came out the other end a bit less ""intense"",  I'd love to hear and also love to hear how you got to tat point. I'm still in therapy but I feel like I've changed to a version of myself where my current therapy is not working for me. I'm not sure how to progress. I freaking love my life, I really do. I love my friends and my SO and with some mixed feelings I even have warm feelings towards my family now. But god it sucks so much to always be the person in the room that ""looses it"" the quickest, has the worst temper, least patience, in so much need of reassurance. I literally get emotional every night because saying goodnight is like saying goodbye, and it triggers my abondonment issues. Sigh I'm sure some of you might relate.

Today was my first therapy session. I was super nervous about going and as I was there I wasn‚Äôt able to ever really calm down. As I was doing the paperwork my hand was shaking so much I wasn‚Äôt able to write well. As we talked my whole body went stiff and certain parts of my body would shake at time. I wasn‚Äôt even really able to properly convey things to her. I felt like she kept taking things in a different direction than what I really meant to say but I couldn‚Äôt find it in me to correct her. I also find myself more concerned about what she thinks about me than trying to accurately explain to her my issues. I already feel like she doesn‚Äôt like me. I understand she has other clients that she talks to all the time, this is just her job and realistically she probably doesn‚Äôt even care enough to dislike me but still. I was so uncomfortable the whole time. I cried my whole drive home. I was so upset with myself for letting anxiety even get in the way of therapy. 

I really don‚Äôt want to go back. I know I should give it another shot and not base so much off of one session but I don‚Äôt know if I  can bring myself to.

Did Therapy ever help you? And if so, how? What did you learn, what did they tell you that you didn't had/knew before?
