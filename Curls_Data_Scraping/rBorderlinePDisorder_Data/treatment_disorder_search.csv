2,I think the current treatment for BPD is actively hurting healing,"People with BPD are have very, very strong emotions and difficulty trusting those around them. Well, in a society where everyone values thinking over feeling and lies constantly in the name of ‚Äúbeing polite‚Äù *that makes sense*. The current treatment tries to force those with BPD to conform to a system that actively harms the members by teaching conflicting lessons like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt seek external validation‚Äù but if others don‚Äôt like what you make/do then it‚Äôs worthless?? Be yourself but be insulted if ‚Äúyourself‚Äù goes against the norm for those around you? Trust people‚Äôs words but their actions actively do not match their actions because in public people say things to be seen a certain way while behind closed doors they feel no need to follow their words because we are a society of shaming rather than holding *ourselves* accountable. How can we ever fit in when we are taught to do one thing while we actively see the opposite being done ? The confusion keeps us from healing because society itself is fucked and we‚Äôre being judged by the standards that society.

Anyone feel similarly? I feel I‚Äôve healed by rejecting the lessons taught by people who don‚Äôt even follow them and listening to my feelings‚ÄîNOT MY HATRED. Hatred is a warping of feelings, I am not saying to follow your lust or anger or need to divert pain, but the only thing that is objective to us is our own feelings and when we base our reality on the words of people who lie‚Äîintentionally or because people refuse to acknowledge their own fault‚Äîour reality is gonna constantly be falling apart. We need to find strength in ourselves not those who ‚Äúshould‚Äù support us and repeatedly hurt us by failing to. Empathy and support have been lost, people want to do what‚Äôs easy and refuse to legitimately feel pain and support others. It‚Äôs so much easier to push people onto therapists or suicide hotlines than share your pain, but pain has to go somewhere and in this society that refuses to genuinely connect it‚Äôs not.

Have you ever been helped by someone pushing you to a therapist or hotline when you reached out to feel cared for? Humans heal through connection, not transactions. Therapists help us hide our pain and claim we are incurable. We have so much pain that needs to be accepted, and it is so hard to do alone, and when our support pushes us to someone who treats us medically but will not shoulder our pain with us we will not heal.

In pain is growth, it is just so hard to push through alone.

3,Can lying be stopped with treatment?,"I‚Äôm looking for hope.

Everyone with BPD is different, but I was wondering if anyone here with BPD could tell me about their experience with lying.

I primarily want to know if, you lied regularly in your intimate relationship, were you able to stop with treatment.

My pwBPD lies often and without difficulty, generally to avoid conflict, rejection and taking responsibility. She‚Äôll lie even once she‚Äôs caught in the lie and do a sort of trickle truth. She‚Äôll be adamant she isn‚Äôt lying even when she is.

When I find out she lied or she comes clean after I press her on some inconsistency she can‚Äôt explain away she‚Äôll tell me she hates herself for lying. She tells me she doesn‚Äôt want to be a liar and that she knows it‚Äôs morally wrong.

She‚Äôs recently diagnosed (last few months) and has started DBT and a treatment program for BPD.

Was anyone here who lied regularly able to stop with treatment and prioritize the truth and honesty?

19,"Has anyone tried other treatments like ketamine infusions, ECT etc?","I'm beyond frustrated by this point. Tons of therapy, medical marijuana, various medications, but I'm still suffering so much that I wish I could just get my amygdala out so I wouldn't have to suffer anymore.

I've previously decided against ECT and TMS because, well, there's a lot of controversy around those two and I've heard mainly horror stories. I'm not gonna repeat any potential misinformation I've heard, but
it does make me hesitate a lot. I don't wanna develop more problems.

20,How to cope until I get treatment?," Sorry  if any of this is incoherent or difficult to read, it‚Äôs very difficult  to make sentences that flow right or make sense but I'm just gonna try  my best.

I have had recurring  psychotic episodes for about 2 years now, alongside depression and  anxiety, and I have mananged it not too horribly until roughly half a  year ago.

I have been looking for  treatment for my mental state since then, mainly for the debilitating  psychosis that, as a few doctors told me, is likely caused either by a  combination of BPD and CPTSD, or the beginning stages of paranoid  schizophrenia (my biological mom has it so it's fairly likely that i  might too).

I have seen multiple  medical professionals in the past months and been assessed as high risk  due to the severity of my situation, rapidly worsening psychosis,  suicidal ideaction, etc. and given an urgent recommendation and referral  for inpatient treatment. Because the mental health system is so  ridiculously overstretched where I live though, I basically won't be  able to get any help for at least another 8 weeks. I have spoken to  countless psychiatrists, treatment falilities and so on in the past few   months, and got told over and over again ""sorry there is nothing we can  do for you, we just don't have the capacities"". Sometimes I'd get  referred to someone else, who would inevitably tell me the same thing. I  can't travel to get treatment, because in my country you have to get  treated in the same area you live.

I  fortunately have lovely family members in a different district, whose  house I legally ""moved to"" on paper, which is the only reason I was able  to get assessed at the last inpatient facility a few days ago. Even  with referrals from multiple doctors though, they told me that they can  only take me in 8 weeks at the soonest.

Until  then, I have neither therapy nor medication and honestly I'm very  scared. I have terrifying hallucinations and paranoia that makes  interacting with others incredibly difficult. Even holding a  conversation or stringing a simple sentence together is hard because I  am distracted by my hallucinations, mentally exhausted and/or  distrustful of other people.

Frequent  panic attacks and nightmares, emotional dysregulation and so on... I am  dissociated constantly and don't know whether I am awake or dreaming.

I  have been holding myself together more or less by self medicating with  things like kratom and weed to help me sleep at least a little and stop  me from freaking out 24/7 but it's a very flawed ""solution"" and  exacerbates certain symptoms. Recently this seems to be working less and  less. I spend increasingly more time in that freaked-out state of  impending doom and unable to distract myself from the scary things I  see, hear and feel all the time.

I  can‚Äôt do very much, all my energy is spent on trying to keep myself  safe-ish and that doesn‚Äôt always work. I frequently self harm to  distract from the overwhelming emotions or because I am so stressed out  by the whole situation. I have some friends but none of them understand  any of what I‚Äôm going through and I can‚Äôt find the words to explain  what‚Äôs going on. I used to be able to talk at least a bit about my  problems, but my paranoia tells me I can't trust anyone and even if im  in a less paranoid state, I just don‚Äôt have the mental capacity atm.

I  had to go on sick leave from university, so I spend my days at home  trying to keep myself distracted. I have a hard time going out in public  because of the constant paranoia and anxiety. Also the hallucinations  are incredibly distracting and I look visibly freaked out cause I keep  looking behind me, hearing voices, never knowing if an actual person is  talking to me or if I am just imagining it.

I  struggle immensely with nighttime. The hallucinations get stronger and  scarier and more difficult to ignore and I find myself having tons of  sleepless nights cause I'm just too scared to fall asleep, or I get  woken up by terrifying PTSD nightmares and won't be able to sleep after  that.

I have a general  practitioner who prescribed me antidepressants and benzos in the past,  but isn't comfortable with giving me anything antipsychotic. And  honestly I wouldn't want her to just give me her best guess, cause  multiple things she prescribed me in the past didn‚Äôt help and made  certain things worse (the benzos caused intense dissociation that never  went away and then a psychotic episode when I stopped taking them, even  though I was taking them as prescribed)

I  don't even have an official diagnosis for what‚Äôs currently going on  yet, apart from BPD, generalized depression and anxiety disorder, that I  got diagnosed with a few years back. The inpatient place that I am on  the waiting list for will do more diagnostic tests and prescribe me the  meds when I get there, but until then I have nothing.

But,  as scary as my situation is, it can hardly be unique. I‚Äôm sure I am not  the only one who has had to wait for treatment in a horrible and  declining mental state like this, especially since the pandemic left the  system even more broken then it was before.

Is  there anyone who has been in a similar situation and can give me some  insight into how to cope until I can get help? How can I keep myself  safe? How do I survive 8 or more weeks like this, without meds or  therapy while my mental state seems to keep declining?

22,Online Treatment Programs?,"Hi all,

I'm waiting to hear back from McLean Hospital regarding their outpatient online program.... and I saw a comment saying they have a long wait list. I don't know if that's just their inpatient program, or the online one too, or how long I should expect to wait before hearing from someone.

Anyway, with as expensive as it is, I thought I'd ask if anyone has experience with that program or any others I should consider. I live in a very rural part of Oregon with no BPD options locally, and the self help books aren't helping much.

I've been able to control my behavior and impulses for 20 years (ok, for the most part üò¨), but the emotional roller coaster, emptiness, irritation, and internal suffering have only gotten worse. I've tried every major type of medication, EMDR, 'generic' therapy, meditation, yoga/exercise, diet, and a 6 session IV/IM therapy assisted ketamine program that didn't seem to put much of a dent in it.

Does anyone have recommendations for remote programs that work? I'm looking for something intensive.

Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è

UPDATE: For anyone interested, the McLean Gunderson program took a little over a week to get back to me, and it's not going to work out after all. You have to be in Massachusetts because of therapist licensing (I thought they had somehow figured this one out because it doesn't mention anywhere on their site) and the $8400 they listed online is actually $9000 (not covered by insurance) for the 6mo program plus another $1100-2300 per week that may or may not be covered by insurance, assuming you have insurance that covers out of state treatment, plus apartment/room rent. So like $20-30k minimum?

DBT Path at emotionallysensitive.com looks to have a decent online program, but without any of the therapy, again for state licensing reasons. That's on my backup plan list, though I might miss the next class start date...

So... I started looking for online DBT therapy in Oregon, instead of searching for BPD programs, and got a few hits of places that offer online group classes in addition to individual therapy and maybe couples therapy. I don't know if my insurance will reimburse for any of it, as they all seem to be self pay, but at this point, I might as well rack up the credit card debt, as my only other option seems to be just continuing to destroy my own life. Hopefully DBT will be enough of a starting point- I was really hoping to incorporate all the other stuff like mentalization and transference focused therapy....

32,Has anyone tried embracing BPD and stopping treatment?,"I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôve worded that quite correctly but  it‚Äôs probably close enough.

I have quiet BPD with a trauma genesis (i think i have complex or developmental/relational trauma, or at least that started this) so i‚Äôve had symptoms since about 14.

I‚Äôm 34 now. I make my mental health an active priority. I live in the UK where treatment is very hard to get; nonetheless I have paid for private therapy for the last 4 years, paid privately for DBT skills, bought many and various self help books, self soothing kit, keeping a low stress lifestyle, avoiding triggers and substances, got a dog‚Ä¶.you name it. 

Recently i‚Äôve opened up to friends more and sought out support for alcohol and also reached out to GP and for additional therapy.

The therapist straight up ghosted me with no warning

As did the alcohol service.

The GP said meds were unlikely to help.

The way I felt was deeply hurtful and, whilst I understand not personal, it reminded me of how scary it is to place your chances of getting better into other peoples hands.

I‚Äôve never felt my anger the way I did then; and I decided that maybe it‚Äôs better to embrace having BPD; being full of feelings and rage and extremes, and work to own it rather than seeking outside support.

I would continually complain that she treated my mother as a human person instead of an abuser, and she'd mostly ignore me.

She would constantly say something in the lines of ""that time I called her she didn't cry like she was lying"". Then I'd say ""Yeah, she's sick and disturbed.

35,Residential Treatment?,"Loooooong story short, I was hospitalized towards the end of May for being suicidal, got pressured by the crap psychiatrist into taking an antidepressant that ended up in me hallucinating and making an attempt while in the hospital (the only time I've ever hallucinated or made an actual attempt), released with a recommendation to do ECT. Hospital experience was awful on so many levels and left me traumatized to the point of having nightly PTSD nightmares after release about being trapped in horrible situations. 

My treatment team (2 therapists and a psychiatrist) do not think I should do ECT and that I need to do residential treatment. The problem is finding somewhere I can afford that works with my insurance, will actually take me, and doesn't sound like it would be actively harmful. I've been rejected by 3 so far mainly due to the anomalous, medication caused suicide attempt and for having an ED. A bunch of them I also had to rule out myself based on reading on their sites that they won't take someone with an active eating disorder. And then even trying to get into ED treatment is problematic because of my recent suicide attempt. There is one place that will take me, but their reviews are terrible and they are an extremely restrictive environment which I know would be very triggering. Plus they will only work on my ED and none of my other diagnoses (depression, anxiety, PTSD, BPD) which seems like it would waste time and be counterproductive. Even the ED specific treatment programs integrate trauma work. 

It's incredibly sad, frustrating, and demoralizing to keep giving out all my sensitive and trauma info/ history just to be rejected over and over. But the kicker is I'm on leave from work and the documents say I shouldn't return until after I've done a treatment program. Plus my therapists are both saying they don't want to treat me if I don't go on to do a ""higher level of care"". And I'm still in bad shape and unable to work. I'm in the US btw.

37,Should I attempt to encourage someone to seek treatment.,"I suspect one of my neighbors is BPD, I have several family members with it, and this person‚Äôs behaviors are significantly more pronounced.
 
We have only been neighbors for about a year and a half. In that time I have noticed a lot of behavior patterns that, even if this isn't BPD are certainly red flags. For instance, she struggles with emotional regulation even in public, and she seems very paranoid. She has told me on more than one occasion, that she ""knows"" the whole street is discussing her. She tends to yell, cry, or make wild accusations for what seems to me to be very little reason. I started noticing these things within months of her family moving in. I once tried to assure her no one was talking about her, she got visibly worked up and frustrated and told me she knew I was lying. 

To be fair, more recently it's likely she has been the subject of many many conversations between neighbors, but in the beginning, no one was paying her much attention at all. She has accused multiple people of conspiring to pick on or exclude her, sometimes directly, and sometimes behind their backs. And yes, at this point a large portion of the street does in fact actively avoid her, and she is much less likely to be invited to things, but she was already claiming it was happening long before that began. I have watched her sabotage relationship after relationship, one misunderstanding or wild accusation at a time. You are either her best friend, or you are out to get her and it can switch with zero warning. I have tried to maintain a cordial relationship myself, I even thought we were friends at one point, but I have been increasingly worried that she would eventually come for me too, which she has now done.

She is currently going back and forth between refusing to so much as acknowledging my presence or getting upset and hurt when she sees me outside as if I am outside for the sole purpose of ruining her day. She is also going out of her way to tell any one moving in, that my children and I are bad news and to stay far far away from us. She has done this to others in the past, I know the new neighbors will figure it out pretty quickly, and she will find herself a new worst enemy sooner or later so I have no real need to address that particular issue with her. Waiting it out and grey rocking will work just fine.

At this point, I mostly just want to help her. I know this is something she hasn't chosen, and I know the way she sees things is very real and very painful for her. From where she sits, she isn't creating drama and picking fights, she's protecting herself from people who she perceives as mistreating her. I have family members with this, and while I don't have BPD myself, I do have a handful of the tendencies from having grown up with a BPD parent and I get how painful and real this can feel for her. To be fair, and largely because I had a BPD parent, and spent a lot of my life in a caretaker role, I likely feel more responsibility for her than is appropriate. 

But what I want is to encourage her to seek treatment. Not in an unkind way, not so she will leave me alone, or suddenly get better, or go away, or because I am exhausted from trying to avoid offending her, or just avoid her. I have enough experience with my family members to know the quickest way to her moving on from fixating on me, is to grey-rock any interactions with her. That no matter how compassionate and well-intentioned, engaging with her at this point will have the opposite effect. I am well aware that trying to reason with her is not the easy way out here.

I want her to seek help because she seems very miserable and unhappy, she can't make friendships work and doesn't seem to understand why, she is even sabotaging her children's relationships as well as blocking their ability to figure out to resolve conflict in a healthy way. She can't seem to see that the problem is her. Or maybe she can, and just doesn't know how to stop.  

Because of this, I genuinely want her to seek help for her own sake, and for the sake of her children. However, I am just the neighbor, on top of being someone she has recently discarded. What is my responsibility here? Even if I am wrong, and it's not BPD, there is definitely something going on and she could benefit from seeking help.

Should I approach her? One of the other neighbors suggested an intervention after a particularly memorable public scene a while ago but that idea was quickly abandoned. It was generally agreed that it was unlikely she would hear it, and she would probably not react well at all. However, I wonder if we weren't giving her enough credit. It's not my responsibility, but I think it's unlikely she has anyone in her life willing to say anything to her.  If I (or a group of neighbors) were to approach her, is there a gentle, but effective way to do this?

41,Trying to get the right treatment,"So I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with BPD, I‚Äôve always felt a little strange but it wasn‚Äôt until a year ago after a few psych ward trips, dropping out of nursing school right before finishing the semester with A‚Äôs, and a extremely toxic relationship I started to look for what was wrong with me and found I fit all the criteria for BPD. 

I didn‚Äôt want to self diagnose myself so once I started therapy and seeing a psychiatrist I just decided not to say anything and let them decide for themselves. They went down the path of treating me as if I was bipolar (Prozac, abilify, depakote) and I just decided to go with it and forgot about bpd for a while. They never actually diagnosed me as bipolar, just as a ‚Äúunspecified mood disorder‚Äù

Anyways during this last month my ex contacted me and some shit between us happened and it threw me off emotionally all over the place to the point where I realized I wasn‚Äôt okay at all and I haven‚Äôt actually made changes in my life to make it better over the last year. 

So I came back to thoughts of BPD and decided to bring it up to my therapist. She grabbed her DSM book and we started to go over the criteria. She got about 4 in when she paused in a way where I could tell she was already going to say I didn‚Äôt have it. She stopped to tell me that personality disorders are difficult and asked me if I wanted to know what she thought about me. I said yea and she decided to finish going over the criteria first. I fit all the criteria, she never denied that I didn‚Äôt meet them. But she would say things like ‚Äúwell your depression isn‚Äôt the kind where you‚Äôre sad and then laughing in the same hour and that alone rules you out from BPD‚Äù and ‚Äúclients I work with who have BPD do a thing called splitting where they think I‚Äôm a great therapist one second and then I‚Äôm the worst therapist ever and are calling HR on me and you don‚Äôt do that‚Äù she also said ‚Äúyou carry a lot of guilt and shame and feel sorry for what you did and people with BPD don‚Äôt do that‚Äù So I met all the criteria but it wasn‚Äôt the same as how BPD experience it apparently.

Anyways she tells me what she thinks of me, I have low self esteem, lack of identity, carry a lot of guilt, extremely hard on myself, emotionally unstable. But she says she doesn‚Äôt believe I have a personality disorder. She says something about how she worked clinically with BPD and just doesn‚Äôt believe I fit that. 

She‚Äôs not wrong about me, she can see what my issues are and what I need to work on. We agreed to sign me up for separate therapy for coping skills and also group sessions for anxiety just to get me in a group. I really like her and have opened up to her and find her helpful in my life. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like despite meeting all 9 criteria and it causing extreme dysfunction in my life I just got written off because I come off as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù with my fake ass day to day persona. 

I don‚Äôt know if it because I‚Äôm a male, or maybe Because I don‚Äôt fit the normal BPD stigma. I‚Äôm a loner, I isolate and internalize everything. People pleaser who avoids conflict, get along great with everyone,gets pissed off at people easily, have no close relationships, hard working and high functioning, but it only last so long until I blow up. I hurt everyone around me and myself. 

Anyways I‚Äôm not sure what to do. A label isn‚Äôt important to me but if I do have BPD I think it‚Äôs important to clarify that for proper treatment. Although she doesn‚Äôt believe I have BPD I think she still see the core issues wrong with me. So I‚Äôm willing to trust her and believe she can still help me get better. But I don‚Äôt know if I should seek a second opinion. All I read about online is how misdiagnosed BPD is and especially with men because of the stigma it‚Äôs a female disorder.

42,"Wife with BPD (diagnosed, treatment not regular) will it get any better?"," 

I have been married for close to a year now (no kids) and recently my wife was diagnosed with BPD (by two separate psychiatrists). She is in denial about her condition, and blames me for taking her to the wrong doctors and influencing them. I have known that she may have BPD for almost 9 months now, and have put in a lot of time and energy to understand her condition and not do things that will trigger her (but unknowingly i have triggered her many times). She has shown all the text book traits, attempted to kill herself( 5 times, excluding the times she only expressed desire to end her life) physically assaulted me when i was asleep. Accused me of having an affair, that i don't care enough about her, i demean her emotions and feelings etc. She threatened to divorce and end the relationship almost every 2 weeks (i tried to help her deal with these thoughts of constant abandonment but they still persist)

She became aware of her condition only 2 months ago she is on Anti-psychotics and anti-depressants. I do no know if she will ever be able to accept her condition. In the past month the intensities of fights and arguments have reduced, and she is slowly getting back to a routine, i still have to follow-up for everything her meds, bills etc. She still hasn't started regular therapy (took me 6 months to convince her that she needed professional help, and she needed to be hospitalized for attempted suicide, that is when she was first diagnosed with BPD.

So now that she is aware of her condition (albeit reluctantly) she is trying to set things right. But i feel completely drained and still walk on eggshells around her. I am thinking of divorce, but also hoping that she will be able to find some sense of normalcy. I still do love her, but do not think i have the energy to deal with more of the mood swings and accusations.

51,ADHD treatment (medication) alleviated my bpd symptoms,"Tw: very short mentions of sh and suicidal ideation

I am in a stationary dbt program atm. 
I was diagnosed with bpd before, here I was also diagnosed with ADHD (I asked to be tested!) 

I decided to try methylphenidate, because a lot of my friends here told me they really benefit from it. I started with only 20mg in the morning (now I take 15 in the morning and 5 in the noon) and from the first day on my bpd symptoms became so much better.

- my mood swings are less often and they are not near as intense as before
- My urge to sh became almost non existent
- Suicidal ideation decreased enormously 
- All in all I seem to suffer less 

You might say, this is also due to dbt. And it is! Dbt is a lot of hard work, it is really painful, but it works and it pays of for me. I am for ever grateful for the chance to make this Dbt program. 

Nevertheless those immense improvements i mentioned above occurred exactly with the beginning of my methylphenidate treatment. 

Bpd and ADHD symptoms often overlap. A high amount of people with bpd have ADHD, and a lot of kids with ADHD develop bpd. 
If you have any chance, I recommend you to get tested for ADHD. It changed a lot for me in the past three or four weeks.

68,How to you guys are able to get a treatment and be able to work,"So in my country we have free health care but BPD is not being under any benefits pretty much and Im unable to get any socials because of that. I have to work to be able to maintain any kind of lifestyle and fortunately I'm working 9-5 corpo job remotely, away from people so even when I have episodes, no one sees it. Because it's till 5 it's extremely hard to be able to find any psychiatrist etc being able to take me as a patient (which I understand, they are people too and don't want to work till whatever late hour). Because of the disorder it's also hard for me to be able to be focused so long during the day - eating disorder as a one way of self harm. After work I pretty much need a nap to live. As I'm not seeing a doctor now I'm scared to take meds regularly as I would run out of them anyways and wouldn't be able to get more of them, I'm super scared of begging unknown doctors for more meds.  
I was on sick leave some time ago because I was in a therapy. About 12 weeks, during day we had meeting and workshops with psychiatrists, good stuff, I was not afraid to take meds then because I had doctors to ask for more if I run out of them. So in the end it was very helpful but every nice thing has to end I guess. 
So I'm not really sure that to do. I'm unable to see any doctors because I work but also I started to have episodes again and it's extremely hard to work. Doctors say bpd are unable to get any kind of socials because it would not benefit them and would make them actually worse as they wouldn't be doing anything regarding their condition but I feel like it's such an ass statement. 
How do you guys manage to get any kind of treatment and work daily? Its so tiring to have episodes and be in agony and also pretend that everything is fine to deliver daily target. It's not like they would care or understand anyways and money is always a first priority.

71,8 years in treatment and I'm losing all sense of self respect and sanity for a new FP. Any advice is appreciated,"I (25F) have found myself falling back into old patterns recently, and any insight into this experience or suggestions for how to feel less reactive and disengage emotionally would be extremely helpful. 

Apologies for it being bit long and scattered, I can't distance myself enough to explain it succinctly. 

I have never been rejected by an FP, really. I'm not used to being rejected. And this person had a thing for me too until he (25M, let's call him P) got overwhelmed with his own emotional unavailability and my own neediness I suppose. We had started sleeping together for a bit, and it was really.. intimate. Didn't feel casual, so I didn't want to keep it that way. We hang out almost everyday because we are in the same group and live at the same place (student accommodation). At the very least, I didn't want to hide it from our friends and everyone else. 

It felt like a roller coaster. He seems to enjoy my company and seeks it out sometimes, but only at his terms. One of our mutual friends teases him about being different around women and stopped being nice to me after he found out that me and P may have a thing. They're quite close. Mutual friend and I were friends for a few months before this and got along great, until now. P often found himself caught between our playful but increasingly passive aggressive jabs at each other. P and I often talked about him and how he's a little annoying. P is just fond of him for some reason. 

Since most of our interaction was at the same place as everyone else (student accommodation) P never prioritized spending time with me and I feel like the mutual friend was a big reason for it. And he seemed to not want to overtly show that he liked me. 

After a rocky few weeks, where I felt sidelined and didn't feel like he was considerate of the time and energy I spent to be around him, I asked P to make it more public and not something we sneak around about. I asked him if he wanted to see other people, and he said he doesn't really care about dating at this point. So I said then maybe we could date exclusively for a bit and see where this goes. If he didn't want this, I gave him the option to just go back to being friends.

He expressed at that time that he feels I disengage at times, just get distant. And he was not wrong, maybe? All the uncertainty had been driving me crazy and I would get sensitive to the littlest of rejections when he needed space, so I would distance myself and try to calm down. But I sure was not asking for anything excessive. He is just incapable of doing anything but being inert and shutting down in the face of demands from me or anyone else. I also just have depressive episodes when I'm not the most friendly.

He took some time and said that we should be friends. He was not a jerk about it, and opened up to me really nicely about how he feels incapable of opening up and being himself. 

After years of codependent relationships, I liked that he had a good sense of boundaries. But it seems I overcorrected? 

I want to be cool with being friends. I am, really. I like him and have fun with him. I am okay with suppressing the non-platonic feelings. I've decided to date other people, I think I can get over this. 

However, I still can't let go of the tendencies of letting him affect me like an FP does. When he is good to me, I feel on top of the world. But he tends to need a lot of space and he's not direct about it. I don't ask him for a lot, mostly just hope that he's around and attentive.. but he doesn't say no if I ask for something as little as going out for a smoke and he doesn't want to, just gets distant and ghosts. 

I feel disrespected in the group too, because the mutual friend is sort of the glue, and he's been passive aggressively hostile. I have been too, I just don't like him. He's like an egotistical old man who's so very average but surrounds himself with people that encourage his casual narcissism. I ""playfully"" call him out on a lot of things because I get annoyed. I try not to make myself small in front of people that want me to dull my strong opinionated personality in order to feel comfortable about themselves. I have done the opposite my whole life. I haven't been an asshole about it either, I've mostly just called him out on academic stuff that he is often so confidently wrong about. We're in the same course (psychology). 

Anyway, I feel pathetic. P's clearly not into me as much as I am into him. Or he is, but is not capable of acting on it. 

Maybe if the rejection was straightforward and clear, I would take the sting and move on. But this.. I can't take it. He wants me around and asks to do things together sometimes but also on his own time. What I want doesn't matter.

I am losing my mind over this. I know I should set boundaries and limit contact with the whole friend group that's just being toxic at this point because of the mutual friend. But with my rocky mental health, the little ritual of heading down every night was really helping keep me sane. I also can't ignore them completely for even a day, because if I go out for a smoke, they're all around, so I have to socialize. Smoking in the rooms is not possible. 

I hate myself for needing P to be.. not the way he is. I want to be rational and not be emotionally reactive to the little rejections like him taking a bit to reply, him not agreeing to the little things, not prioritizing me. 

I have found that if I force myself to have enriching experiences outside of an FP dynamic, it helps me feel saner and less reactive. I am trying that. But at the end of the day, it's P that determines how I feel. 

I am miserable. The things that have made life meaningful over the last few years have all blurred into the background. He's always at the forefront.

I am in a new country, I have close and casual friends for the first time in my life, and not just romantic partners that I obsessively cling to (most of them did the same until we were codependent and isolated). This is all deliberate too, something I am enforcing for myself to not fall into unhealthy patterns. I want to enjoy the little things like friendship, music, reading, going out, exploring the new place, and most importantly, studying - something I love and enjoy doing, it gives me purpose and I am so so passionate about and good at now (managing my ADHD somehow). 

I can't. It's all him in my head. And he is always around. I can't escape.

72,BPD and CPTSD - info on treatment approaches,"Hi everyone

I'm in therapy, but my therapist doesn't seem to like the BPD ""label"" and diagnosed me with CPTSD. she mostly uses talk therapy and CBT, but I don't feel treatment is helping me much. She's also indicated that trauma can create BPD and it may be resolvable. I tend to think this is not correct.

I feel I meet the criteria for BPD and CPTSD, but I don't live in the US so accessible therapists seem less faniliar with anything outside of depression and anxiety, etc. 

I've tried seeing different therapists, and this is the best fit personality-wise. I just feel lately she's not quite understanding how I feel or function. I'm loathe to start again with a new therapist, and be worse off (and it's a massive sink of time and money, which I can't afford again) so I thought I may either ask her to guide me on specific treatments, even if we need to research them together, or try search for therapists based on treatment specialistion. 

I would also like to read up on treatments and BPD to educate myself, and try to align myself with better care.

With that in mind (I'm not seeking a diagnosis or treatment recommendation), can you please tell me what the treatment options would be for someone diagnosed with:

- BPD only;
- CPTSD only; and

I was wondering, and I know everyone is different and acts differently, but would someone with BPD lie about me not getting her messages and not replying, as an excuse to shut me out? I‚Äôm sorry if I offend anyone saying this, I just don‚Äôt know how to properly translate my thoughts on the matter, excuse sounds insensible, I hope I am making sense with the question I am asking.

I guess what I also want to know is, is there any chance she will actually reach back to me? I know it‚Äôs an impossible question to answer, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve known her for years myself, we just started hooking up, but I just wonder if someone could make an educated guess, I would appreciate it since I tend to believe she was quite fond of me and genuine about it.

If she doesn‚Äôt write me back, should I attempt to contact her again, one last time? I‚Äôm conflicted about this since, if people I date don‚Äôt make an effort reaching out, I usually take this as a sign they are not interested, but in this case, we had a good thing going so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs appropriate for me to contact her again.",1684933966.0,False,1,0,carpemalutdiem,None,13qlbs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/13qlbs9/can_i_ask_your_advice_about_getting_the_silent/

Over the years I have explored different treatment options. I have BPD and a bunch of other mental illnesses.

I've considered electroconvulsive therapy but have heard so many horror stories.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is another option, but it seems to have just as many horror stories as ECT.

Ketamine infusions seem to have a decent success rate, but it has its horror stories too.

My psychiatrist wants to put me on Abilify, an antipsychotic. I've heard horror stories about that too.

I'm already on antidepressants and mood stabilizers, seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist and psychiatrist, been through DBT classes, on medical marijuana, but nothing seems to work. And I'm considered to be treatment-resistant.

With my current state of mind, would they even let me undergo any of these treatment options or would they insist that I'm not in the right mindset to consent to such procedures?

91,Recommended Treatment Plan,"(27 M) So earlier this year at the start of July I was sent to A 75 day treatment facility

In the months leading up to this I had gone through A bad breakup, Lost both of my grandparents to Covid, Was our through A very stressful time at work, was demoted, And lost one of my best friends. Needless to say I was depressed, and I was considering taking my own life.

I‚Äôve always been A weed smoker and A drinker, but my habits turned pretty addictive when Depression seemed to keep lingering around my life 

So I went to A dual diagnosis treatment center that helped cure mental health and substance abuse. 

Before treatment I did not think I had A problem with marijuana or Alcohol. I had never been sober before and had smoked weed every day for the past ten years, and drank on average 4 nights a week for the last 6 years. 

Once I had A few days sober I realized I had A substance abuse problem in addition to the mental health issues I was dealing with

After being in treatment for about 30 days they diagnosed me with BPD. I never knew I had this because I had never seen A therapist/psychiatrist in my life before. Everything was new.

When I was diagnosed I felt kind of upset because I didn‚Äôt know what to think. I always felt like O was a little different but I couldn‚Äôt pin point why.

I‚Äôve known for about 4 months now and I went through 75 days of PHP treatment and 2 months of IOP treatment. I‚Äôm now seeing my therapist every other week for an hour but I feel like my progress is very slow.

Does anybody have recommendations on what I should do for treatment because I don‚Äôt feel like this every other week therapy is helping as much as I‚Äôd like. DBT groups? Group therapy? Should I see my therapist more often? Are there any books I can read?

My therapist says this is Cureable and I won‚Äôt let it define me as A person... but for any of you who have had this for A while and have seen a lot of progress can you please give me some advice?

95,At the doctor right now receiving ketamine treatment for Borderline. Came in here a hot mess in tears and am right now completely ok with the fact I‚Äôm not ok. I want others to be aware of effective this treatment can be for some people. Feeling hope!,"I‚Äôm going to keep this brief: while I don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúmiracle drugs‚Äù to cure Borderline, ketamine really gives me hope that we may not be far off. Real healing and recovery from Borderline will always require some sort of talk therapy or DBT/CBT and ongoing management, but WOW.

I‚Äôm someone who has spent *years* in therapy and receiving psychiatric treatments for BPD (GAD/PTSD/ADD) and actively ‚Äúworking‚Äù my recovery and focusing on DBT (a form of CBT) and EMDR (wow so many acronyms). 

I think Ketamine (for me) actually ignites some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. Something resembling hope. 

It, at first in a treatment session, provides (at least for me) profound immediate relief from the constant, heavy feelings of guilt, shame, fear, and genuine terror of everyday existence.

But then the lasting effects I think are that it gives you sort of that distance from your problems in your life, and their perceived weight. It‚Äôs like, by giving you a break from carrying everything, it gives you a chance to breathe and reevaluate your issues from a healthier point of view that is less biased‚Äî almost like viewing yourself in the third person as a kind friend trying to help. It kind of allows you to be your own lifeguard in a way (Borderline for me often feels like I‚Äôm drowning beneath the emotional waves with the trauma response grabbing at my heels to pull me under.)

It‚Äôs not like all your problems disappear. It‚Äôs more it makes me feel ‚Äúok with not being ok‚Äù while at the same time reminding my brain how to have an internal monologue where you aren‚Äôt attacking yourself constantly with toxic thoughts. Something I probably haven‚Äôt experienced since early childhood or maybe ever. 

I see how it is helpful for people with PTSD/ trauma too, thorough similar relief mechanisms. It‚Äôs almost like it makes the the coping skills you learn in DBT/CBT more accessible, if that makes sense. Right now I‚Äôm getting the visual of a carpenter being able to find a tool in his tool belt. If that makes sense?

So much for keeping this brief, haha! If this helps even one person get closer to feeling ok, it was worth spending my $200 session typing this.

I've struggled for so long i'm 36, my only family is my mom, all friendships are gone, self image, esteem, and I have comorbid issues that have compounded. i hate writing this... but im basically disabled from BPD at this point. 

i'm afraid going to the ER will result in me being sent to whatever inpatient i guess that has a bed, and then i'd come out a week later around christmas, alone.

i lack the family friend social and colleague support. i am single, and the last few years I should have gone to ER but my fear is heavily around coming out feeling like I wasn't properly treated or helped and then going home alone without the support system one needs.

i live rural, so making friends is hard but now i've got trust issues and anxiety, so i feel like if i don't go somewhere for a longer period & can actually get out on really good feet, that im going to actually finally die. the rumination of it over years has become acceptance and more recently strategic planning and assuming, but i feel like I should give it one big final push.

107,Ketamine Treatment.,"I did my first two round of Ketamine therapy on 04.06.19
Here‚Äôs a update of what I can remember, I made it as brief as I could, day of treatment.
I am sick and have been taking some medications for a cold so this could have set me up with a bad experience, the following could have as well- getting two in one day, not having my husband with me and knowing my mom‚Äôs doubts about the place. She thought it was a weird place (more alternative vs doctors office) so maybe I felt like I shouldn‚Äôt had felt comfortable. Only 3 out of 10 experience dissociative episodes and I did. Also nausea/vomiting isn‚Äôt common but I also had that and was given nausea meds which did help a little until the second treatment but me being nervous and sick could have caused that as well. 
I don‚Äôt remember much of it except getting dizzy then being gone, then coming to here and there and being very confused while trying to find suitable calming music and trying to figure out if I still had my headphones on and if I was hearing music or was hallucinating, I felt as if I was being pulled between two worlds and in one world I wasnt really me, I was never married and everything was more if a simulation. Everything was very elongated and drawn out in both terms of time and physical objects. It was one dose of 30mg and a 40mg round but he wouldn‚Äôt had done a second round of the nurse had told him I got sick, I may request a lower dose in future treatments if possible because I‚Äôm not sure how this works. I had pretty bad PTSD from a traumatic health experience but it‚Äôs not uncommon for stuff like that to surface. I honestly think it would have been a better experience if I would have just done one dose, had my husband instead of parents with me (fear of being judged or saying stupid things) and if the setting/building had been more professional vs alternative hippy style. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think I can get the remainder of the $800 left but I‚Äôm going to ask for maybe a lower dose on my next sessions and will express my fears better of not being monitored properly as my O2 kept dropping. 
I had a lot of factors against me today but I‚Äôm still hopeful despite it being quite scary but I‚Äôm not against anyone else trying it and definitely think it‚Äôs worth it.
-Day after update, I don‚Äôt feel a tremendous difference but for once in a very long time I‚Äôve woken up not depressed and not with a feeling of anxiousness and I‚Äôm able to accept things that would usually trigger a lot of anxiety like the stack of dishes. Also my mental health usually suffers x2 when I‚Äôm sick and I‚Äôm feeling quite chatty and happy to hold a conversation! 
My husband should be able to go with me the remainder of the treatments and I‚Äôve requested he video me so I can observe my own process.

108,How to approach BPD Silent Treatment?,"The amazing, smart, kind man I started seeing 6 weeks ago told me two weeks ago that he has BPD. He's in therapy, he's on meds, he's working hard and I can tell. I also know that no one else in our friend circle knows this. In fact, in the 6 weeks we've been seeing each other he's poured his heart out to me and I've seen a side of him I never saw when he was around our friends. I care very deeply about this guy and I want to support him....but man am I exhausted.

Last week I was getting sick. I felt so crummy and didn't want to tell him, because quite honestly I felt awkward doing so. Unlike him I don't share quite as easily, if at all. I had been working on this with him, but we both are so different in how we communicate. Midway through our text conversation I told him I was sick, on medicine, feeling awful... and he didn't say anything. I felt weirdly awkward and betrayed. I wanted him to ask if I was ok. I waited an hour and he didn't respond so I said it was a little mean for him to not say anything. 6 am the next day (way before I was awake) he texted back that he had been asleep, adding ""...jeeze"" at the end. I could tell he was ticked off. I felt bad and immediately apologized, but I think my clinginess or me calling him mean (probably the second thing) triggered something.

I had been working on consistent communication after reading about BPD and trying hard to do my research, but for two days he didn't respond to any of my texts (two a day, nothing major or clingy, just random things like ""did you like that show?""). I gave up after day 2, too sick and tired to keep reaching out. I've now been silent for 3 days and I'm unsure of what to do. I don't want him to feel smothered, but man I could have used a little bit of support over the past 5 days. He's an inconsistent texter and sometimes won't say anything until he sees me next, then he'll mention it. I haven't seen him in 2 weeks due to getting sick and I'm antsy and sad. Should I reach out? Should I wait for him to come to me? I'm trying so hard to help us both find some balance but I'm worried that it might not be found.

However today, I had just got back from the hospital and we got into an argument, and I blocked him and went to bed. I woke up and he didn‚Äôt bother to remind me to take my painkillers and so on. I know it isn‚Äôt his job to do it, but I‚Äôm crazy forgetful so I always try to get people to remind me!

114,"GF diagnosed BPD but refuses treatment, thinks that all therapists have agendas","This is going to be more of a rant maybe a flow of consciousness. I don't know,

Me and my gf have been together 19 months and we moved in together in January. I also have BPS but have done DBT therapy but struggle with my substance use. There are many days when everything is very good between us but then something triggers her and her whole caves in. Most times it doesn't have to do with me but a lot of other people get the blame. -- Her daughter or the rest of her family that live in a different state ""always have it out for her"" or  ""They're jealous of her"" etc. She doesn't like working with other people for pretty much the same reason. I get the brunt of it when I use (about 1 or 2 times a month) Although I don't understand much about FPs I  think I am hers so she forgives me quickly and we move on.

I've been able to tolerate it for a while but the last few months have been very trying. I really don't want to leave her but sometimes feel like that would be the best thing to do. Sometimes I've been using just to shake this relationship up and have her throw me out. Once it came to me just leaving and I slept on a park bench that night and came back the next afternoon and we both told each other how hard that night was w\\ithout each other. When there are disruptions in the peace between us the suicidal talk is prevalent. ""Everybody thinks I'm nothing so I'd be better off not here anyway""

Tonight is the worst it has been. Yes, I used. That's not cool AT ALL. My BIGGEST problem though with her is when she asks me ""to be honest with her"" BAD IDEA. I'm at a point where I'm starting to strongly believe I'd be better off alone. It's so fkn confusing. 

There are a lot of other things I want to say here but I'm crying too much. And she's on the phone with me while I chill out downstairs because I need to be alone with my thoughts and she doesn't want me around her but also does want me there. 

Emotional pain is real. Sometimes I just wish it didn't hurt so much.

I recently saw a really good psychiatrist for the first time who explained in depth the difference between PTSD and C-PTSD (fyi I have both).

This is true for my experience at least, as no previous psychiatrist has focused in on how my trauma affects all aspects of my life. 

I really think that if BPD was commonly recognized as C-PTSD, a lot more of us would understand ourselves better and get better treatment.

123,How do I get my mom to seek treatment? (CW: bit of a trauma dump i'm so sorry),"hi r/BorderlinePDisorder, im an autistic and otherwise disabled 20-year-old hyperdependent. im writing this at a very fragile time and just broke my self-harm sobriety streak, so please be kind and gentle with me.

my mom has undiagnosed borderline (my therapists and psychs over the years have agreed with me its borderline) and living with her has been a literally traumatizing ordeal. i have unshakable childhood trauma because of her actions and life at home is very difficult. 

i did move to my fathers, only to find my neurotypical stepmom to be deliberately abusive (and my dad an unapologetic enabler and liar) and much worse, so i moved back as soon as i graduated high school. at least my mom genuinely cares about me, and here its much safer for me- like choosing between living in the arctic with suitable gear or unprotected in outer space.

my mom has a long, drawn-out history of snapping at the littlest things. i have been scared of her lashing out at me ever since i was in kindergarten. i wasnt diagnosed with autism until much too late for things to be done to help me, and a furious cocktail of anxiety disorders and depression and trauma formed due to my home life. im paranoid to this day, and even if my mom isnt abusive anymore, i have the survival instincts of a person who grew up traumatized in an unstable home, and find myself subconciously going through the motions ingrained in my head as necessary for survival. i stop everything when i hear her speaking or moving, turn off lights if its dark, hold my breath so i can hear better, and hold still- even if i know nothing will happen and it will be alright.

my autism and trauma have made me hyperdependent. i require the assistance of others to be stable. my abuela, who lives with us, is also hyperdependent as a result of her rapidly degrading health. everyone in my household is disabled, and my mother is the breadwinner and caretaker. this comes at a cost.

my moms borderline is untreated and worsened over the years. shes in her 50s, has never seen a psych or therapist or even knew her behavior was abnormal (lack of a better word) and harmful to others. no matter how many red flags my own behavior showed growing up (my frequent mentioning i was scared of my mom, my paranoia and survival instincts, my startle reaction and tendency to shut down, among other telltale signs of a traumatized child), something being wrong with my mom was never pinpointed and never helped.

now that im older, medicated, treated, and capable of verbal communication, ive expressed my feelings to my mom. ""you should see a therapist.""

she takes it as a joke, or an insult, almost. shoots me down, says she doesnt need it, that shes fine. she doesnt recognize how much her borderline has hurt me, has hurt her, has hurt my abuela. my abuela, despite our language barrier, expressed the same feelings i had when i was young and that i express now: ""she \[emotionally\] hurts me. im scared of her."" i worry that emotions and frustrations once taken out on me are now taken out on my abuela. she notably told me once, ""id never talk to my mom like that."" shes expressed that my mother was not like this before. there was a time when my mom was not as unstable as she is now, and its a time i cant remember.

im aware my mom is hurting and ive always been aware of it. my mom acknowledges shes broken, that my father traumatized her to a point of no return. but she has never seen that her borderline has caused massive damage, rifts in her relationships, things that make me feel scared and empty and hollow. for the longest time i believed she didnt love me and that rather i not exist. i was very suicidal prior to my treatment.

i find myself saying it a lot nowadays. ""i wish my mom would get help.""

im very tired, and i dont want to see my abuela fall to the same mental spiral i did in my youth. my abuela has expressed she thinks that she isnt loved and wanted, and it makes me worry so much- she thinks shes better off with my very cruel, disowned uncle (please trust me on this that he is unredeemable as a human being), where she would no doubt be in much worse of a state and effectively left to die.

ive talked to my mom and my therapists and psychs about it, but ive come up with nothing. what actions ive taken have been fruitless. if i talk to her, im afraid ill be laughed off or snapped at.

what do i do? how can i get my mom to get help? how can i get help for my mom? how can i possibly break this 16-year-long cycle of pain? who do i reach out to?

i want my mom to get therapy. i want her to get medication to keep her lashing out under control. i want her to realize the damage done, to both her and us. i want whatever good i can do. we have been giving out cries for help for many years, and red flags have shown for even longer.

im desperate. my mind may be a bit clouded right now, im in the middle of a breakdown and im unsure if i medicated this morning, but im desperate.

126,Advice needed: Is therapy the only way? ,"Hey, I have been reading a lot about BPD treatments and every source says that therapy is the only treatment for BPD. This is really frustrating for me because therapists are not professional or trained enough to treat BPD in my country (India). I have been in therapy for ~8 years on and off, and I have made the most progress only when I have been seriously working on myself. 

In my experience therapy is just a small part of the treatment. diet, exercise, sleep, applying skills in real life, self reflection, etc also play such a big role. But to go into remission, you really have to work on the root causes of BPD, which is what DBT is for. For me, therapy becomes a crutch and I stop working on myself when I am with a therapist. So is there a way to continue therapy, just without a therapist? 

Is it possible to go into remission by taking therapy into my own hands? Instead of relying on a therapist to guide me, I will structure and execute my own treatment. 

are there any dangers to doing this? I have been to 4 DBT therapists for several months to two years. but i feel really frustrated starting over every time. I also really can't afford to go to the certified and trained therapists right now because I can't pay for it myself and I don't want to ask my parents to pay for more therapy. It's almost like Russian roulette when it comes to therapy, because you never know if someone really even knows DBT (or therapy at all)

DBT is a specific type of therapy developed for those with BPD, and it has shown to be incredibly effective, I can vouch for this myself. Courses can be very expensive and/or rigorous, and a lot of people aren't always in the headspace where they can handle hours a week of work for multiple months, however there are many other ways. 

You can find therapists that don't offer specific courses in DBT, but are trained in it, and they are very capable of offering you informal DBT sessions. There are also lot's of books on the market that take you through the whole of DBT therapy, and you are in complete control this way. You can also find many online recourses, including free online courses in DBT.

134,I'm Convinced Statistics About DBT's effectiveness for BPD is Extremely Exaggerated.,"Quick context.

I'm turning 23 in 10 days, I'm a straight man, With BPD.

Note: This Takes Place In Canada.
So people from the States or elsewhere may relate a bit less.

I Have spent my life suffering as many have with bpd, something came to a breaking point several months back where I was forcibly admitted to a hospital for about a day as they were worried I was a suicide risk. There I was diagnosed with BPD, and later on, I was re-evaluated by a BPD - Specialist and Reconfirmed to have this disorder.

After several months of waiting after my initial diagnosis,  I'm finally in a program to help BPD patients live normal lives, with a success rate of over 75% of people no longer meeting the criteria for bpd after they finish this treatment.

Here's the thing. It's 12 weeks. Thats it.

I'm currently half way through this program, I go twice a week, once for group, the other for individual treatment. 

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the therapy and I've found it helpful to some extent so far.

But they must be insane if they GENUINELY think they can undo nearly a lifetime of trauma and instability in 12 weeks to a point where I would no longer meet BPD criteria.

I, as I'm sure many others do, have a terrible memory, once I've talked about something. Or something was talked about in group, I won't even remember a 1/4 of what we talked about the week before. 

And I feel like implementing meaningful life changing changes / behaviors into someone is impossible after only 12 weeks. 

Me, as well as I'm sure many of you, and many BPD sufferers have spent a lifetime in pain/agony. No matter how differently you make us see things, bpd isn't just how we act, it's in how we are/how we feel ect, 

I feel like if i was in this program for Maybe 2 years,  I'd likely have a near complete remission of BPD symptoms, but as of right now, I can't even remember what I talked about the week before in specific details how do you want me to work on it? And for it to be corrected for the rest of my life?

There Is absolutely no way 75% of people's Crippling mental health disorder can be prepared or appeased to a point where it no longer meets the criteria for the disorder in 12 weeks. I feel like this is a joke.

I have been looking for help for my entire life,  I was diagnosed last year and at least it told me what to look for help in, but there's simply no way you're going to tell me that even 12 months after the therapy's end , that even a single person ended up changed and ""fixed"" for the rest of their life, let alone 75%. 

Therapy helps, and I appreciate it. But the time limit  makes it so that any true long term benefit is simply impossible, we're not robots that can he programmed. We're complex and changing an entire part of your core self sure as hell takes longer than 12 weeks.

137,hi everyone,"so after years of therapy and a few suicide attempts and no one telling me exactly what i have until the point that i actually thought that i didnt really have anything i looked throught my mother's phone yesterday (talk about abusive behaviour am i right) and discovered that i do actually have a diagnoses and its bordeline personality disorder

idk if its just something that my doctor told my mother so she can have some guidance but after i came here and read some stories everything just can of clicked: this favorite person you guys mention, rage attacks, paranoia, being abusive, not coping with emotions and all that

idk why my doctor never informed me of this and i'll definitely talk about it in the next session, i'm just concern now because the continuity of my treatment is kind of fuzy because i lost my health plan and i dont really know how is going to be from now on 

im kind of pissed off that i'm discoverying this only now and in this way (breaching the privacy of my mother) because i do believe that infomation is everything and i think that knowing this before could have changed things for me

anyway since my treatment will be on hold for a while until i work out the burocracies to get back to treatment, i guess i'll be using this space to figure somethings out so i just wanted to come here and say hi really

138,You can recover ,"I have been struggling with BDP and cormorbidities since 2015. I've attempted suicide seven times and tried therapy for as long as I can remember. I honestly thought there was no hope for me and I didn't plan on living after 30. UNTIL I found a doctor that actually got me and listened to me and took me seriously. I took inpatient treatment, got on meds and practiced what I learned in CBT and DBT sessions. Not to say I don't struggle anymore, I do, but it's definitely easier to cope now. I've developed a way of thinking that makes life easier and simpler and I genuinely try to enjoy every day. Treat it like a choose-your-own-adventure.

I've been a long time lurker on this sub and it hurts to see y'all suffer because I know what it's like. But I want to tell you there is hope and you can get treatment and get better.

139,I want off the BPD train,"I was recently diagnosed with BPD, PTSD and severe depression and anxiety. I was misdiagnosed with depression for 30 years but now I know this diagnosis is right. So thats good knowing what it is because things make sense.

I was put on quetiapine after having horrific side effects to antidepressants. I kept being told I was ""treatment resistant"" and gave up. Things were rough adjusting to the medication but then I got in a decent rhythm. For the forst time ever I didn't think about killing myself every waking second of my life. I felt like I could get past this. 

Well now I don't. I have desperately tried to reach out to friends, even to just go for a walk or a coffee because I am trying to avoid alcohol. I tried to drink myself to death for 20 years. But they are all drinkers (I was a bartender for 20 years) and don't seem to care. 

This shit made me push people away and I have absolutely nothing. I don't see the point in going on anymore. With some support or love I would feel better but I just can't. I am so broken. I have suffered so much abuse in my life.

The final straw for me was my partner dying of a heart attack a year and a half ago. It was the first positive person I had in my life and I cannot cope with his loss. I tried to kill myself quite violently and it was my millionth time and I still failed.

I worked hard to try and balance my outpatient treatments with being so fucking broke, trying to work but the hours I work interfere with my treatments. I can't balance this anymore. 

With no family, most of my friends are dead and treatment are so hard to maintain I don't see what the point is anymore.

149,I Have BPD and Lamotrogine changed my life,"I just wanted to share my journey here becuase I spent years and years trying to find help to survive life with BPD. 

I have spent so much money seeing Phsychologists and psychiatrists. I  even studied mental health to try and break this curse.. I was put on escotelopram about 7 years ago and about 2 years ago i felt like it stopped working.  During this time I was still struggling and was somehow diagnosed with an additional condition ADHD and put on dexamphetamine - this only made me feel high/buzzed and more erratic and emotional. I then tried to move to different SSRI medications like peroxatine and sertraline and neither worked for me both actually made me feel worse, one was so bad i had to stop taking it after 2 weeks. I ended up back on escotelopram and whilst it had a renewed energy to it, i still felt unstable.

I was spiralling out of control, i felt helpless and i was giving up and referred to a mental health triage in Sydney, that didnt help either.

Along the same time i was being treated for pain management and was scheduled to see the pain psychiatrist and it was him who changed everything for me.

On our 2nd session i let out alot of my personal problems and let him know how bad bpd was effecting my life. This conversation was a game changer.

He ummed and arred and i could tell he was brainstorming and working over different treatment options and then he said Lamotrogine. I want to try a dual treatment approach staying on escotelopram but introducing lamotrogine.

He was very stern to advise me of the negative side effects and the dangers of misusing the drug and whilst i felt nervous starting treatment, i wanted to try anything.

I started on a tiny dose. Becsuse of risk of a rare ulceric reaction you must start slow which for someone with bpd felt frusteating becuase i felt like nothing was changing. For the first 2 weeks i was impatient but somehow each day whilst frustrated with results i found more patience... and then after a month it was like i woke up one morning and it hit me - how unbelievably clear my mind was. It was like a switch was flicked and i realised how calm and clear my brain felt. 

And whilst at that point i thought ""ok this is great im happy with this"" it actually got better!

I didnt just start to feel calmer, i felt IN CONTROL of myself for the first time ever. I stopped over thinking all together. I let things that i use to obsess over. I no longer felt the need for the thrill.. i just woke up and felt NORMAL or at least what i always imagined how normal was supposed to feel.

So if you are reading this and feeling like you are a lost cause please please try lamotrogine. 

I now take 30mg escotelopram and 200 mg lamotrogine and it has honestly saved my life.

She is very empathetic, she asks if I took my medication, how my psychiatric appointment was, she respects my space when I want to be silent and she understands that I get angry easily but calm down just as quickly. I've had bad relationships and I've never been involved with someone so kind. She is not neurodivergent and has never experienced a depressive episode or anything like that.

We're trying to expand our services nationally to get more mindfulness to them to bring at least a little peace in their misery. I'm donating proceeds from an 8hr training workshop on DBT and BPD on July 24th that's intended to educate clinicians, clients, and their friends or family members.   


If you're interested in what DBT is or having your family better understand what BPD is, it would likely be helpful for you. The donation for the full day is $100 to go to the nonprofit. There are plenty of volunteer opportunities available as well if you're passionate about bringing humanity into the justice system.  [https://www.compassionworksforall.org/events](https://www.compassionworksforall.org/events) 

&#x200B;

In addition to that however, I'd love to answer any questions that ya'll might have about DBT and BPD from a therapists perspective. (obviously I can't offer any treatment or treatment advice, but I'd be happy to give education.) I'm a total lurker for Reddit, so I have no idea how to get that set up, but if you're interested and someone could figure that out for me, just let me know!  


Much love - Stephanie  


P.s. I believe BPD is 100% recoverable, it's not a life, or death, sentence. It's a lack of healthy coping skills paired with high emotional sensitivity and an invalidating environment. All of that can be addressed and once you don't have the 9 diagnostic criteria you don't have BPD anymore! I love my BPD clients, they're some of the best people I know in the world. There really is hope if anyone is out there suffering.",1594474085.0,False,204,90,thestudio8,None,hp9yzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/hp9yzy/im_a_dbt_psychotherapist_would_an_ama_be_helpful/
167,I think I messed up,"So I‚Äôm a quiet borderline and I don‚Äôt have a history of violence/abusivness. A few months ago I started talking with someone (romantically) things were going fantastic, I was actually starting to feel happy and loved again. I told them I wanted to be completely honest and transparent when we started talking as to not throw our budding relationship away.  So 3 days ago I told them about my diagnosis with bpd and they reacted positively and supportively to it. Then I didn‚Äôt get a message until 24 hours later. I was hit with the ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs better if we stay friends, and we focus on ourselves, mental health, and work/school. I wasn‚Äôt trying to lead you on or anything I just think it‚Äôd be better to stay friends.‚Äù Obviously I responded as positively as I could and accepted being friends. I feel so shitty, hating myself and blaming myself because I knew telling them would end this way if not worse, for some reason I thought maybe this time I‚Äôd be wrong, I should‚Äôve known better. It‚Äôs not something I needed to say, especially since I‚Äôm really good at managing it and am in active treatment and take medications to deal with it. And they‚Äôre aware that I‚Äôm in treatment and I‚Äôve left no toxic footprint in the time Ive had with them. I‚Äôm just so fucked up about it and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if I‚Äôd kept my damn mouth shut. Now I‚Äôm having dreams about them and how it would‚Äôve been if I didn‚Äôt say anything. I feel like my chance of happiness is gone, I really was starting to love and feel loved by this person, it was the most positive relationship I‚Äôd ever begun forming. We got along perfectly and we clicked so well. I just can‚Äôt help but hate myself for choosing to act in a way that makes me feel so stupid and hurt.

168,can somebody please validate that what happened was wrong?,"To start, I am diagnosed with BPD, and I don‚Äôt know where else to post this. I just need people to confirm that this was wrong of them and never should have happened. I had to go to the ER, and the experience made me never want to see a doctor again. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, I felt so alone, abandoned, disrespected, and am left feeling traumatized. I don‚Äôt see my therapist til the 31st and I don‚Äôt know where else to turn to. Here is the full story. 

i was taken into the ER by my fiancee and my mom. We reported that I was experiencing severe abdominal pain, constipation, and i was unable to urinate. We waited in the waiting room but I was called back to the triage room within ten minutes. The nurse assessing me got my identity wrong, thought I was there for anaphylaxis. We corrected him, and he said his treatment plan for me would be to catheterize me and send me home to do an enema. I started to cry, because my pain level was so severe, and my stomach was so distended - I was terrified to go home without my bowel obstruction being removed. I could feel the blockage in my mid-abdomen, and I knew that a home treatment wouldn‚Äôt be effective. We were called back to a room, where they took my vitals are tested a vial of my blood. An ultrasound tech came in to do a bladder scan, and she said my bladder was incredibly full and needed to be drained immediately. We informed my treatment team that I have severe anxiety, and I‚Äôd need to be sedated in order to insert a catheter. They administered a half dose of ativan, and said we would wait 30 minutes to catheterize. I laid in the hospital bed, curled into fetal position. The medicine never kicked in, my anxiety overpowered it.

After about 45 minutes of waiting, my mom called the nurse over and urged her to start the treatment, because the doctor had warned us it was urgent that we catheterize in order to prevent kidney or bladder infection. The nurse rolled her eyes at my mom, and decided to wheel me out to the hall. Once in the hall, another nurse approached and said I could only have one visitor, so I chose my mom. After about ten minutes in the hallway (I was curled up on the bed and crying), the nurses started steering me away from my mom and said she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt allowed to come.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt alert, I was confused and disoriented from pain - so I didn‚Äôt notice that I was being separated. 

Once I got to the private room, two nurses started moving around me very quickly. My family was right down the hall, pleading with nurses to let them join me. They weren‚Äôt being kept away from me due to policy, rather - the nurses said ‚ÄúThey assumed I‚Äôd want privacy.‚Äù - even when repeatedly told otherwise. The ativan was not calming me at all. The nurses announced they‚Äôd be inserting a catheter, and without warning - started shoved swaps into my vagina while I cried. Nobody asked if I was alright. i was still confused and disoriented. They continued without a word, picking up the catheter and shoving it into my urethra without warning as I sobbed loudly and curled into a hall. I tried to close my legs but they did not stop.

Once the catheter was inserted, I sobbed harder, And the nurse started wiggling the catheter around inside me because ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt working right‚Äù. After about twenty seconds of struggling to get the catheter to work, r they suddenly decided to just rip it out and say ‚ÄúYour crying must‚Äôve caused it to fall out. You need to stay still.‚Äù I cried harder in response to this. Then, without any recovery time - they rolled me onto my side and announced they were doing an enema. Just like before, they didn‚Äôt warn me or ask if I was okay while I sobbed. They ignored my sobs and inserted the enema anyways, not saying a word as I sobbed loudly and gripped the railing of my bed. They administered it and promptly pulled it out without warning, causing me to have an accident on myself and the bed. They left me in the mess, tossing me a packet of wipes. They told me to ‚Äúlay there for ten minutes and then use the bathroom.‚Äù before they picked up their stuff and left me there. After 5 minutes, the pain was too intense. I sobbed and picked myself up to use the bathroom. When I finished, I wiped myself off and got dressed. I looked outside my room, hoping to find help or my family - but nobody was out there. I was still disoriented and my pain level was severe, so i slipped on my slippers and hobbled out to the lobby to find my family, since I was terrified and felt like my nurses had violated me.

I found a public phone in the hall, but it wasn‚Äôt working. I approached the front desk and said my family was gone, and that I needed them. The front desk worker scoffed at me, and said ‚Äúyou think I‚Äôm going to help you leave AMA?‚Äù I started to cry, but I continued hobbling around asking strangers if they‚Äôd seen my family. A nice woman offered to call them, so she did - and as she finished the call to my dad, my family came around the corner. I was overwhelmed with emotion. I started sobbing, saying ‚ÄúYOU ABANDONED ME!‚Äù Which made hospital security kick us all out. After the fact, my mom called to complain about my treatment. The nurse who violated me claimed I got ‚ÄúThe red carpet treatment‚Äù And said I had been ‚Äúcursing at staff members‚Äù (that did not happen) - I urged my mom to just give it up and hang up, and she did. Now that I‚Äôm home I‚Äôm traumatized. I‚Äôm afraid to use the bathroom. I‚Äôm afraid of doctors. I‚Äôm afraid of hospitals, of nurses. Every time I use the bathroom, I‚Äôm reminded of what happened and I start to cry.",1706152538.0,False,3,4,plantbasedpumpkin,None,19ezj23,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/19ezj23/can_somebody_please_validate_that_what_happened/

I experienced a job loss a couple months ago and since then i‚Äôve just been spiralling. My BPD affects my all my relationships so much and I feel so lost in knowing how to get better.

172,Therapy vs. career (when we can't have both),"I'm currently struggling because I honestly don't know how my life is supposed to continue and I need some advice, or maybe just someone who understands me.

Little backstory for clarity. I'm 24f, and I've been severely mentally unwell since the age of 12. I've spent my teen years in and out of treatment and engaged in several really dangerous, self destructive behaviours in the past. Over the years there were good and bad episodes, I've been really stabile during some of these times, but crisis always managed to slip in, some minor and some major. I've been diagnosed with BPD at age 19, and I've been to inpatient DBT treatment twice since then. It has helped me a lot, but I've never completely finished a treatment cycle of 12 weeks because it always got to overwhelming for me during the end. The last time I tried was in late 2020, and unfortunately I haven't had any outpatient specialist treatment for my BPD since, because there's just no access to it in my area. 

A lot has happened since then. I've not SHed since 2020 and I'm not actively engaging in ED behaviours anymore. I'm able to live a seemingly normal adult life now and I've worked 9-5 since 2020. Even during difficult times I haven't relapsed anymore and I've now been clean for longer than ever before. But below the surface there is still a lot of shit I need to work on. My last two relationships have been pretty toxic and I had to deal with all of it by myself even though I would have really needed specialist help during those times. I'm still struggling, but it's all happening internally now.

Now, here's my current tricky situation:
I'm back in my home country after I've lived abroad with my (narcissistic) Ex BF for the last 1,5 years. I'm currently looking for a job, and over the last weeks the idea of going to the police academy developed in my head. I never thought I could do it in the past because I was to sick, but now that I'm in recovery my body is in great health (doctor confirmed) and I have no long term side effects from my ED that hold me back. I actually started working out and became pretty fit during the last two years. I really wanna do this, but there's still a lot of doubt in my head if I'm good enough for such a job and if I can do it. I also signed up for inpatient DBT again, and both the police academy and treatment would start in September. 
I'm not sure what to do now. I really wanna go ahead in my career and chase my dreams, but it would also mean that I couldn't go inpatient (aka have treatment at all because inpatient is the only option where I live) for the next 3 years. I'm also scared that someone with BPD as severe as mine is just not able to be a good police officer, even tho I really wanna try it at least. If I fail, at least I know I did the best I can. 
On the other hand I really wanna work on myself and continue to improve my mental health. I'm doing the best that I can by myself (reading books, using skills, bpd workbooks, meditation ect.) but I know that there's only so much I can do alone without professional help. If I start treatment in September it would be good for me, but it would also be another time where my mental health stopped me for chasing my dreams. I've lost a lot of opportunities to this disorder, and it still hurts to think where I could be in life today if I had taken them.
If you wanna share your perspective on this with my I'm very thankful.

175,Numbers on BPD,"I was just curious, so I searched the web for some numbers on BPD. I thought these might interest you too, so I decided to share them here. However all of these should be taken with a grain of salt since they come from different studies and articles and one of them is from a self help organization, that does not even name their sources.
Feel free comment your own, if you found some related statistics.

Prevalence:
In the US, 1.6% of the total population were found to have been diagnosed with BPD. It is asumed that the real number is higher. 75% of these were female (found pretty much the same share for other countries). However, this share is probably biased, since females are much more likely to seek out treatment. Among clinical patients in the US 20% were found to have BPD. 

Suicidality and self-harm:
According to data from a Germany 2023, the suicide rate among people with BPD is 5-10% (quite high), with its peak within the age cohort of 20-30 years. They also found that 60% had at least 1 suicide attempt in their life (70% according to US data). 69-80% injured themselves on purpose at least once.

Trauma and abuse:
40-70% according to the same German source have been mistreated and/or abused during childhood. 60-80% claim to have been subjected to sexual abuse. 

Employment:
50% of BPD affected people manage to find employment. Among those, 20% manage to keep their job and stay finacially independent for longer than 12 months, which equals a total of 10%, who stay employed. 

Prognosis: 
Nearly 50% of patients who recieved treatment did no longer fit the diagnostic criteria of BPD after 2 years. After 10 years it was 88%.

180,"I was diagnosed, but I don't feel it's right.","First of all, I'm sorry if something is not well understood, I'm not a native speaker. And well, moving on with the story.

I was diagnosed when I was 20 years old. I reached my lowest point around that time with two suicide attempts. The self-harm is still permanent. I am from Chile, here there is the public and private system, in the private system the disorder does not enter in treatment so I was diagnosed when I was asking for help and left with nothing because I had no money for private. And leaving the private system to the public system was a condemnation.

The thing is that every time I have been able to, I have tried to verify the diagnosis because there are things I don't have. I don't feel that I have a fear of abandonment, I don't really have a distorted image of myself either (except for my self-concept, which is low) only these days I have had episodes of feeling that there are things in my body that are not mine. Yes I have anger, the urge to eat or spend money, anxiety, addictions, but.... I keep thinking it must be wrong, it's frustrating because every time I want to know if this is right to have the right treatment I'm told not to obsess about it, that it doesn't matter what the name is.

182,Progressing with gf after diagnosis ,"I‚Äôve (42m) been with my gf (32f) for about five years. We‚Äôve been coworkers, then best friends, then dating. Very organic, and we get along very well. 

Along the way, many ups and downs. As time progressed, we thought about buying a house and getting engaged. We both thought therapy would be a good idea, to see if we could achieve more stability. We did relationship therapy, and individual. The fact that she had BPD was diagnosed, and we continued therapy  separately. The relationship therapist suggested that she should see her own therapist for BPD treatment. 

Therapy has both been a blessing and a curse. Many lies were unearthed. Nothing heart breaking like cheating, just very eye opening behaviors. I found out that her finances are a disaster (debt, evictions), her past marriage ended because of multiple affairs, being hypersexual, lying about previously going to therapy, things of that nature. I certainly cannot be judgmental, it‚Äôs just been a lot to take in. 

Now that our therapy is individual, I get the feeling that she isn‚Äôt going, or isn‚Äôt being honest with her therapist. I‚Äôve never been with someone with BPD, but I want to make sure I remain respectful and do not have any triggering conversations. I‚Äôve raised questions about the therapy, and my questions. She gets very defensive and angry. We have been so close for so long, that we are at the stage where I feel like we should be moving forward commitment wise. 

Im just not seeing any improvement, and I don‚Äôt feel like her individual therapy has broached the subject of her BPD. After three months, she is still not diagnosed with this different therapist, not medicated, and still not in DBT.  I don‚Äôt want to hurt her, or start a fight, but I don‚Äôt see how our relationship can move forward if she isn‚Äôt being honest with her therapist. I can‚Äôt pry, or make her talk about therapy, but I also don‚Äôt feel comfortable moving forward in the relationship if we aren‚Äôt moving forward with treatment. 

Is there a better way to handle this? How can I help without being judgmental? Is this a situation that I should step away from until they want to get therapy? I‚Äôm not sure how best to handle it.

183,Saying goodbye to CPN,"Hi all. I'm looking for advice and insight...
I've been having treatment for BPD for 4 years now. I've had different treatment forms and with different professionals for each, though I've consistently always alongside this had my designated Community Psychiatric Nurse. She is the first professional I came into contact with from the beginning, was the one to diagnose and treat me for BPD (her speciality area) and the first person I opened up to about everything; my past, my childhood, my raw inner self, my perceived 'worst' parts, with no judgment and an almost 'motherly' type style, something I'd never had or experienced before. Needless to say, this relationship although kept professional, has had a profound impact on me in both my discovery and recovery in dealing with BPD and with general life. As I grew and evolved and got better through combined treatment, our appointments got spaced out more and more and I no longer felt the lifeline type 'need' for her, and certainly don't have her in my mind as a sort of FP at this stage. However, I'm due tommorow to have my required '6 month break' from all treatment. She has informed me that if I need to come back for more treatment after 6 months of being discharged, that it won't be her I get assigned to again, so this is goodbye, not necessarily to treatment but to her. I think that this would be difficult at any stage but I've just come off the back of the hardest few months in a long time, and am only just getting back on my feet with things, so despite I am a lot better at coping and understanding myself than I was when I first started treatment with her, this mandatory break and goodbye, although required, couldn't have come at a worse time. She is the first and only person to have understood me, more than myself, given me insight, support, and non judgemental compassion. The one and only person who gets 'me' and this disorder in a way my family, friends and partner could never, something so priceless with BPD. Although I don't require her support in quite the same way as I once did, I still don't feel ready or confident with the idea of facing life and its struggles, my struggles, without her. I knew this day would need to come at some point, but I don't feel ready, probably magnified with what I've been through lately. I don't know how to face this. It's tommorow, I'm dreading it and what comes after it, how I'll cope with the uncertainty of the future and what it may bring, without the comforting thought of knowing she's there in the background IF I ever really needed her...

185,I was misdiagnosed with BPD,"Just wanted to share in case it might help anyone: 

I used to read this subreddit a lot before. I was 100% convinced I had BPD and the psychiatrist I had at the time agreed I may have a mild form of it. 

Turns out I have OCD. Not BPD. What I believed was my ‚ÄúFavorite Person,‚Äù was just intrusive and obsessive thoughts about a specific person and would often change as I found a new person to obsess over. This is a form of Pure OCD. I would compulsively text these people and think about them 24/7. 

I have many other OCD symptoms that I won‚Äôt get into, but this ‚ÄúFP‚Äù obsession is the main reason I thought I had BPD. I needed reassurance from them to ease my anxiety. But it had no other logical basis. 

My (at the time) undiagnosed OCD would try to figure out what was wrong with me. So, when I found some similarities with BPD, I started having intrusive thoughts saying I had BPD. And I guess you can say I ‚Äúmanifested‚Äù a mild form of BPD.

190,Psychiatrist has recommended medical marijuana and DBT as opposed to relying heavily on traditional medication,"So I (24F) have been in talks with different psychiatrists and mental health professionals since October, and was just officially diagnosed with BPD last Friday. Over the course of my 10 years in mental health treatment (starting at 13 years old) I‚Äôve tried about 30 different psychiatric medications. 

I am medication resistant as a symptom, meaning that I don‚Äôt like to take meds and I have a very hard time maintaining a regular medication schedule. It is not because I believe they don‚Äôt work, or I‚Äôm anti-meds or whatever, I just cannot for the life of me adhere to taking traditional pills everyday. I get anxious and angry when I see them, and my therapist believes it could stem from control issues and having medical trauma (I have been taking pills for other medical conditions since I was a child). I‚Äôm currently on lower doses of BuSpar and Seroquil but have a very hard time taking them regularly. 

When he diagnosed me and we were talking about how things were going, I told him I‚Äôve begun smoking weed. I explained that after I‚Äôve taken a puff, it is the only time my mind is quiet, I don‚Äôt have anxiety or anger, I can properly articulate my thoughts and feelings and talk through things before I get angry. I am productive as well, an example being that I was having difficulty with a school paper due to being in a bad headspace after a PTSD flashback, and I was only able to write it after I took a puff. I finished all 14 pages in one night and got an A on it. My mood is also 100x better and I do not smoke until I get incapacitated. 1-2 hits and I‚Äôm done. 

He did not react as expected. I thought he would be upset or mad at me but he asked me about my activity level and motivation, when I said they increased once I‚Äôve taken a hit, he told me that I should look into medical marijuana as a treatment option as opposed to traditional meds. He said he would feel better if I was under the direction of a doctor when it came to dosing as opposed to self medicating, which I totally agree with, and that I can stay on low doses of my current meds as well as take medical marijuana as they should not interact with my current dosages. He also strongly recommended DBT as well.

None of my psychiatrists have actually accepted CPTSD as a real disorder, when I bring it up it always gets shut down and it makes me particularly speculate on if my diagnosis is right since CPTSD has never even been considered. I fit the criteria for BPD, because much of my trauma IS abandonment. Could BPD simply be CPTSD where the trauma is abandonment? I often hear people say the main difference between CPTSD and BPD  is that with CPTSD the unhealthy behavior is in order to avoid the trauma, while with BPD it is to avoid real/percieved abandonment. But abandonment and neglect can be traumatic?? I am often perplexed by the overlap. I suppose it does not matter that much as my treatment is going well regardless, but it is something I think about often.

I got denied by my insurance to fix it and now I'm paying for a car that doesn't work. I stopped making payments as well as I stopped paying my rent and other stuff so im really in debt now.

I also became addicted to a certain illegal drug and I think im burnt-out from over working the last 6 years to really prove everyone wrong about my mental status.

I feel like im about to loose everything and since I am now addicted to drugs and suffer from mental health I am thinking I should move back in with my mom to restart.

The past few months I have been excelling- at work, at therapy, physically, dietarily, etc. I had finally reached a feeling of stability, through meds and lifestyle changes. 

But today I was rediagnosed with hepatitis c, after having been told it was cured about a year and a half ago. 

Three years ago I entered a really dark time of my life. I was 19 years old and had just gotten out of a breakup. 

One day, I decided I wanted to end it, and took a months worth of benzodiazepines all at once, blacked out, and wound up with a bunch of homeless people who started to shoot me up with meth and heroin. I don't really remember much of it. 

Ended up in a psych ward a month later, where I tested positive for hepatitis c. (It is transmitted via blood, and the people who where shooting me up had hep c)

Hep c is a virus, like HIV, but instead of destroying your immune system, it slowly destroys your liver, and eventually causes liver cancer. 

In the United States, the cure (antivirals) is $70,000

I had previously cured the hep c using the antivirals, as I qualified for a grant to get the treatment. 

But I have been told they likely won't give me another grant, which means this might be a death sentence, as I cannot afford the treatment.

200,Borderline Personality Disorder and Motherhood,"
The truth about motherhood and Borderline Personality Disorder:

Motherhood is a beautiful and challenging journey, filled with its own set of trials and tribulations. Being a mother that suffers from BPD can make motherhood that more complex. Often misdiagnosed and left untreated can cause inner turmoil in the ones that she loves the most.** I KNOW FIRST HAND BECAUSE I SUFFER FROM BPD AND I LEAVE MY MARK EVERY SINGLE DAY IN MY HOUSE. ** We are often left to suffer in silence, which doesn‚Äôt really bother us, we are used to it and plus we stay in survivor mode‚Ä¶And honestly, you probably would not be able to wrap your mind around the beautiful chaos that is us‚Ä¶

However, having BPD while raising children can be even more complex. WE ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT IT!!!! So many of us are coping with BPD, we are gonna talk about understanding the symptoms and causes, and treatment options‚Ä¶ LETS END THE STIGMA!


BPD is a mental health condition characterized by intense emotional instability, impulsive behavior, and a distorted sense of self. It affects 1-2% of the population, with women being diagnosed more frequently than men. Mothers living with BPD face unique challenges as they strive to provide a nurturing and stable environment for their children.

SYMPTOMS

#1. Emotional Rollercoaster: Mothers with BPD experience a heightened emotional intensity, often struggling with mood swings, anxiety, substance abuse, and depression. These emotional fluctuations can impact parenting, leading to difficulties in creating consistency and stability for their children.

#2. Fear of Abandonment: This is a BIG one! We have a core fear of abandonment, which can be triggered within the context of motherhood. This fear can manifest in overprotectiveness or difficulties in setting appropriate boundaries. ** I was extremely overprotective with my first daughter who is 19 now, and I have NO boundaries with my 14 year old daughter **

#3. Distorted Self-Image: Mothers with BPD may struggle with a fragmented sense of self, CHANGING OF THE APPEARENCE ( hence why I shaved the side of my head last week üò¶ ) making it challenging to establish a clear and consistent parental role. This can effect the bond and attachment with their children. **

#4 Interpersonal Challenges: BPD often manifest into turbulent relationships and difficulties in maintaining healthy boundaries and or keeping friends. ** My LIFE MOTTO when I meet someone new: I don‚Äôt need to get to know you because you won‚Äôt be in my life long enough for it to matter**‚ÄÇthese are the most challenging for us, however we also experience‚Ä¶.
* Impulsive Behaviors.. Substance abuse issues‚Ä¶ Self-harming‚Ä¶Chronic feelings of boredom‚Ä¶Depression‚Ä¶ Uncontrollable Anger.. and Dissociative feelings**

BPD is referred to as the ‚ÄúEGG SHELL‚Äù disease because everyone you are close to will feel like they have to tip-toe around you or walk on eggshells to avoid triggering the inner monster that is inside. 

We have a very hard time regulating our emotions

We can‚Äôt keep lasting friendships

We are highly intuitive and can read the room quickly

WE ARE NOT DANGEROUS!!

hi everyone, it's my first time posting on this subreddit.
I'm 28 (f) and i've been diagnosed with adhd and bpd. i have my ups and downs, and problems with my productivity and executive functions, but recently I've being going through some stuff. 
my mom was diagnosed w cancer, my cat is sick and needs for me to take care of him, and that means being steady w his treatment. which is very difficult for me since I can't even create a routine for myself.

I have days when I just get paralyzed and get nothing done, feeling this huge emptiness inside, fear of abandonment, rejecting help from my friends bc I just feel overstimulated being in their presence while feeling this way. 
and sensory processing issues as bright lights, loud noises, make it very difficult for me to get out of my home.

for some time now I've started abusing xanax as a form of self harm in a crisis (taking up to 17mg) and also 2-4mg daily to try to make the feelings go away. Xanax or Klonopin.
also I've started cutting a little bit, nothing very visible. but still it makes me feel really sad to have come to this point.

I'm actually in treatment with a therapist, and got prescribed by my psychiatrist 50mg sertraline, 1mg xanax, and 54mg concerta.
I'm going to start taking 32mg concerta for a while to try see if that helps me with my anxiety.
but I'm afraid I'm abusing benzodiazepines low key, and I don't know how it might affect me nor how to stop, since I really don't know how to regulate my emotions, nor organize my life and be consistent. 
my therapists suggested for me to go to the psych ward but I was too scared since I didnt want to go through that again. so I've been trying to cope doing therapy twice a week and talking w friends and my bf. 
I feel like I can't give back anything that I'm given, there's days I can't even cook my own food so my bf takes care for me. some days I can't even get out of bed, and feel extremely useless. 
I'm scared and really desperate for this episode to end. I dont have many other resources other than my therapy, and don't have money to pay for very expensive DBT treatments. (I don't live in the us)

I feel stuck and paralyzed most of the time.
I would really appreciate empathetic responses and any advice from people w the same diagnosis or similar experiences.

It‚Äôll take a bit of work on my part to tailor it for you guys so I‚Äôd like to see if anyone‚Äôs even intrested, but if you are, I‚Äôd love to help out others with BPD who might not have access to the same specialized therapy and programs that I have.

209,BPD therapy questions,"I recently discovered earlier this year that I (most likely) have BPD. it's been such an eye opener but now my next steps in my journey to improve my mental health is to find a therapist that is both well versed in BPD and has a technique that benefits someone with my condition. I've had tons of CBT but it didn't do much. I've tried to find some DBT clinics but it's all very intensive stuff (not to mention expensive) rather than a long term, more slow process one-on-one. How did you find the perfect therapist or way of treatment? I'm nervous I'll waste my money on someone who won't have an approach that benefits me. I saw some people on tiktok show how DBT really helped them, as it was someone who was also available for check-ins, and just way more hands on in general than most therapists. Not even sure if this is 100% true, but how was your therapy experience? What sort of treatment approach did you take, and what do you recommend I search for in my hunt for a therapist? I'd love to hear people's personal experiences and tips!",1688343694.0,False,1,3,LeastGarbage7920,None,14p3shb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/14p3shb/bpd_therapy_questions/

211,Can untreated BPD turn into narcissism?,"I apologize if this goes against the rules, new here. 

I was wondering if untreated borderline can turn into narcissism. My therapist told me it is very important to manage my BPD and go into remission as to not have this happen.

My grandmother is a narcissist and had a traumatic childhood. My emotionally immature mother is beginning to have some NParent traits, though that could be my perception. My biological father is also a narcissist.

I am worried the same will happen to me if I don't get proper treatment. Is this true?",1672075344.0,False,20,36,hamforbananas,Teen BPD,zvrvd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/zvrvd0/can_untreated_bpd_turn_into_narcissism/
212,"No euphoria, low highs","I would like to hear about experiences from people with clinically diagnosed BPD that have low highs.

Euphoric highs are such a defining trait of BPD that it's hard to find sources talking about instances of BPD that lack it aside from ""it's possible."" What do your clinicians say to justify diagnosing you with BPD despite a lack of euphoric highs? How do you be confident in the diagnosis without it? 

I experience pretty intense swings but my ""highs"" are either head over heels enamored with someone (not proud of this) or able to simply have fun for once. I've been diagnosed with both BPD and MDD so I guess it's hard for me to understand why my personality issues are attributed to BPD at times instead of MDD. 

I'm looking for a new psych and therapist so that's why I'm asking here instead of them directly. I also understand that diagnoses don't define people but I want to understand these diagnoses so that I can have guidance when seeking treatment and coping skills.

The urge to explode is still so strong though. The emptiness. The excruciating pain. All in waves but so chaotic it‚Äôs exhausting. 
I hate this feeling. I hate constantly fighting with myself. With what feels like at this point a completely separate entity that I resent so god damn much.

214,Autism & BPD - any signs and/or personal experiences?,"I (20F) have been diagnosed with BPD for almost a year. Previously the diagnosis was Bipolar II, but this was altered when I went inpatient for two days last summer. I have also been diagnosed with ADHD (pretty severe, which I am medicated for) and OCD for about 3.5 years. I've been evaluated over 5 times in my life, starting when I was very young, and to my knowledge, Autism has never even been on the table.

People around me seem to think I have Autism or land somewhere on the spectrum - the majority of my close friends are Autistic so I spend a lot of time seeing and hearing their experiences with Autism. I don't think I share many of their symptoms/experiences, and the symptoms I do share (sensitivity to certain noises/textures, difficulty connecting with people sometimes, etc.) feel like they're more related to my current diagnoses. 

I do, however, realize that I am biased and not a psychiatric professional. So, if anyone has BPD and Autism combined (or have had both diagnoses at some point and landed on one alone) and would be comfortable sharing your experiences, please do! I'm not looking for psychiatric advice or treatment - just personal experiences from others that I can use to help inform myself.",1715721437.0,False,3,16,gothashm12,None,1cs3gnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cs3gnu/autism_bpd_any_signs_andor_personal_experiences/

219,I have BPD & I‚Äôm a licensed therapist,"Let me just share some knowledge:

BPD is a personality disorder. There is no cure. However, there IS treatment for symptom management.

To be technical, BPD is *usually* a result of traumatic experiences during brain development (i. e., younger years), that causes our brains to develop ‚Äúabnormally‚Äù. Unlike mood disorders, we can not just take certain meds to address our neurotransmitters levels. 

Do some medications work for some and not others? Absolutely. But does BPD ever go away? No. 

EDIT: *Yes, you may not meet criteria anymore for services though.*

Today, there‚Äôs a lot of misdiagnoses and self-diagnoses. The only real way to be diagnosed is over a 6 month period and to take an official personality assessment test (e.g., the MMPI). And even then, you need to take it again to confirm the results at a later period in time because the result of a personality assessment wouldn‚Äôt change where a mood disorder would.

EDIT: *However, yes; you can get an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù diagnosis by meeting the criteria. But this is where reliability comes into play (e.g., someone can be showing BPD symptoms now, but will they continue to do so in their life?).*

Mental illnesses are all on a spectrum of severity. They also overlap, correlate, and are often co-occurring.

Unfortunately today, insurance forces practitioners to provide a diagnosis right away for billing purposes. On top of that, there‚Äôs a lot of new mental health professionals who are not nearly as experienced that are in the field right now.

I‚Äôm not posting this to have you lose hope, I just believe education is vital.

Having BPD is EXHAUSTING. But, it‚Äôs also what makes us, us. If you‚Äôre struggling, the best advice I have is to educate yourself. Get into therapy with someone who specializes in BPD. Try DBT (it‚Äôs amazing). Or get into some sort of trauma work. 

Learn to be self-aware so that you can predict your manic episodes and prepare for your emotional crashes. Learn to avoid negative coping skills. Be mindful. Do art. Journal. And post importantly, love yourself.

You are not your diagnosis.

EDIT: *I will provided sources at a later date as they seem to be warranted.*
