0,"My psychiatrist put me on lamotragine the moment she diagnosed me (I'm now up to 200mg a day). Sometimes, thinking of it all as therapy or work can make it hard to want to do them. Because then it makes it seem exhausting and unachievable, dooming you to fail before you start.

I get it. I wish my meds made everything 100% better, but I also know it's too good to be true. And the most rewarding things tend to take a little effort.

 I've never done or looked into DBT therapy, but I have developed my own methods of coping and thoughts that make it seem less like work and more like self soothing.

Learn to recognize patterns in your behaviors and mood. When you get to the point you're really upset because something someone said to you came off a way that hurt, learn to step back. Don't lash out or let the hurt root. Do things that distract or direct your thoughts. I like to do puzzle apps or matching games. It gives my mind a chance to calm down, while my body is still actively focusing and directing my thoughts. Once I'm calmer, I look what was said and talk to the person involved. Let them know how they said it hurt and why, so there is communication and less hurt or bitterness imposed by a misunderstanding.

I do this too when I'm upset. I tell people I'm talking to I need to practice some emotional management so I don't lash out. That's what I call the calm down technique. Emotional Management. So it sounds not like work, but regaining control. Having something you have power over something. Something no one else can manage or boss about for you. It gives me a Centerpoint. Something that makes me go ""if nothing else, even if things are going to shit, this is something I can control. It's the bull I can grab the horns of and force to be still.""

Thinking of it as a job, a chore, or work can make it harder to want to do things that are good for you're overall health.",Mission-Definition-6,1c6ddm7
1,"Since BPD is a personality disorder, it’s based around a lot of thought and behavior patterns that can’t be fully addressed with medicine. Medicine can help some people with some symptoms, but it does take work to actually recover. You basically have to re-wire parts of your brain and do deep healing. But trust me, the work is WORTH it, even if it doesn’t feel like it all the time especially when you don’t immediately feel results. They say the best things in life don’t come easy… I haven’t experienced anything more rewarding than BPD recovery and self improvement. I’ve been in remission for over 2 years, and I love myself and life more than I ever ever thought possible, even in difficult times. DBT is a great place to start if you have access to it.",SarruhTonin,1c6ddm7
2,">my partner brought it up to me last night that ONLY relying on medicine to be the ""be all end all"" solution is only going to set me up for failure


Everyone plays armchair expert, with BPD being an internet obsession. And everyone also loves to parrot the ""bootstrap"" mentality of ""doing the work"" and personal responsibility. Your boyfriend's quote sounds like (relatively harmless) generic mental health stigma.


In fact ""general psychiatric management"" is a clinically validated way to treat BPD, managing medication with minimal or no talk therapy provided by a psychiatrist. Whether that's appropriate or successful depends on many things, but ideas about medication being not used or not appropriate for bpd are overstated.",TranZeitgeist,1c6ddm7
3,"I use the term “work” for recovery and any area of self improvement/growth/healing, and it doesn’t dissuade me because I LIKE doing the “work” and know that I experience it differently than traditional work, but I always wish I had a better term when talking about it with other people",SarruhTonin,1c6ddm7

Do you have a source for this? I’d love to read into it further.

I do think that people often misinterpret the idea that there’s no medication specifically approved for BPD to mean that it can’t be helpful in treatment, so I agree with parts of what you’re saying. The idea that it can be the sole treatment is new to me, though.",SarruhTonin,1c6ddm7

0,"IMO most meds should be used sparingly to aid emotional growth rather than as a long-term solution (unless a person is at serious risk of harm unmedicated). I've never been medicated so I lack firsthand experience but a lot of my friends expressed feeling as though they were slowly losing their sense of self and capacity for excitement particularly on mood stabilizers. Too many drugs that only cover up the problem rather than striking at the root of the problem. I won't say I've handled BPD sober because I use and abuse to both my benefit and my self-destruction, but most of them only serve to curb my boredom. The only street drugs I ever took with the intention of bettering my mental health were LSD and ketamine. 

&#x200B;

Progress is slow and steady and it comes from working to understand who you really are, how you came to be this person and how to be at peace with it. How to recognize when your thoughts and feelings are irrational and unfounded, what causes them and how to stop them from overwhelming your ability to think critically. It's important to be able to take a step back from what may be a harsh or panicked train of thought and determine if you are really being fair to yourself and to others. Consider the perspectives of others without allowing them to overwhelm your own perspective. 

&#x200B;

Maintaining a healthy balance between your ego and your empathy for others is key. It is good to have self-doubt but self-love and confidence is just as if not more important. Too many people allow their fear to suffocate their hope and it is their belief that they will fail which leads to their failure. Psychedelics can help with that, but there's really no magic pill that can cleanse your personality of insecurity and paranoia and you don't *need* to alter your brain chemistry in order to change the way you think. All that you need is within yourself.",GiveBackTheBoard,1arol2r
1,"I think a lot of this will depend on the individual, any comorbidities, and where their life is at at any given point.  


There are people who do recovery without any medication, or people who may be prescribed meds to take the edge off long enough for them to do more therapy and get the coping skills to cope with their symptoms. In the latter case, people can work with their providers and safely taper off meds. If someone is more comfortable with this option, and they are able to function without meds, they should absolutely feel free to make that choice!  


That isn't the case for everyone though. I have a love/hate relationship with my meds and would love to live in a world where I could get off them, *but* I have other mental illnesses, so every time I go off my meds, my mental health gets worse, and this last time I ended up hospitalized. For someone like me, part of recovery is accepting that, at least for the foreseeable future, medication is necessary. But for me, meds didn't really help with BPD symptoms; they just take down the ""noise"" from my other stuff enough that I'm safe and functioning to do the other necessary work.   


So I guess that conversation is one that's best had with your provider. You could talk through how you're feeling, express an interest in maybe trying your options, and see where the conversation goes. Just find the balance between hearing your provider's perspective and being your own advocate if they don't leave *any* room for you to have a say in your own treatment.",torgoboi,1arol2r

I also have bipolar and so I will soon be put on mood stabilizers to treat that, but not the BPD.

Medicine like SSRI’s and mood stabilizers can treat general depression and anxiety which are symptoms of BPD but it doesn’t necessarily treat borderline itself so that’s likely why they won’t prescribe it.

I know it sucks but the truth is, BPD is not treatable with medicine. BPD is caused by trauma. The only way to get rid of it is therapy. 

You can however treat the symptoms of BPD, like depression and anxiety, which it seems like you have from your post. I’m sure they can treat those at the hospital. 

Mood stabilizers are meant for those who shift between mania and depression over a period of time, meaning bipolar disorder - not for your daily irritation/happiness/sleepy/etc mood swings that us with bpd have.

If you are feeling large shifts in moods, from days of mania to deep depression, I would ask the doctors to examine wether or not you might also have bipolar.

Hear me out, the spores are legal. You’re only growing a tiny little bit for yourself to medicate just don’t let anyone know you’re growing them. 
Buy some gel capsules and micro dose. It seems so hard and impossible but I went for it and I’m doing it and it’s helping me so much. It’s a cure for mental illnesses used the right way, so they say. I don’t feel cured but I feel like...”thank god I’ve got my mushrooms capsules” when times get tough. They lighten me up, take away the irritability I feel just existing, take away the constant thoughts running one after another, it really helps to slow my thinking down and in turn helps me to rationalize my inner voice. Also growing them can be quite therapeutic in itself. :) I only take .1 grams and I take them at night time, if I skip a night I really feel the difference in my mood the next day. They really do help, plus the side effects aren’t extra suicidal thoughts...if anything you are irrationally in love with the beauty of the world. Lol

26,">I know it sucks but the truth is, BPD is not treatable with medicine. 

Hey, I just want to expand on this since it's an incomplete statement and the nuance can misguide a lot of people. BPD isn't cured by medications, but BPD can also be treated with medications. It just isn't done alone because BPD is a complex mental illness. Medications help with the surface content but not the core content.

Medication treatments differ from psychological treatments in that they are intended  to help people improve the quality of their lives by changing aspects  of their body or brain chemistry. Generally, the most common medications used for BPD include antidepressant medications, mood-stabilizing medications, and antipsychotic medications.

Most of the studies on antidepressants for BPD have focused on  SSRIs (Paris 2005; Silk, Wolf, and Ben-Ami 2005). This is probably  because these medications seem to have fewer or less-serious side effects than TCAs or MAOIs. Four open-label studies have indicated good  effects of fluoxetine (Prozac) on patients with BPD. In one of these  studies, patients who took Prozac had reductions in their sensitivity  to rejection, as well as improvements in anger, depressed mood, mood  instability (or mood swings), anxiety, and impulsivity (Norden 1989).  A few other open-label studies found that Prozac helped to reduce  psychiatric symptoms, depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity among patients with BPD (Cornelius et al. 1990; Markovitz,  Calabrese, and Meltzer 1991; Markovitz and Wagner 1995).  A few double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have also found  beneficial effects of SSRIs in patients with BPD. For instance, one  study found that anger, anxiety, and depression in patients with BPD  who took Prozac improved more than they did in patients with BPD  who took a placebo (Salzman et al. 1995). Another study looked at  how well Prozac worked for patients who had BPD and a mood or  anxiety disorder. This study found that patients who took Prozac had  greater improvements in depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric  symptoms (Markovitz 1995). A double-blind placebo study of another  SSRI (fluvoxamine, or Luvox) for women with BPD found that the  patients who took Luvox reported more relief from rapid mood shifts,  compared to the patients who took placebos (Rinne et al. 2002).

So, given these studies, what can we conclude? Well, right now,  the best conclusion we can make is that SSRI antidepressants may  be helpful in reducing depression, anxiety, and mood shifts among  patients with BPD.

Mood-stabilizing medications are another type of medication  commonly used to treat BPD. When you think about it, this makes  sense. If having an unstable mood is a key symptom of BPD, then you might expect mood-stabilizing medications to be helpful.There is some evidence that mood stabilizers may be helpful for  people with BPD (Paris 2005; Silk, Wolf, and Ben-Ami 2005). For  instance, there is a small amount of evidence that lithium can be  helpful for patients with BPD (Links et al. 1990). The problem with  this research is that most studies on mood stabilizers have been openlabel trials or have included a very small number of patients. Also, the  medication that has been studied the most is divalproex sodium (DVP). Although DVP has fewer side effects than some of the other mood stabilizers do, it is important to remember that DVP can be harmful to a fetus, so it isn’t a good choice for everyone.

A limited number of studies have shown some good effects of DVP  for people with BPD. One open-label study of eleven patients with BPD  found that after taking DVP for eight weeks, patients had less irritability and psychiatric symptoms (Stein et al. 1995). A larger open-label  study of DVP with thirty hospitalized patients with BPD also found  that DVP seemed to help lessen psychiatric symptoms (Wilcox 1995).  However, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies haven’t always had  the same good findings. For instance, one study found that DVP was  no better than a placebo (Hollander et al. 2001). However, another  study that looked at BPD patients who also had bipolar II disorder  (Frankenburg and Zanarini 2002) found that patients who took DVP  experienced greater improvements in interpersonal sensitivity, anger,  and hostility than did the patients who received the placebo.

The best conclusion we can draw is that mood-stabilizing medications may be helpful for some patients with BPD, especially in  ­alleviating irritability, anger, and general psychiatric symptoms.

Sometimes people use antipsychotic medications in the treatment of BPD. These medications help treat psychotic symptoms and were originally used with people with disorders like schizophrenia.  However, the fact that these medications are sometimes also used to  help people with BPD does not mean that those with BPD are psychotic. Psychosis is a term for problems with being out of touch with  reality. People who have psychotic symptoms might hallucinate (see,  hear, feel, smell, or taste things that are not there), have delusions  (unusual or bizarre thoughts), or experience other such symptoms.  On the other hand, even though BPD is not a psychotic disorder like  schizophrenia, people with BPD sometimes do have unusual thoughts  or beliefs that they just can’t seem to give up (like believing you are  ugly or fat, no matter how often people tell you that is not true, and  try to convince you otherwise). Therefore, some of the medications  used to treat psychosis may be helpful for people with BPD.

56,"I hear you. I’ve been there too sooooo many times. Just wanting to disappear like a ghost so the suffering will end. Feeling like your existence is nothing but a burden on others. 

The best treatment isn’t just therapy alone. Or meds alone. The best treatment is meds + therapy (specifically DBT, a type of CBT) together. There are tons of studies that state this is the “gold standard” for treating BPD.

No doubt DBT/ cognitive behavioral therapy is fucking *exhausting* work. It can feel frustrating/alienating/lonely we with BPD can’t just be “normal.” Every day can feel like drowning. It’s not surprising BPD is the most deadly of all psychiatric disorders with a 10% suicide rate.

But don’t be ashamed of crying— as Native Americans say: “tears are the River of the Heart.” They show bravery and courage that you are facing your emotions. Let that shit out. 

Have you been given a copy of [The Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook?](https://www.amazon.ca/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Workbook-ebook/dp/B07MMQ95VG#) If you haven’t been given this yet, it will CHANGE YOUR LIFE. It was specifically developed for people with BPD using evidence-based, step-by-step exercises to help recognize and learn to challenge/change our negative thought patterns that harm us. I can’t tell you how much it has helped me— the techniques learned in the first few chapters have probably saved my life more than once. 

Any psychiatrist or therapist who knows their shit will have already heard of this workbook. 

As an aside, I noticed you mentioned struggling with anorexia too. I can say from personal experience, DBT will help with that as well. As I’m sure you know, anorexia is about control and feelings of unworthiness— when we can’t manage our emotions and they are out of control, we cling to things we can control because the negative voices are overpowering and we spiral. 

Just remember that this work is exhausting because you are literally carving new neural pathways that serve you better (the Workbook explains this beautifully). Sometimes I can only handle a few paragraphs in a day. That’s totally ok! Go at your own pace. No shaming yourself. 

Fighting to face each day, wanting to give up, being sick of fighting, is something I think all of us here empathize with. But I *promise* if you put in the that early work it gets easier. 

Just don’t be so hard on yourself. And remember those negative, hateful, bullying voices are NOT you. 

We will always be here to support you.",vinoprosim,sr19ye

I found the Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook available on Norwegian online book stores [here on Adlibris](https://www.adlibris.com/no/bok/the-dialectical-behavior-therapy-skills-workbook-9781684034581) and [here on Bokkilden.no](https://www.bokkilden.no/populaerpsykologi/dialectical-behavior-therapy-skills-workbook-matthew-mckay/produkt.do?produktId=20867914) — there are online versions as well.

You also mentioned your family being “fed up.” I can relate to this and obviously all of us with BPD have felt friends or family suffer because of our disorder and them struggling to understand. 

I know it made me feel better when I got my family a copy of [**Stop Walking on Eggshells** by Kreger & Mason.](https://www.adlibris.com/no/bok/stop-walking-on-eggshells-9781684036899)

Here is part of the description:
*Stop Walking on Eggshells has already helped more than a million people with friends and family members suffering from BPD understand this difficult disorder, set boundaries, and help their loved ones stop relying on dangerous BPD behaviors. This fully revised third edition has been updated with the very latest BPD research on comorbidity, coping, and communication skills you can use to stabilize your relationship with the BPD sufferer in your life.*

I think giving that book is a nice way of you acknowledging the feelings of frustration and pain that your family feels as a result of you suffering from BPD, while also giving them the tools to understand, cope, and communicate more helpfully with you.

I usually also give a copy to anyone new I date after it’s been awhile and they start to bear witness to my “waves” as I call them. 

Hope any of that helps. A lot of libraries have these books too if you are super cash-strapped. And there are e-books you can print off from WorldCat for free I’m sure....

I got my dose upped and changed every time I saw him,weekely, I was instantly suicidal. I was trying to end my life basically weekly. It made me acutely  suicidal everyday. 

A few weeks ago at detox I had a seizure and they don’t know if it was caused by my withdrawal(fentanyl) or the antipsychotic I started that day. So I can say I am very very scared to take them. 


I belive with bpd you can get treatment without meds I don’t think they are necessary and only make things worse personally I don’t want to just throw shit at a wall hoping one sticks when my life is on the line and you shoudnt either. Personally for me I will only take anti anxiety’s and sleep aids sense that’s the main reason I used fentanyl and I find them actually help me. You have so dbt and all kinds of other kinds of treatment that aren’t medicine based.

If you worried about an overdose or you ended you life that’s a good reason to not take medication and personally I wouldn’t. It’s your life on the line! Taking meds and bpd in my opinion don’t mix

God I hate psychiatrists: always making me an experiment and shoving different antidepressants down my throat. I’ve probably tried almost all antidepressants and even did two rounds of TMS for depression. Like I’m starting to think I’m either medication resistant or I just straight up don’t have depression. 
My psych is out until January (lovely) and I met with him last week for an emergency for the hallucinations and he just gaslit me about maybe having bipolar (I dont! It’s the meds) and he just disregarded it and lowered my dose and told me to call him in a week. I called him and he didn’t call me back.

The weekend after the 2 weeks I was airsofting with some people outdoors and out of nowhere I snapped and lost all concept of reality and life and started having an intense psychotic episode that would only get worse the longer I prolonged taking my meds. I wanted to stop taking them against drs orders as I couldn’t handle the psychosis but everyone said I had to wait to see what the dr said. The dr was an idiot and dismissed my concerns entirely so I had to find a new dr. After that, every gp or psych I’ve seen that’s prescribed me other types of antidepressants and they all had the same affect, including antipsychotics and anti anxiety meds. Meds are not meant for everyone and can make you worse than you need to be.

26,"Environmental factors are those around us, external to us. The only real things you are guaranteed to be able to do are engage or disengage with your environment. So yes, you can leave a unhealthy environment, but how likely are any of us to do that before getting far enough into therapy to realize the importance of doing so?",,10zbkgs
27,"I don’t quite understand that second sentence. You can realise anything at any point and change direction, in fact its an imperative that you do in order to not do more damage. As most things such as a job, a house or a therapist have no end date. most things require you to break away from the continuum to find another path. I was given a book by Bruce Lipton a developmental biologist who discovered that ’environment’ of a cell was everything, as up until then they would take the nucleus out of the cell to try figure out how cancer evolved. And I just extrapolated that across to how people develop in societies. I think BPs are very sensitive to environmental factors and so honing/manifesting better places to live makes a lot of sense for us. Of course one has to decipher the difference between moving to a better environment and ‘running away’, but even in my younger years when I was undiagnosed….the ignorance was so great around me, I couldnt lose in searching for greener pastures.",DiStUrBEdMeLoN,10zbkgs
28,"You do understand the second sentence, everything you wrote follows the logic of the second sentence. Engage as in participate or be involved in (stay), disengage as in decide not to participate or be uninvolved (leave). I agree with everything you say (except for the extrapolation you made between molecular biology and a bio social personality disorder), but in all my experience working with borderlines it’s the ability to recognize that the environment is unhealthy that is quite frequently lacking in those early in treatment or untreated and generally the act of leaving an environment at that point is done in an unhealthy manner. If you read “Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder” by Marsha M Linehan (the creator of DBT, the book in fact goes into how she developed the treatment, why, and it’s process) you’ll find that the psychological definition of environmental factors and the definition as it relates to BPD are those factors that are external to the borderline such as the people around you, the house you live in, your work environment, etc. This leaves you with really only two major changes that can be made, stay or leave. You can make minor changes to your environment, but not enough to really modify the environments healthy or unhealthy interaction with individuals that have difficulty managing their emotions and reaction to things.",,10zbkgs

But, I’ve not had good experiences with any and I know other people don’t. On the flip side, other people couldn’t get by without it. I’m also a little sceptical about them being over-prescribed. I also have a bit of a grudge, a sort of natural reluctance to take them. But, I’ve give them a go and have been on loads over the years, each with very minimal positive effects, but most with very bad negative effects. I hate that numb feeling, 

I kind of gave up trying to find the best medication that suited my needs, like a lot of the medical professionals told me was out there.  I think a good therapist would realise that medicines don’t help everyone, the statistics are out there. Therefore, they should follow your lead on what you think is best, based on your experiences: medication alone, therapy alone or a combination of both.

I haven’t had medication for a couple of years now (I have several mental health issues, BPD being the over-riding one). I find therapy a much better tool for my problems, along with self help stuff that I’ve discovered works for me.

There's also a very specific way you need to take it in order to lower your chance of the (serious) rash. I would say one of the cons is that if you struggle with remembering to take your meds on time, or have a tendency to abuse your medications, you may need to set timers and do everything you can to avoid taking more than necessary to avoid rash.

Others have gone deeper into the side effects deeper. The Pro is that most people get over symptoms quickly, it's non-addictive, its widely available at the pharmacy, it's easy for your psych to micromanage doses, works well with lots of other meds, and for me at least, it has been a lifesafer for my mood swings, especially with my pmdd.

The good news is this is definitely a panic attack and you’ll be ok, as awful as it is now your body is just always in fight or flight mode so any little thing can trigger it. Other things I would do is try to distract myself by doing something active as soon as taking a medication to kind of distract my brain. Or even a cold shower or something.

It will manipulate your thoughts, and keep you in a cycle of absolute shit.

This is where DBT really helped me. Once you become aware of what your brain is doing, you can start to fight against it. Recognize when your mind is being an asshole, shove the asshole to the side, and make a conscious choice about what you want to do.

3,"Hey, I feel for you. I started seeing mental health professionals when I was 16 and wasn't accurately diagnosed with BPD until I was 28. I even came across some descriptions of it and suggested it to doctors at times, and they told me I didn't have it, because there are still so many misconceptions even among professionals.

BPD is complex. Stigma and misinformation as become widespread around a very limited understanding of it. Everyone forms and expresses it differently. To meet the diagnostic criteria, you need to show at least 5 of 9 symptoms, which means 256 different combinations based on that alone - without including different variations in how the symptoms show up themselves and different severity levels. There are 4 different ""subtypes"" you can look up - but even these are just for the sake of more broadly categorizing things, most people don't fit cleanly into only one subtype all the time.

I'm sorry for the frustration and confusion you must be feeling. But first, because BPD IS so complex and has a lot of overlap with other conditions (and usually has comorbities, which makes things more confusing), please discuss this with a licensed clinician - diagnosis is nuanced, and a professional who's well informed on the condition should be the one to diagnose you. Whether or not you get a diagnosis, you still have the symptoms, and it's important to focus on treating and improving those. BPD has a high rate of remission.

I've been in remission and recovery for over 2 years, and I want to give you and a lot of people here so much more advice and support, but it's difficult to do so like this, so I have a youtube channel if you're interested. [www.youtube.com/@SarruhTonin](https://www.youtube.com/@SarruhTonin) I make BPD specific content as well as other areas of mental health, wellness, and self improvement that have contributed to my overall recovery. Some especially helpful videos for you right now may be Understanding BPD and BPD Advice.

Remember, with misinformation and stigma being so rampant, there's a lot of misinformation on the internet and even within these subs despite the members having BPD themselves. Everyone is different - be wary of any over-generalizations. Dr. Daniel Fox is a great professional resource on YouTube as well - He's a licensed psychologist who specializes personality disorders, and I highly recommend his channel. 

I really hope better understanding your symptoms helps bring you some validation, and even hope since it means you can find a more clear path towards improvement. I wish you the best of luck.",SarruhTonin,1937lh2
4,"Hi. I hope you're doing fine. 

I've been in therapy since I was six years old. When I was 22 I started having depressive episodes, self-harming with high levels of anxiety that wouldn't even let me eat. I've seen psychiatrists and therapists since then and no one, til I turned 27, ever told me that I had BPD. No one ever wanted to tell me even, which was confusing af. So they would prescribe me medications for a disease I didn't know that I had. 

I learned since then that BPD is really hard to identify, because sometimes we don't 'fill' the criteria, but it's something that manifests itself in different ways and in very different periods of time. Sorry for being self-referential, what I mean is: don't be afraid of asking. It's your right to know, and knowing will give you tools to handle what you're feeling.

You are probably gonna have to go into your therapists office and flop around like a fish out of water for a good while before they actually tell you what’s going on.

Fortunately my new doctor knows about that and prescribed me some medication that really helps me. BPD and ADHD have similar symptoms so I think that's why they haven't seen your BPD.

Experts are very much starting to discuss whether or not BPD falls under neurodivergency. BPD and autism can have a LOT of overlap, both lie on a spectrum, and both are difficult to diagnose. Bipolar, ADHD, CPSTD, and other disorders in the cluster B category all get misdiagnosed as BPD, and vice versa. The reality is these disorders are just a collection of symptoms seen together enough that it needs its own label. People will often have diagnosable criteria for a lot these disorders at once, which is why can be particularly challenging for a psychologist or psychiatrist —lots won't diagnose purely on the notion that a lot of therapists and clinics refuse to see patients with BPD.

2,"I'm starting to get this attitude of ""what do I expect?"" from professionals, considering that they're privileged people with wide support networks and tons of wealth passed down from loving families. Like, you really can't become a medical doctor/professional psychiatrist ""on your own"" - anything like a PHD you need at least a family to support you financially until you're ""out"" - you don't have huge workloads and the study time necessary while working part-time. They lack empathy for us because they mistakenly believe they've ""EARNED"" their luck, and we're just ""idiots"" for not being ""just like them"".

They fundamentally can't relate to people like us, because they don't recognize that if we had what they did - loving home, good family, safety and stability - we wouldn't be like this. Instead, they warp it in their heads that ""Oh, my mom and dad loved and supported me - that means I was a good person and I deserved it"" and they see people like us and think ""Oh, their parents gave up so these must be bad people"" or any number of false beliefs that blame us for our shit circumstances while making them seem like they ""EARNED"" their good family.

Until we find a way of letting people like us help eachother out without these twisted yuppie middle-men who peddle eugenics and chemically lobotomize us getting in the way, most of us are just going to be bullied and pushed around by nepobaby doctors who misdiagnose us every time we remind them that their occupations are a band-aid barely scraping the surface of the real issues permeating our lives.

If you've already tried communicating directly, openly, and respectfully in a serious way about what's going poorly, and haven't gotten the same energy and commitment to fixing things back with real actionable things and accompanying changes, this may be impossible to salvage.

 I was scared, because we were living together, and I quite literally had never known anything else my entire adult life (together 14-25). I know your feelings of fear. That you may not find someone better, and the general fear of feeling directionless without him. 

Well I broke up with her in November of 2022. I had a period where I was using alcohol excessively on top of weed. But after a few months I moved out in January to a place I was sharing with 3 other guys. Getting out of her toxic friend circle, away from the constant abuse, and the direct pressure and reinforcement that I was inadequate saved me. And in March, I miraculously found someone. She was incredible, far exceeding my relationship and engagement, because for the longest time, I thought that I could never do better (she told me this and I believed it). 

I toned down my drinking, and even eventually cut out weed. Those months while I lived with her while we were broken up was hell. She'd abuse me daily, was seeing other guys and bringing them around the house, and even in it when I wasn't home one day! I wanted for nothing more than death.

But if I had died, I'd have never met that amazing girl not even 6 months later. Now, I'm not saying you'll find that immediately. In the end that girl and I broke up and it was very traumatic for different reasons. But I had many wonderful months with her, many new experiences, and found out that there was more to life than my ex fiance. It might take a year or more if this man is your favorite person and you don't fi d someone right away (which is completely fine!) But how you're feeling right now is as close to rock bottom as you can be. Just touch the bottom briefly, as you will when it's finally time to separate, and then it's all uphill from there. You know what's sadder than crying alone? Crying with your partner nearby who doesn't give a shit.

Hi.
Please don't give up!  You are so much more than you know!  Realize that, although I'm sure you feel like it might be true in the moment - you are NOT alone in this!  Someone once told me, ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" - And that's true!  Know that ""this too shall pass!""  I remember once - when I myself was in a dark place - it occurred to me that, while I was feeling the way I was feeling, I actually couldn't remember - i.e., at an emotional level - what joy, happiness, or even neutrality was like, despite KNOWING (intellectually) that there were plenty of times in my life when I DID have joy, happiness, etc.  
If you need someone to talk to, please DON'T hesitate to message me on this site!  Although I don't have BPD myself, I have been very close to someone who does - someone I've known for nearly twenty-five years now - and I, myself, have something called Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), which is quite different, in many ways, but is often considered distressing to a similar extent as BPD can be.  Don't let this thing (i.e., BPD) have the final word - it's worth overcoming!  (I'm certainly far from perfect, but again, please don't hesitate to message me for any reason!)

I am going bankrupt because the only employer in my small town village doesn't pay enough for me to rent. I live in an ""illegal apartment"" because I don't have a choice, my neighbors can hear all my conversations inside and I have effectively no personal privacy causing gossip in said community. I also have a baby with colic/pain issues that my country's starved medical system (rural Canada) seems to forget about/take months to years to do anything to get ball rolling, and my neighbors smoke cigs and it is wafting in affecting my baby who was born with lung/breathing issues. I can't complain because I can't afford to move anywhere and if I complained to my landlord/tenant board/association in my part of Canada then it would trigger inspection and we would be tossed out of the only place we can barely afford to live in. I used to make money, enough to support my family before covid and before COL went exponential and before I became disabled during pandemic with seizure disorder that is rare and uncontrollable and I perma lost my drivers lic. My SO also almost died and developed sig. health probs. My father died, we lost our house and everything due to their poor financial decisions and now my mom and my cat that saved me from suicide years ago are at serious risk of going homeless in rural Canada (where it can get to -30 to -40 degrees in winter) by next year.

I’m currently trying out this sober shit and starting to go to AA, but yes, I believe that in the end it made me worse. I don’t even think I was functioning to be honest, as I would drink until I was blackout to either help me sleep, or to shut off the shit in my head. A lot of people didn’t like drinking with me for how blackout I would get, but I selfishly thought that it was the “cure” or whatever. 

So basically substance/alcohol use and BPD? Would not recommend lol. Only in healthy amounts, if that’s possible. I think my BPD gives me a very addictive personality so not sure if that’s the same with anyone else",badsbee,18zq2j5

Honestly, don't wait for him to walk away. Take those steps yourself. He is- at the very least- emotionally abusing you, and whether or not he has BPD, there's no excuse. Abusers will drain you dry, until you're a whisper of your former self. Trust me, I know. So, be strong, love yourself, and do what you need to do to heal from this trauma.

I want to add that it took me far too long to leave my emotionally abusive ex, because I was worried that he would spiral further down than ever if we broke up. But, as my therapist said to me back then, ""You can't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm."" And she was right. My ex carried on without me, though I made the mistake of trying to be friends with him at first. He almost succeeded in sucking me back in to a relationship, but then I realized that despite him being on his best behavior, his underlying issues were still there, and if I went back to him, I'd eventually be at least as miserable and downtrodden as I was before, if not more so. So, I went no-contact. It took a while for me to get my sense of self back, but I'm doing so much better now.

TW: self harm

i’m 10 years sober this year (50F). started drinking regularly from age 8 (alcoholic ‘parents’), blackouts by 12. i drank heavily for years. it got worse and worse and my life was totally out of control. i ended up having a total breakdown and was hospitalised for 7 weeks. i got my BPD, OCD and CPTSD diagnoses there, to add to the anxiety and depression i’ve been medicated for since i was 17.

when i got my BPD diagnosis it all suddenly made sense. but, i didn’t have a clue now to manage it. i kept drinking for another 18 months, still getting worse and worse. i was in AA but still drinking for a few months. then i came round from a 3 day bender to find a trashed flat, no money and no booze left.

i had horrific withdrawals for 3 days. hallucinating, vomiting until my eyes bled. in the end i was just throwing up in the. ed as i couldn’t stand up or walk. i tried to go and get some water and i collapsed. i laid there in a dark freezing hallway, not knowing what day or time it was. nobody knew what was happening. i could SEE my heart beating and i thought id finally done it - i was dying.

and in that moment i realised i wanted to live. someone from AA got me to a meeting the next day and i got a tough sponsor and worked the fuck out of those steps and i haven’t had a drink since.

life hasn’t been sunshine and roses. i still get long periods where i’m very depressed. trying not to SH as i had a bad summer a couple of years ago. 25 stitches in 2 weeks and one emergency surgery after i accidentally hit an artery. so i stopped drinking, i stopped hurting myself and i’m in therapy for my huge childhood trauma.

but i’m alive. i made it, and i didn’t think i would. i lost friends along the way as i stopped going out drinking. but i made new friends in AA and they understood me. i still have some ‘original’ friends, i’ve repaired a lot of family relationships. there’s one that hasn’t made it and it hurts me every single day but i have to carry on.

get a hold of this now. i lost everything to alcohol and nearly died. don’t be me.

67,"TLDR: I haven't ""fixed"" my relationship with booze, but I have been able to control my circumstances enough to mend the damage I cause by drinking. Enough so to make it worth it for me to continue having in my life.

I think it helps to ask yourself what it is you like about alcohol and why (and if) it's really important to you. I'm 26 with BPD and I've been a regular drinker since my early teens. I've come to the realization that I honestly just love drinking alcohol and I don't think that I ever want to give it up (unless things go sour or I have to for pregnancy/medical reasons ofc)

When I was in high school, starting from age 13, I would binge drink to no return. Passing out in a field, puking, making out (or other things) with boys I barely knew, hitch-hiking home (incredibly embarrassing when I live in a small town)... constantly waking up with that despicable feeling we all know and dread ""what did I do last night? how much shit am I in today? I drank most weekends and always to an excessive amount (please don't judge my parents, not your problem). I was a teenager so of course I didn't need much to really get to that level. But looking back I never really enjoyed myself all those party nights. Especially considering I don't remember them all that much.

The next 4 years of university were much of the same, except worse because of the increased frequency combined with a lack of supervision. I drank excessively and frequently. often mixing with other substances. I slept with strangers, made terrible decisions, spent too much of my parents hard-earned money, and I rarely remembered a night out.

Now that I am older, my drinking habits are more frequent but less excessive. I often have 1-4 drinks on a work night, and on a weekend I usually cap out around 6. Back in my younger days, I would never drink casually or in small amounts. If I wasn't getting drunk, it was a waste of calories. I think my relationship with alcohol has gone hand-in-hand with my disordered eating habits. Another thing leading to it is that I am more surrounded by people I know, trust, and am not trying to impress. I am also not in those same party situations. (although, when I do find myself at a party/bar/big night out.. I resort back to those same old habits)

I used to drink and drink and drink until I felt invincible. To make the awkwardness go away. I've always had a phobia of dancing. A phobia sounds dramatic but seriously. I was stiff when music came on and would constantly excuse myself away from dance floors. Alcohol helped. I found myself at a dance party recently, and I fell into the same old song and dance (no pun intended). I drank so much that night I ended up passing out early and drinking so much I forgot how I got to my bed.

&#x200B;

So, I guess it turns out that my relationship with alcohol hasn't really been ""fixed"".. it's just being actively controlled.

I don't know why I wrote all of this out. I hope someone reads it and understands or can relate or whatever.

TLDR: I haven't ""fixed"" my relationship with booze, but I have been able to control my circumstances enough to mend the damage I cause by drinking.",jnv29,uhe6fk

I tried Depakote- I was a zombie, could not answer the phone. Lithium was terrible. Seroquel, Trileptal, Tegretol just did not work. I attempted while on Abilify. Any time I was admitted to hospitals, they changed my meds immediately to one of these.

2. text yourself. there’s a satisfaction in hitting that send button, even if it doesn’t actually go anywhere.

3. sing. this one may not be for you, but i’ve found that singing works as a verbal processing method, especially if the song matches the emotion.

Seems like most people with BPD are highly intelligent - and since we mostly suffer out of view, the perceptions of others are that we’re aloof, or arrogant, or disinterested… simply because they already view us as intelligent and accomplished so this unexpected behavior has to fit into a box of assumptions that they crafted for us.  The problem is, having BPD - you take their assumptions as gospel truth!

My point is, sounds like you are on a great path in life.  Fuck everyone else, their judgments and assumptions… it’s always going to be a little harder in life because of BPD (trust me - I legitimately fucked my life up before I found out I have BPD) But at least you get to be smarter than most!!

Look at Vincent Van Gogh he killed himself thinking he was as a failure and after his death look at how many people view him as a creative genius and love his work. Random example my bad. 

Truth is you are better than suicide. 
Suicide is a confession. A confession that life is too much for you to handle. I know you’re not a weak person, you are a fighter. I’m sure you fought to get to medical school because so many fail at that. 

Sit down. What’s bothering you. Journal it. Who do you want to be. How can you get there?
what kind of doctor you want to be?
Your training to be a dr then research how to heal yourself. Put in the work. Dedicate a certain amount of time to studying and for 30 minutes a day dedicate to reprogramming your brain.

I regularly consume cannabis, and it definitely does have mind altering effects. If I get too high, I'll become very thirsty, dizzy, confused, disoriented and just very out of it.

I also don't know how to deal with this, but I think it helps to try to see the person for what she is, remember their flaws and all that, and try not to give in to the thought of her being perfect. It is also important to reming yourself that you will stop loving her eventualy and fall in love with someone else.

Radical acceptance could work.

But, don't add backstory, as in don't start listing everything that's gone wrong before.

&#x200B;

You should check out the other bpd sub, it's the complete opposite to here where everyone echoes bad behaviour and a poor me attitude. It's a split between people who want to improve and want a good name for the disorder and see others do well and the other sub where everyone thinks they are the center.

1,"Usually most people who interject something along those lines are willing to have a conversation with the person to iron out the small details. Anyone worth their salt in helping guide people through this won't pass any judgement. There are certainly some who unfortunately do though, and that shouldn't happen.

We should be able to vent to each other, but to be honest a community where that's all we do sounds entirely unappealing and emotionally draining. Asking each other about management is how we hold one another accountable, and can share techniques that work for us.

We can validate how hard this is all day long, but without being willing to be asked hard questions about how you're managing your BPD and holding yourself accountable... This sub would devolve into something not pretty, in my opinion.

Like this conversation for example, you have an opinion, I have a different one. No problem, we're gonna have different opinions on content we want to see here. I will say there are plenty of other BPD forums, even /r/s, where you'll get straight up banned for holding people accountable. I've been straight accused of not having BPD for it in those forums as well. I was extremely happy to find this place. It's a good mix of people who are in the throughs of this, and people who have had the support to navigate through it to a healthy place.",Skullyy,1ai4swk
2,"I used to get that from my sister and my Mum until they learn about my illness. To my Mum’s credit, she went and bought books and educated herself. 

They would be so offended. I have cousins and Aunts & Uncles that will never speak to me again. They have no clue how different I am in 2024 than I was 2017. My family wanted apologies. Ok, but if you demand an apology and Is say, “sorry”, you got me to say a word. You could have asked me to say butter. It’s meaningless. I would tell my Mum and sister that I understood why they would be upset. Be mad at bipolar, not me. I didn’t ask for this. 

I’ve found my perfect combo of meds. I would say I been in remission for at least a year. Meds, DBT therapy. I’m surprised I see no one else posting about this. It is radically life changing therapy. 

So, I can take responsibility for my actions. My Mum & sister now understand if I’m manic. They guide me thru it. They ask questions, did you pay yours before you bought clothes and they would help me sorted money and manic purchases. 

I can tell when mania is coming on. I can catch it and with a lot of self talk, keep myself from Amazon. I still might be up all night deciding what my favourite lipstick is, but that is harmless. You have to ride the wave.",AdGold654,1ai4swk

But at the end of the day, these people mean well and probably just think they’re doing a good thing to serve these reminders, so I try not to take it personally and appreciate the fact that some people may actually need these reminders.

To answer your question, yes, DBT is available on the NHS, however whether or not you can access it depends on your location. I know this service is available in Oxfordshire, but only during work hours, and the wait time was around 6 months to get in. Don’t know if you work or study, for me, skipping work 2 days a week for months wasn’t an option. If you have a good GP, it’s worth discussing whether DBT is offered where you live. Also, Google the available therapies in your area, as often GPs and even psychiatrists are unaware of where patients can be referred.

So not beneficial at all, actively damaging. Oh and when I was pregnant they reported me to social services because of the diagnosis. I lost the baby but if I hadn't then I would have been under supervision purely because of bpd. I've been under 4 different community mental health teams now due to moving miles away every time I had a total breakdown and they've all been as useless and dismissive as the last.

I received 6 weeks of intensive crisis assistance where someone came to visit me in my home 4 times a week, and then it just stopped. I don’t qualify for the counselling service because apparently my needs are far too complex for what they can offer (I have comorbid bipolar and cpstd, so totally a shit show) my local womens centre won’t work with personality disorders, and my psychiatrist is useless.

I’ve wanted to give the ECT or magnetic therapy a try but my doctor won’t sign off on it. I’m not sure why, and I find it frustrating. I’m 46 now and just trying to hopelessly muddle through life, waiting for the heart attack or cancer that runs in my family to take me. It’s not great.

In the past I would quit for a month or two, get a bunch of stuff done then go back. I didnt understand the emotions but I knew I never felt any satisfaction from the accomplishments and as soon as I ran out of goals it hit hard again. I feel like I want to ""fast forward"" through uncomfortable situations i have to go through. And I recognized I was impulsive and dangerous while not on it. 

I want to quit relying on it out of stoicism and everything. But I suppose there is a place for it when Im feeling extremely acute. 

I also think Marijuana makes me closer to the psychopathy spectrum. Its weird. Sometimes I get very emotional but I notice when im smoking with people I just want to talk a lot and kind of lose the feeling of connection I have when talking to someone.

0,"I'm creative and passionate too. I have a sense of self as I know my talents, abilities, dreams, passions, values, and what I want to do in life. Where my unstable self image comes in is not knowing what my actual personality is. If you ask me who I am outside of my interests I have no idea. It's unclear to me who I am as a person. 

You can be BPD and not have all the symptoms. I believe there's 9 possible ones and you only need 5 off the DSM-5 that are debilitating to get a diagnosis. However, BPD can certainly be misdiagnosed. Have you ever looked into the DSM-5? That would be my recommendation.",,17q0j9x
1,"I mean, do you think you have a strong sense of self or do other people just tell you that you have a strong sense of self?  I used to have basically no sense of self but because I am smart and quick witted and constantly engaging in power struggles other people perceived me as having a strong sense of self.  But how do you feel when you're alone?  How do you feel when relationships end?",PretendCamel3989,17q0j9x
2,"I got diagnosed about 6 months ago a couple months before my 18th birthday when I’d known I had Bpd since around 15 and been showing traits of emotional dysregulation since 7/8 years old after my first lot of childhood trauma. You can actually grow out of bpd and enter remission if you no longer meet 5/9 of the criteria. I deffo do not have a strong sense of self identity but at times I go through spontaneous patches where I am entirely obsessed with something (most usually my favourite person) or occasionally a hobby such as photography or sewing that gives me a temporary sense of identity. 

The majority of people I’ve met with bpd diagnosed are extremely creative in some specific ways, in no way am I assuming anything but there is potential that your psychosis causes you to doubt your diagnosis (one of my closet friends has psychosis and she frequently will doubt her own diagnosis or even that she has psychosis then the next day will be like nvm yup still got it)",cucumbermold,17q0j9x
3,"Our sense of self is a very interesting physical anomaly between two sections of the frontal lobe. 

P3A and P3B are the centers that are active in the moment, and that decide how to recal memories. The relationship between these is somewhat recognized as a large part of our sense of self. 

In our brains they have a shifty connection. Its not consistent and its a bit sideways, but! The connection has an increased amplitude. 

So we change in nuanced ways a lot, and are generally a bit odd, but with quite a bit of conviction at times. 

This comes as a spectrum as well, and is hard to use as a diagnostic criteria. You may feel very rooted in yourself, but can sometimes feel distant(dissociated) or notice you blend in to many different personality groups because your identity is actually fairly maleable.",_-whisper-_,17q0j9x
4,I've always had a strong sense of self.  BPD only requires 5 out of 9 symptoms for a diagnosis and there are over 200 combinations that can be made out of that.  Which is why I question its scientific validity.,Due-Possibility-197,17q0j9x
5,"I’m a creative too. Diagnosis and therapy have helped me immensely. At the end of the day, my ability to function in community (I’m a musician) has improved greatly, which is key. Who can say whether you got an accurate diagnosis but a clinical psychologist? It is possible you’re suffering from CPTSD and/or ADHD. Either one would benefit from the same or similar therapy and drugs. Get a second opinion, but not from Reddit.",80sLegoDystopia,17q0j9x
6,"I'm passionate and have a stable career, but my sense of self sucks because how I feel about myself completely depends on external validation. Some days I feel good about myself, and other days I feel the complete opposite.",justagirlinterrupted,17q0j9x
7,"It's because of a dysfunctional ambivalent self-esteem. Simply sometimes its stable and valid sometimes unstable and invalidated.

This on/off-self - ambivalence - points to BPD, diagnosis seems realistic. It is a question how strong and how lasting this pattern is. There can be mistakes with bipolar but BPD and bipolar do not exclude, it's question of symptoms.

Why together sense of self and not? Because of splitting inside personality. Beeing loved and invalidated by the same person leads to this disorganisation. Goal is to make it consistent again.

Best for you 🙏",cyberbungee,17q0j9x
8,"I see what you mean. Yeah we have looked at the DSM-5 for things, and got a BPD diagnosis on the MID assessment.....but idk, still kind of unsure some days for some reason....It makes sense that you're saying that.

It's just confusing since I also have Bipolar 1, which is confusing for both of those to coexist 

Hmmmm. Outside of my interests, I feel like I know who I am in the sense that I feel like I was born here for something special. But that could be the Bipolar lol 😂",staralien44,17q0j9x
9,"Somewhat both! Others have told me(or maybe perceive me), which is usually a trigger for some reason (as if they know me better than I know myself....idk it's dumb lol) but also, I tend to feel like I was born here for a reason, that I'm someone who can do things no one else can because I'm the only me etc. 
But I definitely don't always feel good about myself. I definitely feel like I deserve to be alone or that I'm lacking, but on my good days I think maybe because I'm Bipolar, I feel like I have a lot to offer if someone would just let me love them.

When relationships end, I definitely fall into a deep spiraling depression and self blame etc. Depends on the fall out.....if it was bad I can get s*ic*dl But after some time I spring back and feel more independent like ""I don't need anyone"" sort of attitude.

Again, that's why I'm not sure if I'm just Bipolar or also BPD, if that makes sense 🙄😅

I was diagnosed BPD via the MID assessment though, I just know it doesn't diagnose Bipolar so- that's why I'm like ""what are the chances""..",staralien44,17q0j9x

1,"I'm sending hugs.

I can't say that every prescriber has your best intentions in mind. I also can't say that these medications are all safe long term.

But I will say not to forget that your brain is also an organ, and it needs health too. The health of your brain now is more important than a kidney maybe later. 

Also remember that dosages are made and tweaked by your provider to minimize damage as much as possible. Always be honest to your provider, and if you feel that your provider is pushing  medications in a way that makes you uncomfortable, you can switch providers.

Everybody needs medication at some point in their lives. Most people will be on some form of long term medication at a point or points of their lives. Medicine isn't a symbol of weakness. Medicine is a symbol of support, and accepting your medications is a show of strength and wanting to survive with a higher quality of life.

It's okay, and good, to be mindful about what's going into your body. But a good medicine will help way more than it hurts, and that's a net positive. If you've got a great kidney but you live a miserable life, or if you get an extra wrinkle but life is stable and comfortable, which one is best?",princefruit,1bmdb6o

I’d say first that his family doesn’t need to know about what medication you are taking. That’s private info. Of course, if he tells them, they will know, but that info is for you and should be kept private, especially if you ask him to keep it that way.

If you ask him to keep it private, and he does not, that’s an indication that he doesn’t respect your needs. 

People take regular medication for all sorts of things that exceed homeopathic remedies like for high blood pressure. Ultimately, I think you do what is right for you, especially if you feel like you are going to hurt yourself.

2,"Mexdroxyprogesterone Acetate injects (the generic version of the Depo shot) helped me. I’m 23F been on it for 2 years now. They last 3 months but I do find them tapering off a little on the third month. I might try the Nexplanon implant next because the Depo shot isn’t meant to be long term. 

I initially went on it for Endometriosis but to my surprise it evened out my Depressed weeks. It certainly didn’t eliminate the depression, but I wasn’t wanting to die for 3-4 weeks. (My cycles were long, it also shortened mine to normal length.) My highs weren’t as high and my lows weren’t as low if that makes sense. That hole of pain in my chest is still present but hormones aren’t turning it into a black abyss consuming me.

It’s definitely not for everyone, some women get more depressed on progesterone, some it helps with depression like me, and there’s a bunch of different kinds too and everyone reacts differently to different kinds.

Let his emotions be what they are and listen when he wants to share them and don’t make this about you. Thank you for coming here to tell us to take care of ourselves.

10,"I've heard the exact things from my son. Seems like every three months something would happen that would set his life off the tracks. 

Prior to his jump, he was pulled over for cutting through a parking lot and ended up with felony charges for refusing to comply with the police (it was a small town, do they didn't have any patience). So his court date was a couple days after he was in the ICU. 

While I don't know your circumstances or family and friend status, you should care life will always have set backs but also good moments. You cannot see what the future has both bad and good. But staying around at least gives you a chance to see some good. Also not too many people really are ""normal"" despite their social media fronts. 

I want to thank everyone for the encouragement and good advice. My son is currently in surgery and will have several more before Xmas.

1,"    Hello 

I didn't read your previous post, but I can respond to this. I have ADHD and PTBS and my Ex had BPD.

After my experience I can say clearly, that if people do hurt other they are hurting already badly inside themselves. You as a adult should of course not send her the message it is okay to hurt others, treat them poorly and with zero consequences. 

But the punishment is probably what she knew all her life, wich is why she doesn't have healthy ways do deal with a adult relationship. Build of mutual respect and empathy. 

Now to you. More important that she sees you are hurt is that you see and recognize your wounds. What you truly need is your validation and to respect your boundaries and feelings. You can see her just like a substitute for your missing self care and respect. That makes you dependent on her and that builds the cycle of abuse and pain and then again honeymoonphase after you both reconciled.

I find it very positive and mature that you ask for second opinion of other how to handle a difficult situation. You can tell her that you are hurt and that you need your time for you and to get your feed on the ground. BPD sufferers often push their partner unconsciously to the point that they repeat what their parents did to them when they where kids. It sounds paradox but that gives them security and manifests their bad beliefs about themselves. I am bad and I need to be punished. I suggest to stay true to yourself and don't participate in that. Is that what you like to punish another hurt person? Stay in your corner and only tell how you feel and what you need. No need to make assumptions or accusations or point her out what she did. Stay with you and be loyal to you. There is a reason why you connected with her. Use that gift and direct your attention to where it hurts in you.

I don't know how old you are and if it's the right time in your life for you. I will still tell you what helped me. 

Dr. Gabor mates information about trauma and healing

Susan forwards information about abuse in childhood and the consequences for adultlife

I'm in recovery from the 5 year relationship with a BPD partner. It is painful but people with BPD are often highly sensitive also in a positive way. They point you straight out, where you lack to heal your wounds.

The fact you’d punish her if she didnt follow your rules exactly is pretty controlling tbh.

Also, how do you know she hasn’t made an appointment if you haven’t heard from her? If she didn’t make one, she probably has a lot on her plate. You yourself said she wasn’t her usual self. From what you described, it could be severe depression, and some people tend to push other’s away when they’re at their lowest. This is a time for you to be concerned and trying to offer support. At any time, you could’ve reached out with a “Hey, I’m worried about you. Are you ok?” but chose not to. With BPD, when it feels like someone you love is neglecting you or abandoning you, it hurts. And from that hurt we lash out or abandon. You’re lashing out by being petty. Think of how that’s going to make her feel on top of the way she already does. I also think you’re being too controlling with the way you’re trying to get her to change her med by giving her an ultimatum.

And she asked me to get her some stimulant, I didn't do that because she wanted it to be shipped to her address which could put her in danger, I got her modafinil which has less potential for abuse and it's legal to have it (It's not legal to purchase it 2ithout a prescription , but she didn't do it I did, so she won't be in any legal troubles)",boooud,167xpkn

Not every Borderline person has FPs. Plenty of disorders outside of BPD have black and white thinking.

5,"I’ve never understood why people believe that living is preferable; life is so painful for those of us who suffer with mental illness, and unless you’ve been in the bottom of that pit there’s no way you can understand it.

1,"1) I have been on lamotragine, fluxotine, latuda, quetiapine, and vyvanse. This combo of meds came from the diagnosis of bipolar (mood stabilizers, first 4) and ADHD (vyvanse) before the diagnosis of BPD. The only two I can tell when I take is quetiapine (knocks me tf out) and vyvanse (narrows down my focus). I have never felt a mood being stabilized. Most people seem to agree therapy is the best (and maybe only) way. 

2) Absolutely yes. I gave myself a concussion with how powerful a sedative Quetiapine is. We were able to lower the dosage successfully. However, if I run out I don’t sleep. I went on a trip and ran out. Didn’t sleep for 3 days. 

3) Beyond the drowsiness  w/ Quetiapine, haven’t noticed anything else. 

4) I think you’ve covered the major ones. 

DBT and CBT has helped a to.  Good luck god speed in your journey. I’m proud of the steps you e took to reach out for help.",Badgersage,154rxs4
2,I was advised recently that meds have not been shown to help BPD and that only counselling affects it,GargantuanGreenGoats,154rxs4
3,"Hi OP, I don't think I have much to add in the medications aspect but your English was great in the post, I think I understood everything you were trying to communicate. 

I haven't been medicated for BPD but for depression & anxiety and an antidepressant did really help with my moods. Mostly it helped with my huge lows and really bad mood swings. It did kind of make me a little numb which I realized after getting off of it. Overall I would say it was a good experience for me. I really really think it depends on the individual and your experience will vary. Medication can be that next step we need to get ourselves to a steady baseline and consistently feeling okay instead of really high highs and really low lows, if that makes sense. If you are really against trying it (which is valid and completely within your rights!) then I'd just prepare something for your therapist with a plan to work on in therapy. Like maybe you would prefer focusing on the DBT and therapy in general and implementing what you learn into life before trying medication. I am not a doctor or therapist but that sounds reasonable to me, especially if you're having concerns of side effects or having to taper off of the medication. 

Questions I would ask about the medications would be - 
1. What are the most common side effects your patients see with this/these medication(s)? 
2. What are less common, but concerning side effects I can try to prepare for or should know about?",Quailfreezy,154rxs4
4,"Honestly, just don't bother. It sounds like therapy alone is helping, and as you continue with it, you'll progress further. Meds, especially mood stabilisers and antipsychotics can cause awful side effects, sometimes they don't even help the symptoms it's being taken for. They're more hassle than they're worth in my opinion, and NO they are not necessary. 

I can't answer about addiction as I'm not sure - but side effects can be bad, I believe lamotragine is one of the worst with that god awful rash it can give you. 

You should consider asking why they're wanting to give you a mood stabiliser for short term problems, they take anywhere between 2 - 6 weeks to make a noticeable difference, that's if they work, and they probably will give you side effects at some point. You could ask about an unmedicated approach to this situation, where you have an extra session every week, or a crisis plan that you can refer to if things get bad etc. And if you/they think medication is the best option, consider a short term medication instead - fast acting and much more effective in the short term, less side effects (for me at least), but can be more addictive.",TheLacosteCroc,154rxs4

6,"Thank you so much for such a descriptive reply! It really means a lot! What I gather and feel about this is - 

1. This numbness from mood stabilizers, someone else also mentioned. I am unsure whether it would be something for me or not. I feel I don't like the idea of it but maybe at least momentarily I feel better with having such numbness especially when I feel I have such a wide emotional range.
2. I have also realized that not all meds work for everyone. There is a trial and error basis attached to meds.
3. I would prefer having like ""as needed basis med"" like an ""SOS med"" but not having something that I take regularly.
4. Therapy will never be replaced and it is a constant for me until I feel I have overcome BPD. This med situation is temporary

I will also say that I have never done drugs and alcohol because I don't like the idea of losing my senses. Also side-effects, etc. scare me a bit. So, it is a part of my reasoning to be reluctant to meds of such sorts. But I am willing to give a try to somewhere. The decision remains in my hand but I would want the session with my psychiatrist to be as clear for me.

So, I will bring these things up in my next session. Thanks again <3",Krish-777,154rxs4

9,"I have read about this too but I believe my medication has less to do with BPD and more to do with the current situation that I am in majorly this depressive and anxious episode. But, I will ask my psychiatrist about the purpose of the meds and what is it medicated for. Thank you for replying!",Krish-777,154rxs4
10,"Thank you so much! My therapist had explained me in the session that the mood stabilizer would essentially increase the production of dopamine and serotonin in my body and also the rate of absorption in neurons of these hormones, once my body is able to produce these hormones at a good rate by itself, they will lessen the dosage of these meds. Moreover, I was told that she is recommending me to the psychiatrist only because of this extremely low phase. So, I assume that I too am being medicated for my depression but when I have my session with the psychiatrist I will clear this up too. 

I want to ask you (I hope I am not crossing any line here) once you got off the meds, and felt this numbness did you ever feel that you got dependent on them at any time or later realized something of such sorts? Do you know why that little numbness was felt? Apologies if I am asking way out of my line .. lmk if so I'll edit this part .. 

I am glad that you shared your experience with me and I feel a little positive about the meds that they could help you. Thanks again!",Krish-777,154rxs4
11,"I too feel that therapy might be enough for me and I do believe if it is enough for me I would not want to take meds. That being said, just because I feel tired of being this hurt so many times and going through a very bad depressive episode I feel there is a need for some SOS. I look forward to talk about some SOS med with my psychiatrist. Moreover, I will ask about an unmedicated approach and its feasibility. I actually feel your comment actually describe what I feel might be the best for me! thanks! <3",Krish-777,154rxs4

13,"Np, hope it works out for you :)",GargantuanGreenGoats,154rxs4
14,"Not crossing a line, no worries at all! I think for me, I miss the numbness only because it helped me feel so much more balanced. Like yeah, the numbness sucks in hindsight (because I really couldn't detect it or realize it until I returned to my normal state of ""chaos"" lol) but it really helped me feel like I had a steadier ""baseline"" if that makes sense. Like yeah I was a little numbed but I prefer that over feeling very very depressed ya know? That's just a personal preference though. Most people I know (who don't have BPD to my knowledge) who have been on antidepressants usually say they did NOT like the numbness and wouldn't want to take them again. But I liked that I felt more balanced, like less over the top upset at small things, felt like I was able to think more clearly about situations that upset me, that kind of thing. It also just generally was very helpful with that heavy, dark depression feeling I experience. So overall I had a good experience but of course it all depends on the individual. 

I wish you the best of luck with whatever you decide to do! It sounds like you're on a great track with your therapist and if you ever feel like you and them are not on the same page don't hesitate to find a new provider. You deserve to feel supported in your mental health journey 💖",Quailfreezy,154rxs4

0,I think it depends on if you act on it. But I can see it as healing. I did one as well before I was on medicine.

1,"I see. I appreciate that. You are definitely correct. I need to talk to my psychiatrist and get a new therapist to help me.

I have felt like I have been trying to find something. Like--the epicenter of where all the other things I have stem from.

Do I realize it is entirely possible that I just have a bunch of different things that are not caused directly from some sort of other condition? Yes.

Sometimes, I do wonder though, if these things I have are not just individual things but that they are actually effects or conditions that originate from something else.

Given, I know I have a bunch of things that are unrelated to this. I do understand that even with a new diagnosis it would not encompass all of my problems nor would it suddenly make these problems better.

1,"It's like not having skin, all your nerve endings are exposed and every damn thing is unbearably painful. all you can do is bleed, until you bleed out and you feel somewhat stable for a little while (constantly empty counts as ""stable"" in my book because, hey, at least it's *constant*). but eventually, inevitably, you start bleeding again. and everyone — friends, family, yourself, doctors, *everyone* — thinks you're a lost cause. it's hell, i'm in hell.",cannedc0rn,u0ub63
2,"Oh good question. I would describe it myself as, it is this deep loneliness that springs me forward to get close to others which makes me feel intense euphoria - the only strong positive emotion I can feel, but takes me straight down to hell: the worst emotions I have ever felt, each and every time. A very intense rollercoaster taking you out of the atmosphere, and straight into the burning core, and always overanalyzing when the next episode will be, and you forget how much it hurts until you feel it again. The fears of your most closest people or FP abandoning or leaving you, and it ignites a spark.

That spark turns into a flame, and it burns in my chest, and it keeps on burning until the episode stops. The fire works its way up to my throat as I can't get it out and it screams at me inside to get solace so it can calm the anxious storm in my mind which is the need for reassurance, the feeling that resets the emotion level back to ""stable"". It hurts to be alone. And it hurts to be with others. That's probably how I would explain mine! And this numbness, inability to feel happy and not knowing who I am, and I start developing traits from people I am close to, almost like merging.

Never knowing who I am because I am so empty. Needing validation and reassurance because I can't get it from within.

1,"Diagnosis labels are primarily concerned with us not being outwardly disorderly. We can get to that point, not being destructive anymore, not usually, but then a lot of therapy is kind of done. The goal isn’t for us to have a good experience necessarily, just to enable us to function. I’m grateful that I can function with few meltdowns anymore, but it’s natural to want to thrive! There’s nothing wrong with you, but think of it like you were sitting way below neutral or ground level on the human experience. You were brought up from the basement and now you’re sitting on the surface. It’s better than before but you have no elevation. You don’t have to stay here though! Now it’s time to climb. It takes us a lot of work just to get to what is most people’s starting position. Accept that and decide to keep moving up if you want. Lots of people are lazy and don’t climb that much from ground level anyway. You’ll be surprised how quick you start catching people. 

That’s how I think of it. Stay away from self-help gurus, but do read about areas you want to improve. Start spiritual disciplines and exercise that are about achieving goals, not just suppressing damage. You will always have some BPD background noise, but you are effectively “cured”. You can’t be cured of your humanity, but you can have more. This is the starting line!

3,"I feel this pretty hard. I think my ADHD makes it worse too, the incessant thinking. The weight of thoughts is always around. I devote too much of my time to thinking and not enough to experiencing.
Psychologists also seem to be really interested in me, but it took someone with really incredible and well rounded knowledge to treat me and help me a few years back, she was incredible. That was probably when I was the most effective, honestly.

Those difficult feelings won't go away, they're still intrinsic for self protection and you can really only make them quieter and easier to control. It's like scraping your knee vs breaking your leg, you need to know they both are happening and you need to respond appropriately. But if scraping your knee feels like breaking your leg, we need some adjustment.
 
I don't really know if there is a cure for disorders per say, but maybe more so an ability to overcome those feelings and be functional in the way you desire to be functional. (Job, relationships, education, chores, responsibilities, etc.

DBT is talked about a lot here and it works for a lot, but have you learned much about CBT? Controlling and limiting the distortions of your own perception of reality? There are a lot of psychological traps we fall into and I see a lot here in your writing, of course I'm not judging or critiquing you, just wanted to explain why I asked.


Here's a short list of distortions I found and a little bit about them and how to catch them.

When covid hit my therapist got sent to another location and no way Im telling all that trauma again, anyway: now I am not in therapy and feel almost on my lowest, I still have a psych so it definitely helps.

The therapists I have been to just always seem to think because my life is put together I am not that bad, so I am just too sensitive or emotional.  It isn’t untrue, I am sensitive and emotional.  However, I want to get to a better point where I do not have to put on a show to make everyone around me not have to deal with me (if that makes sense).  I am guessing I am needing someone who specializes in dealing with Bpd.  I live in a smaller town now and I don’t think all therapists are that familiar or know how to deal with it.

i also think sometimes I unknowingly charm the therapist because I want to be in everyone’s good graces.  They always act like they don’t understand why I am in therapy, my life is good, I am smart, funny, and doing very well.

It is so strange how almost every therapist I have had interacts with me.  They are normally very complimentary and act like I am a great person.

So, I learned to be extremely cautious around all human beings. Carefully observing them first and making slight changes to my personality in order to avoid conflict. 

But I'm unable to do this with a group infront of me, especially if their attention is on me. I'm unable to make my ""observations & calculations"" to more than one person at a time, while at the same time presenting a personality that I'm not confident is agreeable to them.

0,"I was diagnosed with BPD as a teen, my parents weren't quite understanding of what was going on, and I'm no expert, but I hope what I have helps

The biggest thing to remember is BPD people sorta lack the ""emotional skin"", everything can be quite sensitive to her, happiness to you is ecstatic excitement for her. Sadness for you is depression for her, etc. These emotions can also swing rather quickly. Even though it can come off as dramatic and superficial, these are all *very* real to her. Be supportive and validating, never dismissive.

I often found it hard to communicate my emotions, I would consider finding a simple way to communicate mood. Something that can just take a second, like maybe a simple color system. Or even more simple, one I've seen is simply a bracelet that this person wears whenever they are feeling down and need TLC. 

Of course your mental health is important too! You will need to be there for her. Maybe often. Don't overstretch yourself helping her though. You should also discuss boundaries. And remember boundaries are a two way street. I don't know if this applies to others but I always felt trapped growing up, feeling like nothing I want matters. While being a parent is the most most important thing, let her have her privacy when she needs it, keep her safe but let her have her freedom. Sort of how you would treat a friend :)

Lastly, bad things will happen. Even if you do everything right, she could still run into breakdowns, splitting, risky behaviors, etc. Be there to help her process her emotions. Don't leave her alone when she needs you the most. Make sure she's safe.

I hope some of this helps. This is really only advice from my prior experiences. As you said, unconditional love is important. She can be *very* sensitive to tone of voice, how things are worded, what *isnt* said, etc. Keep that in mind. You can find many resources online, and the biggest resource you can find is a *good* therapist. There are bad therapists out there, make sure the one she has not only can handle BPD, but also that your daughter feels comfortable with her. If she thinks something is wrong, don't dismiss it.

My DMs are open if you have any more questions, feel free to ask :)",T_Sophie_0621,1bvmoom

I’ve also been thinking about starting a two-way journal where I can just write affirmations, discuss questions, or hear from her.

3,Thank you! Wonderful idea. I think it can only help and I will do that! I’m willing to put in the work and make the time to go. Both my husband and I are. I feel like that would help me understand my tendencies or knee-jerk reactions that aren’t helpful.,thatavacadoh,1bvmoom
0,"At the end of the day, as long as your spouse focuses on treating the symptoms, I would worry less about the actual diagnosis, and more about supporting the treatment. ADHD and BPD present very similarly, and many people have both. As long as your spouse is honest about the symptoms and doesn’t try to sway them to not fit a BPD diagnosis, focusing on treatment of symptoms is the most important thing.

It can be a really scary label and there is a lot of stigma. ADHD is a lot less scary. If they are willing to go to therapy and treat the same symptoms, it shouldn’t matter. Of course having an accurate diagnosis is ideal, but if they are pushing back so hard against the BPD diagnosis, you don’t want to scare them off therapy entirely. I think eventually, as they go through therapy, the diagnosis will become clearer and they will become more comfortable with it.

To side a little bit with the therapists…and this is my opinion only. A therapist who has the knowledge of BPD and ADHD and also has the benefit of weekly sessions with your spouse, they may have a better understanding of their diagnosis than psychiatrists who don’t know your spouse as well.

I don’t know exactly what your spouse’s symptoms are, but in my experience, the main separator of the two is with BPD there is a massive focus on a fear of abandonment and a lack of identity. ADHD won’t have that. 

With BPD the main treatment is going to be therapy. With ADHD it’s often medication, but can be therapy as well. As long as he goes through therapy, the medication management can go hand in hand, and they’ll figure out what works best along the way.

I hope that helped a bit. Good luck.",,16rfxfx
1,"Thanks for your thoughts - agree that remaining committed to therapy is the best thing that can happen, long term. 
I’m no psychiatrist but as someone who has been married to this person for 13 years, I would tend to agree with the psychiatrist’s assessment - the mood swings are unpredictable and can be intense, going from (seemingly) perfectly content to moody & depressed or irritated, the lack of trust in everyone (even their parents) is baffling because there have been no instances where trust was actually called into question, and their are questions (in their more vulnerable moments) where I’m asked if I’m going to leave, want to leave, why I stay, etc. 
My spouse also has difficulty taking responsibility for anything that goes wrong in the relationship that was a direct result of their behavior. At times, I feel like I’m being gaslighted by them. 
They’re working on themselves, but living with them can be very emotionally volatile, which is difficult for me as a person that just wants to live a contented, calm life with my spouse where we both can lean on each other.
My partner is very much into holistic therapy and the mind body connection in therapy and I feel is somewhat resistant to traditional medicine and therapists that really challenge them. They don’t like to be uncomfortable and the therapists they seek are those that also believe that traditional medicine is not the answer. As their spouse, I want solutions - and I’m fearful these therapists are going to “mind and body” my partner right out of a legitimate diagnosis. I think the work they’re doing has value, but so does a clinical assessment based on the perspectives of both my spouse AND the people that live with/observe them.",Prod_Broad,16rfxfx
2,"I see. Maybe given your spouse’s new diagnosis (whether it’s BPD, ADHD, or something else like ASD), you can convince them to see a more specialized therapist, and not a “mind-body” holistic one. They can continue seeing that one too, but these issues really benefit from DBT or schema or CBT therapy to really focus on the behavior and the emotional regulation. You need someone who is capable of high-level, specialized therapy.

And I agree you should continue to see the psychiatrists. Maybe suggest getting a third or fourth opinion if your spouse is so reticent to these current opinions? And until then just try to get him to a real therapist.

With regard to medication, there’s a long list that are used to treat BPD, none specifically for BPD. But a psychiatrist will look at antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and others. ADHD is more often treated with stimulants, but there are a lot of new medications as well. Some antidepressants are used also.

I hope everything works out.",,16rfxfx

When cooler heads prevails then you both can address the situation. You can also use a third party (counseling or trusted friend or family that can remain impartial) if it keeps becoming a problem with resolutions in a healthy way.

8,"First, I get that you believe you are scared. But do you think maybe you are just really worked up right now and you your heightened emotional state is transpiring as fear. I get that it can be hurtful when someone gets upset at you and we are very often confused about what to do next. Perhaps you need a little time to calm down as well so you can process what happened. 

That being said, is your boyfriend a self-aware BPD? Is he diagnosed? I would suggest you two have a talk about what can be done the next time he is angry. All of us get triggered by something and feel an overwhelming emotion, but many of us are able to kindly tell ourselves ""I am full of rage, but I need to STOP and Check the Facts"". Maybe it would be worth sharing some Dialectical Behavioural Therapy with him! The emotions that we feel are never wrong, but we all have a responsibility to make sure that we treat others with respect while dealing with them. This is a huge problem with BPD as we usually experience rage when we are hurting. 

Another good question to ask here is, what is he doing about BPD? Does he have it and not work on it? You will also have to check with yourself whether or not you want to be with someone who is unwilling to put time into making their life better.

4,"Yup, that's something I forgot to mention in my post: the weight gain aspect. I've been trying to lose weight and it would **devastate** me to gain weight, especially a large amount. I'd completely give up and never try again, because honestly I see the world in black and white so much that if I fuck something up I'll just be like ""cool fuck this I'm useless.""

I have multiple mental illnesses on top of BPD so it's hard having to be on so many meds for different things. I've tried Prozac but it caused extreme increases in anxiety and panic attacks multiple times a day, it was a miserable time. My mental illnesses have all been labeled ""treatment resistant"" and I don't really even know what that means, if any meds would actually help long term or if it's a nicer way for professionals to tell me ""lol you're fucked, you're gonna be miserable all your life so good luck with that"" in which case I'm not even sure why they're bothering with meds if they know nothing will help.

I've heard that antipsychotics are risky. Tbh I would love a medication to numb me completely or at least blunt my emotions, I'd do anything to get rid of my emotions even if that means sacrificing the positive ones, if that makes any sense. So the side effect of it making people emotionless is rather appealing to me, though the other side effects definitely aren't. I've heard of permanent side effects that I don't want. I've considered ECT, TMS, etc but it's hard thinking that there's no way to know whether it's gonna be the best or worst decision. Same with antipsychotics. Idk what to do honestly.

With mood stabilizers, it brought my 11’s down to 7’s and 8’s and brought my 0’s up to 3’s and 4’s. Obviously 3’s and 4’s are better than 0’s, haha. And while “less” happiness might seem like a downside, I’m now able to actually be present when I’m happy! 

I cried the first time I saw my favorite band in concert while on mood stabilizers, because I realized every other time I’d see them, I was so deliriously happy that I was just… Not There. And now I can actually enjoy the concert and be immersed in the experience. 

I was also really scared about being “numb”, and if she doesn’t like it, she can always stop and her emotions will go back to the way they were before the medication!",Raunchey,ypxhu2
1,"Everyone has different side effects for meds. Usually meds can take months to actually work so unless she tries then she shouldn’t cut out meds completely. Technically she isn’t a Guinea pig since these meds have been tested before in other people who were in fact the Guinea pigs. 

BPD can be manageable but it depends on the person, also, she would need counseling and ongoing services along with the meds to get the full effect and help she needs.",PainBri315,ypxhu2
2,"Meds shouldn’t  stop her feeling, just make her feel in more control. For if they make feel numb or out of it, then they are not the right ones for the person. No one can say how medication will affect them until they are tried, if the side effects are too much, maybe something else will help.

As other post said med are only part of the support, therapies are important too.

A way to possible approach it, is to say understand her fears, but you see how much the BPD affecting her and you just want her feel her better about herself and not feels negative whatever she feels. Suggest getting clear information about what medications which is suggested, help her to get clear information about the potential issues. 

I think if she is really doesn’t wish to take medication, then discuss and explore if there are options or therapies that could help. I think try not to see it either or way only, BPD can be approached in many ways and combined could work for her.",Possible_Laugh_9139,ypxhu2

4,I have experience numbness with some meds but not all! Personally a low dose antidepressant and a mood stabilizer help me the most in terms of numbness. I’m not completely zoned out either which is nice. I still feel things now but my brain has time to catch up to what I’m feeling instead of trying to zoom with the emotion impact,waterrrmallon,ypxhu2
5,"She won't know until she tries. Being anxious beforehand is understandable though, but maybe remind her that it can help you feel more stable and happier! She needs to make this decision on her own though.",,ypxhu2
6,Meds depends on the person. It didn't work for me but I tried it out for around 2 years. It also depends on what antipsychotics can have pretty bad physical side effects like weight gain others more mental. But you never know until you've tried. It's basically not an experiment for the doctor but for the person taking the medication to see how well it works with them. Just be very mindful of what side effects are going on and express the concerns. If the psychiatrist shuts them down probably best to see another one. I got into really bad shape because a psychiatrist didn't think my symptoms where medication side effects now my entire digestive system is fucked because I was talking so many meds and the combination sent me into psychosis. Like mood stabilizers you may need regular blood tests so bare that in mind although I've only heard of that for lithium and carbamazapine. Advise her to keep a record of how she's been feeling physically/mentally before and while on the medication to check for any bad side effects.,,ypxhu2

8,Literally everything you said. I struggled with mood stabilizers for a while because I felt “numb” but eventually came to realize I was actually just experiencing emotions closer to how a “normal” person would.

0,"I'm bipolar 1, have been for 16 long years. I've also been diagnosed with C-PTSD which has tons and tons of overlap with BPD.

Olanzapine saved my life. I was in a severe manic episode that I had to put myself in the psych ward to handle. They put me on it. I gained 40lb(18kg) in 4 weeks. I would do it again, like I said, I am pretty sure I would have killed myself or someone else, either my partner at the time or like a van full of little kids in a car accident. It would have been dangerous for me to not take it. But obviously the weight gain was a serious problem and not a great solution.

I've been on quetiapine, at all sorts of doses. At 300mg I was a zombie and couldn't wake up on time for work. I was close to being fired for it, so I had to come off it. That was many years ago. More recently I was put on 25mg for sleep and that worked amazing for a while. Then shit hit the fan in my life, everything changed all at once and I could not fucking handle it at all. I went up to 50mg to sleep and then 100mg during the day to take as needed for anxiety. Except some of those days I needed 200-300mg to get through the day. I gained 20lb(9kg) in 3 weeks, that was in April. I'm still using about 150mg now just to sleep, nothing during the day. I haven't gained any more weight. I've been trying to lose weight but I've not been successful yet because I am motherfucking starving in the morning. Finally these last few days I've managed to force myself to wait until 1pm to eat. I don't eat after 7pm.

I've been on ziprasidone, another antipsychotic, for like two years now. It helped with depression at the time, I'm coming off it now because it's no longer doing jack shit. Didn't cause any weight gain.

My honest suggestion, no matter your diagnosis, if you're dealing with mood swings is a mood stabilizer like lamotrigine or lithium. Lithium got rid of my suicidal thoughts after two doses of 300mg each. I now take 600mg. It's worth talking to your doctor about, for so so so many people lithium gives you your life back. Just be sure it's a low dose, 900mg or less, otherwise you might have freaky side effects.",,iz5bsm

I know it works because although I still feel sad, I can manage daily tasks, actually get out of bed. Also when I go off of it thinking I’m better, I ultimately crash into a horrible depression.

I’ve been on buspirone for anxiety just over a year, this  helped me a lot, I didn’t feel like I couldn’t breathe anymore. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn’t like communicate my thoughts or feelings because I didn’t understand them. I couldn’t speak because I was so in my head about people judging me. I have had to up my dose since I started but I feel better since then.

I started taking lamotrigine for mood swings about six weeks ago. My moods were so out of control, it was getting to be too exhausting so yeah. For the first two weeks I was really irritable but is was obviously a side affect, that has stopped and I am feeling a little more stable. 

Just because these work for me doesn’t mean they will work for you. When you start something new, take note about how you are feeling everyday. Don’t be quick to stop taking them, give it 4 weeks at least. It is not good especially for BPD to be changing medication frequently. 

I know how scared you feel right now, but you will feel better with the right medication. This is a life long battle and you may have to switch meds throughout your life. That’s something tough we all have to come to terms with. The most important thing is that you feel okay.",t_monster13,k8ra1g

0,"I'm not going to even try to diagnose you. But I will tell you this: If you are unhappy with ANY health professional, physical or psychological, you ABSOLUTELY have the right to get a second, third, fourth ... opinion. They don't have to live your life, but their profession should assist you to navigate it effectively. You've got to take care of yourself.

Don't get too hung up on Google because there are a few different illnesses, even medical, that manifest symptoms similar to BPD. But I also wouldn't tell you not to come to your appointments armed with knowledge so you're informed on the facts and how they relate, or don't, to your personal experience.

Best thing to do is ask your psychiatrist to listen to your concerns before making any moves. Unfortunately, BPD isn't much more than a label. It's not easy to effectively treat BPD with medication alone. However, getting an appropriate diagnosis will help navigate you in the right direction as to what course of treatment/therapy will help you as an individual.

0,Based on my own experience- Wellbutrin is good for energy it will get you moving and out of a black hole. However it did increase my anxiety and I  couldn't sleep. I found that the most stable meds for me to be on were Viibrid and Lithium. An antidepressant plus mood stabilizer. So if you want to try Wellbutrin first and see how you do for a couple weeks and maybe add an anxiety med or mood stabilizer to help with it only if you need. I just couldn't do the Wellbutrin anymore because I couldn't sleep but I will always go back to it for severe depression and fatigue. The drugs I'm on right now are maintaining very well. Just my opinion if any of this helps you.  Give it a try!,,w29xoc

It's a mood stabilizer and I noticed times when I would otherwise be anxious and upset and with the medicine, my body would just be chill and roll with it.

LamoTRIgine almost completely got rid of it and it leaves me with enough mental energy to solve my remaining issues.

Deciding what to eat was too much so I didn't. I didn't know what clothes to wear. All sorts of things and I think moving and the decisions around financial struggles require a LOT of decisions add into that a breakup and of course you are struggling. 

Why did you stop taking your meds? I know that if I stopped I would crumble inside of a year. Only you can make the decision but if meds can help, let them. As for your pain, staying in bed is actually pretty bad for your body. Especially if you are kind of living there. I get what I jokingly call ""Depression back"" if I stay in bed too long and end up in a lot more pain than usual. If you can sit other places during the day try to. At least get up and walk around your place, do some stretches, and allow your body a break from the pressure being in bed puts on it. I hate saying it because I know sometimes it isn't possible, but maybe take a walk outside if you can. When I was in program they taught us the acronym MEDS. Medication, Exercise, Diet, Sleep. Those are the key things to keeping your health in order.

1,"Hey! 
I must say, if the thought of going back to medication accurs more often, it wouldn't be a bad idea to discuss this with a professional or an expert. Even though it is hard to go back to something you thought you didn’t need anymore, there sure are some indicators that that might help, especially if you thought about it a few times already. Also, I can totally relate to the relationship struggle you described; I am going trough a break up from a serious relationship aswell and it is really hard to function, you know, just living. However, I realised that I don't necessarily function „better“ when I feel like I am needed/ in a relationship: that isn't the issue. The big issue I am working on (also in therapy) is that I can't be by myself. I can't be alone. I want to f e e l loved and needed and appreciated but I came to the conclusion that nothing will bring me more foreward in life than to actually be enough for myself and being happy by myself. Once you are okay with being alone, functioning alone and living a good life alone; that is when I noticed that I was getting better and became happier. I don't know if that helps, but maybe try to discuss that in therapy. Also, since you mentioned you struggled financially: I don't know where you live (not that I need to know) but there are actually loads of helplines or organisations, helping people with mental ilnesses financially and in general. At least in the country where I am from, I get help financially from the state monthly. 

You are going through a hard time right now and it is okay to struggle. Don't be so hard on yourself if you don’t make the progress you want to make. Take your time. You are not alone and you can get through this.

0,"Its hard right now. It is ok that you are not ok right now.

Try to give yourself space from those around you, focus on you only.

Does your doctor offer telemedicine? If they don't or you don't have insurance, could they do a skype or zoom call?

Some people around us don't understand, and they may never fully understand how we are feeling. Especially when we ourselves don't know the full spectrum of our our own current emotions.

I have some personal coping mechanisms that my friends have told me help them in the past.

* I would give myself personal goals to get through spans of time. Usually it would be ""if I can make it the next 15 minutes, then i'll be ok"", and once I hit the goal, i'd extend a new one for a later time until I got past the overwhelming feelings. There were weeks where I lived my life in 15 to 30 minute increments because I was teetering on the edge of breaking down.
* Hold yourself accountable, but don't be hard on yourself. If you are mean or hurt someone, apologize but don't keep doing so. Being over apologetic can also feel ingenuine to some.
* I sometimes find myself getting stuck in a weird rotation of ""I can't believe I said/did that. I totally pissed them off / embarrassed myself / hurt their feelings."". Usually they are events where in the moment I may not have realized something that I said could have been seen as mean or dumb. I tell myself ""I can't change what I did, it is in the past and I have to accept that. I can make the next experience better.""

By all means these are not all options, but it helps. If those don't work, try to find something that does. You can even make it up as you go.

Also to add, you are not alone in this. I always felt like no one got how I felt until this subreddit. Feel free to DM me if you need to talk as well. I can be a pretty distant creature of habit, but I will always make time for someone in need.",throwaway1066314,gx9e8h

0,"My previous therapist didn't want to label anything either. I'm not sure if my psych office has an official label either. We did a couple questionnaires and went from there. I suit the criteria for both BPD and bipolar, but lean towards BPD more. We just started me on a mood medicine and waited to see how it affected me. (It affected me positively.) 

I struggle with wanting to be in a box and have a label. Partly because of my lack of self-identity (which is a BPD thing) and wanting a concrete reason for the way I am. 

But psychiatric disabilities/mental disorders & illness aren't like cancer. It's a spectrum, just like ASD (I am also autistic with ADHD). I've tried to focus on that aspect. Here's where I'm at the spectrum, and I don't need a definitive label. That won't change anything. 

Even in the future, your docs/therapists will look at your medication record, ask about what you've been diagnosed with or what issue you're taking certain medicine for, and then never really think about it again.

There is also a negative stereotype associated with BPD patients. BPD can be very hard to treat because we have such intense mood swings, have a split mentality and dissociate a lot (like, I start therapy because I want to get better, but I start splitting about myself on therapy days so I skip them and then I'm not really helping myself or my therapist). There's a track record of people with BPD not really committing to therapy/medication, etc. 

So they could be trying to avoid associating you fully with that stereotype in the future to prevent any issues with you getting medical care. But, tbh, if a new doc/therapist acts different after learning about your BPD, you should leave them and go somewhere else.",skyehobbit,wypb96

Yes. My plan is 6 parts of recovery based on implementing an Emotional Management Plan, a Self-Care Regiment, education/awareness building, and Coping Skills all partnered with CBT AND DBT. 

The core goal is to utilize these 6 plans to locate, recover, and bring out a person's Voice and helping them restore their name. 

Invalidation is the core of ALL mental illness which is the process of Losing your identity taken by abusers/bullies by suppressing our voices, taking our names, giving us labels in place of our names, and making us fear our own voices.

My program restores the voice and name to a person so  they find their identity again. Voice + Name = Identity. Abuse takes these things away from us and mental illness is just all The different ways/categories we cope with this invalidation.

That's the very condensed version of this.

And I have to reiterate, this is (hopefully) IN ADDITION to therapy. Not in place of... But it CAN be Utilized for people who are on a waiting list to meet a therapist, don't have the money and expense to get a therapist, lack the facilities or resources in their area, have been labelled ""not urgent"" enough to need a therapist and therefore were denied care.

Life goes on whether we make ourselves participate or not, and I wish I had tried to do anything I could to make myself feel better instead of wasting my life the way that I did. 

I had to get proper medication. Once I did that I could do other things. Got a part time job, got my car fixed, started driving again. My animals are my life. I have cats and dogs that I talk to all the time. 

Life still isn’t perfect I have bad days still. I have days where I hate myself and wish I was dead, but I have good times too talking to my animals, caring for them, playing with them. It really helps. 

They don’t care what I look like, or if I say the wrong thing. All they care about is food, water, play and love. 
I urge you to speak to your family about how your feeling. Lots of therapists and psychiatrists work on a sliding scale, and many psych meds are pretty cheap, even in the United States where prescription drug prices are the highest in the world. 

The next time they tell you your wasting your life, try telling them why, tell them you need their help. You’re very young. There is a lot of life left to live and it’s much easier to pick up the pieces at your age then at the age that I did.

24,Sometimes I actually have to cry some stuff out before I can relax enough to meditate.  That’s you moving some of that energy out that’s been stuck that you don’t need there.

25,"I’m sorry to hear that you haven’t been taken seriously in the past. Surely it is worse for you, and by extension your family to not get the treatment that you need. Try taking a walk until your mind feels clear, it’s overwhelming at first, but all you have to do is put one foot in front of the other, keep telling yourself that until you have some distance behind you. Walk until you’re tired and feel some relief, then maybe try coming home and talking to them again. 

This is just a general idea as any form of exercise can help you clear your mind and make more sense of things. It really is a good idea to be very clear and honest with your family about needing help. I read somewhere that people are more likely to help someone if they use the word help. 

I know families can be difficult- hard to reach out to and it can be scary to put yourself out there like that, but I think you owe it to yourself to try again. If all else fails an emergency room visit could help, you could tell them that you feel your life is at risk if you don’t get treatment (that’s not a lie) If you do that, you’ll at least have a doctor to speak with and some type of medication to try, but please take this route as last resort, as mental health treatment can be downright shitty no matter where you are, some people feel worse for awhile after going through the mental health care system,but still you have to try something, you wrote what you wrote as a cry for help. 

There’s this quote I try to remember and live by, it goes “if you always do what you’ve always done, then you’ll always get what you’ve always got”. We can see that to be true, as you’re not getting anywhere with this route so now you need to do whatever you have to do to get the help you need and deserve. 

Life didn’t start making any sense to me until I was older (the human brain isn’t finished developing until around age 25, and if you have a mental illness, your growth is often stunted by that, not your fault at all, just want you to know that.) it’s actually really good news, because it means that your brain is more open to change and not so set in its ways, and healing can be faster and easier for you at this age. 

I hope you come back to this post too, probably will take some months, sometimes it takes years, but I hope you come back too and feel you’ve gotten your life and self back to an extent that life is tolerable- even enjoyable again for you.

29,"That does make so much sense, and sometimes when I feel like going forward I just feel stuck. It's so hard and I think what is making things worse is the fact that I have to kind of ""digest"" that my family is not going to support me as much as I thought. Probably my mistake for having expectations, also to realise and reflect on the amount of traumas and fears I have and how that keeps me tied up from being the healthy person I've always wanted to be and also being stuck in a relationship that doesn't make my mental health better, my economy is on the floor, my self esteem and everything is just so much that I don't know where else to start. I need to go through a breakup and fight all of this at the same time.

Believe me, I'm terrified to wake up tomorrow to the same thing and to being so unproductive as always, and I'm scared to try to do the smallest thing and fail. I like what you say about life not making sense at 24, explains how I can feel so lost as I never been taught what love is or even self love. So taking care of myself has me completely lost, while people just call me immature because of that (family).

I've tried the hospital thing as well, since I can't afford private, I go to public services and they say they don't ""have resources for people with true problems, let alone people that just want somw vacations"" word for word, that's what I've been told there. System here sucks. I admire other countries for that. Spoke to my family as well, the psychologist I used to have as well, and they just said ""We all have problems"". So, seriously, all this situation sounds just incredible, I know. But, no wonder why I can feel so desperate talking to anonymous people.

I don't have many dreams, but my biggest one is to not be scared to be myself and do something for myself. I appreciate so much all you say, and try to always remember this.",bpdlifestyleaf,y38g3d

0,"My sister is disabled by BPD and says CBD and cannabis strains high in CBD are amongst the safest and most helpful medications for her.

Antidepressants made her suicidal and mood stabilizers as well as antipsychotics made her worse and some had scary side effects.

She got a Ph.D in science from a top school while using cannabis daily. It is a godsend for her and the least risky of the medications she's been prescribed over the years by far.

As her sister, I can report that she is calmer, nicer and far less harsh when using CBD and THC products. Harder drugs as well as powerful psychotropic pharmaceuticals had no effects or negative effects but cannabis is invaluable in a crisis.

That said, it seems prudent to limit any kind of substance use in people who are not yet mature and whose brains are still developing including pharmaceuticals but in severe cases it may be unavoidable for some of us.

1,"It’s known as disassociation and is one of the typical indicators of BPD. Feels like you are watching a scene unfold in front of you, but you are not actually there mentally. If you are there, you almost seem to be on auto-pilot and have little control over verbal responses and body actions. It is definitely an escape mechanism against trauma (present or past trauma, it doesn’t really matter to your brain).

I am going to suggest you strongly consider finding a psychiatrist who you ‘click’ with a bit better. I’ve had bad ones (who just want to write out prescriptions) and I’ve had good ones who try and nurture and care for their patient more holistically. Both can treat you, but obviously the supportive ones make the whole process a little more “pleasant”. 

When I was younger, most doctors were dismissive of my questions - I even had the one who kept referring to me as a ‘drug addict’ because I thought I was being mature by telling her about my recreational drug use (I was 20, was mostly just smoking weed, and it seemed like ‘open cards’ was the best approach to a transparent relationship, big mistake). Being with a doctor like this is not good for your mental health in the long term. 

The last thing a person with BPD needs is a carer who is dismissive of their legitimate concerns - and I’d recommend seeking a different doctor for this reason alone. 

It’s not spoken about enough, but there is such a thing as “fit” between doctor and patient. I think for mental health support and treatment the fit is as important as the medication, and the circumstances and environment the person themselves is in. There is **nothing** wrong with seeking out a better relationship with a different doctor - it’s not a reflection of you, or of the doctor - sometimes we just don’t get on well with certain personalities. 

Obviously you also have to ensure that you continue with your prescription, and that you schedule an appointment with the new doctor so that you obtain a new prescription from them before your existing medication runs out. Don’t mess around with these kinds of meds - even missing a single dose of certain medicines can throw you into trouble.

Yes its my first therapy and im using fevarin as an antideppressant and misar for sleep and my panic attacks or mental breakdowns idk how to explain it. I was taking them 1 whole month and then stopped cuz my mum took them away from me. The pills make me quite sleepy and I have stomach problems after them. My mom said that I felt better just because of my state of mind but even though I took them i still had daily ups and downs in one day.",MlakaVoda,gemwoi
0,"One method I use is to listen to music that follows my mood to a degree, at times it can trigger me, but the more I listen the more I get lost in the meaning rather then the words themselves

Have a couple different playlists, one has a mix of upbeat and slightly oof-in-the-feels, and another that is mostly slightly oof-in-the-feels. It helps distract me long enough to either calm down or switch my mind set.

BUT be mindful of your triggers is all I can recommend in this case",DementedPoet,cuw424

0,"I took lots and lots of antidepressants, none of them did anything for me.

I take pregabalin which really helps with anxiety, helped me so much. I also take an antipsychotic, which did make me gain a lot of weight. I don't know what it really does for me mentally but it lets me get to sleep which I could never do before. Every night my head hit the pillow I'd have an anxiety attack. I tried to come off it this year and it was intense agony for a month. I wouldn't go near it unless you had to.

I'll also take a tiny amount of LSD if I really need to get stuff done. I can get more done in a day than I can in a week with that. Not being productive makes me feel worthless and sets me off, so I'm counting it as medication. ",notoriousLSD,9b9qyg

5,"Thank you for your reply. You are very right, talking does help. Always. The thing for me is, I've been struggling for more than half of my life now and whenever it's getting a little bit better I'm like all over the fucking place telling everyone how good I'm doing and I'm going to change myself, my image of who I am, basically my whole life will change for good now. Eh, u know the game. A day or two later I'm back in my hole of dirt going nuts about everything. In fear of disappointing others, friends family and also my therapist I play the happy role and pretend everything is still super amazing for me. I know I should be honest to those around me who actually care and lying to my therapist won't get me anywhere but even into deeper. But being real about myself and my struggles is really really hard. Maybe it's because I'm scared of telling others the truth about me because in scared they might turn away one day because all these ups and downs are so hard to take... I don't know. Honesty is something I've never been good at... However still thank you so much for your reply. <3 and the food thing is a whole other story, but I'm trying to go vegan and let myself eat more regularly and healthy... ",Maddiesin,9b9qyg

1,"I'm gonna be totally honest with you here OP, you sound like a wonderful person and an incredible partner. You are doing everything you need to be doing to have a healthy relationship. 

As a fully grown adult, his mismanagement of his disorder is his responsibility - not yours. He is not your child. You don't have to make excuses or special exceptions for his emotionally abusive behaviour. He needs professional help and he needs to be going out of his way to seek this. This is help far beyond what you are capable of giving him. 

The most important thing is, you are protecting your needs and mental health. There is absolutely no shame in not wanting to tolerate this behaviour anymore. You shouldn't be a scapegoat for his behaviour just because he's not in an emotionally healthy enough place to be in a relationship. It's ok to walk away if you don't want to continually be emotionally abused.",Low-Implement-1637,1auin28

Do you know whats making it difficult to take your meds (forgetting? Self-sabotage?)?

What strategies to calm down have you tried before?",Awesomesauce250,ym84w1
1,"It’s kinda both with my meds because even when I set alarms, I kind of just put it off I don’t go take them. And nothings really helped with the calming down the only time is  when my boyfriends home and he’ll breathe with me but the biggest problem is when no one is with me that I seem to not be able to find anything to calm me down even music or anything.",Aggressive-Guide-787,ym84w1
2,"Hmm, could you carry your meds (or at least 1 dose) in your pocket? That way you can take them when the alarm goes off without having to stop what youre doing. 

For calming down theres all the dbt distress tolerance skills. TIPP is particularly good imo (especially if you do all the letters right after each other). Maybe you could also ask your boyfriend to make a recording for you where he breathes with you? It could say whatever you think youll need to hear (eg. ""I care about you"" ""im not leaving you"" ""ill be home soon you can do this"") and then guide you through breathing. Might help you remember he cares and loves you even when he cant be right there.",Awesomesauce250,ym84w1
3,"The problem with running my meds in my pocket is I have a tendency to lose absolutely everything I can have it in my hand one second and then it’s gone so now I have like a bag to put all my medicine in so I don’t lose any of them. 

But thank you for suggestions on calming down they are something I will definitely have to try ☺️",Aggressive-Guide-787,ym84w1

0,"I can say that I felt better med-free during pregnancy than I ever did while not pregnant. Something about the switch in hormones definitely made me more ragey as far as feeling my blood boil much quicker, but it was all very much mother bear instinct stuff and I really liked my emotional state for most of my pregnancies to be honest. 

I won’t say it was a walk in the park haha, but my borderline symptoms greatly decreased during my pregnancies as I focused more on the future I was setting up for my little ones and I. 

I felt like being free of all medications was pretty magical because our hormones are really something else while we are pregnant, and being able to be that tuned into your body without all the drugs blocking natural stuff’s might not be as fulfilling an experience. 

Obviously that’s just my perspective and I’m sure many others wouldn’t feel that way. 

I always liked feeling my intense emotions and have chosen to remain med-free now despite my crippling anxiety and sometimes really overwhelming depression, so I guess that’s something to consider as well as far as my perspective goes :p  

I wish you the best of luck in whatever you decide, and I hope you find pregnancy and motherhood to be magical! <3

1,"When I got pregnant I had to stop my prozac. It was a very very very long 8 months (my little boy came early). I chose to stop the prozac because I figured my kid would have enough emotional issues to deal with having my Gene's and I didnt want him to have any physical problems, too. My obgyn said she could prescribe me something else (I forget what it is now) but I declined because it hadn't worked for me in the past. Maybe your obgyn can suggest a different medication for you? Good luck! I know its hard situation to be in.",MamaMcBewbs,dmpvy7

5,"im pregnant now and taking 150mg effexor xr, which doesn’t increase the risks of any birth issue or miscarrying. i dont know if after being on the same meds for 6 years you’d be up for a change, but it is an option. 

im 22 weeks and my baby is healthy and fine. i’ve spoken to several other women who took effexor while pregnant and gave birth to and successfully breastfed multiple kids.
 
edit: i do still have occasional mood swings, but they’re definitely not as bad or as frequent as being unmedicated without a therapist like i was in my first pregnancy.

also what a shitty thing for your psychiatrist to say? i would also see if you can get a midwife nurse at your hospital vs a doctor",azimmer7,dmpvy7
6,"I don’t know how helpful this is, but when I got pregnant, I was taking medicine and my obgyn actually had me speak to maternal fetal medicine specialists about the medicine I was on, what class it was, how harmful they could potentially be to my baby, and studies that have been done on the medicine and the effects it had on babies. Maybe see if that’s something you can do and go from there. That helped me make my decision on what to take and what not to take.

7,"I have 2 kids, but I've never been medicated. 
If i were you, i would stop my meds during pregnancy and go to therapy to manage the moodswings, but that's easy for me to say, because i have no idea how much you need your meds.
I just know that I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt if i caused my children something preventable. But if you need the meds to function, that makes the choice much harder, and the consequenses less preventable.

I don't know the standard treatment where you live, but here the goal is to become a functioning member of society without meds. The meds are seen as a cast for your broken leg. When the bone is healed, it's time to remove the cast and work on the muscles.
What is your goal with your meds?",,dmpvy7
8,"I had to stop my mood Sudbury l stabilizer, and under turkey under turkey by my doctor order, I got physically sick send being off my meds I was crazytown.

I cried for 2 days before they put me back on me here at the hospital. They said the mostb damage would be done during 1stv trimester but I but didn't find out I was pregnant until 2nd. Blah blah little boy is happy and healthy.

Did it help with mood swings?  I get depressive mood swings and I haven’t self harmed in a really long time so my biggest fear is not being on meds, having depressive episodes and doing self harm while being pregnant. I don’t want to be labeled as a bad mom.

11,Cleft palate is not so much more common on lamotrigine than off it and is fixable by surgery. You would have to start taking folate before you get pregnant if you decide to stay on it.  It is important to recognize that the there are risks to the fetus if you are unmedicated as well. Research suggests that maternal depression and anxiety can have long-lasting effects on the fetus/child. Think carefully about what you feel comfortable with for yourself as well as your future child and remember that neither choice (on or off meds) makes you a bad parent.,maeflowers213,dmpvy7
