Does it get better with age? or is remission and back ?

2,How many of you are avoiding being diagnosed?,"Curious as to how many lurkers there are here (I am one) that are %100 sure they have BPD, but are avoiding being officially diagnosed for one reason or another. If so, why? For me, I feel ashamed and embarrassed for having it. I’m terrified of telling people close to me, which I think is a common experience, but I’m curious about how many people here are in the same boat.

****Edited to say: I will respond to comments when I can, I usually don’t have time in the day time.

The ones who I’ve talked about this to have strongly suspected bpd, as well as gone over with me the criteria for diagnosis. I’m not trying to be one of those people who just lazily diagnoses themselves or does it to seem “cool”. Ive been on too many types of meds to count trying to find the right one as well.

5,I was diagnosed with BPD turns out I have female autism. ,"I don’t even know where to start. I found out recently I have autism, yet I still meet all the textbook requirements for bpd. My new therapist specializes in autism and she works with mainly women with autism. She told me most women she has come across with autism that get diagnosed as an adult have been falsely diagnosed with bipolar 2, or most often bpd. I found out the reason why most people diagnosed with bpd are women is because a huge % actually have female autism. Undiagnosed autistic women also played a role in the formation of the bpd diagnosis which is interesting. Medical misogyny plays a huge role in this and the lack of recourses for women with autism. Female autism looks completely different than male autism. It has been absolute hell going through this process and it’s likely there’s a lot of women in this thread that have asd that were misdiagnosed with bpd so I wanted to share my main symptoms/ issues and if you heavily relate hopefully this can give you an opportunity to look into asd. 

What helped my doctor realize : Burnout - After being social for long periods of time I would go through a lengthy period of burnout and this mirrored depression. I had sensory issues as a child, I had trouble with the way my sock seams felt, sometimes clothing, etc. Hated having my hair brushed. Picky eating - My mom told me most of my childhood I would only order mac & cheese at restaurants and I would argue with her about what she cooked if I didn’t like the texture. I was open to trying new food but I would refuse to replace my favorite meal. I grew out of this but I still have issues with texture, for example, coconut shavings or meatloaf. Special interest, these obsessions tend to be popular things which is why it’s not recognized. It can be intense and last weeks or months. For example, collecting Squishmallows. Masking was a key point as well, my therapist that diagnosed me with bpd thought my masking was mirroring. I would take traits from people around me or characters in shows to fit in and seem “normal” or to make people like me. Masking became involuntary to a certain degree at an early age but I’m still aware of it and purposely do it at times when I am socially uncomfortable. S*icidal ideation anytime I get very upset, this is common in women with autism. This is also a trait of bpd. Fear of abandonment - It was actually my fear of not being able to take care of myself or feel safe without help/ support. Strong fear of social embarrassment/ rejection. Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria is common among autistic people. There’s typically strong emotional reactions when we perceive ourselves as being rejected. Explosive anger at times - meltdowns. Feeling overwhelmed by sadness - intense emotions/ trouble regulating emotions. Intense relationships due to differences in social cognition, social interactions, and maintaining long-term. However, I did have relationships last long-term and I had big friend groups growing up. But there would always be issues. Eating disorder (common comorbidity with autism.) Disliking change unless I choose it. Favorite person- was just one ‘intense’ friend at a time which can be obsessive (common with autism). Unstable sense of self. Making lists. Self harm. Sense of emptiness this is very commonly reported among high-masking autistics. This likely is related to diffuse identity due to social masking. Experiencing a sense of emptiness during burnout or when not actively engaged in a task. Paranoia. Hallucinations (Over 40% of people with autism experience hallucinations - I rarely experience this but I have experienced auditory and slight visual hallucinations under stress/ sensory overload). Depersonalization & Derealization both can be a response to trauma; however, they can also be a response to sensory overload as the body shuts down to keep from taking in more sensory information. I often can’t consciously tell when I’m overwhelmed sensory wise. Avoidant attachment style - Autistic people are more likely to have an avoidant attachment style than people with bpd. For me this can look like ghosting people because even replying to a text can be too much (typically only during burnout.) Substance abuse. Both groups have an elevated risk of having co-occurring mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. I’ve dealt with both. Impulsivity. High masking autistic women may not struggle recognizing social cues, I don’t due to trauma I’ve been forced to learn every social queue and read body language better than most neurotypical people. Talking excessively about a select subject, even if others are not responsive. I have no problem with eye contact either, but I do think about it (which isn’t common for neurotypical people). I am very forgetful. Many women with autism experience problems with executive function, a set of skills that involves working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control. People with executive function problems might find it hard to organise themselves, finish tasks, and maintain emotional control. I have horrible insomnia this is also common with autistic people. I struggle with saying socially inappropriate things (not often) but at times my mouth can run ahead of my mind, I typically notice peoples facial expressions before I process what I said. Rewatching the same shows/ movies. Obsessively replaying social interactions in my mind, I’ve kept myself up thinking about something embarrassing I said years ago. Stimming - For me as a kid this was biting my nails or the inside of my cheek. I never walked on my toes or had flappy hands.

 I think it’s because I got admitted to the psych ward at 12, and then went back many times through the years. There’s some criteria of like 2 years of BPD symptoms. I did some psych testing thing. They were basically like “yeah no she’s fucked up. We don’t need 4 more years to figure that out”. 

I’ve just never talked to anyone who got a diagnosis younger than 18. I’m curious if I’m just real fucked up or maybe it’s just a state/district difference?

To me it never seemed bad or harmful and I’ve never met anyone that self diagnosed and then flexed it. And I only say this because I was technically self diagnosed for like a year. At 15, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder. At 19, I was re-evaluated and diagnosed with BPD. So at about 18 I kind of figured maybe that’s the right diagnoses, but I still would be like “well I have bipolar but I honestly think it’s BPD” and inevitably was diagnosed with that.

I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, poly-substance abuse disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. I think i might have BPD. I resonate strongly with the symptoms of ""quiet"" BPD, and meet all 9 criteria.


The problem is, im always halfway lying to my therapists and psychiatrists. Im terrified to tell them about self harm, and suicidal ideation, if i get institutionalized ill lose my job+insurance and im screwed. I try to tell them about self destructive behavior, and its like i say one thing and they hear another. I dont know how to get an accurate diagnosis, whatever it is, when i feel like i cant communicate my symptoms and behaviors accurately.


I guess my question is, how did you get diagnosed? Did you resonate with the symptoms first, and ask your therapist about it to get more pointed questions?

14,Newly diagnosed with BPD in 5 minutes ,"I don’t know how to feel. 

I’ve done research on BPD before and while some symptoms do overlap for me, the major ones do not. The man just asked me after my depression diagnosis, if I have mood swings, history of self harm, past trauma. I say yes to all and he says you have BPD, I’m like what the fuck?? Are MDs just handing out such a serious diagnosis like candy now? 

I don’t have a fear of abandonment or extreme  black and white thinking. I do have paranoia (not like the man even asked), history of unstable relationships, unstable sense of self, impulsive self destructive behavior (again not like he asked any of this), chronic empty feeling. But can’t most of these symptoms be chalked up to depression?

This is ridiculous! I spent months without medication waiting for an appointment with this man and this hack gives me a diagnosis in 5 minutes after 3 questions.

15,Vent about self diagnosing,"[ edit: so this got a lot more attention than I imagined wow. Thank you for all the feedback and I’m positively surprised that so much of you agree! However the amount of comments is overwhelming, so I most likely won’t reply to all. Also, this isn’t against people who can’t afford seeing a professional! I understand how very expensive therapy is. I just have a problem with people who self diagnose say they confidently, 100% have this disorder when it could be an entirely condition ] 
(I don’t want to offend or attack anyone, I’m just very frustrated with this and I want to vent. I don’t want to fight or argue with anyone. I’m curious as well if I’m alone with this or if anyone else can relate)

I sometimes get so irrationally triggered and angry at self diagnosis, especially with young people, and it’s even worse when people ask for diagnosis on the internet. People can’t diagnose themselves, most are incorrect. Some people are correct with their assumptions, I’m not saying that’s completely unheard of. But if someone thinks they have it, they should go to a professional with their concern instead of claiming to actually have it. Only people who went to school to learn about this in great detail and who have experience in psychology/psychiatry are qualified to diagnose anyone. I don’t want to say that people who self diagnose are completely healthy, if you think you have a disorder because you’re very unwell, then you probably do. But one can’t say what their disorder correctly is by themselves, people often misdiagnose themselves

If you wouldn’t self diagnose yourself with schizophrenia because of how serious that it then you shouldn’t do it with BPD either. Borderline is a severe and very serious illness where some parts of the brain not develop properly or makes them malfunction which is caused by some sort of childhood trauma when the brain is developing the most. And the issue with teenagers diagnosing themselves is that BPD shouldn’t be diagnosed until someone is at least a legal adult, but ideally when someone is in their 20’s as the brain develops until then and most teens with borderline symptoms and characteristics grow out of it until that point

And I don’t think most people realize how awfully complex BPD is. It isn’t just the vague 9 symptoms Google lists for diagnosis criteria, it’s more than that. I think a lot of people who self diagnose confuse it with GAD or depression as those are symptoms of BPD, but not exclusive to it. Borderline is a very confusing mixture of symptoms and mannerisms that aren’t all exclusive to it. A lot of times even professionals misdiagnose it and if they sometimes have issues with it because it’s hard to diagnose, then people who just read up on it on Google and take online quizzes will have a lot more issues with figuring a diagnosis for it out. And the thing is, these characteristics are in everyone, but the difference between pw/oBPD and pwBPD is the severity of them

Around 80% of people with BPD have suicidal thoughts and tendencies, 10% actually commit suicide. This isn’t a game, it isn’t a trend, it shouldn’t be romanticized or taken lightly because it’s absolute hell that ruins people’s lives

I don’t support self diagnosing with any other mental illness, not just with BPD. People can have concerns and assumptions, but only a professional can give them an accurate diagnosis. Lately I think there has been a growing issue with this and I hope there was a way to normalize having mental illnesses (as opposed to being shunned, demonized and not being taken seriously for having one) without encouraging self diagnosis",1610288538.0,False,213,230,patexie,None,kuf9ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/kuf9ni/vent_about_self_diagnosing/
16,Stop Self Diagnosing,"I don’t mean that you shouldn’t evaluate yourself for BPD before seeing a mental health professional, it’s okay to suspect you may have it. AS LONG AS you get a professional dx before spreading the word that you have BPD. 

Also, just in case anyone isn’t aware of this fact, BPD is NOT an excuse for toxic behavior. It is an explanation but it absolutely does not give anyone the right to treat other people poorly. If you get assessed for BPD and don’t meet the criteria, don’t keep seeing different doctors until someone agrees with you. A second opinion, maybe, but taking the assessment over and over until you get your desired outcome? 

Why?

If the answer is so you can be “on trend” or refuse to cease toxic behaviors, you’re contributing to a stigma that WILL STILL BE AROUND WHEN BPD IS NOT TRENDY ANYMORE. People with properly diagnosed BPD will have to deal with the fallout. 

BPD has a 10% suicide rate, that is VERY high. Self dx-ers and people who try to fabricate their assessment to get the diagnosis they want don’t seem particularly interested in real recovery, which means that many rare BPD recovery programs could fill up with people who don’t need the treatment and will likely not take it seriously, let alone benefit from it like someone with an official diagnosis.

Is this a histrionic personality disorder phenomenon? That would make sense, as the defining trait of HPD is attention seeking.

Regardless, just stop. The amount of BPD hate is increasing by the day. Get seen or admit to yourself that you’re not “trendy” enough to have what is widely considered the most painful mental illness in existence.",1660177571.0,False,103,136,DefiantKnowledge1303,None,wldd1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/wldd1y/stop_self_diagnosing/

18,Newly diagnosed ,"I’m 34 years old and I’ve known for quite sometime that something wasn’t right with me. I’d have these sudden emotional swings, and feelings of anger, sadness, fear of abandonment, etc. All of my relationships would kind of end in the same fashion, and I wasn’t great at maintaining friendships. I’d always been in search of love because I didn’t really receive much as a child. My childhood was rough (but who’s isn’t) my parents got divorced when I was 5, and both suffered from severe mental illness (mother bipolar and BPD, father with bipolar). Fast forward to now and I’m in the final stages of finalizing my divorce, which admittedly I know I shouldn’t have gotten married I just didn’t want to be alone. We are both living separate lives at this point, and I am dating someone who I’ve known while I was married and here and I were  friends. I probably shouldn’t be dating at this point, I just so desperately want to be loved and with someone who cares about me. I go through these bouts of pushing this person away and really being an absolute horrible person to them, especially (at least to me) it looks as if they’ve not been honest with me/they are cheating on me. I don’t know how much of it is actually happening as opposed to the disorder skewing my judgment, but I like to think  I have pretty good intuition. Over these last several weeks I have lashed out and said some horrible things, including that they are fucking other people, lying to me, etc. I hate who I’ve become and my therapist asked me today why don’t I just break up with this person; the answer is simple I want the validation that I’m not crazy and this is really happening. I hate everything about myself, I hate that I’m incapable of maintaining any healthy relationships. I never wanted to turn into my mother and it looks like I have. I feel like I’m destined to be alone in life and frankly it sucks. My therapist is trying to get me into an IOP that specializes in BPD, but I almost feel like what’s the point?

For reference, I am a 21 year old female who has been struggling with the same issues for pretty much my entire childhood and adolescence.

Now my question is: is 21 really ""too young"" to be diagnosed? Because I've heard from a lot of people who are my age or even younger than me that have been properly diagnosed.

You can trust that I’m intelligent enough to explore all avenues with my therapist and psychiatrist. All of them. On god, why do people think it’s appropriate to diagnose on reddit?


I’m 30f, I’ve always clung onto certain hobbies or things I dive really deep into. 

Education is one. I have 2 associates, 2 bachelors and an MBA. I have some hours towards a doctorate but I’ve put it on hold.

I’m also obsessed with my photography. I’m obsessed with working out. These are the two things that ever make me feel any better.

And finally as a classic I end up obsessed with whoever I’m dating. But I don’t want to scare them off so I do my best to act normal and not like I’m hanging on every second waiting for them to text me. It’s torturous. I’m terrified of being annoying or seen as a burden I can’t seem to get my needs met. 

Can anyone relate to these?

28,Partner Diagnosed,"Hello community! 

I have been in this relationship about 3 years. My partner is an amazing person about half the time.  I mean incredible, and I really want to show up for him like he showed up for me.  We met when I was experiencing psychosis. I have schizoaffective, and he helped me get into a hospital and get medicated. While I was there, he would spend hours on the phone with me as I said things that didn't make sense.  He was so wonderful to help me. I moved in with him and he proposed to me, which was really romantic but also a bit fast and intense. 

Basically, the last few years have been some good times, but also really hard a lot of the time as my partner seems to engage in ""splitting "". A lot of the time he becomes moody or angry, disconnects and works on his computer feverishly all day. 

When he's not angry, he's overwhelmed by shame and regret and says he wishes he could die. This happens almost every day. 

When I first met him, he was doing a lot of healthy things like walking his dog every day and lifting weights. He'd take care of his house. Ever since I moved in, he's stopped those habits and become obsessed with crypto, only talking about it and working on it all day long. A little bit ago, he made a lot of money, but then lost all of it. 

He's done some crazy things. Almost like a switch goes off in his brain and it feels an awful lot like jekyll and Hyde. For example, someone flipped him off on the road and he almost rammed our car into theirs and began yelling very loudly at them, became very aggressive like I thought he may actually go fight them and hurt them. He is also a war veteran. He ended up parking, getting out of the car and running the several miles home without talking to me. 

What can I do to help him? I can tell he's suffering a lot. Almost every day he tries to break up with me, but I can tell he doesn't really want to. He also seems to get really annoyed with me and really annoyed with small things and will disconnect and become angry.  He has very low self esteem and a lot of self hatred. He seems to have extreme emotions and enormous feelings. 

All of this has been difficult to navigate and I find that it's made me pretty unhappy even though I know he's struggling with his mental health. 

Genuinely, when he's doing well, he's one of the most amazing people I've ever met. He's exceptionally smart and helpful. He desperately wants to be a good person. He takes responsibility for his actions and really tries to show up for me. 

I have worked hard to gain his trust. But to be honest I'm not sure if I can handle the ups and downs too much longer as I yearn to have a healthy romance where I can joke around and be merry. 

I asked him to go to therapy where he's gotten the bpd diagnosis. I read the wiki article on it and so many things clicked about his behaviors. 

How do I survive this and help him? It seems like he only really likes me half the time and it's painful. ",1715178074.0,False,0,0,ferociouswanderer123,None,1cn5qw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cn5qw1/partner_diagnosed/

34,PSA: BPD is not a trend. BPD is not cool. BPD is not something you should diagnose yourself.,"I’ll preface this by saying that I’m not trying to diminish the struggles of others, nor am I a fan of gate keeping but I have to say this. 

Borderline Personality Disorder is one of the nastiest conditions out there. I’ve lived with it for a 10-12 years now as a result of a TBI. I wouldn’t wish this hell on anyone. Knowing my struggle and the struggle of others like me; I’m absolutely sick and tired of all the trendy BPD shit, all the people claiming to have BPD, and all those completely diluting the meaning of an already misunderstood condition, at this point reducing it to an internet trend and meme. Quite frankly, if you don’t have a diagnosis or a medical professional has not at least brought up the suspicion of it then you shouldn’t be here claiming that struggle as your own, and you sure as fuck shouldn’t be using it or the idea of it for online clout. I’m extremely tired of it. /rant

Edit #3 Would again like to apologize to anyone I hurt with this post. I will not be taking it down however, because I feel that’s less beneficial than actually showing that my thinking evolved and also the good conversations I had that opened my eyes some. Thanks to those who respectfully communicated their perspectives and to those who showed less judgment than me. 

I really do believe the best way to handle BPD is accessing professional care that can confirm the diagnosis and help develop a treatment plan. But access to that is very lacking in many parts of this world and even in places where it’s ‘better’ it’s not good. I understand now better than before how difficult it can be to navigate, and that’s where my thinking has evolved. If you take the time to understand what you’re dealing with, and truly believe it’s BPD, then that’s valid. If you then do the work with learning DBT skills and seeking out resources then that’s amazing, and it’s damn impressive to do on your own. I never meant to invalidate folks in that situation. 

I take issue with two things; flippant self diagnosis that isn’t well thought out or is reactionary, and trendy self identification to seem edgy or whatever motivation TikTok types have. Beyond that, you do you and everyone knows their brain best. 

I hope everyone that reads this continues to find ways to cope and we all keep growing! I know I’ve been a bit angry at times in these comments but in my heart, I want the best for everyone suffering, irrespective of any differences we have had here. Peace and love ❤️💯


Edit #2: Honestly I cannot believe that I’m actually being still attacked for this. Didn’t expect to be sent into an actual episode over this but here we are; being called ignorant and privileged and a bunch of other shit actually got to me… weird, it’s like I’m overly sensitive. 

So to those of you that had real discussion and also pointed out blind spots and things I didn’t consider in a respectful way, thank you. 

To those who are hell bent on making sure I know how ignorant and privileged I am and how easy I apparently have it. Thanks, I appreciate being triggered into an episode where I question the validity of my own struggle. Thanks for that 


Edit: Okay to be honest I wasn’t expecting this rant to blow up like this. A few things I’d like to say 

-It seems despite my best efforts I have a blind spot still for those without access to mental healthcare. Thanks to those who (respectfully) brought this to my attention. 

-I also did not think enough about cultural issues and stigmas far worse than I or others have experienced here in the US. Need to think about that more and for those that live in stigmatized cultures, stay strong, one day we’ll all be able to talk openly and get treatment 

-Lastly I want to clarify that what I should have said is the following; self diagnosing is dangerous if it’s done hastily or for the wrong reasons. However, it is sometimes all one has at their disposal, and if it’s done with the intention of finding ways to improve and work on the the symptoms and issues associated  with the the self diagnosis then that is a good and positive thing.

I've joined this subreddit because my (23M) girlfriend (19f) told me she thinks I have BPD. The things I relate the most to are splitting (which has been under control for like two months), possibly having an FP (herself), and the self-esteem issues/difficulty with enforcing boundaries.

I've been seeing my current therapist for like a month now, and she seems more capable than my previous therapists. She's been subtly suggesting that I might be being manipulated in this relationship (in great part because besides the rent that her family pays for her, I pay for basically everything, as well as doing more house chores than her - and I don't even live at her place). When I shared with her (the therapist) that my gf suggested that I may have BPD, she was kind of dumbfounded - at what I interpreted she saw as ""audacity"" and also at me ""falling for it"". She was clear this time in saying that I was being manipulated into thinking that my behavior and demands weren't valid.

Recently I got the opportunity to do an international travel for work and invited her, but now we were almost set to going together when we discovered that I would be pretty busy in the evenings as well (not only 9-5) and she started talking about staying at a different city. Also, I had initially set an expectation that I wouldn't be interested in going if she didn't go with me (maybe she wouldn't be able since she has Uni), but when I changed my mind about it she essentially told me she would have to reevaluate our whole relationship until I stepped back.

44,Newly “diagnosed”,"(Content warning: mentions of self harm & suicide)


Not sure if ‘diagnosed’ would be the best word to use but as the title states; I was told 2 weeks ago after being assessed that I have BPD.

As grateful as I am to finally have an explanation to why I do and feel things and an answer that can help me in the future to deal with this. 

I’m currently waiting to start my 10 week group & 1:1 therapy sessions to help me with this and I think the long wait is why I’m finding it hard to cope; it’s like I’ve had this massive bomb drop with no professional support to help deal with this, I feel kind of left on my own because I don’t know anyone else in my life with BPD.

I just feel like I’ve spent this last while reflecting on every. single. event in my life that wasn’t actually because of x, y or z; it was my BPD being evident and I never knew at all.

According to the psychiatrist, I grew out of the more extreme symptoms since my teen years; which was when I was extremely prone to self-harm and suicidal ideation; attempting twice before I turned 22. Now I wouldn’t attempt (due to a sudden family death which made me decide that if my relative cannot choose to live or die, I don’t get the right to choose to die so selfishly) but the thoughts are still very much there unfortunately.

I’ve thought about experiences with family members, friends, relationships and started thinking maybe I’m the bad person here.

Looking up BPD on the internet and reading all these subreddits and forums makes me feel like if I tell anyone then I’ll look like a monster. I’ve only told a selected few and although they’re all supportive and happy that I have a diagnosis and getting the proper help, I can’t help but fear this’ll turn people away from me. It’s made me scared to date people incase I become horrible towards them because “I have no fucking idea how to deal with this and I never have except now I have a super cool name for it!”

And I don’t even understand anything I’m reading?! What is a FP?! What is splitting? What even is going on? I feel lost and confused and I’m not sure if I need a hug or reassurance that I’m not some evil monster.

Again I am waiting for my group therapy sessions where I will get to talk to others but it’s just for now I just feel like confused and somewhat overwhelmed. I’m not even sure if I’m using appropriate language to talk about BPD.

I'm still learning about emerging BPD and BPD in general, but from what I understand (and from what the psychiatrist said) is that with emerging BPD, because my personality is still developing, there's a possibility it can be reversed with therapy? if that's true then I'd be so happy cuz I've been struggling so much with it!!

87,Just got diagnosed,Not sure how to feel rn. It all makes sense and it answers so many questions but at the same time it’s a little surreal to me and there’s still so many things I’m asking myself. I’m happy that I finally came this far and have discovered this important stuff abt me at least because I can tackle it sooner than later. I never really suspected myself to have BPD since I’ve always been sort of quiet and overly nice to people but inside I’ve felt like a completely different person. This kinda explains that now I guess? Idk! I have OCD too so I always brushed off my symptoms with that label but knowing I have BPD kinda helps me discover this other side of my struggles.

88,Got diagnosed officially ,"In October, I was admitted to the hospital for trying to end it after my gf of 5 years left me. Before the hospital there was a lot happening. She left like 2 weeks prior, and I freaked out. Had a lot of panic attacks, couldn’t really keep my mind straight, and I thought I was going crazy. I begged her to stay, while telling her it was probably safer if she left, all while asking why she  would leave. I felt crazy.  Anyways, the hospital happened, after being taken by the policeman to another county over, and I was kept for a week. At first I was scared, cried, all that good stuff. Then I kinda just sucked it up, talked to all my ‘friends’ i had made, and then played my way out of there. Once I got out, therapy was required (which I’ve committed myself to going to) so I had it every week. 

I asked them if I could possibly have BPD, because I’d read a lot about it, and a lot of my actions match up with the symptoms, not just the breakup…but other stuff I’d rather not go into detail about yk. But they switched me to my new therapist we’ll call Maria. Maria has been very patient with my jumping thoughts, and my unstable behavior patterns, and last week we were talking and out of no where I started crying. That week was wild, my ex had reached out for something, I slept with someone on a drunken adventure, I made myself sick from drinking so much, and I quite frankly felt the most down I had since October. I asked her what was wrong with me, how can I fix this, I just want to FEEL happy for a minute. Usually I’m pretty nonchalant in her office, but that day I just couldn’t keep up the happy facade. 

She looked kind of surprised, but more like a…not pity I’d say….concern maybe. She let me calm down and I sat there for a moment, and she told me that she is certain that she can diagnose me with BPD, and that she’d been certain for a while. At hearing that, even though I’d been thinking it as true, I cried…harder than I’d cried before. I don’t know why I cried but it made me a little confused. I already knew, but I was upset hearing it. She’s pregnant, and after this month she’ll be gone for 3 months. I told her that I’d probably not come back, but she’s advising me against that. I don’t know what to do. I feel lost and found, but I’m just tired of trying. I dunno man. ",1709309490.0,False,1,1,MorphoCraxkus,None,1b3y204,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1b3y204/got_diagnosed_officially/

I've been with my partner for 4 years now and she's given me absolutely no reason to think she's going anywhere and we don't have any problems at the moment to be concerned about but since being diagnosed I CAN'T for the life of me stop thinking that she's going to leave me, she's just waiting for the right time.

90,Officially Diagnosed!,"I know it seems weird to celebrate finally having a BPD diagnosis, but it's something that I've suspected that I've had for around a year now and was finally diagnosed with it today after last week...last week was probably one of the worst weeks that I had in a really long time, but it brought up a lot of things that I was able to talk to my therapist and psychiatrist about over the past few days. 

For the longest time I've been trying to figure out why I act the way I do, I also have AuDHD, DID, PTSD, and suspected Bipolar, so I've really been put through the wringer my entire life. And if anything, the BPD has been the cause of a lot of my issues in my life over the past 8-ish years, which is when the symptoms really started to show(I was 13 and just turned 21 on sunday). It caused so many issues for me and for others that I associated myself with, it actually also was the main reason why I had rumors spread about me throughout highschool as well. It was awful and it's caused me a lot of trauma and distress. 

However, I'm actually happy that I officially have this diagnosis despite its stigma. I'm very self-aware of my behaviors and actions that I do that aren't healthy for myself or others that I need to work on and I plan in working my ass off to be able to get to remission. But I also know that now if I tell someone that I have BPD, then I'm risking the judgement due to its stigma.
I'm so glad to finally have some mental health professionals that are actually listening to me and helping me look into what I potentially have wrong and are not afraid to call me out on any bullshit or if I'm diminishing my own feelings. Unlike my last therapist who completely invalidated me and also encouraged the very negative and harmful behaviors that I was exhibiting...and she even encouraged my delusions as well. I'm glad that I dont see her anymore.

But anyway, I'm just glad that I FINALLY have this diagnosis so I can actually truly get the professional help that I need to improve myself and my symptoms. Its been a long road so far and I know I still have a very long way to go from here, but getting this diagnosis is truly a blessing in disguise. It can only get better from here, even though I know that there will be many tough obstacles in front of me.",1706650930.0,False,4,1,Witchy888,user has bpd,1af0915,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1af0915/officially_diagnosed/
91,Getting diagnosed,"Hi guys. I think i mentioned this before but what led to me getting diagnosed was cheating on my ex. But after doing a lot of self reflection i've had the ability to look on my past behaviors that were most definitely a symptom of bpd. this includes stealing little amounts of money from my parents, speeding when driving, not feeling stable ever, hooking up with random people, self harm, attempting to suicide. i always thought i was super depressed or anxious but bpd makes perfect sense.

even reflecting on my childhood the symptoms were always there. i would bottle up my emotions until i exploded, would lie about failures in school, was very impulsive, sensitive, and shameful.

Where i am out now: i am trying to meditate and be close to God. i feel extreme guilt and regret for the times i stole from my parents and need to make amends by course correcting my entire life and giving back to them. I never realized how deep into BPD i was. i was an alcoholic for a few years (and im only 20) and a stoner and those only increased my issues. these made my issues so much worse, led me to awful decisions, and also led me to trauma. i am crying while writing this. i truly believe God is watching over me. i could be dead now or in jail for petty theft. i could have very unforgiving parents , friends, and ex boyfriend. i hurt people with my actions and was selfish. i am grateful that i never went too far.

My ex boyfriend meant so much to me. i split on him and emotionally and physically cheating which is the absolute worst... never again the shame, guilt, regret, and remorse ate me up.. once during an episode i stole a hair clip in his paren't bathroom. another impulse issue. I stole costume jewelry from a cousin once. the screwed up thing is that i always knew these were wrong but i still did them and i feel truly horrible about it. i had major impulse issues and would shoplift too. stealing was common in my family. but there was no reason to steal at all. i just did it. i guess i am looking back on the behaviors i regret most. stealing, cheating, and lying. 

i really wish i got help sooner but i want to know, how can i make it up to my parents and do i tell them i have bpd???

115,help?? been self-diagnosing ,"hello everyone! this is my very first post in reddit and I am here to share (?) how and why I feel like I possibly have bpd and asks your opinions about it.

I am from the Philippines and I am a college student. Therapy or having a therapist isn't really that popular here in this country. Even mental disorders remain highly stigmatized. That's why even though I badly want to get checked and go to therapy, I can't. Ever since I've read what BPD is, I've been self-diagnosing. I need your opinions about my traits if I qualify to possibly having BPD. (i know i can't get a working diagnosis here in reddit) 

 I have been in a relationship with someone for almost a year now and everytime we have an argument, it's almost always because of me. I easily get 'hurt' or offended by my partner's message because of how I perceive the tone and the mood of his text. The message itself isn't derogatory or negative, even just plain yes  no or even the good nights and good mornings. Just simple messages like that–still I get upset at how the tone is set when we're chatting online. I always think that something is off with his tone and immediately jump into conclusions like he's tired of me and his feelings for me have faded already and that's when I start to get real defensive. I will set the tension high by questioning his texts and accusing him of those thoughts of mine  I mentioned earlier. Even in person, when I notice him not being as clingy as I want him to, my mood shifts immediately. 

During those heated arguments rooting from one tiny detail that I observed and offended me, I feel so angry. Not just upset. I'm full on enraged. I feel like screaming what I have to say and there's just this feeling of rage in my body that makes me wanna jump or squeeze something or even break something. The worst part is, even though my partner is already apologizing, my anger wouldn't go away so easily. I don't mean in a snap. I meant even just getting a little less angry but, no.  This is not only during arguments with my partner. Every argument I have in general especially with family or friends. When I get angry with someone I'm not close with, I start wishing for their downfall. Once I get angry with someone I'm not close with, I just can't replace their negative image in my head like I can't get along with them even after years of being mad at them. They're always the bad guy in my head. 

(TW) As for having suicidal tendencies, I have thoughts but I have never cut my wrists or any part of my body. Though, I self harm by digging my fingernails into my arms so hard until it leaves bruises, sometimes very small wounds shaped like crescent moons on my skin. This is what I do when I couldn't contain my anger anymore. Instead of breaking something, I do this. I don't have suicidal thoughts just out of anger. I often think about this usually when it's quiet and there's nothing to distract me from thinking of myself and my life. (very pity party) What's funny is that there would be times when I feel like I'm literally better than most people I know. Then other times, I feel like shi and literally so behind from all the people around me. That's why I try to find new hobbies but then after days, I feel uninterested already. I rarely finish personal projects I've started.

I also noticed my thought patterns. I often think 'maybe I need to break up w my partner and focus on myself because I have this traits' but the next day, as I'm talking to my partner, I just can't and I feel anxious thinking of being alone and missing him. Sometimes, when I'm upset or stressed, I suddenly get so energetic that I once thought I was having a manic episode. I don't get myself and I get frustrated about this. One second I can be very cheerful and a few minutes later, I wanna lay in bed and just cry. Like I'm literally having a good time with my friends and something hits me like my life isn't that good enough or idk just a feeling of dread that makes me wanna cry or stare blankly into the wall or whatever.",1713987347.0,False,1,0,Beginning-Rhubarb-19,None,1cc7diw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cc7diw/help_been_selfdiagnosing/

122,Diagnosed with BPD.,"Hi everyone, just wanting to come on here so I don’t feel so alone. I recently got diagnosed with BPD from my Physch - after working together for a while. I feel quite mixed about it - the stigmatisation of it seems daunting but I’m trying to not allow myself to feel ashamed because it is what it is and I can’t help having it.  Part of me feels very relieved to understand myself and my actions, and especially the way how I behave in relationships finally has a name.

 But for some reason - it’s made me feel slightly helpless and a little like I am standing infront of a huge mountain overwhelmed about how I will tackle it.  

Does anyone have any tips on how to help cope with this & or any skills you use with the mood swings every day?

 I’ve longed for the pockets of peace in the days I sometimes feel. I Think maybe I’ve had a bad couple of weeks with all of this, but trying to keep hope that I will get better.

I have a symptom I can't quite put together.

I meet 8/9 of the criteria and have been misdiagnosed before (and it never felt right. this feels right). In my years you can probably guess I’ve made mistakes and hurt people.

A huge thing going through my mind has been wanting to reach out to everyone I pushed away. Luckily I’ve been trying to analyze my patterns, took a moment and realized I’m just trying to excuse my past behavior with my diagnosis. In no way would me shoving myself back into someones life heal them, it would be for my sanity. I need to accept what I’ve done, that I hurt people and I will never get them back.

I’m on a huge path of self forgiveness. But I have always found it hard to cope with the thought people walk this Earth with the scars I made. Did anyone else have this reaction to their diagnosis? To want to blurt out “Sorry it was the chemicals in my brain! Not me!” to all their past burned bridges?

157,"“Newly” diagnosed, question.","I posted here recently in the midst of trying to figure out what’s going on with me. Long story short, I was unofficially diagnosed when I was 12 but my mom wouldn’t let the doctor even entertain the idea of an official diagnosis. I’m now almost 28, a firefighters wife, a mom of 2, and finally have an official diagnosis of BPD. 

So, I’m basically discovering who I am and who I’ve been (or who I thought I was) for the last 16 years. I’m also quickly learning that almost all of the things that have frustrated the hell out of me about myself over the years was due to this mental disorder. Which in one way is extremely relieving because 1. I know I’m not alone and I have support groups like this and 2. I finally have a starting point for treating the thing that has almost driven me to the end countless times. However, it’s also extremely frustrating because now I know that if my mom would have just listened to the doctor 16 years ago, I might not have been through HALF of the shit I’ve been through with this disorder being untreated. 

So, anyway, to get to my question… is there a name for the days that you just get into a nasty funk of dissociating? It’s hard to explain but it’s happening today. I basically feel like I’m dealing with a bout of depression (I don’t want to do anything, nothing sounds fun, everything is a chore, I’m extremely overwhelmed by menial tasks, and I’m very overstimulated) but the fact that I don’t want to do anything or care about anything makes me dissociate *really* badly all day long until I snap out of this. Like, I could be standing in the kitchen talking to my husband and we have a break in the conversation and I start to space out and then it just turns into a 10 minute dissociation and I’m just completely separate from the world around me.

And getting misdiagnosed several times and got completely brushed off and the subject just changed on me whenever I first learned of bpd and asked about the possibility of me having it on several occasions given I was experiencing all 9 symptoms intensely for years that were progressing, and it went ignored.

 It took me getting thrown in the psych ward for attempting suicide over an fp 3+ times before I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist at the mental hospital. But even then my psychiatrist still refused to acknowledge it, and requested my records to make sure and when he received them and saw I wasn’t lying he just avoided discussing it all together.Like he didn’t wanna acknowledge it because then that would mean he has to treat it.

A lot of times most mental health professionals don’t wanna face the possibility of someone having bpd. Because how hard it is to treat they don’t wanna face trying to treat it because to them it’s like the big bad boogey man of all mental illnesses because for them it’s too difficult and complicated to treat so they often will be in denial about it until it becomes too obvious to ignore. And it’s very unfortunate for pwbpd because it goes untreated and as we all know untreated bpd is unbearable.

172,29 M | Just diagnosed with EUPD (BPD) | Clueless,"TL;DR - 29 M who just got the most real diagnosis after a series of failed psychiatric diagnoses and therapy sessions. I've just got to know I have EUPD (or BPD, as the internet tells me) and I'm looking for a kind soul who'll help me understand this better.

\-----------

Hi, 29 M here. Till about a week ago, I knew I had anxiety issues, suspected some OCD and ADHD traits but all the psychiatrists I met told me, ""It's just Anxiety. Chill. Here are some anti-depressants and chlonazepam. You'll be fine. Try to think less."" (Yeah, right. Thanks! Why didn't I think of this before? Silly me.)

Anyway, my anxiety largely grew to a point that it started affecting my day-to-day functions and I was deperately looking for professional help. Recently, I met the most sensible psychiatrist so far (atleast one who's not out to just mint money with ready-made prescriptions) and I was told that Anxiety is a spectrum and hence, that's what the diagnosis will always be. However, I show signs of OCD and adult ADHD, which could probably explain what I was going through. Albeit preliminary, I felt the diagnosis was detailed and it took into account the myriad of emotions and situations I'd been going through all my life. I was happy that I was heard. Now, the psychiatrist told me that I also have EUPD (Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder). The internet told me it's also called Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and hence, I'm here.

Would someone in this community be kind enough to spare some time and help me understand what it is? OR direct me to resources that can educate me further on this?

173,Just got diagnosed and things are starting to click ,"hi, im 19f, I got diagnosed recently, like 3 months ago, and somethings kinda started to click so i just wanted to vent about it ig

for starters, my friendship pattern growing up was so very obviously off and yet it never hit me how strange it all was, ever since i was like 5 or 6 i can recall wanting very desperately to become friends with one particular person for no apparent reason, doing everything in my power for them to like me and then getting attached and completely basing my mood off of what this person was feeling, if they were sad, i felt sad, if they were happy, i was happy and so on. i also would get REALLY jealous if they wanted to play with other kids at recess, i remember getting insanely angry and moody at home because i thought my best friend would leave me for another kid she played with in recess the day before.

then there is the too many/too little feelings situation 
my parents put me in therapy when i was 6 because they legit thought i was a social-path, no kidding, i know how ridiculous it sounds. apparently the only emotion i ever displayed up until my teenage years was anger and a pretty unmanageable amount of anger, explosive, it genuinely felt like splitting. anyway, they put me in therapy and my therapist quickly found out that i was just bottling it all up because my emotions were too overwhelming and anger was the only one i knew how to express (given i grew up in a pretty violent household) 

these things obviously aggravated as i got older and it became more obvious how there was something off about me but i just find it so interesting how ive had symptoms since my formative years

175,"Do you think it was benefitial for you to be ""officially"" diagnosed or not?","Hi everyone,

I'm suspecting since around a year that I might have BPD.I'm not officially diagnosed (yet?), and am wondering if that is benefitial for you and if so, in what way.

I'm already in Therapy (since ca 1.5 years) and on medication (ca. 12 years) for Depression.

We also did DBT for my intense moods in the past during my therapy, so regarding that there won't be a change anyway in case I get a diagnosis for BPD. So I'm wondering, would that even be necessary?

188,I was diagnosed with BPD once.,"For me it was an experience of negligent self-esteem, and the desire to feel valued despite not having intrinsic value.

I notice a lot of threads on here pertaining to how finding about one's BPD is this life-changing scenario.

The fact is, BPD, like other mental health descriptions. Stems from factors such as genetics, culture, our intrinsic and subconsciously held values and beliefs.

I've met individuals who have use the description of BPD as another label to devalue and lessen the value of others when we are all human and equal.

I notice that with low self-esteem it may be part of the mindset to also devalue oneself with these same beliefs and labels held by and used by others.

I just wanted to share, no matter how lost or hopeless anyone may feel, that's actually a good place to be at. It creates a desire to be better. And that's the thing, it IS possible to separate oneself from the behaviors and emotions that have created the label of BPD.

Self-Help books were where I found my contentment, passions, goals, beliefs, and values.  
It helped me to consider BPD, as another form of negativity.  
When we live in negativity all the time, it spreads. Breaking the cycle may seem hopeless, we may have been diagnosed with behaviors that at one time met the criteria for a mental health label. But it doesn't mean that we can't change the behavior and mindset.

Positive choices, attitude, and mindsets, all start with the small steps. Such as positive affirmations.

Some ppl treat ASPD and BPD as the exact opposite, and claim that it's impossible to have both. But in fact, some of their symptoms are really similar.
 (To begin with, both are cluster B)

I've always felt that I don't have my place in the world, cus there are lots of terrible stigmas.

Recently I started to study abt the BPD communities, and realized that some ppl with BPD tend to treat ASPD as an ""absolute evil"".
Also, some ppl with ASPD tend to make fun of BPD.
Constantly worried that I feel I'm hated by both of them.

I def have some unethical aspects of my life, but I'm deliberately trying to fix them (this is one of the reasons I became a vegan). 
I don't want ppl to think I'm a ""emotionless monster"" (my father always called me like that, it hurts).

211,"Recently diagnosed with BPD, close friends immediately become distant","I was diagnosed with BPD last month and I have been struggling a lot grappling with this new reality. I have been misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder in the past based largely upon me lying to the psychiatrist or withholding information.  I guess I wanted to feel safe in a diagnosis that held weight but was not scary. After a lot of work with my therapist breaking down the barriers that prevented me from being honest with myself and psychiatrists the severity of my emotional problems became more readily identifiable. As the puzzle pieces fit into place and I looked back on a decade of dozens of destroyed relationships it felt like a train hit me.   


As such I immediately needed emotional support from my friends, in particular my closest friend (favorite person). I had been relatively open with my friends about  my emotional problems/trauma in the past so I kind of assumed that the reaction would be supportive. Instead, basically everyone has been really distant and hesitant to engage with me. I feel like I am suddenly radioactive and untouchable. My best friend has said less than 20 words to me since I told him 3 weeks ago, refuses to engage with me ""while I am like this"". This has sent me into one of the worst spirals I have had in years, I almost needed to be hospitalized on Saturday (3 days ago). I send him a few messages a day that all boil down to ""why are you doing this"", he responds with silence or just says ""sorry I can't help you"". I think he has made his decision to permanently distance himself, and even if he hasn't this is a fundamental violation of trust for me, like I don't think I want to recover from this with him. My other friends have not been this cold but they are slow to respond and have little to say outside of ""yeah that make sense"".  


I feel the silence of the world around me every night and the cold absence of embrace. I feel like a child screaming and crying, banging against the glass and no one seems to see me or care. I am glad to finally know what is really wrong with me but my world suddenly feels so much darker and small.

214,Therapist was hesitant to diagnose me,"Hello everyone, 

So my therapist did diagnose me with BPD over a year ago. She came to the conclusion on her own but for the first year of talking to her, she was writing all my behaviors off as symptoms of depression and anxiety. I had my own suspicions that I had BPD, and from learning about it and talking to my
therapist about my mother, it’s clear my
mom has an undiagnosed personality disorder (whether it’s BPD or NPD, I may never know as she refuses to go to therapy). Anyway, so I asked my therapist at one point do you think I have any other mental illness. and she said like a personality disorder? And I said yes. After going through the DSM 5 questions, she diagnosed me (it shows up as a diagnosis on my insurance and everything). She told me she’s unsure if I actually have it or if I just picked up on my mom’s behaviors during my childhood. Her reasoning for this is because I am extremely self aware, I don’t “test” her and I’m 100% open and honest with her. We do DBT but she has never mentioned my diagnosis since. I did start taking an antidepressant a year ago as well, and I feel like that made a tremendous difference in my behaviors, along with therapy of course.  

So my question: Do you guys find you have self awareness and suspected you had BPD? and did antidepressants make a huge difference for you dealing with BPD too?

First, I felt a sense of disappointment and judgement towards myself, like the evil voice in my head was telling me I should be “stronger” or “better” than this diagnosis. Then, I felt a little surge of relief — reading and talking through the symptoms felt like finally being understood and seen. It felt like I finally got an answer. 

Now, a couple hours later, I feel a profound sense of sadness and grief for what I’ve made of my life so far. I feel so so terrible for my child self who was so confused and hurt and scared, aaaaaalll the time, who didn’t understand the complexity of the traumas she experienced. I feel so sad for my teenage self who learned that self-destruction was the only reliable way to feel regulated. And I feel sad that I’m here now, in my bed, empty and isolated, staring down a lonely recovery journey with only a few shreds of hopefulness left.

217,How long was it until you got diagnosed?,"Hello friends,

This is something that has been weighing on my mind for some time now. 

I've said before in this sub that I just recently started taking steps to better my mental health - well, more like better understand it. It's been about two years, and I've just recently switched to a therapist that I genuinely click with and feel we will work well together.

Within the past year or so, I've come to feel that something more is going on in my head - more than my usual problems. Now, I want to say that I am not a fan of ""self-diagnosing""; but I do feel like there's just something more going on in my brain than I think. I have researched and talked with some friends of mine that are in the psychology field, they do say that I show some BPD symptoms - but as I said, I'm not one to self-diagnose.

218,I’m Not Diagnosed But I Relate to Everything,Hey I just joined this Sub Reddit. And I’ve read a bunch of posts and I can completely understand each and every one so I was hoping that someone with BPD could tell me if my experiences sound like them. I’m not saying you have to go into detail. I wouldn’t ask anyone for that. But I just want to relate to someone because I feel so alone. I can’t hold down relationships. When I get close to people I’m always thinking they are trying to hurt me emotionally like my girlfriend cheating on me. She doesn’t ofc but it still comes up all the time. It’s lead to fights and me trying to end things and me saying horrible things to her because I know it’s irritational but inside it feels so real and overwhelming. Sometimes I can’t tell what is and isn’t real and what feelings are real and which ones are me being paranoid. And I’ve tried coping and I have this feeling of dread and anxiety inside of me. I go into blind rages a lot when I get overwhelmed and I hurt people I love. And it makes me not want to be around anymore. I feel so bad for even wanting people or friends. So I try to isolate myself but then I get depressed and I feel stuck. For years I’ve just assumed relationships aren’t meant for me. I try to do things to make people happy I give away my money and things I have and I spend money on people I don’t have in hopes that it makes me a good person so I can feel better about myself. But I always end up hurting someone. I just don’t know what to do anymore. So if anyone can relate please let me know. I just feel so alone. I want friends I want people to understand me.

220,how did you get diagnosed?,"I've (F26) recently started therapy again and apparently I meet some of the criteria for BPD. I've struggled with severe anxiety and depression for 11 years now, and thought that was the end-all and be-all of my issues, the reason why I behave the way I do. Thing is, as stupid as it sounds, I've always attributed my intense, moody and overly emotional character to my zodiac sign or something. I've never put much thought into it. However, my therapist and I have been piecing things together and some of the symptoms I show are: fear of abandonment to the point where I really struggle to let people into my life if there's any chance of them ever leaving. Meaning I lead a really lonesome life. (Platonic, but mostly romantic). The few people that I do let in though, don't stay in my life for too long, because I always find a way of pushing them away. My relationships are always all or nothing. If I let you in, I'll give you my all and expect to receive the same devotion and... well, obsession. When I don't receive the same-- if I feel like I'm being wronged by someone in any way, even minor mistakes that most people tend to overlook or forgive--, then it's over. No one has ever reached three strikes with me, because one strike and I'm fully out.

For example, I've recently had issues with someone I trusted-- a person I finally let in and allowed myself to be vulnerable with. Something happened and I felt like he wronged me. Now whenever I look at him, I feel physically sick with anger- actually like I'm about to puke from rage. I want to physically attack him and do all sorts of horrible things to him, but obviously would never do this. What I do instead, which is extremely problematic and evil as well, is to imagine several tragic, deadly things happening to him, over and over again. Sometimes I even write about the ways I'd like him to suffer. Before that, I was putting him on a pedestal. It happens every time I feel wronged by someone. I'm not proud of that, but it's the only way I can feel better about the situation: to imagine someone going through the same pain that I am going through.

Most of my anger, however, is released inwards. I never take it out on other people, only myself. I have a long history of hurting myself. On top of that there's also the mood swings that have been an issue among my group of friends for years now, and I just can't help it. I can't help the chronic sadness and emptiness that follows me like a dark cloud, and nothing ever seems to be good or fulfilling enough for it to go away. It feels like it's just part of me at this point. Then there's my problematic relationship with alcohol, which I'm trying to quit... by replacing it with something just as bad such as cigarettes etc.

My question is, before you got diagnosed, could you relate to any of this? I constantly fear I'm just a bad person. How did you get diagnosed? How was the process?

226,Officially diagnosed and healing after years of being unheard. ,"Long story. But I need to get it out, unfiltered, honest, and focused on myself rather than the hurt I caused in the process. I feel safe here. 

Around 16, I brought up concerns with my therapist at the time. I was a teenager, who had been through repeated traumas. I was obsessively stalking people at school, would have full melt-downs on a regular basis, hated myself. I had at that point turned off all sympathy, empathy, and compassion. I was angry, and hurt, and often lashed out in harmful ways. I recognized I could not stop myself. I was medicated, in CBT, in case working. I had gotten the early intervention, and still, I knew something was wrong. I didn't have a moral code to follow, I knew I wasn't feeling empathy, I knew that my actions were manipulative and harmful- but I also 'knew' I would never get the things I needed without that. I learned that early, from a lot of very hard lessons. 

I expressed concerns I may actually have BPD.  I laid out my concerns. Looking up people's addresses, making burner accounts for those who blocked me, planning out my FP's class schedule so I could take the same hallways and maybe see them. Making sure I was in the same lunch block as them, texting them (see: harassment) constantly. Confessing my love numerous times, rejection every time. The response from my therapist was; if you had BPD, you would not appear as stable as you do.

Years went by. More trauma, more hurt, more pain. Both to myself, and to others. I didn't know how to stop, because in my head- if I wasn't hurting people, I was the one being hurt. Everyone left regardless. Why did it matter? Really matter? I had chosen so often as a kid to try to be kind, and every single times I ended up hurt. I was tired. I was broken. I didn't care who I hurt anymore.

At 19, I had once more sabotaged an (unhealthy) relationship. I was in the rebound phase. I was not a Good person. Again, lack of empathy, sympathy. Didn't really care who got hurt in the process as long as I got what I needed. I'm not excusing any actions whatsoever as right. I fucked up and hurt a lot of people. But I am providing reason. Can't really tell my side of the story to people in real life, you know? 

And then I met someone- who had suffered similar trauma as me, but was kind. He was the first person I met who could actually, genuinely, understand what had happened to me without me going into detail. It was an immediate attachment. I never thought I would meet someone like that? I always heard there were people who went through those things, I read stories, but never in my life had I actually met someone my age like that. 

But what confused me most was, he was so kind. He was empathetic. He was sympathetic. I didn't understand *why*. I mean, I could from a logical perspective. But not from an emotional one. How could two people who went through (different, varying) trauma come out completely different? Why was he kind? Why did I hurt people? But he understood. He was the first person who did, in hindsight. 

And that sort of started everything. Our relationship started fast. I fell, cautiously this time. Afraid. I wasn't used to kindness like his. Understanding, and empathy. And honestly, meeting someone during the healing process can absolutely go horribly wrong. And I did end up hurting him, emotionally, a lot. I pushed boundaries, I lashed out, I disrespected him as a person. I experienced splitting often. I pushed him away at every chance I got. I would unload a bad thing I had done in the past, waiting for him to leave. I didn't want the other shoe to drop unless I knew it would. 

It never did. He never left. He was always, always, kind. He was patient. He was loving. I hate the things I did. I'd do anything to take them back. Words said in a blind rage, passive aggressiveness, manipulation tactics. In his words, he knew who I actually was, and he knew I was trying to push him away at every chance. He knew I was afraid, and hurting, and that wasn't really me. 

But the more I was around him, the more confused I grew. In a good way. He had a moral code. So, I followed that. If I was confused about something, I asked him. He would explain it to me, sometimes three times if that's what it took for me to understand. My behaviors shifted, slowly. I still lacked empathy, and sympathy- but I was kinder. I hurt less, and I didn't want to hurt *him*. I still fucked up, a lot. He deserved (and still does) a hell of a lot better than some of the stuff I put him through. We talked about it every time something happened. I tried, but without resources or a diagnosis, I didn't have access to the skills to heal. 

At 24, this year- I was admitted to inpatient. I experienced a splitting episode towards my psychiatrist over paperwork that was the likes of which she hadn't experienced on her end before. I was diagnosed. Inpatient was solely DBT, and I remember asking about empathy. I didn't want to go my whole life without it. And the therapist said (or I guess how it came across) ""You feel uncomfortable when people are upset, [ and I know you think that feeling is born out of convenience ]. But maybe take some time to think. Why are you uncomfortable?""

It was dam, after dam, breaking all at once. I realized I felt like the room glowed when my partner laughed. I knew that was a form of empathy I had blocked out, but I still felt. What else was there? A lot, actually. And all of the anger dissipated. I hurt, rather than being angry. It was scary. I went from being this impenetrable wall to a defenseless kid again. Anger replaced with heartache, euphoria replaced with sympathy and empathy. Control replaced with kindness, and genuine joy for others. 

After inpatient, I transitioned to intensive outpatient. Things were finally worded in a way I understood. Concepts I had, but could never put into words. Splitting, how to handle it. How to respect boundaries, but more importantly, why? How to be kind. What actually were my core values? Who was I? What did I actually want? I had to, at least temporarily, stop focusing on the hurt I caused and start focusing on healing so I stopped hurting others in the future. 

I finish my IOP out next week. 

My partner is the reason I found myself again.
Those resources are the reason I found myself again.
I was lost. For a very long time. But I missed me. I missed her, so much. 

My partner and I are still together. I've had some brutally honest conversations with him since, that were very scary, and amounted to; ""I know I've hurt you. I cannot take that back. If one day you need to leave, to be happy, to be healthy- that's all I want for you. I want you to feel safe, secure, loved. Even if that isn't with me. But for as long as you are here- however long that may be- I will do my best to ensure you always feel loved. You always feel safe. I will do my best to rebuild trust I've destroyed. But if ever you have to leave; don't stay because you feel you have to. I want nothing more than for you to be happy.""

We talked about engagement last night. I found a job I can help people at and bring joy instead of cause pain. I'm connecting with family again. I'm attending treatments, taking my medication, staying on top of things. Everything does hurt again without the anger, but in a different way. It hits harder, but allows space to breathe, and process. 

Very rarely, I still feel like I miss a home that only exists in limerance and feeling. More often than not, I still can't recognize the person in the mirror. But I feel human. I feel like me. 

Whatever consequences I reaped, if I have to sow them in the future, I'll accept responsibility. I'll accept the consequences. But for now- I'm happy to be alive. I'm happy to feel empathy, and sympathy. I'm happy it's not just anger. I'm happy I feel hope- for the first time since I was a kid. I'm happy. For no matter how long that lasts; for right now, I'm happy. And that's okay.

227,Recently diagnosed and feeling hopeless about it,"I recently worked with my mental health provider to receive an official diagnosis of BPD. While I am well-aware this disorder doesn't define me as a human being or make me any less capable of living a normal life, it was still a gut-punch to accept that the label applies to me. Many, many things about myself now make sense (hypersexuality, unstable relationships, impulsivity, abandonment issues, you know the drill), which is comforting. It's nice being able to contextualize all the FPs I've had over the years and look back on my life with a sense of clarity. But this still doesn't change the reality of my situation, which is killing me inside: I have a Cluster B incurable personality disorder.

There have been so many nights I have found myself rocking back and forth alone, begging the ceiling for an explanation on why I can't just be normal. I want a love I don't have to earn. I want a mind that is quiet and calm. I want to wake up in the morning and not dread what my own brain has in store for me next.

And if we're being extremely candid, I feel like I'm claiming a label that doesn't belong to me. My mind will often convince me that I am not traumatized because both my parents loved me, we were financially well-off, and they've remained married for the duration of my life. It's so fucking stupid -- why the hell am I questioning the legitimacy of a diagnosis I received from two licensed professionals?! Why do I feel like I didn't ""go through enough"" to qualify for this disorder?

I wish I could come to terms with my diagnosis without still feeling isolated from it. I wish I could admit to myself that mental illness is indiscriminate in its targets. I wish I could accept that I watched my parents' marriage disintegrate as my father mentally/financially abused my mother, cheated serially, and isolated me from her to convince me she was crazy. That my mother leaned on alcohol to cope, and was a belligerent, angry drunk. That I lost myself in my FPs to distract myself from the warzone I knew was going to be waiting on me as soon as I got home (and almost every single FP ended up hurting me more).

I turn to sex, toxicity/abuse, MJ, and self-isolation to cope with my emotional instability because at least this is pain I know. At least I know how to brace myself for it. But I know this isn't sustainable and I can already see the physical effects of years of self-neglect when I look in a mirror now. I'm ashamed. Even with two providers, this cycle seems impossible to break.

Fuck BPD. All I want is normalcy.",1703179072.0,False,2,8,vintage-glamour,user has bpd,18ns1c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/18ns1c8/recently_diagnosed_and_feeling_hopeless_about_it/
228,I got diagnosed today.,"I am a 22 year old female and I live in the US. I've suspected for several years that I have BPD. I've seen multiple therapists and psychiatrists throughout the last 10 years. I just recently started seeing a new therapist about a month ago. I was skeptical because she is an older woman. I had this bias that older people wouldn't understand mental illness, so I always opted for younger,  female therapists. She has been great so far!

She diagnosed me with BPD, MDD, and GAD today. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety before. In the past, when I have expressed concern about BPD, I was always told ""you have to be 25"" or ""insurance is tricky when it comes to diagnosing that"". I've been waiting for years to be diagnosed, now it's finally here and I don't feel any different.

A question of mine to you all is, how did your diagnosis affect your insurance if at all? I'm scared that I'm going to receive a hefty bill of some sort, or some other drastic change.",1700174705.0,False,1,1,oibruv_innit,None,17wzt39,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/17wzt39/i_got_diagnosed_today/
229,"Hi, I am 19F I recently got diagnosed with BPD.","Hi, hi. Currently I  am in college and I have been kind of isolating myself from any kind of new relationships, I am scared of myself and I am traumatized by the relationships I have 'ruined', my impulsivity, etc. I am currently just relying on my college schedule to survive, I don't know where to start at all with this diagnosis.

So far I have just been watching YT videos about it, watching Tiktoks too and it does relief me to think that I am not crazy and there are people like me. But then again the 'BPD' in my head says I am wasting time by doing so because I just want 'another thing to relate to.'

I came here because I really need to know what steps I can take to start my healing journey, without constantly k**ling myself inside within the process. Or some stories, coping strategies, etc. If anyone would be kind enough for that 🌱 Thanks!

230,Just got diagnosed,"I have my 2-week follow up appointment with my psychiatrist this Thursday. I was diagnosed with BPD and it was a mix of relief and grief.

I was wondering to those who’ve gone through this - what are the best next steps to get better? I have a therapist I like that I’ve been working with for awhile. But I’ve been told group therapy is helpful as well as DBT.

Any ideas or tips or advice? I’ve been cycling through it the last few weeks. I’m trying to not identify with the disorder and accept it. But a Google search was …. stressful lol",1692651267.0,False,0,6,MaryJaneDaydreams,None,15xjsa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/15xjsa4/just_got_diagnosed/
231,What do you wish you knew when you first got diagnosed?,"I got diagnosed with BPD last week. My therapist suggested I start DBT almost a year ago now (weekly group sessions), so I have a basic decent understanding skills wise. But I'm curious: for those who have had their diagnoses for a while now, what do you wish you had known right after you got diagnosed? How do your initial thoughts/feelings/expectations compare to how you feel now, with it months, years, or decades behind you?

232,How many others didn't know about BPD until they were diagnosed?,"I was 28 when I got diagnosed. Before that, I'd spent many hours trying to understand myself, why I thought this way, what must be wrong with me.

I was diagnosed without ever knowing about BPD, honestly I don't know if it's because I was blind to it, or I'd just never come across it in my search for why I am like I am.

And when I was first diagnosed, it felt like freedom, like this weight on my shoulders made sense. I want to be clear, it didn't make it easier to know, it made it more understandable in easy terms. 

Why did I feel like killing myself at every second of my life, why did I put everyone above myself? Now I know, now I realise why. Though it doesn't make it any easier, my feelings, my intense fucking feelings weren't just me. But were understood by so many people. 

I want help, I need help, I've got some questions I would love help to answer, if there's anyone out there that is keen to help?

For the first time in my life, I think I'm feeling a relationship to somebody, but I can't tell if its just because of me, or if she actually has feelings for me. Is anyone interested in helping me find an answer?

233,I was diagnosed with bpd I think it might be a mistake ,"I’ve been to the mental hospital 2 times. The first for trying to OD the second for self harm. After I came out of the hospital I met with my psychiatrist. She had a different air to her than normal, normally she’s very light hearted but this day she was serious. She was very blunt and in about 5 minutes she told me I had bpd. I think I just have bad depression and adhd though. I’ve also been diagnosed with adhd so I can get really excitable and distracted. So sometimes when I have depressive episodes after them I feel really excitable but I think it’s because I have adhd. I don’t know.

234,Just got diagnosed.,"Hey guys. (Sorry for confusion I’m new here:))
I (24F) am in DBT outpatient treatment. Just finished 3 weeks of the PHP program. And now on IOP. Which is just 3 days a week for 3 hours a day. The PHP program was 9am-3pm Monday through Friday which I felt like I had a purpose and I was doing something. 
Anyways I guess what I need to let you all know is I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD when I was 16-17 after that went down a slippery slope of drugs (literally all of them) until I did acid at 20... and  thought I lost my freaking MIND lol (funny because having bpd you feel that way anyways) 
I always knew I was “off” or something. 
Fast forward 2 and a half years I was sober and fine.. so I thought. 
Here came the panic attacks, depression. Angry outbursts, quitting jobs, threatening to hurt myself. 
I knew I needed help or I was gonna go right back down the same bad road.
I found an (ACT) therapist that I’ve been seeing every Monday give or take for almost 2 years.. I think . I’ve also held down a job for a little over a year. At this job I had a breakdown that sent me to the doctors and that’s how I made it to the treatment center. I said all this to say now I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. .. idk what to do with that. 
Idk who that is but that’s not me. 
I have a loving boyfriend that doesn’t deserve to deal with all these emotions.

I find myself fantasizing about getting hit by another car while driving, or when trying to sleep, I think about what would happen if I just don't wake up. I'm not suicidal, and I suppose I do have some sort of suicidal ideation. I'm too scared to ask my mental health professional about it in dear they'll commit me or something.

236,Got diagnosed with BPD after a very long personality test.,"Long story short, the questions the doctor asked me made me realize I have had it since I was a teen, now in my 30s, I haven't had a stable job. Jobs here and there, I have a few interviews aligned but the fear of rejection from them has crippled me. 

I would like to know how are you all getting shits done in your life, as soon as the pressure hits I am frozen and numb and can't think of anything but kill myself because of how sorry loser I am. I do have my manic episodes too when things are all good. 

One more thing I am starting my DBT from next week, I want to know how useful was it for you guys? I am going to give it an honest try. 

I would like to seek advice on the career font, I feel like I am not good enough for apprantly anything, but I still want to do something.

237,i’ve been officially diagnosed with borderline personality disorder!,"it’s been such a long journey with trial and error honestly. i’ve dealt with such shit mental health professionals who refused to listen to me or take my symptoms seriously that i had to get help from a private psychologist that specialises in evaluating personality disorders. i live in sweden as well and here getting a diagnosis is free so the fact that i had to pay privately for a diagnosis i could’ve gotten for free had they just listened to me does feel bittersweet ngl..

at first he was a bit unsure and according to him he was conflicted between 3 personality disorders, that being anxious personality disorder, dependent personality disorder and borderline personality disorder.
so he read the criteria for all starting with anxious PD and i only related to like few minor things, same thing with dependent. 
when we went through BPD i checked every box, literally 9/9 of the criteria and he even mentioned that what i related to in anxious and dependent PD were overlapping symptoms of BPD, like inability to handle conflict and fear of abandonment, which makes sense.

but yeah i can finally say I AM DIAGNOSED WITH BPD without feeling like such an imposter cause for over half a year i’ve just had psychologist after psychologist telling me i show signs of bpd but no actual diagnosis.
it’s a shit disorder don’t get me wrong but it’s the only one that describes what i go through and describes me as a person in general.
like my friend who has BPD literally told me i need to get it checked out cause she 100% sees me having it. guess she was right :)

anyway i’m genuinely happy. i felt listened to FOR ONCE and now i actually feel like i belong somewhere finally !!

i asked my psychotherapist and she took out an evaluation paper she had. we went through it and she said i needed to fit 5 of the questions to meet the criteria, and i fit 6 1/2 (the half was regarding impulsivity)

i asked her what exactly that meant, and she said the evaluation she gave me is what is used for bpd assessments, so i have bpd. she explained we would start dbt and emdr

despite this, i still feel like an imposter. like i wasnt actually diagnosed. i feel like this is something maybe that we know i have but didn’t formally diagnose? or do i just have imposter syndrome ?",1691273922.0,False,2,6,FirstImpressions38,user has bpd,15j8j9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/15j8j9u/was_i_diagnosed/
