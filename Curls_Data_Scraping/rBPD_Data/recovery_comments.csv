0,"So six years of hard work? How many days a week did you go to therapy? And is it something you can say now after being ‚Äúdone‚Äù with your process that you wish you‚Äôd known sooner? 

I just started my journey! I‚Äôm 34 now. Lost my ex, but think he was not a very good person either way (according to my friends, and now my own experiences of the relationship. He made me feel very bad about myself, and in the beginning I though he was mister right. Heads up; if someone calls you their goddess and their soulmate after four dates, he‚Äôs probably not the one). Anyways, my only problems have been in romantic relationships, so what was your main symptoms? 

Your recovery story gave me hope and I‚Äôm eager to dig into this group therapy! Did you also work on your attachment style?",H3LLO_fire,swawek
1,"I‚Äôm 22 and have been struggling with BPD since I was 16. I graduated from two IOP programs and am now in a weekly DBT skills group, as well as two individual therapy sessions every week. It takes a lot of work and patience, it‚Äôs been 3 months since all of this treatment for me and I have never felt better. I‚Äôm proud of us!",alonesidjdnmsis,swawek
2,"Ah, this is great to hear. Most members here seem to be much younger and with early diagnoses, so reading about their stories does not help me, a 30-something year old that got diagnosed less than a year ago! 

I see myself kind of lucky because my BPD traits have never been extreme. Only a few months ago, I learnt that my mom has BPD+ADHD like me, (though mine is quiet, and hers is definitely not) and she is a psychologist, so I received a lot of the DBT stuff through her throughout my whole life without even realizing. 

My life is mostly bearable and the emotional breakdowns usually come when I am under a lot of stress. I think this is why my diagnosis came so late; I have been diagnosed with depression+anxiety several times, because those were the times that things were too much to handle. 

Getting an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù DBT did not help me much, because I already knew most of the stuff and incorporated the skills into my life unconsciously. That being said, I still cannot get over the emptiness, so I just accepted life as a meaningless journey to go on with.

This stuff definitely gets better with age by the way.",,swawek
3,"This is so reassuring. I just had a massive triggering splitting episode with my partner and feel hollow and wretched. I‚Äôm on the list for a DBT program and am hopeful it will help. 

Well done to you ü•∞",MissQueenBee1982,swawek
4,Thats refreshing. It‚Äôs always good to hear the positives. Just got diagnosed with Quiet BPD as a 32 y/o M and the stigma around BPD is terrible. I feel like somehow who would always a burden so don‚Äôt even try to make connections with other people. It‚Äôs my cats and I. Thats it right now. Life can be lonely beyond belief.,Xiaco9020,swawek
5,"I am so happy for you, congrats on all your new accomplishements!

I am aslo here to say that recovery is possible (I am 33F). I agree with everything you've said OP. 

It's going to be okay guys.",throwaway_thursday32,swawek
6,Question about your engagement - do you experience splitting? Do you have periods where you feel empty toward your partner at all?,AngryBPDGirl,swawek
7,"This is amazing to hear OP, thank you so much for sharing! I got my diagnosis around the age of 13 and I‚Äôm 29 now. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm in recovery but I‚Äôm very high functioning and also deal with physical disability. Saying that, I‚Äôm in a much much better place than I was 10 years ago and I‚Äôm actually quite looking forward to what my thirties will bring because I know that even if I have relapses and wobbles, I‚Äôm on a steady path to recovery",Top-Resolve1775,swawek
8,"this actively makes me feel better. 

i‚Äôve always found comprehensive dbt programs to be out of my budget financially and in terms of time. do you think it is that imprtive",notreallyanangel,swawek
9,Good for you!! Good to see it is possible with hard work. I‚Äôm 20 and starting my first DBT group March 10th. You sound like you‚Äôre in a great place,,swawek

11,I love to hear this. I literally dream of having a peaceful mind and providing for myself to be more than comfortable. I wish I could give you the biggest hug. Wonderful job <3,,swawek
12,This gives me hope,azuk9,swawek
13,"That's fantastic that you went through with all of those programs! I wanted to drop in here to say that I had a very special opportunity to participate in a BPD study conducted at my state's university. It was completely free to me. 

And yet, I ghosted my therapist after five weekly sessions. I was too depressed / busy trying to numb my pain to do the homework. And it was embarrassing. I felt like I brought nothing to the table. Then other times I felt euphoric after the sessions and questioned if there really was anything wrong with me since I could ""fix"" myself so quickly and easily. 

So I haven't been to therapy since, I feel like a POS for ghosting therapist after therapist. However, reading success stories always lights my fire again, so thank you so much for sharing your journey. I know one day I'll be able to share my own and that no progression is linear.",rottenpeachesx,swawek
14,"I am honestly in tears at this post. I‚Äôve been going through a huge rough patch, lost a job I was extremely hopeful for, just lay in bed stoned all day. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone but my boyfriend, and even with him I just feel sad. I‚Äôve gone through the DBT program, it helped until the next thing went wrong. Then I fell back into the same old habits. I‚Äôm only 27, diagnosed around 21-22. Last year I had shingles, due to stress. I‚Äôm starting to worry about that too. 

So it‚Äôs nice to see that there can be a light at the end of this EXTREMELY long tunnel. Sorry for the rambling üôà",Wicked_bitch003,swawek
15,"but it only truly work if you want to be helped and if you want to get better, alot of us are in a loop of wanting to get worst for no actual reason other than feeling like we have a little control over our own emotions :/",buguibob,swawek

18,Do you to take meds,Brightseptember,swawek
19,"I'm 20F and received my diagnosis of BPD, ADHD, and Asperger's last year. I did DBT therapy over last summer and I am currently on 15mg Ritalin (2x a day for ADHD) and 150 Lamotrigine (1x nightly for mood stabilization). I meet with my longtime therapist about every month (even though I should see her more), and I see my psychiatrist about every month as well. Hearing your story makes me happy and gives me hope! 

However, I feel like perhaps I'm not getting enough help, because even after all this treatment, I still feel like my BPD eats me away, especially in tandem with my other diagnoses. Do you think I need to be in treatment for longer, or try something different? I've recently felt like I've needed help functioning in daily life; even going to class has been difficult recently.",dogsayscow,swawek
20,"Ooo yea watch out for those ones. My ex kept asking me if I was real. Obviously I loved the attention. But then he yanked it away once I was on the hook.

I‚Äôm one year in to DBT, I‚Äôve been in therapy for three years at least. I can‚Äôt speak for the author but I don‚Äôt think we are ever really done.",Liamisthebestboy,swawek
21,That‚Äôs so awesome! Good job :) when I was doing DBT I was always amazed when I realized I had used a skill I had learned without thinking about it. Super proud of you!,astridanomaly,swawek
22,"And I am so proud of you! <3 It takes effort to continue with treatment, well done!",H3LLO_fire,swawek
23,"The emptiness, I think, comes from lack in of connection. Mostly with oneself, that‚Äôs why many with BPD seeks connection from the outside. 

My son is sick atm, usually he doesn‚Äôt want to be close to me anymore, but today he‚Äôs been laying next to me the whole day. I haven‚Äôt done anything, and it most of the days makes me feel bad and lonely, but not today. Today I‚Äôve felt good within, because I‚Äôve been close to my son and I‚Äôve been taking care of him. 

It made me realize that how I feel normally being alone a weekend, has nothing to do with the fact that I‚Äôm home or don‚Äôt talk to anyone. It has everything to do with it I feel connection or not. 

So we need to urge ourselves to find ways to feel connected and loved with and by ourselves. I saw a post on IG about ‚Äúways to use your own love language for self love‚Äù, and I have to look more into that. 

Maybe it works for you too?

I also have ADHD and BPD.",H3LLO_fire,swawek
24,"I‚Äôm glad that you have come to a point where life is bearable, I‚Äôm sorry to hear about the consistent emptiness. I have also have been anxiety and depression at different points in my life. Something that has helped me with the emptiness and lost-in-life feeling is really focusing on what I find meaningful and trying to bring more of that into my life. I decided to change careers and work towards a future career that aligns with my values and it has brought me a sense of purpose.",astridanomaly,swawek
25,"You have a brain I‚Äôd love to pick. A unique position. And I‚Äôve been racking my brain on this for a few weeks now so I‚Äôm gonna ask for your personal opinion knowing you may not be able to respond. I suspect that I have ADHD with my BPD, and would love to mention it to my therapist. But I was ghosted by my last large business therapy office, by two different providers so I switched to a new one. Haven‚Äôt mentioned BPD diagnosis yet (she also hasn‚Äôt asked about any previous diagnoses yet) in hopes of an unbiased second opinion. I‚Äôm being treated with major depressive disorder at the moment. Does this sound like a mess in my brain, and should I 1. continue with the way we are going since it‚Äôs only been 4 visits so far OR 2. mention the above to her next visit?

Edit, I‚Äôm 27 diagnosed at 26 so I‚Äôm middled and new lol",,swawek
26,"There is a TON if evidence that shows DBT helps with BPD symptoms and behaviours. Be gentle with yourself after the triggers, practice self-care and self-compassion. You deserve that ‚ù§Ô∏è",astridanomaly,swawek
27,"The stigma around it is awful but in my understanding BPD is rooted in experiences of trauma and that shit is not our fault! Once I started learning to have more control over my thoughts, emotions and behaviours I identified less and less with the diagnosis and now I don‚Äôt care as much about all the garbage online about BPD. People don‚Äôt understand the intense pain that comes with BPD and that people with BPD are just trying to alleviate their pain. I hope you are able to make some connections with caring people who understand. You are not a burden!",astridanomaly,swawek
28,I‚Äôm proud of you too! It is no easy feat but it is possible!,astridanomaly,swawek
29,"I have been with my fianc√© for just over 3 years and I have had way too many splitting episodes to count. Soooooo many BUT not nearly as much anymore. I have a lot more awareness around my episodes. Usually if I have stress from another area of my life that I don‚Äôt address adequately, it manifests in a splitting episode towards my partner.",astridanomaly,swawek

31,"They way I see it - recovery is a journey and not a destination and it to me it sounds like you ARE in recovery! I‚Äôm very happy for you! My 30s have been great so far with, as my mental and emotional stability increases I feel so much more in control of my life.",astridanomaly,swawek
32,"I don‚Äôt know about the US but in Canada you can get into programs that are run through a hospital so they are covered by health insurance. I‚Äôm so happy it makes you feel better! In the mean time there are lots of videos online that talk about DBT skills and you can buy the workbook, though it is a bit daunting to tackle on your own.",astridanomaly,swawek
33,Good luck! Do the homework and practice as much as you can. You‚Äôll do great! Life is better than ever lately,astridanomaly,swawek
34,"Thank you so much, you are on your way. Sending a hug back to you!",astridanomaly,swawek
35,"That‚Äôs so tough, and having shingles must have been awful. It is a long tunnel for sure but it gets so much better. Don‚Äôt give up! Go back to your worksheets. Force yourself to check the facts regularly, and go through the emotional regulation skills and practice. I know it takes energy but even just looking at them can help when you are struggling. And look at the list of pleasant events and start doing some of those things, choose the ones that make you feel even 3% better. Give yourself the opportunity to have some nice feelings. Have a hot bath, make some hot chocolate or whatever makes you feel cozy and warm and nice. Make a mood board of all the things you love. Watch uplifting videos on YouTube and get outside for some fresh air. Give it a shot, you‚Äôve got nothing to lose‚ù§Ô∏è",astridanomaly,swawek
36,"Yes I would say the first step is wanting to get better, and having hope that it‚Äôs possible for you. There is a lot of work to be done, but it is so worth it. You can gain control over your emotions and it is so empowering when it starts to happen!",astridanomaly,swawek
37,"routine, even routine that is harmful to yourself, is comforting because it's predictable. so i get the loops. especially since a lot of us had volatile lives.",,swawek
38,Are you in therapy?,astridanomaly,swawek
39,"Yes absolutely, I feel quite grounded in myself. My behaviours and thinking have changed but who I am at my core is the same. I‚Äôm still me, just much more regulated",astridanomaly,swawek
40,"Yes, I have been on antidepressants since diagnosis. I have anxiety and was very depressed before and the meds help me a lot",astridanomaly,swawek
41,BPD typically requires therapy 2-3x a week to pick up proper momentum as BPD healing is through relationship (reparenting). This is virtually impossible to do seeing someone once a month. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Life or death.,Special_Zucchini9917,swawek
42,"My ex went from calling me a goddess, giving me his grandmother‚Äôs ring, to saying everyday I was schizophrenic. He made me question myself so much, all my friends whom I‚Äôve known more than 5 years (most over a decade) all told me ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre not crazy, and absolutely not schizophrenic. We‚Äôve known you for so long now, stop believing him and stop asking us everyday if you‚Äôre crazy‚Äù. Once he broke up with me with the words ‚ÄúI hate you, I cannot stand you and I‚Äôm breaking up with you now. We‚Äôre not going to see each other again‚Äù. And after two days I called him and cried (hysterically) and he said ‚Äúsee, you‚Äôre crazy. Making it up that I broke up with you. Wow, you‚Äôre not stable at all! I‚Äôm scared of you now. I never broke up with you‚Äù. After a full week, I asked him ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about what happened so much, didn‚Äôt you say ‚ÄúI break up with you now?‚Äù. And that fucker said ‚Äúyes, but I didn‚Äôt mean it!‚Äù. So he made me think I was literally CRAZY, just gaslighting me. So weird. I still can‚Äôt comprehend what happened, and how it‚Äôs possible for someone to like become my brain. I trusted him SO much. 


And when it comes to the process of getting rid of BPD, I think it‚Äôs always going to be a place of awareness that is required to not go into those old neuropaths we‚Äôre used to. But the brain, the neuropaths and so out personalities can change over time and with hard work. It‚Äôs proven that the brain is neuroplastic. I‚Äôm going to change all my old habits, to restart my brain. I just started ice bathing, and started a course in meditation. Also, I think a trip to a foreign place bringing awareness into the trip, would help change the neuropaths. Doing the same things doesn‚Äôt give the brain a chance to use other other ‚Äúmuscles‚Äù. So I‚Äôm also going to climb once a week to unfold myself, and start doing hobbies I‚Äôve never tried before. Things that are either hard or a bit scary, I think would work wonders. 

I‚Äôm too healthy to get a spot into DBT. It sucks because I love how DBT has all these tools to use. Like ‚Äúlife tools‚Äù, skills I‚Äôve never learned growing up.",H3LLO_fire,swawek
43,"I love what you said about finding ways to feel connected, not just with others but really with yourself. It‚Äôs so true. We have to learn to give ourselves the love that we desperately want from others. That has been a huge lesson I have learned.",astridanomaly,swawek

53,"Yeah, the catastrophization and limiting beliefs here can be frustrating. To be fair, it can be incredibly hard to do self-directed treatment with this disorder. A lifetime of invalidation and trauma can cause negative self-concepts and self-fulfilling prophecies. Mental healthcare really needs more funding globally.

58,"I started meeting most of the criteria for BPD when I was 15 but I didn't find out until I was 33 and had already recovered about 50% or so. Mental health professionals only played a small part in that. It was mostly through self-education and hard work, especially after I started studying BPD in an abnormal psychology class and then obsessively learned everything I could about it later that year. It all started making sense why I never responded to my previous mental health treatment. My problems are much more pervasive and I needed a much more comprehensive approach hitting on all my major areas of dysregulation: emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and social.",,ud6hx8
59,"Totally agree. The average person with BPD can mostly heal their personality with an a year. Of course we are still human and wont be perfect but yeah its curable, just not by a pill. For many people, it gets better with age naturally. Sobriety and buddhism (spirituality) has helped me take control of the car and go down the right road. Common cognitive behavioral therapy is based on stoicism, the classic ""why did u do that""  ""how did that make you feel"". DBT is more based on Buddhism, like a counselor telling u a short story with a deep.message. instead of just telling u the message. This allows the person to come up with there own conclusion first and shape beliefs or view on it.",Lopsided_Air639,ud6hx8
60,"The main thing that helped me get better was meeting safe, healthy people who actually gave a shit about me and working with therapists who actually understood how frustrated I was for most of my life. I was always drawn to people and situations that replicated what I felt about myself and would get trapped in cycles of abuse In pretty much every aspect of my life. Once I was able to learn skills and develop an iota of self esteem (hard when I spent my life being discarded, overlooked, and shamed for who I was and how I interacted with the would) I was able to form healthy connections and begin to feel safe. Finding these people who rewrote the script when I tried to self sabotage (a boss calling to check on me when I went MIA and tried to quit after checking myself into a hospital, a partner who communicates with me and does not just yell at me or use my body for sex, another boss allowing me to take time when
I had a flashback and validating how scary and exhausting this was, etc) really helped with recovery. Therapy provides the foundation, but the key to recovery from BPD or CPTSD is safe connection, as many of this were denied this during our formative years.",Anna-Bee-1984,ud6hx8

69,"Proud of you for beating some of the ""demons"" you carried. I too did a lot of ground work by myself and am working very hard to break my borderline, or at the very least tame it.  I think in all fairness hopelessness is just as strong as everything else we borderlines feel, so maybe when they've said those things they truly believed them. 
Some people may have no idea where to start. Mine started with meeting my opposite. He held me accountable but was fair. His family took me in, they helped me grow and showed me what family is. I didn't start getting to where I was with myself until about 34 I'm 36 now.  I understand where you're coming from when you say those things but sometimes others life's aren't in a place where they can handle what they must do to progress. Sometimes just making it through the day is so hard there's no time to work on yourself.  Perhaps some like where they are. Keeping moving forward friend and good luck üíú.

75,"Yeah no matter how treatable a disorder is, it's not a guarantee of getting better especially if you're going at it alone. A lot of my energy to work on myself these days comes from my SO who has BPD worse than me, interestingly. I didn't go out looking for a borderline. That's just what I happened to be drawn to. I felt like I'd known him all my life. It was such a strange feeling after growing up feeling like the alien who was different from everyone. Like the perpetual outsider that many *wanted* to understand but never could no matter how hard they tried and how hard I tried to explain. This guy just got me.

As for the BPD x BPD... sometimes it's chaos but we're almost 9 months in and still going strong haha I get super mad at him sometimes and he gets super mad at me but it helps that we bonded really deep and really do want to be good to each other and build a great relationship. We both are working really hard to get better. The bad times come and go but after each one we keep brushing ourselves off and moving forward. Always forward. Every month has been better than the last ‚ù§

And yeah stereotypes oversimplify a group of people. Of course groups all have something in common binding them together which in this case is powerful emotions combined with a deep-rooted sense of shame and invalidation making deeply painful emotions triggered easily, but that can come out in all kinds of ways. My SO's go-to is dangerous activities like not following safety protocols when he's working with dangerous animals in his job. Whereas for me it's more I scream and break things. Or I just don't want him to touch me for awhile. 

And every borderline has a unique history even if they grew up in the same family as somebody else with the disorder. We're influenced by that. We're influenced by everything we've ever experienced up to now. 

Also the amount of education and training a pwBPD has already received affects how well they can keep these things under control. I'm light years away from how I was back in the early 2000s. Those were dark days.

Stereotypes do not look this closely. They just lazily slap the ""bad"" label on a whole group then go back to watching Hulu.",,ud6hx8

healing happens slowly so it may feel like you're not getting better, but you are. looking back at where I was just 1 year ago, the difference is actually huge, and the further look back the more I see the progress I made. it's hard to see a lot of the time, but when you watch yourself differently to something that used to trigger a breakdown, it's like !!!??? ‚ú®üòÆ‚ú®",CorCaroli11,ud6hx8

82,"There is a Taoist story of an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years. One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit. ‚ÄúSuch bad luck,‚Äù they said sympathetically.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù the farmer replied.

The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. ‚ÄúHow wonderful,‚Äù the neighbors exclaimed.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù replied the old man.

The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy for what they called his ‚Äúmisfortune.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù answered the farmer.

The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son's leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù said the farmer.

Take a step back before ever acting and look from outside with empathy. Don't be harsh on yourself and challenge the self talk it's hard, but it's doable. You need to start working on whether your outlook on life supports your negative behaviours because if they do, you will have trouble making the changes. Try not to ever assume intent behind actions and communicate clearly. Beyond that, there are plenty of books written by people with BPD. I recommend some, but I can't think of them off the top of my head.",GRIMMxMC,19724y4

I'm trying to avoid being harsh on myself but I am trying to be fair and fully acknowledge just what my actions were but for once, really digging deep to recognize the tiny ""insiginificant' actions that seem so little at the time but are honestly pretty big tell-tales. Sitting down and writing out the story from the very beginning helped and fortunately, I am on good terms with one ex who took the time to help me identify the patterns .  


As for the outlook on life, that's one of the things I also dove into last week as I tried to deal with the aftermath and avoid the usual pratfalls (as best as possible). My job is a big reason for my outlook on life, and a big reason for my feelings of inadequacy with my ex (though she truly was beyond supportive and never once spoke negative about it ... the issue was her father did, and I took that out on her.) So my first order of business this week was to work on a new resume and start applying for ""real"" jobs with consistency, structure ... and insurance (cuz treatment aint cheap!)  


Though she never said it outright, I think she has also been battling with BPD but has honestly worked her butt off to get to the point where should could allow herself to be in a committed serious relationship. Seeing that growth while I regressed naturally is embarrassing but I'm choosing to use it as a motivator to get back on track and return to the positive path I was following before spinning out of control.  


Really appreciate your thoughts. We're two days into no-contct, and about 10 into the breakup and I feel like for the first time in my life,  I at least know what I'm dealing with even if I don't yet know how to deal with it.

* No longer allowing posts that armchair diagnose someone with BPD
* No longer allowing posts that are not about supporting a current/active/ongoing relationship with someone w BPD - this means NO ""my ex w BPD was shitty"" or ""my ex w BPD left how do i get them back"" etc

I was diagnosed 3 years ago over COVID, after realizing that I‚Äôve been suffering with it (and other mental illnesses) since I was extremely young. I‚Äôve been in therapy 1-2 times a week since I was 16, and started heavily focusing on controlling my reactions and thoughts to situations. In turn, this helped control my moods but in my opinion, only lessened the intensity of them slightly. However, what I learned is how to love the intensity of my emotions, and how to comfortably live with them and work with them rather than lose control of myself because of them. There are certainly times where I still lose control, but as of right now I haven‚Äôt split in 6 months, and I‚Äôm really proud of myself for that. BPD doesn‚Äôt ever fully go away, but we have to learn to accept that and not let it take control of us. You‚Äôre still young and I think that helps significantly with recovery.

Lots of days I still feel like my 16 year old self. More days I feel like I'm getting better and better at navigating it. It's better if you work at it. Avoid drinking and hard drugs. Be honest with people about what you are feeling, especially in relationships and at work. 

With BPD, the very worst parts happen often, but for me they don't seem to last so long. The most severe episodes last between 2 and 24 hours. When they come, be kind to yourself. Don't blame yourself for the pain. That makes it hurt more. Speak your truth simply, and don't repeat yourself. 

In time, you'll learn your habits, your cycles and your triggers. Even if you don't see it coming, you can create protocols to mitigate the damage. Turn off your phone for the night. Watch your favorite cartoon. No matter how unstable we can be, we can still choose to lean toward our best selves.

187,"Journaling, planning my days and having a schedule that helps me to do things one by one and little by little.
I started all this about a year ago when I gained a lot of weight, I hit rock bottom and decided to change everything, I started by cleaning my room, and you don't have to do everything at once if you don't want or can't do it, let's start by your desk today, tomorrow your wardrobe, the next day your floor and so goes on. Having a clean space makes everything less stressful and it's a reflection of your own thoughts, if you have an organized space, so are your thoughts.
Then I did the same with exercise, an important thing to mention here is finding the perfect workout, sport, exercise is the key, doing something you're comfortable with and that makes you feel like you're actually progressing is what'll keep you motivated and consistent, I personally loved pilates, but there's lots of workout videos on YouTube. 
Eating three times a day and at the same hour is also really helpful, make sure to always eat a bit of protein. 
Guided meditation videos are also a life saver, you can find any of those on YouTube and choose the best one for you and your necessities, mental peace, self love, anger, sadness, etc.

191,"Hello there, I really related to this post. First off, props to you for seeking to heal yourself, it's a huge step! I often feel this way too as I often don't have access to therapy, but just started again recently. 

But I do believe we can heal ourselves.  

I believe we can build on healthy habits till they become second nature. But there will always be some deeper work to be done for full healing. 

May I recommend a book, a very straightforward but kind book that has been helping me feel like I can heal myself, even when I don't have access to a legit therapist.  The author is pete walker,  he's got some degrees and such. And he even mentions that healing teachers can be found in many forms. The book is called from surviving to thriving. I feel like it covers everything one might need to know to start or continuing really healing and reducing harmful behaviors that set us back.

192,"Just downloaded the book! -- thank you so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

I believe our lives are worth living. I believe our pain, the stigma, and society putting up with us is worth it.

 I've never met any BPD person that wished harm onto others. We act how we do to show others how we feel, because we are so misunderstood and minimized. I know that it's an aftereffect of our survival mechanisms. I wouldn't blame someone for stealing in dire circumstances, we shouldn't do that to ourselves either.

 I'm being cognizant of how my actions affect others, sometimes more than I notice *them* being aware of how their actions affect me or others, and I think, we are such loving creatures, that do deserve the patience. Let's be patient with ourselves, and not expect perfection. 

I had a bit of a bickering match with my BF last night, but I went to bed telling myself that these things are completely normal and not progress-destroying. I turned the heated text argument into an in-person discussion where I asked him what *he* feels so we could reach the middle ground, and I feel so great about that now.

209,"Like another poster on here, DBT helped a lot. I got into lots of arguments with the guy running the sessions, but he was wonderful and turned all of these into teaching opportunities without being patronising or making me feel shot down. My biggest take-homes from DBT:

- In any given situation, you will react internally (with feelings and thoughts), then react externally (with behaviours). You can't control your feelings in the immediate sense, and you have some degree of control over your thoughts in the immediate sense, but you always have control over how you physically act in a given moment. Mentally expanding that ""gap"" between feelings, thoughts, and actions can give you the opportunity to change maladaptive behaviours (e.g. compulsively texting something provocative to a friend/partner if they haven't replied after 30 minutes). Changing your behaviours will create a feedback loop that will start to affect your thoughts and feelings when similar situations arise. This takes time though! It's been 3 years for me and I still have to make the effort to keep it up, though it's gradually become much more like second nature.

- Everything that's happened to you in the past has made you who you are now. None of that will ever change, all you can do is take it forward and use it to make the best of the world in front of you. This was probably the hardest and most useful thing that came out of DBT for me- I still don't quite understand when I started seeing this as a good thing and a source of internal peace, as opposed to ""I'm a hollow shell of a person and always will be"". Possibly when I started to focus on tasks/goals in the present, and dwelling less on the existential stuff (that definitely still happens lol, but again I think that's a good thing in measured doses!).

- In stressful situations, count all the green things in the room.

- You will continue to make the same mistakes over and over again unless massive energy is spent on making change. I found that this applied in many areas of my life- choosing to date constantly/be alone constantly, engaging in validation seeking behaviours, leaving the dishes until they piled up etc etc. 

I don't mean this to be a list on how to do DBT, more a list of the the things that stuck with me the most. In terms of how I've changed since learning how to manage my BPD, I kind of feel more boring? And I love it? 

Life is much less of a rollercoaster, I cry less, I still feel suicidal occasionally but I'm better at not behaving in ways which will propagate that feeling, because it's always temporary. 

(Trigger warning: descriptions of suicide ahead)

At my worst, I lost count of how often I was hospitalised with suicide attempts/suicidal ideation. I had to accept that picking up the knife/cutting myself/gathering pills/writing a suicide note/calling the police/getting admitted to hospital **did not** help those suicidal feelings, or any of the underlying causes of those feelings. All you can do is respond to those feelings in a constructive way. Feelings by themselves cannot hurt you, or force you to do anything that will hurt you.

(Back to the present)

These constructive responses to negative feelings have resulted in me picking up hobbies, developing healthier habits (even mundane stuff like making the same hot drinks for myself when I feel tired), and maintaining relationships with people who I otherwise would have driven away. This has helped greatly with my sense of self, which was one of the biggest things I struggled with. I'm still working on it, but compared to where I was while at rock bottom, it's night and day. Maybe not night and day quite yet, night and dawn?

One last thing: a shout out to mindfulness. I wrote this off big time whenever it was brought up, but it allowed me to discover simple things about myself that really helped develop a sense of self, like:

- I enjoy the sunshine, and like the sound of birds 
- I prefer when towels have just been washed and are kind of crunchy
- I sleep better when I'm not sweaty
- I like long train journeys at night time

And lots of other boring stuff! But I feel like less of a husk now :)

210,"I‚Äôve got a slightly different story, but will share it nonetheless... I‚Äôm 44 and was diagnosed around a decade ago, I am not entirely sure on the time frame, but looking back, I displayed symptoms from mid teenaged years after growing up with an abusive, narcissistic father.  I have never been medicated for the condition and consider myself ‚Äòquiet borderline‚Äô.

My ‚Äòrecovery‚Äô happened as a result of having to deal with every single one of my most abject fears occurring within a close timeframe.  BPD people, as you know, have a significant fear of loss.  So, first I lost my career, and was made redundant four years ago, I lost a sense of identity that I had formed around my job.  I lost my income and was forced to sell my car that I had saved up years to buy, then sold my house under financial duress and had to move out of a place that was my dream home location. I lost my autonomy by having to rely on my husband for income support.. 

I lost my best friend to cancer, resulting in a massive emotional and psychological breakdown, I lost my sanity, for want of a better word due to the prolonged insomnia and extreme ptsd and nightmares from watching him struggle through his final weeks.  I lost a decent chunk of my memory for several months and the ability to concentrate long enough to read more than a few lines of text or write anything due to a fall that left me concussed, and I eventually also left my husband of 17 years due to his relentless alcoholism.  The turning point to all this occurred while I was living in a bus for 6 months, effectively homeless and rudderless while processing the death of my friend and undergoing grief focused counselling.  

I had a moment of clarity that came at the exact point where I was seriously considering suicide.  It was like something in me just.. I don‚Äôt know.. broke and fell away.  All the weight I was carrying up to that point.. the feeling that I had failed so many people in so many ways, and lost so much, became a clarifying moment and I realised that everything that I had lost, had in effect made me stronger because I no longer had any emotional vulnerability.. I no longer ‚Äòcared‚Äô about losing anything as it was all gone.  I wasn‚Äôt depressed.. I was simply completely empty with no more to lose.

I had experienced the worst of the worst that I could possibly imagine, and here I was, still capable of standing.  I walked away from what I had intended to be my suicide location and told my husband I wanted a separation.  From that point onwards, I genuinely felt like I was a different person.  The familiar roller coaster of emotions were no longer present.. I was able to look at everything with clear and reasoned eyes, and I reacted to everything with a steady, calm and measured response.  It was like heightened emotion no longer played a part, and for the first time in my life, I felt that I had been reset back to what ‚Äònormal‚Äô feels like.  I am now three years post ‚Äòrecovery‚Äô and I can say I still have no symptoms.  I look back on who I used to be and how I used to react to particular things and I no longer recognise that person within who I am now.",humanbinchicken,fxm4t2
211,"It feels like I'm always finding that balance-- not in a bad way, it's just like, I know if I lose it now I have the tools to find it. Reminding myself to find it can be the hard part though. 

Really though getting a routine, putting passion-- and specifically, hard work-- into something meaningful to me (writing, my relationship), making amends with my trauma and my situation, understanding that I'm the one who understands my circumstances and they can't be boxed in by any labels, affirming my identity and sometimes lack of, *reminding myself that my thoughts aren't facts despite my innate trust in them*: these are the things that have helped me, and I do them every day. It's not easy, but it's rewarding. It didn't really start out that way but over time I trained myself; something clicked. 

Also, locomotive thinking/ decision making. It's not related specifically to my PD problems but learning to make decisions quick and be at peace with the consequences helped me a lot, because ruminating over shit has been one of the most detrimental things to my life-- when your thinking is distorted, thinking things over won't always help you make a better decision.",tubularical,fxm4t2

I think the most important thing is to realize that no one made you act up. It was tough to admit that I screwed up. But it's something that has to happen.

213,"For context I‚Äôm 25 and I‚Äôve been in therapy (DBT and others) for ~7 years, on and off. Along the way there were definitely points where I felt like I had ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù, and I had in some ways, but looking back I can see I was still hurting and struggling to process. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll feel similarly about myself now in another seven years. 

I think the biggest change is stability. I know myself intensely, and I know that disruption to my life, relationships, and routine will bring a symptom flare up of some kind. I feel better equipped to weather those flare ups and still maintain basic self care without destructive behaviors. But there are certainly trauma-related things that make it really difficult, but I do feel resilient as I get older. 

My only goal through treatment has been ‚Äúless intense, less often‚Äù and I can say with a lot of pride that I have continued to surprise myself in that respect. I will never be ‚Äúcured‚Äù of BPD in the same way I will never be cured of my trauma, but along the way, and through advocacy for myself and others, I have developed an intense compassion and patience for myself. I try to care for myself as I wish I had been cared for as a child.",foxconductor,fxm4t2
214,"This will be brief relative to what it could be, but i hope to lend a little hope to you.

I was just out of an 8 year relationship. Suicidal, but not wanting to die. I wanted to find help. I sought out therapy and within a month my therapist was confident enough in her assessment to diagnose me with bpd. It seemed to fit me very well. This was a year and a half ago. 

I remember how much it helped me just to know and understand that there WAS something going on with me. It felt so validating to see that my struggle was not in my head. It had been so horrible feeling day after day like you are just like everyone else and you just suck at existing and managing your emotions and life way worse than they do. 

That was a key component to my recovery. The acceptance was easy. I wanted to be able to reconcile why most everyone I saw was getting along in life fine and I was struggling to go to work each day.

My therapist challenged my beliefs about emotions. And I learned strategies to deal with the bpd. 

**This is the single most important part of managing bpd day to day in my opinion with my knowledge and experience:**

I used to believe that there was no way to influence the response that your head manifests for you emotionally when you encounter a stimulus.

Ex.) bad driver cuts you off - - >> ANGER

this was my experience with life since I was a boy. I never knew anything different.

But with practice you can drive a wedge between the stimulus and the reaction. Not in the sense that you don't respond emotionally at all, but rather that you can slow it down and self talk about what is happening.  being able to do that is extremely important to my day to day management of bpd. It takes practice and it won't work well at first but it's like training muscles. Neurons that fire together wire together. You do it enough and it gets easier and in some situations it may become automatic. Like muscle memory.

While I worked on this ""emotional training"" for lack of a better word, I also worked on negative self talk.

Nuerons that wire together, fire together. I constantly have to listen for bad talk in my inner monologue and talk it back when it happens. Again, this takes effort and practice but becomes easier with time.

Both of these are what I do to help manage my bpd along with an antidepressant.

Finally, take all the above strategies and pair them with the understanding that sometimes the ball starts rolling downhill and you are spending a BUNCH of energy on trying to stop it because you know thats an unreasonable thing to be this mad about or this sad about. Hell, maybe you don't what it's about and you just want it to stop... But rather than spend that energy there, try to be mindful of the nature of the emotional response and let it do its thing. It will burn itself out and you don't have to stop it, you just have a responsibility to be aware of it. 

I've had success with just telling myself that I'm really upset or really depressed and idky and that's OKAY because I have bpd, it happens. this will pass with time. I tell my current gf that I'm upset and idky but I'll be okay soon.

This is the brief snapshot of recovery for me.

Im different. Thats okay. Im worthy of love and care. Practice reaction management. Practice self talk. Know when you are losing a battle controlling an emotion and cognitively step aside from it. Imagine my conscious self literally moving out of the way of the emotion as it tumbles down hill out of control. I choose to let it go and do its thing while remaining centered.

215,"I've been doing intensive DBT and individual therapy for about 3 years now. Before that I spent about a decade doing other therapies that weren't as helpful. In the last 6 months, things have finally begun to feel stable and I'm not being affected by most of my usual symptoms.

When I'm triggered by something, I can anticipate my reaction; I know what I want to do to and I can CHOOSE what to do instead of just acting on impulse. It's honestly incredible. It feels like a super power. I can sense my emotions rising, identify what they are and why I'm feeling that way, and then use that information to decide a calm and effective course of action based on what outcome I actually want for that moment.

If I feel abandoned, I know how to slow down and ask for reassurance or attention in a way that isn't accusatory or take time away from someone without completely cutting off everyone and everything in my life.

I still have very intense emotions, but I'm not controlled by them anymore. If I'm angry or scared, I know what helps me get through that. I know whatever I'm feeling, I will go back to normal eventually. And I have a normal, now. Normal is feeling happy and calm and even peaceful.

What I'm working on now is recognizing who is good for me and who isn't, what I want in life, what my boundaries are and how to protect them, and what needs to change to support my recovery. One thing I've learned is that therapy doesn't become less intense when you're improving; it really ramps up at this point.

It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs so much better than when I was younger (especially my early to mid 20s).

> How did your view of yourself and your outlook on life change, and what were the most challenging obstacles you had to overcome? 

One thing that recovery really taught me was that ***feelings aren't necessarily responding appropriately to situations***. If there's one take-home message it's that just because you feel a wave of anxiety or extreme sadness, it doesn't mean that there is anything to be sad about. Anxiety doesn't imply that someone will leave you.

You have to learn how to accept your emotions as a guidance, but not as an indicator of reality.

Another take-home message was that people have emotions too. They themselves can get tired, angry or frustrated at a million other things. So when someone you love seems off, it is most likely not because of you, but because of something that happened in their life. This is called mentalization.

With borderline, we're so caught up in our own mind that we forget that not everything is about us and our life situation.",Wintermask,fxm4t2

When this person (who I ADORED) wanted to rekindle our relationship, I said ""no"" for the first time ever. I chose what I knew was right rather than what would have validated my insecurities.

It was a lot of therapy and work after that epiphany. I stopped self harm. I stopped using substances. I got into meditation. I got more into reading. I got rid of toxic friends.

221,"I have been in remission for awhile.

The things that helped me were:

1. Deciding I wanted to get better, and recognizing its a long nonlinear journey and it would not be easy. 

2. Understanding that wanting to get better meant having to be absolutely honest with myself about a lot of things about me and my life. This was hard to do, very mentally exhausting, but its all about self reflection at this point. You have to understand whats going on with you. 

3. Then I sought out books about BPD and attachment theories which helped me a lot. I did a lot of research over a period of two years and I still research to this day. 

4. I tried applying the things I learned myself, went to non DBT therapy, started making positive lifestyle changes that were in alignment with my higher self or who I wanted to be. 

5. Started attending individual therapy and DBT group therapy. 

6. Cut out the toxic relationships in my life. Focused on fostering healthy ones. 

7. Figured out who I am, what the constant cores of my personality are, and now I stick to who I am unapologetically and don't let people influence who I am. 

8. This is critical - learn to be alone. Get comfortable with it. This helped me a lot with my fear of abandonment, understanding that even if I get abandoned its not the end of the world. 

9. Mindfullness and applying the skills I learned through research and therapy everyday to think through my emotions and not act on impulse. 

10. It is not a linear process. Does not matter how bad you want it or how hard you are trying, you might still relapse until you get better. You might still have bad days. You might reach remission and still struggle with things. THAT IS OKAY. Do not let that discourage you into giving up completely. If you were physically sick and taking an antibiotic with a 7 day course, and getting better little by little, would you drop it and stop taking it on day 5 just because you still have a bad cough? No, so try to be just as patient with your mental health healing. It takes time. Growth is uncomfortable. BUT YOU CAN DO IT.",brainsandb00bs,fxm4t2

Life began spiraling downhill for me, and I almost got a possession charge for marijuana among other life struggles. I managed to graduate magna cum laude with a double degree. This was followed by another suicide attempt and lots of substance abuse. 

This is what worked for me:

1. Go to therapy and keep going even if you don‚Äôt think you need too anymore. 

2. Medication is overlooked, but provides you the space to address what you need too by keeping anxiety and depression at bay. 

3. Genesight was my life raft. 

4. If your family isn‚Äôt supportive or attributed to your BPD (most have) set firm boundaries. 

5. Figure out who you are (haha this one is hard). For me this included finding a passion for cooking and veganism, writing, and other hobbies.

6. Know your coping mechanisms and use them. Write them down. They are your mantra.

223,"My recovery was a bit long. I basically spent all of my late teens and early 20s in a cycle of being hospitalized for suicide attempts. Everyone has a voice in their head that tells you what to do. For me, it was like I had two different voice tracks in my brain, because one was emotional and irrational, and one was rational and guided me towards healthy habits. 

My emotional brain voice was telling me that I was better off dying because I was torturing everyone around me, that no one care about me, that everything was a mistake, that I'll never find my purpose, that I'm a lie, etc. But I had that rational voice inside me with things like encouraging thoughts, challenging those emotional thoughts, telling me that they weren't true, telling me what to do to get through the day and take care of myself. It was just quieter at times and hard to hear the helpful and healthy things. Therapy helped me listen to those voices separately and use the rational voice to challenge the emotional voice. Although I had to listen to the emotional voice from time to time because sometimes it WAS a warning, and over years and years of therapy, I learned what was what.

I also learned that I've had epilepsy apparently this entire time but never learned because I lived alone or just never slept in the same room with someone. My psychiatrist and my neurologist worked together to get me on a medication routine that might work for both my mental health AND my seizures, and they did a good job.

So basically, I credit 15 years of therapy and medication. I'm only suicidal when things REALLY hit the fan, but I know to give myself patience after that reactionary wave of ""I can't deal with this"" because it always passes and then I'm back to baseline.",antilogy,fxm4t2
224,"When I started my recovery process I was in a very bad state in my life. I was severely depressed, psychotic, isolated and only thing I cared about were drugs. I wasn't diagnosed at this time and didn't understand where my issues stemmed from. I got into a relationship with a person who was 20 years older than me and who had expertise in child psychiatry. She immediately recognized just from my symptoms that I had been badly abused in my family. When I talked about my parents she would often make remarks like ""that's not right"" or ""that's not what a parent is supposed to say"". I used to get very angry at her for criticizing my family without really understanding why. When I was with her I was able to be myself, she would hold me and treat me with respect and it was the first time in my life when I felt I was truly seen for the broken person I was. In 2014 I went back to my family to spend Christmas with them. My family lived in a other country so most of the year I would not see them. Immediately when I was with my family my symptoms would get much worse. I became depressed and more narcissistic. Talking with my ex helped me. After this Christmas I decided that I would take healing seriously and consciously started distancing myself from my family. I told my parents that I needed space in order to heal. This was the single best decision in my life. I started working with my partner seriously in my healing process. My partner recognized the ""inner child"" within me and I felt emotionally safe enough with her so that I started to regress. These regressions were really intense, I would scream in pain, feel intense fear and horror, shake violently and babble like an infant. She would hold and comfort me, very much like one would comfort and hold a small child. After these ""sessions"" were over I felt so relieved as tremendous amount of pain had left my body. After much investigation into my family background both from my mother's and father's side I understood that both my parents had been badly abused in their families and because they never took responsibility to figure their issues out, they abused me like they were abused. Through the process of regression I 'remembered' that my mother had hit me when I was a baby, for example when she would breastfeed me. She would also leave me with extended periods to starve as a baby which caused me to dissociate and feel that I wanted to die. In short, I realized both my parents had strong narcissistic tendencies, especially my mother who I now suspect is a borderline psychopath as she feels no true remorse. I realized that all my life I had been abused and treated as an emotional punching bag, all while verbally told that I was loved and that I was important. I was guilt tripped, gaslighted and manipulated to love my narcissistic mother while she sexually, religiously, emotionally and physically abused me. This double-binded communication caused my mind to split further. I was basically a ""fountain"" for a narcissist parent that was unable and incapable of loving me. This healing process is still going on. It's basically digging up long forgotten memories and emotions of trauma and facing them. It's withstanding pain and not escaping it. I also realized that a lot of the painful, strong emotions I carry within me on a daily basis are not MY emotions, they are the emotions of my parents that they internalized within me with their abuse. Like the terrible guilt I carry within is the forbidden guilt of my mother as she incestuously abused me. I realized at some point that this healing process will never be finished, but I've come so far. This process has enabled me to be able to finish my studies and to be able to work. I still struggle with relationships but I know it will get better as I work on myself. [Recently I've progressed far enough that I've started to make videos on Youtube about healing BPD and how to better understand it.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_k5mlP0u0Q7C6IYpkPjHA) Based on my own experience I'm convinced that in order for a person to develop a personality disorder, there needs to be substantial trauma during ages 0-2 years which halts the emotional development and in order to cope the person develops narcissistic tendencies as a defense mechanism to protect the fragile, traumatized, underdeveloped aspect of the psyche. As I've healed the most fragile aspect of myself I've learned that that aspect is the most healthy and ""true"" aspect of me. That traumatized infant. So I'm basically parenting myself now and letting that aspect have another childhood so that it may grow and heal. And it's working. And that's how I've found ""my center"". I am that traumatized infant at my core emotionally, stuck in an adult's body.",,fxm4t2
225,35yo. Being sober helped immensely but I still slip up fron time to time but dont go on benders and its moderate amounts. Falling into a routine and diet really helped a lot. I got super into working out again which was my thing when I was younger and my BPD didn't seem as bad back then. I still tend to really obsess over fitness and will get into working a single muscle intensity. One thing my therapist hates is I found isolating myself to be really helpful to figure myself out and not just pick up other people's personalities. A lot of it just kind of started to mellow out over time for me naturally but it could be from everything I mentioned above. I still have my moments but they've been becoming more manageable.,Zul_rage_mon,fxm4t2
226,"I wouldn't use the words recovered or happier to describe myself. After years of therapy I can honestly say I am more at easy with the way I am. I have a better understanding of why I feel the way I do. Because of therapy I am better at telling people how I feel. However, now that I have all this insight I consider all relationships to be unsafe and I need to shield myself from everybody.",Soylent_green_day1,fxm4t2
227,"Well, I'm not recovered. But I am better than I used to be, and these are reasons why:

1.) Recalling my skills! I've been through roughly three cycles of DBT/group therapy (over a handful of difficult years). Time deepens my interpretation of those skills. You have to force yourself to use skills at first, but it really does become natural over time. You know what a DBT therapist would say. You know how you'd feel, processing this challenging event later. 

I almost always am using more than one skill at once because emotion waves are like that. Seriously trying to use DBT skills (not fill out homework, not be a perfect human, not understand the whole of DBT) I cannot recommend enough.

Some times you need to just get through a moment. Some times you can challenge yourself w/Opposite to Emotion Action. With time and patience you get a sense of yourself...what works for you and the moment.

2.) Exercising. At all. Walking around more. And kind of being intuitive about it...not establishing any schedules/goals. Just doing it because I know my body needs it and/or my mood is feeling low/dull. Maybe I'm stuck in a mental rut. WHEN you exercise, focus on your breathing. Focus on actually challenging your frustrations w/constructive self-talk. Reconnect with your body/animal self and nourish it with that edge. Yoga is lyfe

Eh, I don't have any more points. That seem valid enough. I'm less crazy but still crazy.",,fxm4t2
228,"First off, I‚Äôm 22. I have other disorders to deal with like anxiety and PTSD. But having my emotions not raging every which way helps immensely. I have a better sense of self and I‚Äôm not doing the stupid shit I used to. I‚Äôm more safe and making better decisions. My relationship with my parents improved and I‚Äôm able to go back to school. Once I got on my current medication and finished up my DBT therapy everything became so much better. If I go any lower on my Venlafaxine my BPD comes back large and in charge and I remember why I‚Äôm on these meds. I have so much more control over myself and my emotions. When something annoyed me it used to feel like a cup with a lid was being filled up with water and the water was overflowing through cracks. Now there is no cup and I don‚Äôt explode over the smallest of things. I can bite my tongue and put on a fake smile, all things I never could before.",,fxm4t2
229,"I went through DBT, that helped a lot. I found the courage to break up with my ex bf. He was an addict. Very kind, never meant to hurt me, but emotionally draining and of course it hurts when someone is an addict. He did not want to get help, go see a doctor or therapist or anything. I was afraid nobody would ever love me as much as he did. We tried for years, but i finally stood up for myself and broke up. I definitely needed DBT skills to make that happen.
I still get emotions. They don't disappear after DBT. I still get suicidal thoughts. But I talk about them with friends, family and my bf. They are very understanding now that I can actually explain why I'm feeling like I do. We don't fight anymore. I used to fight a lot with family. Now we just talk it out. Even though I went through some triggering shit last year (including break up, funeral etc), I can handle it now. I know these emotions will pass and I know how to deal with them. I can actually communicate and stand up for myself.",Sea-Werewolf,fxm4t2
230,"Most days, it's relatively okay.  I did a few years of DBT, so I have learned to moderate some responses.  I find I still internalize a lot of others, though.  Honestly, my outlook hasn't changed much.  I'm trying to help other people as much as I can, but I still expect that I will quite likely die alone and by my own hand.",MotorCycologist,fxm4t2
231,"I‚Äôm a 23 year old female, I had a lot of issues when I was young that could‚Äôve gotten me and many others into a lot of trouble. I got lucky. My first year of college was my breaking point when I realized there was something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me and I started to seek help. That was about four years ago.

Recovered is an odd way to phrase it to me. I will never be ‚Äúcured‚Äù I will always battle with my emotions and reactions. I know I‚Äôm lucky because my BPD isn‚Äôt nearly as severe as some people I‚Äôve known but I was lucky to have started to get help early on and have a mental health care team that saw what I was going through and helped me get into behavioral therapy before my actions and reactions got more volatile.

As far as what ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù looked like, it‚Äôs healthy management. I made choices (very hard choices at times) to stabilize my life, to settle into a career, and to learn to communicate what‚Äôs going on in my head. That was the biggest thing, communicating helps me manage my BPD, voicing my emotional strife when appropriate to my family or significant other helps validate that my feelings are real and it also helps me from aggressive reactions that could otherwise damage relationships and goals. 

I set goals and I work towards them and when things get rough or I start to fall into an emotional episode I have a support system to help me get out of it. I also realize I need to let myself feel some feelings. I process my emotions alone before sharing them and I work hard to challenge negative thought processes. I took every word of my twenty weeks of intensive therapy to heart and I look back to my therapy books and work sheets when I need a reminder. I also still see my therapist when I need to. Despite my family sometimes thinking it‚Äôs unnecessary I know that it helps me stay on top of my BPD so that I don‚Äôt go backwards.

That all sounds swell, but there are still problems, I struggle with long term friendships, I have lots of self doubt and self sacrificing behavior that I fight. I sometimes lash out at loved ones even though they don‚Äôt deserve it. Like I said, I will never be ‚Äúcured‚Äù of BPD, but my recovery is the fact that I don‚Äôt cry myself to sleep and I‚Äôve started to love myself again, I‚Äôve found and fostered hobbies that help me identify who I am without mimicking others‚Äô personalities. 

My advice for anyone  struggling with BPD, and losing hope, is to constantly remind yourself that managing it is possible, that you aren‚Äôt alone and there are people out there who will support you and remind you that you are a human being with emotions and that you are more than your diagnosis. You have a future, managing BPD is possible, you have a place in this world and you deserve to be happy. 

If anyone needs someone to talk to or vent to and you don‚Äôt have anywhere else to turn, my inbox is always open.",stalkercat21,fxm4t2
232,"I got sick of my thought patterns and became determined to work on myself. I took steps of placing boundaries with people despite my attachment or perceived ""need"" of them. I came up with an idea of how I wanted my future to look and how I wanted to be treated in a relationship and I focused on that. I cut a lot of ties with toxic people. When I notice toxic behaviors in a person I cut contact before developing a connection with them. I got lucky and my medication helps a lot with my anxiety. I don't act out on emotional impulses anymore. I focused on being healthy and taking care of myself. Exercising, eating healthy, finding time for my hobbies, etc. I am now 30 years old and am just now feeling content with life. I've quit dwelling on the past and refuse to allow any victim mentality. I learned from the past but dwelling on things isn't going to help me have a positive mindset. When I start to feel down I try to focus on all the things I am thankful for. I want to be a good mom and I don't want my mental health issues to cause me to not be able to be the kind of mom I want to be. Putting my kids first is a priority and helps me to not have a favorite person to obsess over. It's been a really tough journey but I am glad that I put in the work and figured out how to get this far. I hope to be able to keep this going. I'm not sure that I will ever be truly ""recovered"". And I don't think I could have done this without the help of medication. I fought taking meds my whole life and now I wish I had done it sooner. I realize it's not for everyone though. Oh and I got rid of facebook. Trying to get as far away from negativity and drama as possible.",,fxm4t2
233,"
Honestly, there‚Äôs a lot of recent factors that I feel have caused a huge change in my BPD symptoms, but the biggest change for me so far has come from getting clean. Long story short, I went to rehab this past November after a 10+ year issue mainly with alcohol. One week from today will mark 5 months without drinking. The first week in rehab was nasty going sober cold turkey, but I was cooking for myself again, I was going to the gym 5-6 days a week, I began sleeping better, I was bonding with other women after isolating for years, I had a therapist, and I kept a journal. I also began a gratitude journal, every night before bed I recounted something that happened that day that I was proud of, and 5 things in my life I was thankful for. Being able to take stock in the positives of your life really does make a difference.
My symptoms are by no means ‚Äúcured,‚Äù I still have bad days and struggle with coping mechanisms, but as a whole everything has become so much more manageable. I‚Äôm taking care of myself and nurturing relationships. I‚Äôm able to talk myself down from huge panic attacks instead of just waiting an hour for it to end. I‚Äôm also forced to replace all the time I‚Äôd spend drinking and going out (aka prime impulsive decision and reckless behavior time) with productive things that make me happy (making art and music, streaming, training my dog, spending time with my sisters & nieces).

ETA: To make this more relatable for ppl who may not be dealing with substance abuse issues because I know my answer is wildly specific: Basically, I replaced a largely destructive ‚Äúcoping mechanism‚Äù with manageable productive habits through means of therapy. Cutting out alcohol allowed me to reevaluate who I am as a person, and I‚Äôm allowing myself to engage in things I actually like doing. It‚Äôs still an ongoing process, and like I said I definitely still have bad days. But now, I‚Äôm better about taking my medication. I‚Äôve learned how to diffuse the negative self-talk and feel comfortable reaching out for help when I need it. I‚Äôve *finally* been given a glimmer of hope in regards to my BPD and bipolar symptoms and I don‚Äôt plan on letting that slip away any time soon.",greygrave,fxm4t2
234,I definately am no where near recovered but I am a lot better than I was & I would say yhqt recieving my diagnosis helped me a lot.

But now I kinda understand myself better I feel more in control.,LostWinterKitt3n,fxm4t2

236,"Becoming an adult has nothing to do with recovery. Definitely not, unfortunately. Mine is getting a lot worse with age as more difficult experiences pile up.

I have done a lot of DBT ($$$$$$$$) and tried many different medications and none of it has worked for me unfortunately. I can say medication usually makes it a lot worse.

I don‚Äôt believe that full recovery is possible because it is a personality disorder. Some traits can‚Äôt be worked away. But management is possible for sure. You can‚Äôt expect someone who lives w a personality disorder their whole life to ever do a full 180 and change. Tendencies will still exist - but the borderline can manage them so it appears to others that they are ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù. A manageable life is possible.",,fxm4t2

along of course with practicing my skills. something that‚Äôs been really good for me is writing about my feelings and the actions i want to take when i‚Äôm really uncomfortably angry or sad, and rereading it after when i‚Äôve calmed down a little. puts things into perspective for me. if that makes sense. and this page , i usually don‚Äôt get much engagement but it‚Äôs a nice place to talk and know that someone will at least see it.",tryin2Balivetbh,fxm4t2
239,"I don‚Äôt know if I count, because I do my best to control myself at any cost, so is that recovery? I have no idea. But I‚Äôm 31, and I developed this disorder in my early teens. 

For me, I guess I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù in that I believe I‚Äôll have to keep a hold on myself as much as I can. I‚Äôm medicated for MDD and severe Anxiety, so that helps somewhat. 
I used to be very scared to tell anyone the name of what I have, but now I‚Äôm working on being more open with family and friends. I‚Äôm an adult person, I don‚Äôt have to hide things from them anymore. I‚Äôm lucky that I have my mother who respects my privacy, my space and the need to look after myself. I always think I‚Äôm a bit shit at doing that part, and I‚Äôm probably right. I should look after myself more, I need a lot of therapy still, and that would alleviate some symptoms I think. 

The behaviours I displayed as a teenager were not great towards myself, I was always more of an internally angry person. Lots of blame, and self destructive shit that I was already getting from an abusive parent. In my twenties, it turned to the kind of thing where I stopped hurting myself. But I sure did drink and I guess after I was left by my first major ex, it all went a bit insane. 
25, I tried more drugs I hadn‚Äôt ever tried and probably wouldnt again, but I wanted to escape my head. I was jumping into bed with people not thinking of their OR my feelings on the matter. 
And then it really hit the fan, and my dissociative episodes ramped up to a point where I was losing time at work, I lost a few jobs in a row. 
But by my 27th, I was out of another major relationship, abused and lied to horribly. And things didn‚Äôt go well for a while then either. 



The things that happened I mostly had a control over my wildest behaviour so it only negatively affected me. However that doesn‚Äôt mean I think I didn‚Äôt hurt anyone. I‚Äôm sure I did. It was only until my 25th that I truly tried my hardest to never hurt anyone again. 

So in recap, I went from self injury and eating disorders as a teen, and into my twenties as a sexually charged person who needed the validation. I can admit that now. Hell, I worked as a cam girl at that point, I couldn‚Äôt stop the good feeling I got for having people who liked me. 
And now I‚Äôm early thirties. Not sexually adventurous or wild, not dissociating as badly as I used to. Putting people first no matter the cost. I dont want people to be attracted to me anymore, and I‚Äôm honestly better off on my own. Maybe that‚Äôs sad. But there‚Äôs no bigger red flag to the bull that is my borderline, than a relationship. I refuse to do it. It won‚Äôt help either person, and I‚Äôve tried quite a few times now. I‚Äôm okay with being alone now. 
So I guess recovery is not physically hurting myself, not sleeping with people i had no feelings for, and no drinking. No ridiculous spending.  No self sabotage. And if it costs me some time around others, that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs worth it for me. 


Recovery is a weird word for me. I was always told there wasn‚Äôt a recovery available for me. So I just kind of shrugged and agreed, and then found a different way of not having it affect anyone I love. Recovery is different for everyone. The borderline is absolutely there, but I‚Äôm able to get inside and away from people if I need to cry or have a meltdown. No one else has to see that.",thebearofwisdom,fxm4t2
240,"Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm fully ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù I‚Äôm still improving day by day. I started DBT a couple months ago and that‚Äôs helped for sure but what‚Äôs helped me the most is doing shrooms, not joking. I took a pretty heavy dose and tripped intensely for a few hours and came out with a whole new perspective and understanding of the universe, I felt grateful to be alive for the first time in so long. life is a gift, all our fears are illusions. I felt like this for a few days but my old thought patterns started to take hold again after a few days so I did shrooms again impulsively and learned more about myself, this time, instead of reverting to my old routine I went to my too neglected creative pursuits; painting, playing guitar... I let go of the fear that was keeping me from pursuing them and decided to enjoy them for once fully with my whole self, this state of mental freedom is intensified and revealed on a shrooms comedown but difficult to access when sober and have toxic thought patterns. Through this newfound freedom and the things I‚Äôve been able to create since I‚Äôve finally proven to myself my own worth without even trying, because I‚Äôve finally let go of any standard of I have for myself.

Recovery looks like the dbt skills and mindfulness being habits I do automatically each day without thinking much. Knowing what works in each kind of emotional flashback automatically and doing what worked last time. Being neutral or supportive to myself. It means being able to stabilize in 5 minutes for small triggers and a few days to a week for big ones. It means knowing myself, having a built up confidence and identity, and secure relationships (that I still occasionally avoid and doubt but I can stop myself from trashing or testing them).

It may seem silly or small (it did to me at first, anyways), but it legitimately helps get it touch with what's going on in my brain for a sense of control. Meditation may look differently for different people; you need to find a version that works for you. 

I use a SAD light lamp and pretend I'm sunbathing on the beach, relaxing, taking deep breaths, feel my chest rise, fall. Feel my legs get heavy. Think about goals. What do I want to think about myself? Who am I? Am I my body? My ideas? My role in society?

If anything notable came to mind via self reflection, research, or therapy (DBT highly recommended) , I would write it all down as soon as I could. I would then try to act on the new information, and start the cycle anew. It was a very iterative process

Over time, I built a mental model of the stubborn, almost unchangeable, parts of my brain. That, combined with my finely tuned behaviour, has immensely helped me navigate difficult emotions.

I will say, this process requires some understanding of mindfulness, and is greatly benefited by an ongoing mindfulness practice. The root of this approach is mindfulness. The sooner you start working on your mindfulness, the more you'll be able to step away from your emotions and self observe

Slowing down took a while, and took some therapy. At first, I was at this point where I would do something and later I'd say, ""oh, that went really badly."" My pdoc would reassure me that it was progress, and we worked on finding ways to slow me down until now I'm at the point where I can ask myself ""Okay, what is it I need? Will this get me what I need? Will there be negative results if I do this? If so, what could I do instead?"" That may sound simple, but it took a while. During that, when I'd get upset, I used a lot of affirmations from DBT workbooks, stuff like ""This is hard but it won't last forever"" or ""things feel bad but I am in control."" I didn't always believe them but I'd sort of repeat them to myself and found them soothing.

The mindfulness had helped me a lot, especially with interpersonal stuff. I had some awareness of my symptoms, as I am sure many people do somewhere along the way. I think noticing what brought on symptoms and what was driving them, what I was thinking and feeling, all of that helped me understand it well enough to see that there were bits I could change. As an easy example, last time I felt insecure about a friendship I was very angry and my instinct was to blow up and end the friendship, but I was able to say ""wait, I really care about this person and don't WANT this to end. I'm just afraid and feeling vulnerable."" I was able to slow down the conversation and I was more emotionally honest, and it let me move away from that splitting to preserve a friendship I value. I think that over all, understanding what's driving me to feel like I need to do something, at the base level, helped me to be open enough to do the stuff workbooks and therapy suggested, where before I was kind of in the mindset of ""this feels pointless and isn't helping me.""

I hope that's somewhat helpful! I saw you got some other really positive responses as well -- it's great to see everyone sharing their process and I hope you find something in that which is helpful to you! :)",torgoboi,fxm4t2
277,"Basic mindfulness exercise is to close your eyes and just focus on what sounds you hear around you. As you hear the sound, assign a source immediately, and resume focusing on the sounds. When you notice that you're no longer paying attn to the sounds, consciously turn your mind back to paying attn to the sounds

Every time you hear a sound, assign a source, and go back to listening, you're training your ability to be mindful

Every time you notice you're not paying attn, and turn your brain back to the original thoughts, you are training your brains ability to stay mindful. 

Working on staying mindful first might be best

278,"That‚Äôs a very accurate way to describe it.. yes.  Definitely not something I would recommend as a means of finding recovery, but effective in its own way for my unique personal journey.  Thanks for starting this thread... it‚Äôs been an interesting read.",humanbinchicken,fxm4t2
279,"To be fair I still regret a lot of decisions I make. Like, *a lot*. But there's two sides to this coin; sure, when that guilt and regret goes unchecked it ain't good, but I can be comfortable in that I know it makes me a more compassionate person, with critical thinking skills and an acute awareness of the consequences of my actions... so long as I'm *aware*, consciously harness it to my own means, and remember I'm not always right in my judgements. This next parts a bit of a rant but whatever.

This awareness is, for me and soooo many people, one of the biggest reasons we're able to recover at all. It doesn't have to be a bad thing, and I think fighting against aspects of myself-- instead of knowing myself and working with them-- has done me a lot of harm. A lot of the times the sort of unconventional thinking mental health issues bring is put into a dichotomy: shame vs romanticization: 'that's strange/ unproductive/ unnerving/ not profitable' vs 'wow it's so beautiful and amazing and will fix the world when you let it come out totally unfiltered with all the pride you can muster'. The truth I think I'm privileged enough to have realized is that both sides of that dichotomy are just ways to avoid addressing the uncomfortable truth-- unconventional thinking has utility, we just don't recognize it because it's utility that's systemically devalued. And not recognizing it directly translates into not understanding it. It's all connected to a larger problem of how much of the human race is losing communication skills, becoming less resilient to trauma, losing the ability to understand ourselves as we are because the modern world makes a story about what a human is supposed to be, one that doesn't fit with a reality we can see **so long as we know how**.

282,"You might've heard this already, but honestly mindfulness. Practicing deep breathing methods every day trains your brain. There's this thing called ""wise minds"" I learned from therapy and it's basically using mindfulness to recognize the logic of the situation you're in, and the feelings you have, and making a decision based on considering both. It requires considerable practice though and doesn't work the way a lot of people think it does; for example, it's better to get into wise minds imperfectly, half way, than it is to mull over why you're unable to do it fully. The most important part of wise mind is acceptance, which often looks like noticing those thoughts that taunt you to ruminate but not allowing them to lead you down that track-- and not judging yourself too much when they do... and not judging yourself too much when you judge yourself... just accepting your thoughts as they are, even when you can't. 

Because doing that makes you way more able to change them. We can train our brain to think certain ways. We can learn to choose which thoughts are the ones we listen to, act on, and which ones are just chatter. It's also simply about making a choice. Last night I didn't know whether to respond to all the comments this post was getting, or get high and play animal crossing, but I had to trust a gut feeling that I wanted to do the latter, even if it made me feel like a bit of a dick. I never would've just trusted my gut so simply before, I'm always suspicious of my instincts, but developing trust in them is one of the best ways to know when you should follow them. I've been having a lot of trouble recently with feeling like I'm wasting time when I smoke and end up not doing anything substantial, so I'll often just lay around high as hell regretting that I can't think of anything sufficient to do, so deciding on something to do despite the risk of not enjoying it was a small victory. 

Making sure my brain knows it's a victory even if I didn't enjoy what I was doing after is the important part, because it motivates me to make more decisions in the future. This is especially important for me because my brain inhibits my dopamine, which means I have trouble feeling rewards for completing tasks and things. So, **TL; DR** brain training is what helps, and it's a constant process.",tubularical,fxm4t2

307,"Tbh I‚Äôve kind of low key suspected for a while that long term rejection from asperger tendencies to say the least may have eventually led me to develop what is almost definitely bpd. And it checks out because one of the key criteria is chronic invalidation which is definitely what I experienced, not to mention I have one of each disorder on each side of my family, plus ocd and alcoholism on both. Fun times. 

I do kind of feel like my extreme difficulty at properly expressing myself and understanding the way people are supposed to relate to one another and what is and isn‚Äôt appropriate to say led to decades of such intense rejection that I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore and it blossomed into full blown bpd, a lot earlier than I knew the word for it. Funnily enough I did a book report on a factual book about bpd in high school which looking back was a pretty odd thing to do. I remember I realized as I was walking to the front of the class that I‚Äôd forgotten to make a visual aid so I grabbed my teachers scissors on the way up to represent self-harm and got half credit for it, lol.

I‚Äôve never talked about this before and it‚Äôs weird for me to even address it, I was just so blown away that someone else thought there was precedent for autistic tendencies to develop into bpd. Who knows but it honestly makes a lot of intuitive sense to me. Life‚Äôs a trip.

321,"First thing that came to mind reading this is somewhat sad: I don't really think there is recovery  with having BPD, it's mostly learning how to cope and live your life with it.

On the flip side, I try and think about my BPD as just another part of me. Instead of fighting to get rid of it, I'm trying to accept with it and live with it, learning how to make it work for me instead of against me. Example: having BPD has made me so much more emotional, thus making me able to connect with people emotionally that other's aren't really able to do. This opens up so many doors for me to be able to be close with people and help them in ways that others might not be able. 

I'm on a lot of medications as well, and therapy helped me get to a somewhat healthy place in my life with BPD. I'm 24 now, had it since 15. I'm not gonna say it gets easier, and I'm convinced it won't, but you learn to roll with the punches and appreciate the good that it can come out of it while learning to cope with the bad. There isn't a ""normal"", and we don't know what others go through that can make their life difficult as well. Just be proud of yourself that you made it this far with BPD! It's such a difficult condition to have, and we are stronger for surviving each and every day with it. We get hit with the tough bumps that might seem minor to other people but it's ok for it to feel like the end of the world for us; I let myself feel the emotion, as long as I can find the will to keep going.

384,"Individual therapy did not help me as much as I wanted it to, DBT trained or otherwise. Did you happen to take it in a group? This type of therapy really has more effect in group settings with structured skills review versus just going over individual problems or scenarios week after week. 

I REALLY want to kind of zoom in on your comment about DBT doing fuck all with a bit of reassurance: the brain will not feel better after a ""short course"". There is a video on YouTube about a man that rigged his bicycle to go the opposite direction when steering. He wanted to see how long it would take to learn to ride it confidently the new way, after decades of riding a normal bike. Every day was hard, and he fell a lot. After a year of practice and feeling like he'd never make progress, he woke up one morning and his brain just snapped into gear. He rode the bike with no problems.

I know it sounds cheesy or maybe obvious that ""practice makes perfect"", but think about how many different parts of the brain are required to ride a bike? You've got motor skills, steering, paying attention to surroundings, balance... And all this happens seemingly on autopilot, until you change the steering directions and realize just how much brain function you're using. Behavioral therapy is no different, you've been functioning on autopilot in BPD mode for so long that anything new feels impossible.

The key to rewiring the brain is repetition -  the brain must be exposed repeatedly to the skills, and it won't even feel like it's working for the first few months. In fact, you're probably going to be spending a lot of time going through the motions and ""faking it"" -- this is NORMAL in recovery. It won't feel like it's done a damn thing until one day you wake up and your brain naturally demonstrates a new autopilot skill. Then another. And another. 

Lastly, I'll add that the guy tried to go back and ride a normal bike again after learning the new way. His brain took HOURS to latch on to his old motor skills, and he fell quite a bit. He reverted faster than he learned, so this demonstrates the need to rebrush on skills when you start to feel low to avoid relapse. However, it is comforting to know your brain CAN process under a new autopilot.",,11oqti6

442,"TW: I might sound like a c*nt

My psychiatrist considers me somewhat recovered and I also considers myself as such 

I know when people talk about recovery in terms of BPD, they mean not having the PD or actively fighting against it.

For me, it just means not being ashamed of it anymore,I'm a borderline through and through, my PD matches my actual Personality. My symptoms are just facets that I don't really mind.

They used to be really destructive for me when I used to be ashamed but now i'm not anymore, I don't feel shame any longer even After an episode, I've accepted all parts of me, I have a solid ethical values that I stick to, other than that I just live my life as angrily and happily as possible :)

If somebody doesn't like that, i don't really care as long as they're not being ableist.

Some symptoms are obviously hard, but the positives far outweigh the negatives.

Ever since I've just gone with the flow instead of forcing myself to be something I'm not, I've been able to build great connections with people, granted they're as disordered as me, I have a great partner, I study in a field I like, my psychiatrist is proud of me and I've started repairing my mother's relationship with me. 

Also i can fully live my symptoms (within ethical boundaries) which is honestly relieving ! I know that since i don't actively push down rage to appear normal, now when i have an episode, I know I won't just choke that person because they didn't give me my pen back in time :)

I even live out the emptiness, fortunately it doesn't last long these days, but i've come to see it as a welcome break when it rears its head for a short time only!

I feel great on the inside and if I make life worse for some people on the outside, I can evaluate if it's ok or not and take appropriate measures. Things really got easier and I don't feel like i'm trapped anymore.

Big love to my emotional dysregulation and all my other symptoms, they really make my life into an improptu rollercoaster and I never hate it.

My psychiatrist said on our latest appointment that whilst the severity of two of my symptoms (self harm and instable sense of self) went down, I still have the whole chart and I'll probably never not have BPD as I show some severe symptoms and I'm very treatement resistant.

There IS a self amplifier factor to our pain and struggles. When I‚Äôm disregulated AF, among many things I‚Äôm also making my experience of life worse for myself (and others I care about). This leads to added guilt, shame, humiliation, embarrassment about how I acted and what I said, that I have to bear going forward, and it makes everything a bit worse going forward. And I‚Äôm a bit more marginalized, excluded and rejected going forward, which of course makes for more frequent triggers and feeds the beast. 

If I somehow keep my shit bottled up and managed enough to not fuck everything up, I‚Äôll still feel horrible as usual on the inside, but everything external would be a bit less fucked up, and I‚Äôll appear to be a normal person with normal emotions, which will bring a slightly better experience of life going forward. Then the next time a situation comes along, in theory if I somehow keep it regulated again, things will get just a bit better, and maybe I would feel slightly less horrible during and after, and so on.

In my case, there are still symptoms I struggle to navigate, but time and therapy have helped to make them seem less crippling. There are bad days, and those bad days are worse than they would be for someone without this disorder, but they no longer feel like the end of the world. I also noticed that things like work my ability to not destroy relationships have improved a lot, and I think having less chaotic surroundings contributes to being able to tolerate the pain.

Because of my BPD though i‚Äôve isolated myself completely, i make sure i‚Äôm never ever seen or heard by my housemates, i don‚Äôt speak to my family and have zero emotional connections to anyone at all, though i‚Äôm friendly with people. and i‚Äôm totally okay with this, i‚Äôve always been a recluse and i know that the only way i can truly heal and live the rest of my life in peace is if i limit the connections i have with other people as much as possible. 
i have a cat and i have no issue hooking up with people whenever i‚Äôm feeling it (maybe once every few months) so i‚Äôm not deprived of love or intimacy, i just know that my disability isn‚Äôt compatible with being around people all the time, and i much much prefer being alone or socialising with cats as dumb as it sounds. 
it‚Äôs so weird to be stable though isn‚Äôt it? i feel like i‚Äôm waiting for something to go terribly wrong, or i feel like my bpd isn‚Äôt even real but like‚Ä¶ even though i‚Äôm fine and thriving, my thriving state is what most would consider torture, but this is peace for me. no one to speak to me in the wrong tone, no one to pretend to love me and then use me, it‚Äôs so good and i never ever intend to create intimate relationships either platonic or romantic until and only if i ever get in to remission and even then i‚Äôd be terrified of a relapse",poppedthecorn,zx4s6g

469,"All through my 20‚Äôs were chaotic and very self destructive. I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with BPD until about 22-23. They started me on CBT and ECT. (ect was for my major depressive disorder) I had multiple hospitalizations, a suicide attempt and terrible financial management. I couldn‚Äôt keep friends for very long, let alone romantic relationships. The world was shit, I was shit. 

I am now in my thirties. I can manage my emotions with much more ease. I‚Äôm aware of my thoughts and emotions and where they stem from. I struggle here and there but it‚Äôs NIGHT and DAY in comparison to my 20‚Äôs. Reckless spending has ceased. Relationships and friendships actually last. I have some depressive dips here and there but they‚Äôre much easier to manage. I no longer self harm. I struggled with some alcohol a few weeks ago but I immediately worked with my psychiatrist and nipped it in the butt. (I was alcohol free for 5 years) I still have FP intrusive thoughts, jealousy thoughts, abandonment thoughts, but I talk myself through them with as much rational as I can.

470,"Basically from 18-21 I was undiagnosed and doing ever bad BPD thing until I was hospitalized and had to see a psychiatrist. It‚Äôs been 3-3.5 years since being diagnosed and recovery has been nonlinear. Started with regular psychiatry appointments and meds, then intensive outpatient group therapy which helped me control a lot of the BPD symptoms. After that I decided to stop taking meds after feeling stuck in a rut and do ketamine, shrooms, and a lot of lsd for like 7 months. Then got schizophreniform from doing mdma and lsd together and wound up in a psych ward, put on meds and saw my psychiatrist more frequently. It‚Äôs been over a year since that happened and I‚Äôm finally feeling ok, some minor slip ups but overall good and I‚Äôm back at university.

471,"My life has drastically changed. Ive mentioned it on this subreddit multiple times. I started EMDR in May of this year, and prior to it I read a ton of stuff online about how quickly people see a change in themselves, but I was skeptical. Well, after 10 sessions so far, I can‚Äôt imagine my life without EMDR at all. After about 5 sessions I noticed the drastic change. 

I haven‚Äôt split on anyone, or had any sort of rage episode since June. I developed feelings for someone and it was actually healthy, yes they lingered on my mind but I communicated with them in an appropriate way, at the appropriate times, and avoided them becoming an FP all together. I don‚Äôt think ever in my life I‚Äôve had a healthy crush on someone, and experiencing it was incredible. I still have lots to work on but having those two biggest struggles of mine become less of a burden in my life has given me so much hope for my future. Another thing I have noticed since EMDR is my sensitivity when it comes to online comments, Reddit is a perfect example. Before, someone could say something mean to me or simply disagree with me in the comments of social media and I would dwell on it and feel this pain in my chest, then I‚Äôd spiral. Now, I really could care less. It honestly blows my mind at how unfazed I get.

Now, that being said, I was diagnosed in February 2017 at age 23. Recovery from BPD is no walk in the park and typically takes years to recover from. I tend to compare it a lot to addiction, because of the amount of relapsing and lack of support due to stigma. It was a hard road, many lost friends and relationships and I truly believed I was doomed forever, especially because I failed with DBT so many times, my future truly looked dark.",,xvmshs
472,"Did a year of ECT to break the depression I'd had my whole life (March 2017-March 2018) and then I could see what was actually going on and not just treading water, trying to stay alive.

In 2018 to 2019 I did DBT (for the second time!) and was well enough and ready enough to fully absorb everything. I realised a lot about the scope of my emotions and came to learn that I'm not painting with the full pallet of emotions that most other people do, but the ones I do feel I feel very deeply. I had to learn how to be a human and I like to make jokes that I'm something inhabiting a human suit, learning how to person because it was very much like that...Like, learning DEAR MAN...why does it matter how I go about it so long as I get what I want? Turns out it's because you damage the relationships with people around you and those people have feelings we have to take into account...even if we don't actually care about those things...and that way those people will want to stay around us.

After DBT I did Schema which was *so* enlightening but very emotional. Definitely see why you do the DBT first, lol. I wouldn't have had the skills to handle the emotion otherwise. Schema helped me answer a lot of questions as to how I got this way and why my BPD looks how it does.

I've been out of all therapy (including individual therapy) for two years or so and it's great. I'm single (have been for ages) but ready should romance arise, and I'm maintaining a few close friendships. I'm socialising more than I have in years, thinking about my spirituality, living in my own space (heavily subsidised by family as it's on family property, for which I'm grateful), and doing my own thing.

There is life with BPD. I do still feel emotion very strongly but I know how to manage that now. I do still misstep and upset people, and people still upset me, but we do our best to be accountable and keep our side of the street clean as much as we can. This is a complex disorder that really does form you -- I mean, the P is for PERSONALITY, lol, it's entrenched! -- and the impact it's had on my life was very hard, but I also appreciate it, in a way. I got to learn how to be a person, I got to learn good skills that even a lot of ""healthy"" people don't have, and I wouldn't swap that for anything.",elegant_pun,xvmshs

474,"I read this as what would recovery look like for you haha. Anyway I don't think I am in recovery yet, just way better off objectively although my brain likes to tell me otherwise, and it probably differs from person to person. 

But for me, I still experience highs and lows but it's less intense. And when I experience them, I've replaced unhealthy coping mechanisms with much healthier ones (meditation as opposed to self-harm). Self-harm used to be daily for me at my worst. Now it's maybe 2 times a year if it gets really bad. 

Keeping in mind that in life bad things happen and nothing is static, the ability to bounce back from bad events is better too. Although I was recently in the psych ward, and ability to get out faster was due to the support of my friends, my ex, my family and most importantly the fact that I've been seeing the same psychologist for years, it was also hey I know when things are bad enough that I need professional help and not being oblivious to the fact that I'm putting alot of responsibility on my friends and most importantly my ex, if I just asked them for support. In the past, I've lost friends because I would just be red-zoning so often and laying it all on them. And if the things that had happened to me recently had happened to me in the past, I would very likely be dead by now, by my own hand.

I was so frightened by the explanations of all these out of control borderline people but all the things I've done are to help me cope and hide and secretly mourn. I've only had manic in the form of anxiety that I can remember and my mother and I were arguing when it happened and I was so intoxicated with emotion she stopped me to look me in the eyes and record what was happening because I was sobbing and crying so hard. I did have rage but I never hurt anyone or broke anything, I paced and cried. I'm a crier. Everything makes me cry. Happy cry sad cry angry cry. 

But 99% of the time I have a very controlled appearance and I refuse to be described as anything by other people, Everything I hear someone say about other people becomes a fear of mine and I avoid looking like it and eventually accidentally avoid them so much I become like it.

I've had a very painful and very turbulent life as it is. And many of my hurts are not the result of my actions or beliefs, but all of those events caused such grief and emotional pain inside that I punished myself secretly for years. Constant self harm secretly and never for attention. I cut myself on my upper thighs because nobody would ever see it and I was stigmatized by my friends who said they cut and had it on their wrists where people could accidentally see it. üëÄ I tried to make my friends keep it secret, but they loved me so much they stood up for me and required me to comply. They made me take care of myself and I began asking for help and channeling my self hatred into self care routines and Journaling to sort my thoughts. 

Im almost 24 and My therapist said the reason it never got diagnosed is because of my self control and immense resiliency. I owe it all to Jesus who spoon fed my subconscious with conversations and teachings and songs that told me word for word at times how I can get better. Take every thought captive. We can do this. I might feel like cutting myself in 20 minutes or I might feel like eating some food for once, but in this present moment that I have freedom to choose to make it easy for myself when I don't have so much freedom and I'm in more pain than this current moment.

Especially, you know, I never knew I was being manipulative with gifts, I was just completely unaware, and you blew my mind.  I always give gifts, more than the people around me, and it confuses me because I think of it as a nice thing, but sometimes I think it makes people confused or uncomfortable.

529,"I'm saving this. You nailed it. 

I have started to suspect that an FP is someone with whom we try to PROVE our ""loveability"". I was abused as a teenager by my first boyfriend. I clung to the myth for a long time that he abused me because he didn't love me enough, and he didn't love me enough because I am innately unlovable. 

Every relationship I've had after that (friendships and romantic) have been a series of attempts to prove that I can be loveable enough, good enough, that I won't get hurt. If I am good enough, I won't get lied to, or cheated on, or stood up, or my feelings hurt.

Of course, in big and little ways, I am let down, lied to, and hurt by people and I respond with absolute rage because to me, they did all of that because I wasn't good enough.

The truth is, they did those things for reasons that didn't have much to do with me. They'd do those hurtful things to anyone.

532,Thanks for your post. I have also been in a relationship with my FP for 5 years and had a ridiculous rage outburst this morning. I am really embarassed and disappointed at myself atm because I was doing so well lately (at least towards others). Your words reminded me that I should focus on myself and deal with my issues because I have started being a toxic person in other people's lives once again. It feels like the neglected inner child is choking me on the inside.,Snuffie95,65p2xv
533,"Ahh I totally feel for you!  You're at the most agonizing part of the FP cycle in my opinion.   Usually it's best of friends, everything is right with the world, they're beautiful, amazing, etc ---> I show some kind of token of my love/appreciation usually a gift or a kind conversation ----> I perceive them as devaluing me in some way -----> I rage on them ---> I apologize profusely and experience a HUGE sense of relief when they accept my apology or at least don't leave me.

That period of time after showing the emotional anger is awful.  It literally feels like you're going to disappear!!   I usually have physical symptoms, huge amounts of anxiety, brain looping etc.   the FP usually is silent which makes me even more upset.   

This is exactly the cycle I am INTENT on breaking!   Btw.. the above cycle isn't usually quick.  It might be in the beginning but it can be a long time between ""events.""   

My heart goes out to you and just know that your friendship/relationship will probably survive this.  Please be gentle with yourself and going forward you know that you don't want to put yourself through this again.

534,"It's been a long time since I've really had an FP properly that I think I have outgrown the need for one in many ways. I think showing yourself that you can calm yourself down and also make yourself happy is so important that when the time comes where you meet someone you really like, you don't need them to be there for you all the emotionally. I've lost a lot of 'FPs' over the years due to different circumstances that aren't always BPD related, that I've lost the trust of giving someone my emotions to take of and to be my rock anymore. I've become my own FP in many ways, but I think what you wrote here is important to people who are too attached emotionally to someone in the unhealthy ways. ",LittleChaotic,65p2xv

543,"I like to think that my gifting comes from a really good place, and actually, part of it does.  I'm a naturally generous person.  The problem is when you start looking at the other person critically after the gift.  Did they not react the way you wanted them to?  Maybe they didn't thank you the way you wanted them to?  Maybe you'd actually like THEM to get a gift for YOU like that?  All that stuff is wrapped up in the gifting, at least for me.

And THIS SHIT IS SO HARD!!  One thing that I've noticed with this FP stuff is that it's almost like we don't have to explain it...WE ALL JUST FUCKING GET IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE SAME!!  I've read enough and shared enough with people over the years to know that we experience it all the SAME way.   Obviously the details are different but the emotions and the roller-coaster cycles and push-pull are all the same.  It truly is exhausting.",coffeenmeat,65p2xv
544,"I just found this thread / comment, as I am dealing with a friend with BPD. Our friendship is on the rocks and I am desperately trying to save it. 

Maybe I can help explain a little. My friend gives me gifts too, and it's crushing me. 

I don't want gifts. My home is free of clutter, I don't collect things, I don't like ""Things"" and ""stuff"". She loves to shop, and she sees things that make her think of me, and buys them on impulse, and gives them to me. On the surface, it seems I'd love them. I love dogs, so she sees a stuffed dog that looks like one of mine and gets it. But I hate stuffed animals, and my dogs destroy them anyway, and I have no room for them, and nowhere to display it. I don't want it. So now I have to either pretend to like it (which is inauthentic), or I have to say ""Thanks for thinking of me, but I really don't want this gift,"" which is impolite. I really hate being put in that position. I feel resentful.

And, now it creates an obligation. Now I feel that she wants a gift from me. I feel like I owe her one. So not only do I now have a thing I don't want, but now I feel manipulated, very subtly, like it's that much harder for me to say ""no"" to her in the future. ""Oh, you can't visit me? After I got you all those gifts, and THIS is how you treat me?"" 

I run a business, and one of the things we learn is that you NEVER make a customer feel like they are even slightly in your debt. You do the opposite. So, for example, when I go to a client's home, and they offer me a beverage, I accept it, because subconsciously, now I ""owe them one"", and they feel like I will give them better service. I never give them a pen or a magnet or any other gift right off the bat, because then subconsciously they ""owe me one"", and in the back of their minds they will wonder how I will make that up (jacking up my prices to cover the cost of that gift? Cutting corners?) It's TOTALLY subconscious, Nobody would ever say ""I gave you that glass of water so I expect top-notch service and a discount."" It's just a perception thing. But that is what giving a gift does. It is a subtle manipulation tactic to put someone else in your debt, to say ""You owe me one. Next time I need you, you're going to be there, right?"" 

Some people do this more overtly, and it's called ""loan-sharking"". For example, let's say you HATE country music, but I have an extra ticket to a country music concert, and I beg you to go with me because I don't want to go by myself. You finally give in. We go to the concert, and it's loud and sweaty and crowded and miserable. Then, next week, I tell you I need you too help me move. You say ""Oh, I can't, I'm busy that weekend."" I say ""What? After I took you to that concert for free? This is how you treat me? Anyone else would LOVE a free concert, and you can't even help me out."" So, you feel guilty and help me move - but you never wanted to go to the concert in the first place! See how that works? 
 
That's an extreme example but it might shed a little light. I would stop with the gift-giving entirely. I am desperately trying to find a kind way to tell my friend to stop giving me gifts. I know she will dismiss me and say ""Oh, I like it,"" but I DON'T LIKE IT, and I don't know how to tell her to stop without upsetting her.

Yeah I have the same - I feel nauseous and suicidal...And the silence is the worst, I always feel like I would rather have him be angry at me and not just disappointed! But I am giving him space. I apologized and now it is up to him. I accept that I can no longer have these so-called pity parties where I scapegoat and blame him for my feelings. How do you deal with such situations? Do you distance yourself, give your FP space?

Thanks for your kind words.

553,"Oh man, you really nailed it there.  I mean, I think of myself that way, too, like I'm just a generous, thoughtful person, right?  But (this is very embarrassing for me to admit), it was my birthday a few days ago, and it was really hard to handle how many people didn't even text me happy birthday or anything (and I think they knew it was my birthday), let alone didn't give me presents.

One person's birthday was the week before mine, and I organized a really awesome group gift with all these friends.  I think of him as a good friend.  He didn't even text me on my birthday, or anything, and he knew it was my birthday because his wife is a good friend and I'm sure she told him.

You know, in that situation, though, is it wrong to feel hurt?  So much of this is confusing because we know we're prone to disproportional feelings, right?  It's hard for me to put into words, but isn't it hard to know when our hurt feelings are justified?

in this particular case, he isn't my FP (though I do feel somewhat insecure with nearly everyone I know, like uncertain if we're really friends or not -- this is common for us with BPD, right?) and I genuinely wanted to make him happy with that gift because he was going through a rough time.  i didn't expect anything in return, but a ""happy birthday"" text on my birthday would have been nice.

Then, like you said, they're just living their lives, he *is* busy and going through a rough time, a bit.  I don't know how to feel.

I wonder if other people spend as much time wondering if their feelings are correct as we do (assuming that is a common trait?  I imagine it's common if one is self-aware about having BPD).

But yeah, the gift stuff is terrible because: 1. it makes me wonder if I am really just being nice or setting up some kind of test for people; 2. it makes me feel pathetic and (this is where your post comes in) manipulative (which I didn't realize until your post, so thank you, seriously) 3.  some people DID give me presents and say happy birthday, and instead of just basking in how nice some of my friends are, for some reason I feel like I value their generosity less and I also just yearn for the people who I feel are ignoring me.  It really is exhausting, like you say, and it's sad, too.  It's a sad way to be.

I almost certainly am testing people with this stuff.  I didn't realize it somehow.  And also maybe trying to jumpstart a friendship, do you know what I mean?

People don't have to behave the way we want them to because we want them to.. and they hardly ever do!! Lol

P.S. - the point of my post is NOT to beat yourself up.  It's not to make yourself feel like shit or like manipulative person.    This is part of growth.  It sucks and it's painful and yes there are times when there's a lot of second guessing and self doubt.   But I have no doubt that you're an amazing friend with a generous heart.

I guess it is hard for us to lose control and feel helpless for a moment. On the other hand I can't imagine what our FP go through. So I think my FP deserves someone better. But this is just like what you said in your post. You have to deal with yourself first. I try to tell myself that even though I fucked up and even if my FP hates me atm (I am sure he doesn't) that does not define me, I am NOT a fuck-up in general. I am trying to think of times where I was ""good"" because right now I am splitting on myself? I go from seeing myself as the victim to seeing myself as the villain. Meanwhile, my inner child/ego is just overwhelmed and confused. Right now, I am trying to not be ""fake-empathetic"", so not telling my bf that I feel his pain and that I would break up with myself too...Hence not doing the whole self-fulfilling prophacy thing again.

587,"I am a recovering drug addict with BPD

Do u mean fully recover from BPD? Untreated BPD usually is in full affect for at least 10 years it gets better with age. But that does not at all mean that with treatment  it can't be managed and worked with and recovered from. DBT therapy is extremely helpful. If there is DAILY work being put in to emotional regulation there will be very positive results as early as 6 - 12 months. BPD is a pretty serious mental illness and it takes a LOT of work specifically on it. Without DBT skills its going to be really hard for progression to take place. It can be hard to stay sober too its been a long road for me in recovery. But yes, it can very easily become more manageable and once its more manageable it can very easily become almost non existent",wilfred6969,m3csdt
588,"It‚Äôs weird how they mention that recovery means that the person no longer meets the criterion‚Äôs for BPD. Idk where I have read this from but it was mentioned that peeps with BPD have a larger amygdala than ones who don‚Äôt and have an ig underdeveloped prefrontal cortex. Implying heightened emotions and lower self control or ig metacognition.

So idk if this helps but I have read a study done on meditation. Where they examined its effects on a 6 month duration after 30mins of it daily. Turns out the prefrontal cortex does increase in size by quite the amount.",LambertW2020,m3csdt

Not having a cure and having to work harder to live a fulfilling, productive and happy life doesn't mean we *can't* live a fulfilling, productive and happy life.

And to be even more specific i used to throw up 2-6 times a week, but now i dont get the urge to throw up anymore. At all. Back then i didnt have any healthy ways to deal with stress, emotions ans anxiety, and i thought i could never stop harming myself. But it is possible.

612,"I wouldn't say I ""recovered"" but I can say I'm *recovering*! Im in a very healthy relationship, coming up on 6 years now. I have a fairly civil/cooperative relationship with my ex-husband so we can effectively coparent our daughter. My daughter (9) is healthy and happy and we have a healthy and close mother-daughter relationship. I've been able to finish a certification course recently (with a 4.0!) and I sit for the AHIMA exam soon. 

My partner and I talk about our relationship and our feelings. We have disagreements but we don't ""fight"". I struggle sometimes with intrusive or paranoid thoughts, but I'm now usually able to ""back myself down from the ledge""  and during a particularly rough patch I can ask my partner for support-which he happily gives to me. I have friends. I have reconciled with my sister. 

Its hard. Its work, hard work too. I've found that it doesn't become ""less work"" over time, just a little more automatic and a little easier each time. I personally think recovery is just that-its just work, and it's a journey or path rather than a destination point. 

The work gets easier, but you have to keep doing it. BPD will always be there, you might struggle harder with some things than others, you may never stop struggling with something in particular, but you have to keep going. You have to keep working. Just like dishes or laundry or bathing, you just have to keep doing it.

615,">Hi everyone. I‚Äôm going to share with you what helped me recover from my bpd. I was in and out of therapy and hospitalizations for years. I dealt with my trauma, I learned the coping skills but something was still very wrong with my brain. Every little thing bothered me and made me upset and anything could be a trigger. My emotions were so intense it was as if something traumatic was happening to me everyday. I had extreme episodes of rage and sadness that I just couldn‚Äôt control. I was endlessly suicidal. I was self harming in extreme panic. During my last hospitalization, I was really out of control and I had delusional paranoia that the doctors and my family were conspiring against me.

&nbsp;

>It was horrible. The psych prescribed me an antipsychotic called risperdal in the ward that I had no choice but to take even tho I was terrified it would kill me or permanently disable me. As soon as I took it I noticed a sense of calm come over me almost like a benzo would. My thoughts stopped racing and for the first time i felt real relief from my brain without the messed up feeling from a benzo. When I got out of the hospital a week later I noticed I had blurry vision like as if I needed glasses. I couldn‚Äôt see the TV very well and reading or driving was impossible. It took about another 2 weeks for that side effect to go away.

&nbsp;

>It sounds scary, but honestly I felt so good from having relief from my brain that I was happy to deal with it. It‚Äôs 7 months later and I am thrilled to say that I am still stabilized. It feels like night and day difference and my loved ones see it too. The only other med I take is the lowest dose of Zoloft bc the risperdal helps with my anger/paranoia/panic and the Zoloft helps with the sadness. I have tried well over 15 different meds but I have finally found this golden combo. There is hope! And if you were like me, feeling like you just aren‚Äôt trying hard enough to get better and blaming yourself for being the way you are just know that sometimes your brain is actually sick and no matter how many therapy hours you put in and coping skills you learn it will never be enough until you find the right medication.

&nbsp;

>It‚Äôs not your fault! Don‚Äôt give up! I hope this post inspires at least one person to keep going and trying to recover from their bpd. Love to all.

618,"Yeah my extreme low were destroying my life but the numbness was destroying me even more physically with foods. I used to binge eat regularly but when I was on medication (antidepressants, antipsychotics mood stabilisers) all I did it was make it easier to go out buy the binge food, eat it one go and then get more to replace it.",BlueEyedGenius1,nhaykw
619,"Yeah, I think half of the difficulty of recovery is reconciling with the fact that it is boring and it is long and it is difficult. It's so much simpler to be self-destructive and surround yourself with drama than it is to try and build yourself as a person. Half of my self-destructiveness comes from this deep-seated questioning and dislike of who I am, and sometimes it just seems a lot easier to implode and have this flurry of drama around me at all times rather than develop as an individual. But at the same time, I also think it's worthwhile to recognise the need for impulsivity and stimulation that seems to be pretty consistent among people with BPD, but try and channel it into something productive rather than unhealthy coping mechanisms. Like some people might be content working a nine to five in the same office for years on end. That's not me. Some people might be content with unpassionate relationships. That's not me. And I've learnt those two things the hard way, by trying to deny my nature and feelings and repress a lot of things, before eventually retaliating with a spiral into self-destruction and developing a bad drinking problem. I think it's about balance ‚Äì looking for ways to satisfy that need for validation and excitement in a more constructive way. I always liked cooking and writing. I find both of them creative and rewarding, especially cooking for friends. I still drink and take drugs, but I'm trying to do both less often, or at least in a less self-destructive way. Like as an accompaniment for dancing, or drinking at dinner with family, or at special events. I think there's an element of trial and error; you gotta find out what works for you rather than shutting yourself off and isolating from the world because that hasn't worked for me yet. Go slowly, keep on reflecting, know your limits, talk it through with people you trust.",LowPlatform,9fv73p

622,"just to say - my life is a lot different right now because I‚Äôm trying to recover from BPD. I was way more involved in my social life, volunteered tons and pursued hobbies and new people - at the mo I‚Äôm out 2 times a week at best (if my lack of sleep or emotional state can let me!!), social life has halved... I‚Äôm even dressing differently now. muted tones!!!!

however - I strongly believe that this is part of the process AND isn‚Äôt necessarily permanent. underneath the BPD we still exist, and recovery is - for me anyway - trying to find the version of me that is true to who I am but can also function and help me achieve my long term goals/forget my past

I‚Äôm really sorry you don‚Äôt feel yourself now - but you are so brave and strong for continuing with your recovery. think of it as saving to buy something. right now you are saving for your future self. when you find that, you will realise you are who you thought you were - even if it feels different, because of your hard work and personal sacrifices, it will feel right.

I‚Äôd be working so hard to counteract my urges to tell that person off, and it felt like they got a pass to be as ‚Äúdysregulated‚Äù as they wanted. If your person is really invalidating towards your treatment or can not forgive your past transgressions, it might be worth it to move on or de-prioritize the relationship. 

I‚Äôm really proud of you for trying all those skills. You‚Äôre still so early in your journey with this, and it sounds like you‚Äôre really making an effort. Implementing the skills you referenced were really unpleasant for me when I first started (particularly feeling and recognizing the emotions). It was almost like experiencing drug withdrawal‚Äî feeling every bodily sensation brought on by the emotion intensely all at once, because I used to always push the feelings down or numb out. 

The boundaries thing can feel super uncomfortable at first, and can be met with a lot of pushback because you are interrupting a long standing pattern of behaviour or relationship dynamic.

I know I was resistant to treatment because of the stigma. It‚Äôs hard to ask someone to take on the identity of BPD when folks with BPD are routinely discriminated against.  To be honest, I didn‚Äôt do it until I had nothing left to lose. 

Having participated in a similarly intensive program, stateside, it was absolutely the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. It‚Äôs performing brain surgery on yourself with no anesthetic. Without the many, many privileges I had, there‚Äôs no way I could have done it.  I had the luxury of short term disability insurance covering my living expenses so I didn‚Äôt have to try to work at the same time. I also was fully immersed in recovery ‚Äî my program ran 7 days a week ‚Äî so I didn‚Äôt have to dip back and forth between therapy and real life.

702,"> What‚Äôs her perspective?

Not entirely sure to be honest. They are hard conversations to have, as I'm sure you know. I get a lot of negative responses when I try to talk to her about any kind of recovery and she's very reticent to talk to me about it generally, which I find hard to deal with.

She was officially diagnosed with BPD about 6 months ago. So that was a great first step. We were both long-time chronic users of cannabis at the time too but we've both given that up now. Obviously that was a lot easier for me than her.

She's also been assigned a 'case worker' who's only recommendation so far is to complete a 4 part 8 hour online discussion group. She's completed that now but it wasn't very helpful since it wasn't tailored for BPD but more for general mental health well-being. Generally she's dealing with things well, as well as she can I guess.

There's other unaddressed issues compounding her difficulties too though. Work and money problems, which doesn't help.

>Chances are your gf is working really, really, really hard just to stay alive. Adding the responsibility to discover new ways of functioning, and giving up what‚Äôs kept you alive, is a big ask.

I appreciate it's a big ask. I get that. I'm also aware she's said she doesn't want to feel like this for the rest of her life. Twixt the devil and the deep blue sea.

one of my biggest recovery goals though is learning to deal with jealousy/dependency/being alone. i have no issue being physically alone, but i for some reason cant bear the thought of being on my own, with nobody to turn to. i wanna be able to be my own support system, not that that's my ideal situation, because i'd like to have a support system that isn't Just Me, but i need to learn to be okay with being alone. my jealousy and codependency stem from my fear of being abandoned and being alone, so once i learn how to take care of myself and regulate myself then i know i'll be okay. that's all the recovery i'm focusing on currently. and once i make it there, we'll see!",oooyeahwooyeah,niqc2h

I started seeking referrals through UCLA and finally found someone who is truly a ""perfect"" match. I consider myself very blessed. 

I work on my DBT homework and practice the skills ALL the damn day long, EVERY day! For better or worse, that is what I know it is going to take for me to recover.

I had a dbt therapist for 2.5 years right after my diagnosis ‚Äîwhich was informal because my psychiatrist refused to document it because of the stigma concerns. The therapist has lots of years of experience and training with Marsha Linehan. Dbt changed so much for me

My therapist explained that basically BPD and cptsd are the same thing in terms of symptoms and of what treatments are effective, but the way professionals name things in the DSM is very convoluted and political process. She said the stigma is widespread amongst medical providers of all kinds and even amongst mental health care professionals! 

This made a big difference in the receptivity I had towards treatment.

It‚Äôs because your brain is so used to these highs and lows and the chemicals released during those are very addictive so when you begin to recover your brain still craves those dramatic changes even if they‚Äôre harmful. Without those mood swings life can feel boring and for some reason the human brain hates feeling bored even if the alternative is self destructive pain. 

 I also struggle with a lack of identity and not having those big mood swings leaves a lot of empty mental space that makes it harder to run from the fact that I don‚Äôt know who I am. When I‚Äôm in the moment wanting to do something harmful I just try to distract myself as much as possible with something I enjoy and something to give my brain a little dopamine without giving in to bad habits.

760,"I'm really sorry to hear this. I relate halfway - I'm pretty boring after recovery. My ""recovery"" amounted to cutting off all my close relationships, moving to a different country, and basically drifting around and keeping people at a distance for about 5 years until I felt emotionally stable. (I also got therapy, counselling, and did some CBT and am now on Sertraline, but that was all for depression and I never confessed to my therapists all the terrible, manipulative ways I would behave around those closest to me.) I like it this way and I feel much stronger on my own.

I do really feel you on losing some parts that felt like you, though. I used to be goth, and while I still wear only black and have maintained my goth interests, I don't look goth anymore. I originally gave it up for a former fp, and not getting it back feels like not quite being myself. I've lost some other interests and traits I used to really identify with, too. I'm gradually getting them back.

I'm not sure this will work for you because I'm not a psychologist, but I've worked on separating my ""aesthetic"" identities from the BPD traits and behaviours that I associated them with. People thought my self-harm and the way I dressed or the music I listened to were inextricably connected. I started to believe it, too. But there's no reason for that to be the case. Maybe you can separate out being spontaneous and fun from being volatile and impulsive? Like really convince yourself of the difference. Visualize yourself being fun and carefree and then notice how different it is from visualizing yourself having a BPD rage episode, or whatever epitomises the condition for you. Maybe do your hair/make up/outfit the way you used to one morning and see how you feel? I think so much of our identities are habitual - change your habits, change yourself. The 'old' you doesn't have to be a package deal.

Anyway, sorry for the novel; not sure it's helpful but I definitely relate.",,hd4tf6
761,"I¬¥m sorry :( Maybe where you are at is just a roadblock. Recovery is not linear. The second guessing and over analyzing and being unable to have fun and relax, being serious and worrying about consequences - this is where i am, not being in recovery. I struggle with this much more than impulse control, I guess I¬¥m the quiet type with some OCd/anxiety in the mix. I sure you are not at your finalized point of recovery. You don¬¥t have to stay where you are if you feel so uncomfortable. What are some things you¬¥d like to do that you feel you ruin now? I don¬¥t think life has to be stagnant or bland in order to be stable. you get to chose how much stability you want in your daily life and how much you want to take chances. do you have someone who you can talk to about this? a therapist or reasonable friend? Or look around if you notice people who are fun and carefree but dont seem to be self destrcutive. It sounds a little like your internal struggle and tension has shifted to different behaviour but some of it is still there.

for the looks thing. I relate to this internal conflict as much as  everything else you wrote. maybe you can find more creative ways to express yourself in your looks that are not motivated by shame or insecurity. Dressing sexy empowers some, modesty empowers other. I don¬¥t think there is a wrong or right, everything can be harmful if the intention is harmful. How you look can totally be an extention of your personality as long as it¬¥s nothing you depend on to feel comfortable or like yourself. If it did not matter at all there would be no issue in enforcing gender neutral clothing for everyone. But that¬¥s not right because everyone deserves to dress at they feel authentic. I love girly dresses but have friends who never dress up at all. Both is fine and I think the most balanced is when you dress as you feel you look like you but if you had to borrow clothes from a friend with the opposite style you¬¥d still be fine because it¬¥s not a safety blanket.

Today we are happily married and about to start trying for a baby. I am still seeing my therapist once a fortnight, but it's because of BPD unrelated stuff now. 
I still get BPD-y initial reactions to things, but in 99% of the time I can instantly take a step back and look at the situation realistically.",NormativeTruth,4poqu8
779,"I'm not completely out of the woods, but came to the startling and very scary realization that I had BPD in January.

The month prior, I had pieced together that my family and my upbringing were largely abusive and abnormal. My father has uBPD and despite my mother's desperate pleas for him to see a psychiatrist, he never would because ""how DARE you call me crazy!"". So we lived in a constant state of fear, hiding, and avoidance because if he got too angry, he would storm off in a fit of rage and wouldn't return for hours-days.

I realized that something was very wrong when I stayed with my at-the-time fiance's family (note: we are no longer together). His family was loving, supportive, and physically and verbally affectionate. 

In sharp contrast, I grew up in the emotional equivalent of a freezer. We were never told that we were loved, never hugged, never touched. We simply weren't a touchy family. I began to realize that statements like those were excuses for our abnormal, dysfunctional family dynamics.

Despite these realizations, my boyfriend and I fought more and more. He was codependent, I was codependent, we were isolated and miserable. He wasn't what I wanted or needed. I had settled into the relationship out of desperation, as I simply could not stand being alone. Unfortunately that came with a price--being with someone I was not truly compatible with.

Everything came to a grinding halt when I found out about BPD on Reddit. While he and I were in the middle of a vicious argument about I don't even know what, I came across a meme about an elderly woman telling a flight attendant to serve her whatever would kill her fastest as her children no longer spoke to her. Everyone immediately began to label this person as having BPD. 

Morbid curiosity got the better of me (Ooooh! Maybe this is like psychopathy! Interesting!) however when I read the Wikipedia article I was confronted with a list of symptoms that fit me to a tee--it was incredibly sobering and also terrifying. My at-the-time boyfriend cringed and agreed that it sounded like me.

The next day I told my therapist who told me she could no longer treat me. My boyfriend cried, broke up with me, and forced me to move out of our home because my mental illness was not his ""burden to bear"". The following week my psychiatrist urged me to find someone else. I ended up initially with a therapist who did not practice DBT and scolded me repeatedly for being emotional without offering any coping strategies. I was suicidal and hated myself more than ever for being mentally ill.

I eventually found my way to a psychiatrist who put me on a mood stabilizer. Around the same time I began going to the only DBT center in my city. This was around early March.

4 months later, I have made an incredible amount of progress. I have mended many scorched relationships and have started a few new friendships. I have picked up new hobbies and returned to old ones. I have committed myself to living a healthy lifestyle and work out nearly every day. I use my DBT skills daily. At first, they felt forced. With time, I found which skills worked for me. For example, PLEASE skills are very, very important for me. When I don't follow those, my moods become more labile and I am more prone to upset.

I still experience symptoms of BPD. I am still sensitive. I still dissociate when I'm really stressed. I still struggle with my identity. But I am aware of why those things happen now and have the skill set to get myself back on track when my emotional mind tries to get in the front seat.

As far as romantic relationships go, I haven't dated anyone seriously since my ex and I split. I don't know how or when that day will come, but for the first time in my adult life, I am okay with being single.

Shortly before my senior year i just grew out of it and although there were definitely some moments of issue after that I generally didn't do anything differently i just had better brain chemistry. 

Now as I am close  to someone with BPD I recognize how much of my depression recovery was probably just my body adjustment and not ""how I thought about thoughts"" or going outside more etc that I see people so often claim are miracle cures. 

I know however I was definitely in the ""do things differently and you'll be better"" camp until I lived next to real mental illness first hand. 

I guess point is that people need to understand that sometimes teens especially do have depression for a few years and then naturally grow out of it,  and thank their lucky stars because not everyone does.  They didn't do anything differently than those who don't grow out they just had different genetics or epigenetics or whatever it was in their case causing issues but more sun isn't going to magically correct a real medical issue",CharlesDarwin59,gdvbix

Bpd (as well as other disorders) naturally come with ups and downs. How can you (and anyone else feel free to chime in) tell the difference between getting better, versus a temporary bpd related high? How can you tell the difference between a temporary remission, and true progress forward?",,dmsl4m

836,"Way to go ‚Äî super excited for you. I have been in recovery and stable since finishing a round of partial hospitalization and a round of intensive outpatient therapy nearly two years ago. 

Know that recovery isn‚Äôt a straight line, it‚Äôs an upward spiral. When you encounter life‚Äôs challenges or changes, it‚Äôs common to experience more symptoms during the adjustment period. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre relapsing, just that you are adapting your recovery to a new situation. You know what works for you, and now you have a template to come back to if things aren‚Äôt working. 

Recovery for me is about knowing how to perform maintenance and repairs on my own brain machine. It‚Äôs not always at peak performance, but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot better than it ever was before. 

I found maintaining a group element to be key for me. When you‚Äôre not symptomatic, it can be so difficult to remember what it felt like. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôm in danger of being overtaken again. Hearing from people who are currently symptomatic is a powerful tool for my own self-awareness.",arithmetok,dgftt5

838,"> Maybe this is a small form of mania or something but Im enjoying it.

That made me laugh a little, because I can relate. 

I was diagnosed about 2 years ago, and I just recently finished a 10 month DBT course that truly changed my life for the better. 

Of course, I've still got issues. I always will.  This week they changed the bus schedule in my area, eliminating the earliest run which is the one that I rely on to get to work. I found this out on Sunday, and the changes came into effect on Monday. I was so upset. I could feel the fear grow inside me, like a balloon being blown up, that I just know is going to pop at some point. Immediately went to the worst possible scenario: I'm going to get fired. I'm going to lose my job and I won't be able to find another one and I'll run out of money and I'll lose my apartment and I'll end up homeless and and and and what the fuck is wrong with me, why don't I have a car like a *real* adult? I can't deal with this. Why am I even still alive. 

All of these thoughts, pretty much all at once, and the next thing I know I'm looking for a razor to self harm with. But then something was different. I had self awareness. It's like I could see it all playing out as it was happening. Am I really going to do this? After all this hard work I've done to *stop* doing this? I mean, I could. Would it solve anything? How would I feel after? How about the next day? Are these thoughts based on current reality or are they based on years of trauma?  What am I feeling right now? Fear. Shame. It's all valid but it's trauma-based. This is not really a life or death situation, it just *feels like it*. I didn't self harm. I decided instead to use my skill of distraction. I watched youtube videos. 

The next morning, the panic started to come back. I couldn't bring myself to  tell my boss I'd be late, catch the later bus. I took an uber to work instead. 

I did the same on Tuesday.

This morning I had to deal with the situation, because I am totally broke now (until I get paid tomorrow), so no money for uber. I texted him saying I'd be late, and then when I got here this morning I told him about the bus schedule. That I'd need to change my schedule. I didn't apologize, or cry, or anything like that. I just said it matter-of-factly. He was sympathetic, and said of course that's fine. The entire conversation took less than 5 minutes. 

I thought for sure that once I'd told him, no matter what his response was, I'd be a puddle of emotions on the floor. But I'm not. I actually feel perfectly fine! It feels weird, to not feel horrible. I'll take it though. ",drunken_superhero,6mv268

844,"It‚Äôs hard to gauge whether people are being supportive when A) we never sought ‚Äúnormal‚Äù levels of support and B) we tend to invite unsavory people into our life. It took me years to realize (and I am still realizing) that I built a horrible support system for myself. There was a reason I wasn‚Äôt getting adequate care even if the company friends. Like you, I feel like there is a lot people don‚Äôt know. It almost feels more natural for me to bottle things up or not update people on my life. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that when I scream, nothing comes up but the sun. I will deal with it alone and the next day life continues like nothing happened. And sometimes the same feels true of positive emotions and good news! There is probably balance to be found between those two worlds, but probably not before weeding out the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù you built for yourself while in the depths of BPD. It‚Äôs worth acknowledging that family often plays a huge role in the development of BPD, and that while you work on yourself, they may stay the same.

I met a bunch of people who were in similar situations as me and I really benefitted from the group talk therapy because we got to talk to each other and not just talking to a therapist/doctor. I was in IOP for two weeks. I spoke with my psychiatrist and she put me on a mood stabilizer (lamotragine). A month after that I quit my toxic job.

The thing that really hit me like a truck was when I admitted to the group that I just felt so *guilty* because they all had stories about domestic abuse, a homeless mother, dangerous situations, and I just didn't know what happened to me. I didn't feel like I had any kind of *trauma* that triggered my BPD. The lady next to me said (who had witnessed a friend die), ""Oh girl, nooo! Don't compare scars! My pain isn't more than your pain. Just because you don't know what happened doesn't mean it hurts any less.""  And the guilt just lifted off my shoulders.

I've also adopted a much easier manner with myself. If I start acting irrationally, I laugh and try to use my skills to get me ""unstuck"".

I distract myself a lot. When the dread/anxiety/general mental discomfort starts creeping in, I validate whatever emotion is popping up, reassuring myself that it's okay to be upset sometimes and either problem solve and/or use self-soothing.

For some, it is a physical limitation, others a health limitation, and still others a social limitation (e.g., being a member of a minority race/ethnicity in a society). BPD is most likely, although perhaps not definitely, a chronic condition, meaning it will always be with you. As xylosephone said, it is best to radically accept this (notwithstanding some future possibility of a medical cure). With commitment to (years of) therapy and acquisition of the proper tools, the condition can be managed and its severity and impact on your daily life minimized. Your quality of life can be greatly improved, even if the disadvantage is never eliminated. That should be a realistic and worthwhile goal.",bananasandsocks,5lyi3r
855,"I'm going to disagree with everyone here. Respectfully, of course!  BPD gets better over time naturally.  Also, the right therapy/therapist, in combination with medication, and perhaps lifestyle changes and insight, can absolutely lead to people  not meeting criteria anymore.  And if you don't meet criteria, you don't have the illness anymore.

Whether or not we would still have some issues, or fallout from years of living with the disorder (not to mention what caused it) is still up for debate.  Here are a couple of links for you:

856,"I *am* a recovering borderline. I baited and bit. I seduced and abused. I was severely abused as a small child and grew up with a nasty case of [C-PTSD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=c-ptsd) pretty much like every *other* borderline I have ever run into (which is now over 100). I am not responsible for my disease, but I am responsible for my recovery. This is how I did it:

1) Medications, but *only if really needed* to get one stabilized enough to do the next six things on this list: After wasting a lot of time with people who didn't know what they were doing, I found a board certified psychopharmacologist in my area by using the clinician locator on the *Psychology Today* website. I learned the hard way that getting psych meds from a GP or primary care doc can be useless or even risky. Psych diagnoses, meds and med interactions are just too complex now for most GPs and primary care docs. Important to understand:Some [SSRI-class anti-depressants](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=ssri%20antidepressants) *can* be helpful for anxiety, but have a potential for over-stimulation into at least mild [mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania)... as that *is* what they are: neuro*stimulants*. Low-dose-level [anti-psychotics]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) are often helpful for extreme anxiety, but that call should be made by a board-certified psychopharmacologist or specialized nurse practitioner. And very much likewise for the use of [benzodiazepines]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine), which have very high potential to induce [tolerance]( http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/drugs/factors-affecting-response-to-drugs/tolerance-and-resistance-to-drugs), [dependence]( http://www.emedicinehealth.com/drug_dependence_and_abuse/article_em.htm) and addiction if used for very long. I take a *very* low dose of an anti-psychotic ""major tranquilzer"" to keep a bit of lid on my [PTSD](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml)-driven, [autonomic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system) ""[fight, flight or freeze](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=fight+flight+freeze)"" tendencies.

2) Support Groups: I got into [AA](http://www.aa.org/), [MA](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/) and/or [NA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=narcotics+anonymous) because I was using intoxicants to try to cope with my emotional pain; and [ACA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=adult+children+of+alcoholics), [EA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=emotions+anonymous) and [CoDA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=coda.org)... where I found others in similar boats who had found explanations, answers and solutions.

3) Books and academic, *professional* websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). Strongly recommended because they all understand the upshots of having been [stressed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=fight%20flight%20freeze) for too long, including [complex PTSD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=complex+post-traumatic+stress+disorder) which is pretty likely what you have: Bessel van der Kolk, Peter Levine, Patricia Ogden, Bruce McEwen, Sonya Lupien and Robert Sapolsky. *Accurate* information is power. 

4) Psychotherapy: I still use Ogden's [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) as the [interoceptive](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=interoception+meditation) 9th of the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to manage any ""time bombs"" that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [CPT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy), and [schema therapy]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), as well as [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [HBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), [SEPt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), and [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html). 

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, I looked [here]( https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/), and [here]( http://doctor.webmd.com/find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry), and [here]( https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/), and (for DBT specialists in particular) [here]( http://behavioraltech.org/resources/crd.cfm). If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most MD / psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often -- though not always -- excellent sources of referral. 

5) Mindfulness Meditation: After trying several methods, I found the [Vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81)-style. (For a *lot* of people with anxiety, this stuff handles anxiety chop chop. Not sure about depression. Many of the modern psychotherapies for anxiety are actually based on it now.)

6) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=DBT+therapy+workbooks).

7) Moderate exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to ""massage"" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.

She won't battle it with me, instead she desires making me the enemy.  I'm clawing out of codependence in a codependent way: trying to re-aim the desire to truly help, to truly put her first, to be a real 'white knight'- by saying ""no,"" by refusing to be responsible for her emotions/behavior, by refusing to be afraid or neglect myself in fear of her outbursts.  It is difficult to compose myself surefooted, it is a mine-field, and it we have an exhaustingly long way to reach the other side.  

I don't see much progress yet, but I cannot change her.  I am changing me and going to make this a healthier relationship and environment for her, in spite of any destructive forces.  It seems that she needs me to take up, what to me appears along the narcist spectrum, an unwavering, uncompromising, unflinching, man that she knows her storms cannot even reach.  This is difficult for me and I don't desire to ""dominate"" her in this way (I dreamed of one day having 'a partner'), but this seems necessary for her.  Am I finally going crazy?  I seem to be trying to attain a feigned selflessly selfish way of life that I don't desire, but superseding this is my desire for her health and that of our son.  I need her to open her eyes before it destroys us.  

I would NOT be able to take this challenge on in a healthy way without the communities and resources shared with me in these subs and blogs.  I NEEDED to see people 'open their eyes' and successfully find ways to fight for their own lives.  I needed to see that my struggle isn't in vain.  I need to see my wife reach this level of peace and contentment and I will methodically put my feet only in a direction that brings us closer.  

*sigh*  I think I need professional help too.

I love her and support her.  I make it clear there is nothing about the real and present PD that makes me respect her less, think less of her, or myself above her.  I even fell in love with her for traits along the same spectrum- her creativity, her energy, her humor, her intense passion and her impulsiveness.  I don't desire removing parts of her, just helping her hold onto her identity.  I simply want her to be able to be ""her"" and not keep having it taken away by thinking, emotions, and behavior she clearly abhors being a part of.  

I just want her to open her eyes, but reading your blog always fills me up with such hope.  I can see people who took up arms to fight for themselves when in the same place- and they won a healthier happy life.

874,"Well certainly BPD is not a disease. But it's also misleading to describe it as a ""disorder"". Rather, what is called BPD might be better understood as an arrest or state of frozenness in a person's emotional development. It can be overcome - a person can recover to the point where they are no longer borderline at all. That is what I write about in the blog listed above.

And no need to apologize - Many former borderlines are free of their former symptoms, and not only that, but they are actually engaged in rewarding relationships, working at jobs they enjoy, and feeling emotionally well most of the time. There are many books, studies, and case studies supporting this viewpoint. I'd be happy to list some more.",Bpdtransformation,2vsol1
875,"Many years ago I felt horribly empty most of the time. A major cause of this is a lack of positive remembered experience with other people (i.e. one can't evoke a comforting image of another person, and doesn't even know it's missing. This is related to an inability to self-soothe or comfort oneself, and also an inability to take in, introject, or understand positive relationships in the way healthier people do.... in other words the emptiness arises from not being ""filled"" or taking in reassuring experiences from the outside world, both in the past and present).
Yes it can absolutely get better. I have gone from feeling totally empty to feeling truly alive, well and real a lot of the time. It takes a lot of time and work, and learning to trust somebody in depth. But anyone can do it given sufficient support and determination.
Sure, occasionally I still feel empty and down - anyone can feel these feelings. But I don't feel it nearly as intensely or as often as before.
Gerald Adler's writing on BPD explains pretty well why the feeling of such emptiness develops. It's discussed further here -

886,"I don't see the logic there, since some medical conditions do have cures, and some don't.

But the other, bigger problem is that BPD is not a valid medical diagnosis. There are no reliable observable physical signs that can be used to diagnose it (e.g. it's not like dementia, or cancer). For that reason, it cannot be considered a valid object of scientific study.

If you think about it in a common sense way, it hardly makes sense to  formulate a condition with 9 subjective behavioral/emotional criteria, for which one only need meet 5 to ""qualify"", and then to say it's a reliable medical condition.

 One person could have only criteria 1 through 5, the next could have only criteria 5 through 9, and they might even differ greatly in how and in what context criteria #5 is expressed... can they really be said to have the same ""disorder""?

And, do all 256 combinations of the 9 BPD criteria constitute the same ""disorder""?

And also, who can reliably determine how intense each of the criteria has to be to be included in the diagnostic picture? Can different observers reliably determine when someone feels ""empty"" enough (one of the 9 DSM criteria) to be a part of a BPD diagnosis, in the same way one can test, for example, whether someone has diabetes by measuring their insulin?

I could go on. You can see the problems with this. BPD is simply not a valid medical disorder, and therefore one cannot make definitive reliable statements about its cureability or lack thereof.",Bpdtransformation,2vsol1
887,"Your question about science makes me think of the problem with all these studies. The study of so-called ""mental illness"" is not truly scientific, it is all inferential. In other words, these are all quasi-experimental studies, because they are studying human beings and you cannot adequately control for all the constantly shifting factors. Also, the reliability and validity of BPD itself is suspect, so that is another problem. With human behavior... it just can't be studied like something in chemistry or biology.
If any one of these studies were peer-reviewed, it wouldn't make any difference in the bigger picture. Because, one quasi-experimental study does not prove anything. There has to be a pattern of many quasi-experimental studies pointing in the same direction, to give any strong evidence that something ""real"" is going on (unlike a truly replicable experiment in the hard sciences). And there are many that suggest that people labeled with so-called ""BPD"" can do quite well in therapy. As for how many of these are peer reviewed, I don't know.

More scientific research needs to be done in all aspects of mental health. You stating that ""I'm cured"" has no basis in fact as you said yourself that ""...one cannot make definitive relable statements about its cureability or lack thereof"".

891,I'm confused but I'll agree! ,,2vsol1
892,"Right, that is the paradox of this. I can say ""I'm cured"" - which does have an experiential basis in my feeling/functioning much better and not experiencing severe borderline symptoms anymore - but then the so-called disorder I'm ""cured of"" wasn't even valid or reliable in the first place.
As to the notion that BPD is a ""spectrum disorder"", certainly 'borderline' traits individually exist along a spectrum of severity. But that does not mean that BPD itself is a ""disorder"" that occurs in a coonsistent form from person to person. Disorder is a medical term which would imply that BPD can be reliably diagnosed and is therefore valid. But, there are no biomarkers that can identify it. Even the guys like Insel, Frances, Hymer, etc. - the former leaders of the DSM and NIMH - admit that there is little science behind the current classifications of ""mental illness"" and that DSM V is only making it worse.

894,"Pretty good advice already given here. I'd just say that trauma is a risk factor for BPD, not necessarily a cause. Seems like splitting hairs, but it's important with regard to what your therapy focuses on.

I would absolutely recommend a consultation with a psychiatrist who specializes in personality disorders. They'll likely want to see you for more than one session. They'll do an intake interview, probably a diagnostic questionnaire, and then just talk to you about what makes you think you have BPD. No matter what they say, whether they confirm the diagnosis or not, it's worthwhile to then go and get a *second* opinion.

Diagnosis matters, because not all psychiatric treatments are the same. The meds for ADHD (which can present with emotional dysregulation and also runs in families) differ from the meds for bipolar which differ from the meds for major depression, and no meds are very effective at treating BPD (you need specialized psychotherapy for that). So, getting an accurate diagnosis needs to be your first priority.

Get the diagnosis first, and then tailor the treatment *to the diagnosis*. Walk away from any mental health professional who wants to start with medication or other treatment *first,* before identifying the problem.",VivaSisyphus,hcpf9a

901,"I had my worst meltdown ever and knew I had to get away from it. I lost everyone close to me, hit rock bottom. I actually quit 2 weeks before I found out I was diagnosed. But I think the biggest reason I got off it then was because I'd tried many times in the past, and knew deep down it was holding me back. As great as the high from smoking it was (and trust me it was fucking great), it would be a false sense of happiness and ultimately held me back from getting my life on track. I could never smoke in moderation no matter how hard I tried, and I would just not do anything except smoke and play video games. It made me unhappy because I had nothing much going for me and I never had much motivation at all, never put any real hard work in to get my life on track. It stopped me from holding a job, therefore never had money or savings, I missed birthdays and christmas most of the time and never got anyone any presents, I never ate well or regularly, and I had all these plans of what I wanted to do with my life but that's all they stayed as, just plans and thinking about them.

I've found this community and others on live streams and such very helpful to stay afloat and keep on the right path.

Which is why I'm hanging to learn as much as I can on interpersonal effectiveness because I feel that's an area I really need the most work on.

In my experience, and according to the book on DBT, you are in the next phase of recovery.  I went through this, too.  I learned the skills and got the behaviors under control, but I was still too neurotic and self absorbed, spending too much time thinking about my problems.

The next step in DBT is ""building a life worth living"" which is basically going out into the world and finding meaningful things to do and adopting responsibilities which take you out of your own head.

I'm very well recovered, to the point I'd say I'm cured.  I still have all of the ""traits"", I have points in time where I'm extremely emotional etc.  But the difference is that when those things happen I don't lapse into this kind of teen angst stuff about being ""broken"" etc. Now I just see stress and panic and extreme thoughts and feelings as difficult facets of life that I have to handle so that I am capable of doing the things that have meaning. 

So yeah, this is a phase that everyone goes through, it's even discussed in Marsha's book.  I really struggled with this phase as well because in a way it was worse because my identity for so long was the BPD and when that was gone I felt like I had no soul.  It sucks but you just kind of have to weather through it while you build up the other parts of you that have something meaningful to contribute.

965,"i see sexuality as a very fluid thing . that being said if you are in a good place and don't feel comfortable in a relationship with a man, then seek one out with a woman. and you know don't worry about putting a label on it until your sure. there is no rush to define who you are. what's important Is what makes you feel healthy and safe, and if that's only being with women for now or forever then that's cool right. I am male and always thought I was bisexual. but as I started to understand my illness more since the change of my diagnoses from bipolar to BPD at the beginning of the year, i have looked inwards a lot more and i think my attraction to men may just be an idolisation in that person of the type of man i want to be (how they look how they act. their life). but I am not ready to put a label on it yet especially since I have sworn of relationships for several years now as i don't feel i am healthy enough yet to be in a relationship and put someone through me being unhealthy. its just not healthy for either me or the person I may enter a relationship with.

968,"Hey girl, lesbian here. For me my sexuality has been more solid with the exception of about 10 years where I was trying to force myself to be straight because of Jebus and all. I was insanely religious and that fucked me up royally. That being said, I know that lesbians don't actually enjoy sex with men. Maybe they might exist in super small numbers (although it would make them bi in that case imho) but I haven't met any, so maybe the bisexual label fits you best. Also, for some people sexuality is very fluid and their attractions and desires differ quite a bit from month to month, year to year. There was a time when I thought I was bisexual in my teenage years, but after trying to have a sexual relationship with my boyfriend for years and HATING sex every time, it was a pretty clear signal something was up. It wasn't until my first sexual experience with a woman where I had a huge epiphany. I knew in that moment that there was no way I could be bi and forcing myself to be straight was so so so dumb. It gave me confidence to know I was a lesbian and have never found myself longing for men, being attracted to them, or wondering if I just didn't meet the right man. 

Have you been in a relationship with a woman before or had sex with women? If not, I'd explore that first and really take a lot of time reflecting, experimenting and figuring out what you want out of a partner and relationship. It could be that you are super gay, but bpd is getting in your way big time. Or you have the ability to have a relationship with either sex and it's more about the qualities of a person than their genitalia, either way is awesome!",,9e5f5z

I wonder if the amount of sex drive has an influence on that. Like, I have had very promiscuous times where I could just well, fuck anyone, and the act has actually nothing to do with them (as cringey as it is to type that). I think its very much connected to craving any kind of human connection in my case. Maybe you could argue the same with straight people who have gay intercourse in jail for example. I'm wondering what's beneath all this BPD layer of behaviours.

I've always wanted to have a relationship with a girl but it never worked, I'm quite feminine and not publicly out as bi so I'm also not visible for girls who could potentially be into me I think. I had a lot of girl crushes though and notice women much more than men.

975,"""Is it always a niggling source of pain"" Yeah, it kinda is from everything I can tell. The skills help, and as time goes on they help more and more. Eventually ones behavior is to the point it is essentially not affecting a person's life, which makes a person feel better in and of itself as it improves relationships. The intensity of emotions may reduce, but the ability to handle the emotions certainly increases. The amount of things the person enjoys increases, the the ability to find and sustain healthy relationships increases, and overall things get better.

1003,"As the other reply mentions, DBT can be particularly helpful. But therapy generally is valuable regardless, I do relational therapy and it has changed my life fundamentally in so many ways. If substances are an issue AA/NA is very helpful, it can also help with socializing. Joining a group of some sort for social reasons based upon an interest can help. Church or spirituality has heloed many who are inclined towards it. Exercise and eating properly, tough as it can be, is incredibly important. 

A pet can help a great deal, I cannot tell you how many people I have known who told me a pet saved their life. It gives a person something that provides the sort of unconditional affection that is almost impossible with people, and it gives a person something that needs them in a real way, a reason at times to go on when there seems to be no other. Getting into nature has helped so many people. Going to the park, wooded areas, the shore, anything to get into the outdoors. If they are physical people sports and such can help. If they are less physical things like bowling or billiards can help. 

Mental health drop in centers can be a great place to interact with people, good people with issues who get it. They tend to be quiet and safe places where one can just have a cup of coffee, play cards or a board game. Volunteering is valuable, it gets a person out and makes them feel useful. Those are the biggest ones I can think of. But therapy is kinda key to make real changes, the other stuff is helpful but more for coping. DBT is specifically helpful. But if it can't be found finding any therapist who you feel a fit with who says they can handle you is valuable. ",gurneyhallack,aki91y

In mental illnesses which can relapse, I've seen that when two people have the same issue, it inevitably feeds into one another and causes a subtle fall back into relapse.

Same with 2 people I know who are prone to substance abuse- they were recovering until they got together.)

In my early 20's, my boyfriend at the time was seemingly perfect and supportive of my mental struggles. One day we were discussing how far we've come as a couple and when I praised him for being a key factor in how far I'd come to healing and improving my mental health, he got funny. 

The next day he was off but I didn't want to pressure him and figured it was just stress from work. Then he casually asks me ""sooooo you're recovered right? You're no longer suicidal?""  and I answered that at this moment yes, I am feeling well on my way to a recovery and no longer have suicidal thoughts.  He said ""I'm so happy, thank god"". 

And then promptly broke up with me. He had been waiting for 2 years for me to recover to a point where he could officially break up with me because he didn't want to be the cause of any suicide attempts. He had another woman he was already in a relationship with.

As another commenter said, his leaving you, specifically in his method, shows a complete lack of empathy. There‚Äôs no doubt he has a thousand justifications for what he‚Äôs done and is continuing to put you through, but please remember to stay strong. It‚Äôs easy to blame yourself, it‚Äôs the nature of BPD and stigma makes it even easier to think you‚Äôre the problem. But his actions regardless of your past actions are still wrong - a loving partner would at least have attempted counseling, communicated before leaving if they felt it was impossible to reconcile their grievances, etc. There‚Äôs a million and one ways to leave without doing such a degree of harm.

1027,"Hi there. 

I went through something very similar but on a much smaller scale-- my significant other gave up on me while I was working on myself and getting better and became angry at me for things I'd done in the past. Things I'd already apologized for, addressed and spent time wallowing in guilt over. Some things I'd never even been made aware were an issue. It nearly destroyed me and caused a massive regression for a time-- afterwards my best friend of eight years cut all contact with me just because I gave her advice that she didn't like (for her safety. she wanted to go meet her internet boyfriend alone and I was against it.) Felt like a final nail in the coffin. She left when I needed her the most.

* Use it part as of my reward system, to reward myself for trying my best on any given day, for doing what I need to do, for choosing healthier choices over more destructive choices.
  
* Use it as self care.  I have a terrible skin picking problem around my fingernails.  I found the cheapest nail salon for a gel manicure and I tell myself it‚Äôs an investment to help curb my tearing the skin off my fingers.  It‚Äôs working by the way.

1051,"They are lucky to have you. It's great you are taking interest in learning more about them disorder and that you are committed to being there for her recovery!

In terms of what you can do to help, fortunately, that is an emerging topic of research!

I want to share with you a recent study that focuses on highlighting key things friends, parents, and partners (aka carers) implement to improve their relationship with a loved one on the road to recovery from BPD.( DOI: [10.1521/pedi\_2018\_32\_340](https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi_2018_32_340) )

To Summarize: They employed group psychoeducation and focused on improving relationship patterns, psychoeducation about the disorder, peer support and self-care, and skills to reduce burden. They found that carers of people with BPD in the intervention reported improvements in the person with BPD, better relationship dynamics, and improved emotional stability.

I can send you the research paper for you to review, but I recall that **part** of the intervention involved teaching carers of people with BPD to:

1. Be non-judgmental, validating, attentive and appropriate.
2. Reduce their reactivity and try to remain calm and ‚Äúmindful.‚Äù
3. Attend to their own needs through staying connected with friends and family, attending to their own physical and mental health, and taking breaks.
4. Model appropriate assertiveness and setting appropriate boundaries and ground rules for the relationship.
5. Get outside help when crises arise and having a crisis plan.

 

So while it is their responsibility to seek help and grow, it's great to know that you have some control over maintaining the quality of your relationship!

 

Because you mentioned that you were interested in finding a healthy balance in the relationship, I wanted to share these two articles. I think you are doing the right thing, and these articles should affirm that.

I suppose it's like a constant need for reassurance.

And honestly, I think a lot of people hated me, too. I wouldn't blame them. Then I realized I was mentally unhealthy af and I needed to get help. 4 years later, I've seen such a huge improvement in myself. My husband (who I've been with since I was 14), says I'm like a completely different person. I still feel emotions too strongly. I still split on people. I still have trouble controlling the things I say/do when I'm angry. But it's better now. When I was diagnosed, I felt like dying. Because I didn't think I'd ever get better. It didn't help that the therapist said, ""Borderline can never be cured. But with extreme therapy, you may see an improvement. Unfortunately I'm not equipped to counsel borderline patients, but I have a colleague I can refer you to."" It made me feel like I was a fucking psycho who belonged in intense in-patient therapy. If I had known then how much better I would feel 4 years later, I would have cried of happiness. 

I don't even want to be completely recovered. There are aspects of my BPD that I really love. I love that my BPD makes me a more compassionate person. I feel sadness for other people more than the average person, so I always try my best to be as kind as possible to everyone I meet. I'm also more aware of other people's emotions, so all of my friends say that they feel really loved and understood by me. I am more affectionate with my kids and husband. I also love that I'm the mom that cries with pride when I watch my daughter saying her 3 lines in the school play. I am more optimistic than the average person (when I'm in an optimistic mood, anyway. lol). I also feel like my BPD makes me creative.

He began having fainting spells and exagerrating his infirmity.  This went on for some time until he overheard his father telling someone that he had lost his life savings trying to help his son.  Jung was faced for the first time with the reality that his eschewal of responsibility had deleterious effects on the people around him.  

Studies have shown that having an internal locus of control is correlated with less stress and better physical and mental health. Conversely, having an external locus of control is correlated with higher mental illness, in particular anxiety disorders. 

So what I am getting at here is that, indeed, you will have more responsibilities if you recover, but responsibilities are nothing to fear and furthermore they are not what you fear.  You fear novelty.  The very things you think will make your life harder will actually make your life worth living. ",pricklycoconut,7o18or

1134,"I'm not sure if I would categorize myself as recovered yet, but I feel I am very far down the path of recovery. I'm at a point where my episodes are pretty rare, and when they happen they're extremely short. When I feel myself getting upset about something I'm able to use whatever skill I need to address it, and it's become mostly an automatic response now. I own my own home, no debt, a good job, a loving partner of 5 years and my own identity. I know what kind of person I am, my hobbies, passions and interests, etc. But one of the best parts is I do not think about suicide anymore. After daily fantasies of suicide for 20 years, my brain just don't go there anymore. 

That being said, reaching this point was so hard and there were times I didn't think I would ever reach this point. There were times when I was in the middle of recovery and struggling with so much emotional pain wondering if this would even pay off, but it does.  ",,9xhz48

1136,"I've had similar thoughts/experience. I won't say I'm 'recovered,' but I do notice my behaviour better, when it comes to people/relationships, and I try to contain/control it. 

It started with me noticing how much, at my own incovenience, I did for my friends, and considered myself still inadequate and they would leave. At the same time, how little they did in comparison and still called themselves great friends. When I lowered my efforts to more on their level, I was called indifferent (by one), and that they didn't know how to deal with me, and that they didn't think I liked them anymore. They assumed I wasn't okay. And because of my own story, I keep asking them to communicate to me, but they would rather not say anything to me about it - honesty is hard apparently - because of me. 

I wonder, as you do, if my allure was all the attention I was giving them (that I never got in return). 

I have told them that I don't like it when they use my mental health, and their uncertainty about it, as a reason not to talk to me, but that hasn't changed. And, I think because what I say still doesn't make impact, I feel as you do - that they can stay or leave, and I would be indifferent, but while they stay, I'll care.

1144,">Who am I if I can't hide behind my inability to deal with life

This hit home with me so damn hard... I know that feel times a million. Especially since I'm also diagnosed with autism. 

Somehow, it's easier to deal with life when you know you ""can't"" deal. It becomes an excuse. The hardest part of recovery is forcing yourself through hard shit that you never used to deal with because you just couldn't.

Chores? Just cry! Work? Call in sick! First date? Rain check, too anxious! Self care? Just reddit instead!

Recovery is great, because it gives you the tools to actually accomplish things and stop hating yourself. I'm so thankful for all I've accomplished, the most important being the ability to hope for the future. I have a wonderful life. Even if I can't see that every moment of every day, it's the times that I can see it that make everything worth it.

But it's so hard. Especially at first.

It's almost like an addiction. The idea of learning new coping skills, new routines, and essentially giving up all you've ever known is terrifying. On top of that is the fear that you'll fail anyway. If you don't try, then failure feels better. When you fail after trying your best... That's horrible. And the worst part of recovery is the failure. Because you will fail over and over again. But it's like meditation. When you fail, you just have to stand up and start again. Bring your attention back to the moment. You'll have meltdowns, you'll call out of work, you'll hurt yourself (or want to). But what matters is bringing yourself back again and starting each new day fresh.

And by the time you're at that point, you will have the tools you need to keep going. You don't have them yet, and that's what feels scary.

I actually have an identity now!!!!!!!!! It's not stable, it's not always within grasp. But I can write an elegant, honest, online dating profile that really sounds like me. I can describe myself and recognize myself in the words. I can see and understand that people like me, that I'm likeable. My life is SOOOO much better now than it was.

But damn. I hate that I can't cry my way out of cleaning the litter box anymore. Goddamnit.",abeyante,3nun78
1145,"I'm in that process too, and it's honestly so unbelievably tiring and terrifying. This is what I tell myself whenever I'm tempted to just give up:

* I have come this far. I have started therapy, started incorporating some DBT skills, and it took so much hard work and effort for me to even get to where I am now. Do I really have the heart to let all of that go to waste?

* Even if I did decide that recovery was too exhausting for me, would I be happy backsliding? Now that I know what it's like to be on the process of recovery, how will I feel knowing I am stuck because of my own refusal to continue pushing myself? It's likely that I'll feel even more like a failure. You gained the amount of self-awareness to start working on your problems. Once that lightbulb flicks on, it's never going to turn off. You will always be aware of your diagnosis, and you will always be aware of the mistakes you are making. To give up on recovery is to commit yourself to feeling like a failure forever. (Note: it doesn't mean that you actually ARE a failure. I definitely don't think so. But your BPD *will* convince you that it's one more thing you've failed at.)

* Recovery hella sucks. But pre-recovery sucked really bad, too. And at least the suckiness in recovery has some sort of payback at the end of the day. Going back to your old ways will be major sucking without any form of payback at all, save for temporary relief.

I know at this point everything's still really scary. But the whole point of recovery is that it will help you gain the ability to deal with life better. It will help you cope with failures. It will help you figure out who you are and what you're about. Everything you're worrying about will probably resolve itself *if* you continue therapy and getting your issues under control.

1157,"Interesting timing you have.  I've been thinking a LOT about this myself lately.  I stopped drinking 3 years, 6 months and two days ago.  It's been a tremendous help, just as you said! But BPD is bigger than AA, a lot bigger.  When I began AA in earnest, I had already had my last drink.  Like, woke up and knew I was DONE sorta thing.  The program came easy after that, and I haven't picked up a drink again.  That said, though...  I've stopped going to meetings, a long time now.  And I've always been ambivalent at best about AA and its ... philosophies?  Cultishness?  Like, if you're an alcoholic that's not drinking but not in AA, you might as well just drink because you're probably in misery, etc. etc.  

You may not be a spiritual giant.  You may have a messier head than the rest of that crew.  But you haven't had a drink or drug in X amount of time, and that's something.  You managed to do it, however you've done it, one stoopied day at a stoopid time. Maybe it's the fellowship and being accountable.  Who knows.  Maybe you were just DONE when you quit.  

I dunno if there's a Higher Power, or if it gives a fuck.  It doesn't seem like it sometimes, but I have hope.  HIGH hope.  Like that ant and the rubber tree plant.

1167,"I lead a NAMI support group (YA Connections). Four out of 8 people in the group have trauma/went through DBT. I think we all got used to the benefits of group therapy and missed it. It seems to work well for them/me. NAMI has a structured approach to groups and makes sure everyone gets to speak every time. Every group facilitator is trained the same way, to validate and help generate discussion and stay out of the way because it‚Äôs a peer based group. There is a lot of group work and healing because NAMI focuses on listening, venting, and on solutions rather than dwelling. People come back every week and they make changes and people offer each other group wisdom and care. Even if you don‚Äôt say anything you end up thinking through a lot. 

Of course, YMMV because no matter how structured it is, everyone facilitates a little differently and some groups probably have different peer populations than others. 

If you‚Äôre 18-30 you want a young adult group ideally, otherwise just general connections. Some places have lgbtq groups too. ",Razirra,8g3uus
