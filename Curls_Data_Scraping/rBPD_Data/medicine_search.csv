0,Is there any medicine that doesn't take life away?,"Probably not. So before I was diagnosed, August to October I was on 5mg of Lexapro and it was helping but I had 0 sex drive and just 2 drinks would make me into a vomit fountain.  Then closer to the end I felt like a zombie, SI came back but it was more like why not, I guess the medicine made my thoughts clearer I don't know. I just stopped cold turkey. December I was given Pristiq and I didn't start right that day because I had a friend's birthday that weekend but I had a lot of shit happen that week so I took the pillssssss.  Of course now I'm in partial hospitalization but when I was in the actual hospital the psychologist said I could start Pristiq 5 days after everything.  Well I did and long story short I had serotonin syndrome so I stopped that not even a week on it. Then the psychologist at PHP gave me mirtazapine which I could barely stand for 3 weeks so we stopped. Like a month ago she diagnosed me and she's like yeah this is why you have a hard time with medicine. Over the summer I had a few mushroom trips and they help so much like I would be good for a whole month so I figured out that was my medicine but then of course I was out and everything happened. For Christmas my dad got me 2 mushroom grow bags. The one we started isn't going to well so he might remix the bag to see and maybe start the other bag. I guess I'm asking is there any medicine that doesn't take your life away. Last week was terrible, I was very suicidal and I'm just going through a lot.  Of course this week I was pretty fine but that's BPD for you.  I'm just tired of feeling so much. I'm 23, I like partying I like sex so I don't want to give those up for something not to work",1709839710.0,False,73,88,ComprehensivePilot21,user has bpd,1b92zml,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1b92zml/is_there_any_medicine_that_doesnt_take_life_away/

Also, it is worth mention that I'm not taking benzos because I really need them, it is just because I cannot stand my life and anxiety anymore, so I prefer being numb and sleepy than really alive and anxious.

10,Weed as medicine?,"DAE smoke bud as a way to regulate yourself? I find it helps me stay closer to an emotional baseline. It‚Äôs not 100% effective, but in my experience neither are pharmaceuticals, and I like the side effects of weed lol

It can be anxiety producing at times if I get too high in some situations, but I‚Äôve been smoking a mixture of CBD/THC buds together (about 75%/25%), and I find that to be the magic combination. Can‚Äôt tell you how many times smoking helped me come down from episodes of extreme emotion. At the very least smoking a joint is a breathing exercise, and breathing is another go to coping mechanism for me. 

I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of stigma around weed. My parents blamed my issues on smoking and drinking for a long time, and fed me with anti marijuana propaganda, but in retrospect part of me feels like smoking weed might have been the glue that helped keep me together for so long without realizing I have a serious mental illness to address. I think the war on drugs poisoned all the boomer parents‚Äô minds lolol, I have a ‚Äúreefer madness‚Äù poster hanging in my room, they made some extremely outlandish conclusions in that flick üòÇ. 

When I explained my smoking habit to my psychiatrist he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fine, I don‚Äôt see regular pot use as an issue,‚Äù I was really surprised, but after all some doctors prescribe the stuff for anxiety and ptsd, why not something like BPD?

Downgrades so far are that I have significantly less attention and rough intelligence. It's hard to put intellectual effort into something, it's hard to hyper focus and it's hard to make relation between facts, mainly abstract ones. It's something in the lines ""oh, so if Friday is the day to take the trash out and today is Friday I have to take the trash out"". I am also hallucinating a lot more recently, mostly auditive stuff and false awareness of real things. Like hearing a dog bark and having fear as if it was a lion.

22,Laughter as medicine?,"A thought just came across my mind and I figured I'd post it just in case it can prove useful to someone. I see lots of DAE, venting and heartbreak posts here, but not many that try to provide advice.

Years ago, I was in the military. I was under a lot of stress because of what I perceived to be unfair treatment by my superiors. Seeing as how there weren't many people around I could complain to, I kept it to myself at work and either lash out or act inappropriate around my friends out of what I can see now was a desire to have someone, anyone, acknowledge what I was going through. I still didn't find many people who were able to listen without eventually being fed up with my complaining. I can't blame them.

However, one thing that I noticed would help me cool down when I got pissed off was watching funny things. And I mean funny. For me, that's watching videos of babies laughing. I don't know why, but I can't help but laugh too. It really helps me come to my senses. I don't consider it to be a long term solution for behavioral problems. But I think being able to ""switch back"" quickly could help people not push away their close friends and FPs as strongly, which would help with maintaining a strong social safety her. *that* is something I think can benefit people long term. But as many of you are all to familiar with, it's very easy for pwBPD to scare people off relatively quickly. Maybe a little laughter can help you defuse things when they get heated.

28,DAE smoke marijuana medicinally to cope with symptoms?,"And if so, has it helped you, exacerbated symptoms or both?

I started smoking in college and have continued post-grad with a med card. I really go back and forth wondering if it helps me or not. I have quit several times, the longest being for 9 months a few years back. 

Some positives of smoking for me are: it slows my thoughts somewhat so I'm not as impulsive or driven by emotions, it inspires creative thought when I'm in a slump, it makes listening to music more immersive and engaging, and I just really like not having to think so intensely for a little bit.

Some of the negatives are: bouts of paranoia, laziness which makes it hard to implement any ideas I have, poor memory while high, causes some physical issues in me like stomachaches, and I've noticed my partner and I fight way more when we've been smoking alot lately but aren't currently high.

31,"Hello R/BPD, My name is Alok ""Dr. K"" Kanojia, psychiatrist and Co-founder of HG, Ask me Anything!","Hello BPD Reddit!

My name is Alok Kanojia, but the internet knows me as Dr. K. I'm a psychiatrist and co-founder of HG, a mental health platform that helps the digital generation build a healthy mind. It is an honor to be here today!I stream on Twitch (\~700k Subs), have a Youtube Channel (1.25M subs) where I talk a fair amount about BPD. Healthy Gamer also has a Discord server (70k members) that is focused on building mental health.

I really enjoy working with clients with BPD. I've found that they are some of the most exceptional human beings on the planet, and it has been rewarding to help them integrate into society in a healthy way. I've worked with a ton of folks in high-powered fields such as finance and medicine who have BPD. I also believe that Eastern psychology and medicine has *far more* to offer to help people with BPD. Marsha Linehan and the development of Dialectical Behavioral Theory was just the first step!

Also, some cool stats - most people think of BPD as a permanent diagnosis, but research shows that people with BPD can get significantly better and in fact most do. 35% remission at 1 year, 91% remission at 10 years, and 96% remission at 16 years.

A bit about myself. I spent a few years studying to become a monk, and wound up going to medical school. I went to Tufts University School of Medicine and then did my psychiatry training at Mass General Hospital, McLean Hospital, and Harvard Medical School. My work today is largely informed by my time spent in India, South Korea, and Japan studying meditation and Eastern medicine.

Just a reminder that although I am a medical doctor, nothing on today's AMA is intended to be taken as medical advice, everything is for educational and entertainment purposes only. If you have a specific question, please see a licensed professional!Ask me Anything!  


EDIT: Hey all, thank you so much for all your questions. I'm honored by the opportunity, and learned a lot myself! Best of luck to each and every one of you.

32,Medicine to become socially functional again,"I've been to therapy for two years and I still don't feel any less crushed when I try to socialize for once. I don't socialize at all. Like sometimes I am feeling great and confident for a couple days and reach out to people but get hurt in the process because of rejection and withdraw again because I have to focus on my safety. Being with people my age who don't deal with shitty mental health is a huge trigger for me.

Idk I really hate the medicines I tried so far. I don't have a full blown depressive episode this time either. Like I was almost hypomanic a day or two ago. But at this point, idk what else to do.

However, I really don't know how I would stay on a medicine for long enough either, like if it fucks up my sexuality completely (always happened before) and I actually feel better, I have no clue how I would stop myself from going off it once again.

Is this stupid? I feel like if I don't have a sexuality anymore because antidepressants zap it I have even less reason to socialize, but it's not like I'm actually getting with other people due to always getting burnt in the process so it's not like I would really lose anything except the ability to masturbate? (But I am not sure if my future self would agree.)

33,DAE take lithium? I‚Äôm terrified to start my medicine.,"So after not seeing a psychiatrist or therapist in three years, I decided to get help. I met with a new psychiatrist yesterday and had to go through the diagnose process again. 

I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar II with hypomania. My doctor prescribed lithium. 

I have read so many horror stories about lithium carbonate. That it‚Äôs dangerous and can be toxic to your body, that it causes massive weight gain (I‚Äôm losing weight currently and have history of an Eating disorder that flared up when I read it, so this makes me panic), and that you always feel thirsty and can never get hydrated. 

I am so so scared to take it. I legit have the worst anxiety. I want to get better but the side effects scare me. I was prescribed another pill too but I‚Äôm less worried about that one.

36,Extreme mood swings with recent medicine change,"Hello everyone,
This is the first time I post on here, so if I make any mistakes I apologize.
I was diagnosed with BPD when I was in a mental hospital last year, but wasn‚Äôt informed by the psychiatrist until a few weeks ago. In the records they gave me when I got discharged last year it only said I have a mood disorder. But seeing a psychiatrist a few weeks ago at the mental health urgent care he tells me that I have BPD and is in the medical record he has.
Anyway, I went to the urgent care a few weeks ago because I was feeling suicidal. A lot of things have been going on in my life. I recently got married in March, and I was on fluoxetine for years for depression. The fluoxetine wasn‚Äôt helping much so the psychiatrist decided to change my medication.
He put me on cymbalta 30mg for a week, then increased the dosage to 60mg. Ever since the dosage went up to 60mg, I‚Äôve been feeling worse.
Over the past 3 weeks I‚Äôve had blackouts where I dissociate and not know how to control myself. Two nights ago I got out of bed and started packing my clothes to go to my parents house and my husband kept asking me what am I doing. I couldn‚Äôt answer. I was trapped. For a moment I even thought he was my ex boyfriend who has tried to kill me back in 2012. It was very scary.
Today, I woke up late for my class. That already gave my anxiety. My husband was being mean to me and usually in the morning I enjoy sitting outside with him to have coffee and a cigarette. When I noticed he went outside without me, that was when I felt completely broken. I was also very upset and yelled at him, told him that he didn‚Äôt have the decency to ask me. He told me to leave so I said ok. I went to my car and sat there thinking he would go outside and tell me that he didn‚Äôt mean to tell me to leave. He didn‚Äôt. So I texted him saying that I will leave the key and wedding ring in his room. That‚Äôs what I did and I still couldn‚Äôt drive. He comes out to my car and tells me that he has to leave to go to class. I was crying and all I could say is okay. I left and while driving I was thinking of where I want to go.
I drove to a park, had a few pills on me and felt like it would be best to just end everything at that point because I felt so helpless and like a burden. I remembered that my therapist from the past saying that if I feel suicidal to reach out to someone, so naturally I reached out to my husband.
He told me that he needs to go to class and he is going to call the cops on me. I told him that I will be more upset if he did call the cops on me. He said that he would want me in jail just to know that I‚Äôm safe. That was like he took the knife and jabbed it in my heart even further. So I decided to drive to a city an hour away from where I am.
Not even driving 5 minutes, I get a flat tire. I parked on the side of the road, no one stopped to help. I call my dad and he said he‚Äôs tired but he will drive to me. I felt bad and told him not to bother so I called my father in law and he said he will help me.
He picks me up and leaves my car where I won‚Äôt get a ticket, and drops me off to the house I live at with my husband.
15 minutes or so, I‚Äôm sitting outside with my dog chain smoking and I see two cop cars pulling in the driveway.
My dog is usually scared of strangers so he kept barking and I was trying to take him inside and all I see is the cop reach for his gun. That‚Äôs when I yanked my dog and pulled him inside.
The two cops talked to me for 20 minutes and left. Asked if I wanted to get admitted and I said no because I can‚Äôt afford it (my health insurance is a joke, I‚Äôm still paying off the thousands of dollars I owe to the mental hospital from last year).
Fast forward a bit. My husband leaves campus and comes into the house angry. Didn‚Äôt bother to hug me or ask if I‚Äôm okay. Goes straight to bed. I laid in bed, and before he went to work he went to get food, didn‚Äôt bother to ask if I was hungry. Before he left he just kisses me on the forehead and tells me ‚Äúsee you later‚Äù. No I love you or anything.
I feel even worse, so I call his supervisor and ask if my husband is absolutely needed at work. He asked me if it‚Äôs an emergency and I said no. He said unfortunately my husband has to work. I said ok.
At this point my car is still parked and I was waiting a few hours for my father in law to take me to the car to help me change the tire.
I end up calling my dad again and my dad says he will pick me up so we can go get my car. Before my dad gets there, my husband gets home. No warning or anything. Walks in and asks me for a cigarette. I just put it on the table and said here you go. Again, no hug or anything. His biggest concern was a cigarette. I left and now I‚Äôm here. How do I continue living like this? I‚Äôm so tired of it all and just need someone to talk to with no hate or hurt.",1569901778.0,False,0,3,unknowngal94,None,dbnmui,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/dbnmui/extreme_mood_swings_with_recent_medicine_change/

I also have a lot of psychotic thoughts and bad communication skills when I am upset. When I am distressed I use a lot of word repetition and very simple minded ways of wording things. 
Example: 
What I mean: You hurt my feelings
What I say: ""Hurt hurt hurt hurt fucking hurt me""
What I mean: I need some help right now
What I say: ""i cant (help x10)""

43,I'm starting to hate my brother who has BPD but doesn't take medicine.,"I feel awful admitting this, but I can barely stand the sight of him anymore. He is four years older then me and he's had this for as long as I remember. He's also a diagnosed Schizophrenic so his paranoia is almost impossible to deal with. He gets triggered easily and goes into a rage. He's beaten me up, broken almost every tv, furniture, doors, and ps4s too. It's been emotionally draining dealing with him. My parents have tried their hardest to get him help but he doesn't even know he's sick and instead blames them.
I feel like an awful sister. I'm a medical student and know it's not his fault, but it's still so frustrating especially when he doesn't eat his medicine.

It's like this will never end. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. If i say something that triggers him I either get blamed for being mean and not keeping my mouth shut or simply I end up hating myself for even speaking while he rages on and is either beating me up or yelling for hours.

I wish I had a healthy big brother to depend on, not someone who changes within the hour. I just felt really down after yet another fight today.

However, what if these offenses keep happening, and it just seems like the person is being rude or disrespectful to you? This is what triggers me. Mind you, I believe I express that I am offended. I even say what types of things offend me. However, some people continue to treat me with this kind of behavior. Once the buildup happens and I notice it more and more, I start not giving AF so I start to be just as rude and insensitive. When this starts to happen, the other person gets genuinely offended and for some reason can't keep a joke, but when it's reversed and I mention that I am offended by certain comments, I'm the one being sensitive and my feelings are sometimes overlooked. I don't understand it.

Aside from expressing what is offensive to people who dish it and can't take it, or completely cutting off another person, what are some strategies you've used to 1) make yourself feel better or 2) at least keep the peace?

62,How do I cope with my family using my bpd against me(19f),So when I was first diagnosed with bpd my family dismissed it for the most part and told me I just needed to eat right and just do as I was told. Envuantually my mom got on them a bit to take it more seriously it got to the point where I showed any excitement or happiness they're first reaction was did you take your medicine? They would literally count my pills and make sure I took everyone and it got to the point where my best friend died and my mom upped my dosage to one pill to 2 pills. Anytime I would speak my Kom would ask me if I took my medicine she then proceeded to tell everyone she knew I had bpd and that I was in medicine as well. It was bad but it had been going on for 2 years so I just rolled with the punches but know that I have moved out and gone to college I can't take it anymore. They're critical about ever little thing my weight my grades how much I'm taking my medicine what classes ik taking I can't take it and the stress of college. Recently my grandpa showed up at my house (unannounced) and saw my room was messy and told me that I was sick and that I needed help. That they were going to get me the help that I needed usually when he gives me these speeches I just nod and roll with the punches but I was genuinely getting upset. I tried to stay calm but stern so he wouldn't think I was going into a manic episode or ask me if I took my medicine. He disregard everything I wa saying said my room is always messy and told me that je wished I would talk to him straight and that I was  being  defensive. My family over critical nature of everything makes everything so much harder than it should and makes me so stressed I can't sleep or even relax.i just don't know what to do I'm trying to be perfect but it's still not good enough. I used to be okay with understanding I wonever be enough for my family .

My medicine , Zoloft, was lowered so that might be why too.

Fuck the ""not ruining my relationships"" bullshit. This is making me feel so hopeless as if I'm just condemned to this suffering and can't do anything about it. I'm not even the impulsive type but more selfdestructive and avoidant so there's not much to work about in terms of harmful behaviors.
 Will the healthy options really be as effective as the unhealthy options? Will they take away the pain as sh or alcohol does?

122,Suggestions/ CBT Excercises recommendation,"Hi all! My therapist told me that I have low self esteem and previously mentioned I had mixed traits of adhd and bpd. 
So, Im posting here.

I compare myself with everybody. Im a medicine student and this game of comparison brings me down, and exhausts me physically mentally and emotionally. 

So, on doing some research on the internet, I found this act of comaprison can be developed by improving self esteem and self image (as this stemms from childhood trauma, due to emotional neglect).

Is there anybody here who have actuvely built their self image through any cbt exercise recommended by your therapist? 
Or please give any tips or suggestions you followed which helped you. 

Thank you.

But my ADHD and focus became a massive issue because although I felt better mentally I couldn't focus to save my life so my doctor prescribed me Strattera about 3 weeks ago.

I'm doing everything I need to do. Going to the gym, eating well, taking my medicine, getting out and being social. But I don't think I've ever felt this depressed before. It's getting hard to even get out of bed no matter how much everyone around me in my support net is telling me I'm doing great.

I've been on Strattera before (with Prozac) and I did amazing on it. So I'm not sure what the issue is. Has anyone else had bad luck mixing Effexor and Strattera?

Before this, things were more complicated because I was binging all the time and it was like I wasn't able to stop.

It fell amazing at the beginning because I felt numb and the intrusive thoughts and impulsives were gone, but I think that now, after 2 months doing this without being supervised by a doctor, my body and mind need more and more in order to shut down. Don't get me wrong, I know that we shouldn't 'play' with medicine like that, but tbh it has been the only way I've found that has gave me this false sense of control or something like that.

165,Need a perspective on a failed dbt attempt,"Trigger warning: toxic and abusive dbt therapist. Transphobia. Please don't read if this may trigger you.

This will be a long read. But I really need some perspective here. This took place in a clinic in Germany btw.

My partner is diagnosed with BPD. He started dbt at a specialized clinic this week. He is also trans (this will play a role in the story). So he has been waiting for 6 month to be finally able to start therapy at this place. He got some weird vibes from the doctor who runs the clinic beforehand, but didn't trust his initial gut feeling. When he started this week they were completely unorganized and asked him the same triggering questions about his history in three separate sessions with different people. Needless to say he was really triggered and unwell. They sent him home without any support or anything. That was already a red flag for me tbh. Another thing that happened was him asking the team to use the correct pronouns for him (he has not legally changed his name) and they refused and told him he need to discuss this with the doctor running the place. Yesterday he discussed the situation with the doctor and her reaction is beyond me. She told him he wants to control the therapy, that he needs to give up control and accept being called Ms instead of Mr. He told her that he doesn't want to control anything, just be respected in his identity. She told him basically that in ""the real world"" people won't accept his identity as well. He argued that people actually do. She told him that he is living in another world than she is and he should stop abusing her for his goals. If he wants to be called Mr he cannot stay at that place. He stood up, gave back his things and told them that he won't come back then. 

Here is where I need some perspective. I understand that dbt needs a very controlled and regulated environment. I see that this doctor is really transphobic. But the whole thing rubs me the wrong way for other reasons. I have undergone therapy myself (and still am) and never have I heard that asking for basic respect would be defined as controlling or even abusive. And even if it was controlling, if a person has a high need for control you cannot just demand giving that up. It needs trust to be built between therapist and patient. Is this normal for dbt? Being forced into obeying?  My personal feeling is that this doctor has created a nice place for her to control, belittle and abuse people with BPD. Is this what he needs to expect at other places? Because I can fully understand NOT wanting to be at such a place. He wants help and get better but that's just not it. My gut feeling is that it would be very traumatic for him to stay there, being misgendered, disrespected and shut down for weeks.

Thank you for reading and sorry if some medical terms are not correct, English is not my first language :) Please feel free to share your experiences. I am really looking for some perspective. Of course I won't push him to do anything. It's likely he will need some time until he feels ready to start again. I just want to be there for him and understand the whole concept better.

I know if I don't I'll just freeze up and forget what I need to say.

She even blocks me pretty often and there could be 1-2 weeks where I don't hear from her at all.

That said though, she is not always like this. She apologizes after she cools down (though not always) and says she can't see herself with anyone else. Its only when she is set off by her mother whom she lives with or if I say something that upsets her. Usually its small things like the last time I asked her not to buy me medicine for my cold because I have some already and don't want her wasting money on me, then she says I'm ungrateful and selfish. What I want to know is if it's worth trying to make us work again at this point? I want to try for her, but after all this time I wonder if I can get her to respect me again and not verbally or physically abuse me anymore. Is there a chance things can go back to the way they were again or is it too far gone? 

As a final note. She is in a really bad spot and doesn't have anyone other than me as a friend. If we can't work out as a couple, can we work as friends? She is dangerously suicidal. I'm trying to motivate her to do therapy again and try new medicine to help. I want to stay by her side at least until she's in a better place, but would I be doing more harm by staying?

181,Stepmom being more cold/rude towards me since she found out about what new meds I started on.,"Just like the title says, I started Lamictal(for BPD and probably also bipolar)about 2 weeks ago now and honestly, so far I think its been very helpful! However, since I told my stepmom that, she's been acting so much more negative towards me than usual. Frankly, she's always been rude towards me along with my other parent. 
I never even told her *what* I'm taking it for, all I told her is that it was a mood stabilizer. I'm not sure if she's put 2 and 2 together or if she thinks that I'm just ""overreacting"" like she always thinks I am. And for some reason, since I started taking it, whenever I have therapy or a psych appointment, she's always been so passive aggressive towards me whenever I tell her about it(she and my other parent have said that they'll reimburse me for all my appointments and medications as long as I tell them before or after.).

I just got into a fight with both of my parents about that last bit like 30 minutes ago. The both of them basically gaslighting me and telling me that I'm demanding money from them and being rude(I'm also autistic and have adhd) for ""demanding them for money"" when all I've been doing is simply telling them and informing them like they've told me to. Apparently telling them, word-for-word like they've told me to do for the past almost 2 years is now ""rude"" because ""I'm obviously just demanding money from them and acting like they're my own personal bank to just get money from."" However, I've just been doing what they've told me to do? 

This all has just been super difficult for me because I *finally* have this BPD diagnosis and *finally* am medicated for it so I can actually start managing everything. I'm just so upset because it feels like I'm being treated worse than I have been treated in the past all because my stepmom now knows wgat meds I'm on. So it's either that OR this is how they've always been treating me and I'm just now opening up my eyes to how I've actually been treated this entire time and just can't tolerate it anymore. It's all so confusing and I'm not sure how to even process all of this or even if my assumptions are correct. :((",1708105857.0,False,1,3,Witchy888,user has bpd,1aseuyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1aseuyf/stepmom_being_more_coldrude_towards_me_since_she/

186,Am i in the wrong? Or am I being extra?,"So, for minor context, I am in a throuple with my amazing significant others, one of which also has BPD. Her and I are generally pretty well at communicating but often have our bf as a bit of a moderator in heavy discussions. And sometimes, I'm the moderator for them and she for him and I.
 ANYWAYS. 
We all recently got a place together and combined households. There came a point where gf requires surgery and would be off work for a minimum a week. And in that time, she would be home and she has a prescription she would need for recovery. I have a history of substance abuse and while I was in a great deal of pain I told our bf ""do me a favor and don't let me have access to her prescription"". In that moment i was in so much pain I would have downed a bottle and started a vile cycle of abuse again. Easily.
Later that night when gf came home, I heard her and bf talking and him bringing up my request. Her response was ""if I find out she's stealing my medicine I have no problem calling the authorities"".
This quote has been replaying in my mind CONSTANTLY. It made me incredibly angry to begin with and now it just hurts more than anything. I am aware of my problem and voiced it. Granted, now that I'm not in nearly as much pain there could be a bottle here and I wouldn't be nearly as tempted... But I'd be lying if I said there would be NO temptation. However, I've been managing my addiction fairly well and don't think I'll go down that slippery slope. Another phrase that came out her mouth was that ""I'm not going to hide my medicine or not take it cause you might be tempted"". This is coming from a woman who's family has a history of addiction and constantly says things about how she's worried about becoming and addict herself.... 
I want to talk to her civilly about these things but I'm so caught of her being ok with calling the police on someone who she claims to love and want to protect. It's ok for her to be mindful of her POSSIBLE addictive genes, while it's not ok for a recovered/recovering addict to be mindful???

187,My BPD partner attached to another person - what to do?," Disclaimer: I've reposted this text over a few BPD subreddits cuz i don't know much about reddit and don'tm know which ones are trustworthy and which are not.

To  put it the shortest way possible - I've been with my girlfriend for 1.5  y and we've come through all the classical BPD problems there are - and  hadled them. A new problem arose when we moved to another cities to  study. We were afraid of the situation but decided to face it - we  organized our time to be able to visit each other even for 4 days. But  she met another person there and, from being completely attached to me  (in the unhealthy BPD way we heavily worked on), she switched to being  absolutely obsessed with another person - something she's been always  horrified that I would do. She would spend every second of the day,  every day of the week with the aforementioned guy, have no contact with  me and then ignore me, not respond for the whole week - purposefully  cuttingattachement to mute the feeling of guilt (according to her). And  then, while visiting me, after week of emotional infidelity, she came  with a proposal of open relationship.

Taking  with her, I realised that she makes all the points and decisions  totally impulsively, without thinking about later consequences. After  some conversation she realised that she hasn't taken her medicine that  week + she didn't have a therapy for a long time bc she's switching  therapists. So she kind of wasn't herself. After realizing that, she  kind of started to think more sober - yet still with with difficulty  (she was still on non-medicine mode).

Interesting  point about the whole situation is that she, despite all hurting,  impulsive and mutually contradictive statements, would stuck to the  position that she still loves me - this was like the only thing she was  sure about - before and after the no-medicine realization.

We  decided that our relationship is important to both of us and we both  want to rescue it. And that's kind of where the problem begins. How to  do it? I've never came across any info on how to deal with BPD partner  gluing themselves to another person. When we're talking on the  phone/texting she actually seems involved, but she doesn't call  regularly (i'm the one that has to strive for attention even if i've  mentioned the problem already), text, responds after very long time even  if i text her that i miss her and feel bad. I know that if i call her,  she's there for me, but... Yeah u know.

Sooo... What can I and what can we do?

Before seeing a psychiatrist, I was treated by a psychologist for what she believed was *generalised anxiety, panic disorder and OCD* and we mainly worked with cognitive behavioural therapy. I was feeling very unwell and she wanted me to see a psychiatrist and hopefully receive medical treatment.

I have been through a lot in the system, here's the story short.

1. Seeing a private psychiatrist, who first treated me for major depression (severe) and anxiety + some OCD symptoms. I started antidepressants and that triggered, what the psychiatrist thought was a hypomanic episode and I was diagnosed with *bipolar disorder*. Then I started treatment with Quetiapine without any significant change and he wanted to start me on Lithium, but I wasn't feeling safe so I needed to move on in the system.

2.  Then I became a patient in the community mental health service. Here I was treated by some not so competent doctors and a nurse. They started me for instance on Valproate without any effect. They wanted me clarified for borderline, but a specialised psychologist quickly cleared me for borderline - ""you are way too healthy in your mind to have Borderline""

3. After the unsuccessful diagnosing, the local community mental services sent me on to the specialised unit for affective disorders in my county. It was a very underwhelming experience, only diagnosing with a psychiatrist and no supportive talks or therapy. I became more and more ill, because I only had a talk once every two months and only about medicine.

4. I called the acute psychiatric clinic a lot at this time, fall 2017, and was a patient in their acute team some weeks and in December 2017 I had a 10 day long admission to a psychiatric hospital, where I was severely depressed/in a mixed bipolar episode. A psychiatrist there cleared out my diagnoses again and diagnosed me, besides *bipolar*, with *borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder*

5. After the admission, I got back into the local psychiatric clinic, this time again with an incompetent nurse, no therapy and I was miserable. At this time I started seeing a specialised psychologist in psychiatry and he wasn't content with my treatment,so he helped me on in the system.

7. The last stop on my journey through the Danish psychiatric system, started two years ago. I was being declared ready for therapy, targeted on my borderline diagnosis at a psychiatric clinic. I started with some psychoeducation, medicine adjustments (many of them) and then a year of mentalisation based group therapy. The group therapy ended in November and I had individual therapy sessions with my two therapists, with the last ever session yesterday. The psychiatrist at the clinic decided to remove my bipolar diagnosis, because she thinks my problems are all related to my personality disorder(s).
These two years have been so helpful. The group therapy was SO effective and resonated deeply in me, I learned so much and my therapists have been AMAZING. 

When I started group therapy in November 2018, I was very sick. I had a lot of suicidal ideation, was so afraid, did a lot of head banging, I couldn't keep eye contact, I was hopeless, despondent, felt badly treated, left alone, let down. I was a victim. I seeked other's protection all the time and was helpless. I was sure I would shatter, if I was left alone. 
In May 2019, my ex boyfriend of 8 years left me because of my mental health problems. In September 2019, my beloved mum died, way too young, only 62 yo.
And besides this, which my therapists thought would CRUSH me... I am standing on my own two feet. After years of numerous kinds and combinations of medicine, numerous psychiatrists, numerous diagnoses and therapists.

I am living alone for the first time ever and it is going SO well. My suicidal ideation is almost gone. I am having better days more frequently and it is easier for me, to drag myself up again, when I fall. Self harm is at a bare minimum. I am capable of mentalising.
I am in a relationship with a wonderful woman who actually also has borderline (+ schizophrenia), but we are so good together.
I still have somewhat severe mood swings, and I can have days, where I am very depressed, but I have learned to go softer on my self and be more accepting and loving.
I have been out of job for three years but slowly but surely, I am soon ready to start working again. I am not a victim anymore.
My therapists are so extremely proud of me and my process and they got both goosebumps and tears in their eyes, when we said goodbye yesterday. It was very hard for me, I miss them a lot already, especially with my attachment problems/feeling left, but I can cope.


I am not completely well. I still have issues. I still have a LOT of work to do. I am still on a lot of medication and I need to be some time but eventually I can try to get off it with a doctor.
Besides these things, I am better than in several years and damn, I am so proud.

Recovery is possible. I have seen rock bottom, but I got my life back.
We can get better.

210,Tried a new psychiatrist and i don't like it,"Before anything, english isn't my first language so i'm sorry if I wrote something wrong.
Today I went to a new psychiatrist, i had to change my previous doctor because i'm staying with my parents for some months.
When I said my suspects (BPD obviously), he asked if i used to drink and i answered that sometimes ( my relationship with my FP is very stable and i promised him to not drink when have problems, even if i hadn't promised this i don't have money enough to buy alcohol regularly and my parents wouldn't let me). Ok, is a fair question. 
Then, he asked if i had too many partners and i answered that no, so he said that this is very important trait of BPD, that bpd people are promiscuos and have a big rotation of partners because they lack character. I know some people with bpd can have a big rotation of partners but saying all of this isn't stigamatizing the disorder? I remember seeing here someone talking about this specific stigma and how they are not true.

Besides of that, he came with a lot of stigmas. When I said that I was autistic, he asked my mom if, during childhood, I usually beat my head on the wall when my routine was changed.  My mom told that i had no difficults during school time and he said that it was good, so couldn't be TDAH misdiagnosed as autism. Then, he told autism and those type of disorders must be diagnosed during childhood and that most of people think that are autistic those days.

In the end, he told to try Lithium and another medicine for anxiety. My mom told me that I should try, because we don't have other options of doctors because we can't pay more.

Idk if I'm being that person who just is looking after a diagnosis or if this psychatrist really wasn't good. At this point, I don't even know if as he said that i confusing what is BPD (he said I probably am cofusing bpd with bipolar disorder since instability of humor is one of the symptoms).

But what it does do is allow you to access your subconscious and dig around for repressed memories, trauma, hurt inner child, etc. I've seen it help people with standalone symptoms such as depression or anxiety, it takes people to the root cause of those symptoms and helps them solve the trauma and let go.

213,I think I'm finally over love ,"I have always been a hopeless romantic. Everything I have done in life thus far has been an attempt to feel loved and wanted - to be ""good enough"" for love. 


I always had violinently dramatic reactions and actual trauma from perceived abandonment from romantic interests and partners. 

I am 23 - about to turn 24 in September. I  heard this is the time our frontal lobes start to develop (between 25-27)  and I think mine is about to develop pretty soon. 

My mood swings aren't as violent and dramatic anymore - I still struggle with occasional suicidal thoughts but for the most part, I understand 99% of my life's problems will get better if I learn how to be disciplined and take medicine. Oh, and most importantly, staying away from certain kinds of people. 

I don't have FOMO anymore. I still plan on getting cosmetic procedures  done and changing my looks completely, but it's moreso because I'm bored and want to look a certain way. Most of the work I want done is ""unappealing"" to the opposite sex anyways but I don't care. 

I understand the reason older men say they don't like older women now - I believe women stop yearning or chasing relationships after a certain age and we go on the complete opposite end where we would just rather not deal with men at all. That's my headspace right now. I don't even HATE men, I have just lost interest in sharing a space with them in my home and I'm not waiting on ""Prince charming"" anymore or someone to turn me into somebody.  

I think romantic love is a trick our brains play on us to get us to reproduce - leading you to true, ultimate unconditional love which is the love you have for your children (familial love). I still want to be a mom one day, and I am understanding that that's just something I will have to do on my own - but I must set myself up to be financially equipped to raise a child on my own or buy property.

217,Your Favorite Person Is Yourself,"Hey guys,

I think I realized something huge.

I have noticed that if I feel like I am in ""self"" (nervous system regulation) around someone because they feel safe to some degree, I will go home and idealize the shit out of them. This leads to inevitable dissapointment because they are not going to be that projection I'm expecting.

The reality is that the person I'm trying to find to fill my void is actually just a full expression of my integrated self. Relationships are the vehicle for getting closer to this, but take time to unfold when healthy.

I think my pain makes it really difficult to wait for the natural unfolding to happen, so I jump to extreme conclusions to soothe the pain inside. This can often freak people out and push them away. I think people do this with religion too.

Kind of paradoxical huh?

It seems that there is a distrust, and sometimes mistrust between relying on others to feel my ""self."" I think this is because my mom did the idealization void-filling thing to me and it was really confusing for me because I didn't have my own self reflected back to me for most of my childhood. It felt like my mom was an emotional vacuum, when I wanted a safe connection.

It seems to me that we're all just looking for an experience of self that integrates and normalizes the part of us that feels so much pain. Most human relationships we get into won't be capable of that. I like to think there will be one out there that will...in a genuine and safe-boundary type of way.

Edit: This same dynamic can exist with experiences other than human relationships. You can idealize a vacation, a place, a tree, a psychedelic trip, any of it. It's all just evoking parts of YOU. Know that YOU are the medicine.

Anyway, I went through a huge stint of deep depression and end of life feeling and was prescribed the prozac.  Fast forward 12 Years to 3 months ago when I was diagnosed bpd finally..

Well. I recently heard through the family grapevine that my mother in law, sister in law and her husband said some negative things about me , in front of my 8 and 14 year old nieces no less, specifically that I'm ""addicted to antidepressants"".

I feel embarrassed, weirdly betrayed/hated, and I've now decided to go off My meds. I'm tapering under Dr's advice (he's a general practice and unaware of my bod diag) ..I never knew I was bpd until recently and I'm terrified of going off the meds now that I'm aware. I know I shouldn't do this based on their opinions but for whatever reason unnecessary..I'm worried these judgements they have will turn into them turning my husband away from me to divorce and I honestly just wish they'd like me..maybe that's why I'm going off them idk..I've always been nice and giving with them, none of them have seen the bpd side..just my husband..and he's been with and supported me even before the prozac.

221,i crave positive attention so bad,"i mean, everyone does to an extent i guess. but it‚Äôs so overwhelming for me. my roommate came in to bring me a cup of tea and some medicine because i‚Äôm sick right now and this little gesture has me so happy i could cry. i‚Äôm like this any time someone shows me they think of me, wether it‚Äôs sending a meme that made em think of me or picking me up a coffee, or finding out someone said something nice about me when i wasn‚Äôt around. it just blows my mind people think about me when im not present, or do things for the mere sake of being kind or making me happy. i didn‚Äôt get a lot of this kind of attention when i was a kid, i didn‚Äôt have a lot of friends growing up either, so it‚Äôs incredibly overwhelming to be treated kindly and it makes me really happy but to the point that when people are kind to me, i split and put them on an insane pedestal. and then i start to only feel happy when they‚Äôre nice to me, and then not getting attention- or god forbid, getting negative attention- from them is soul crushing. i cling onto friends intensely and although im better at masking those anxieties, it for sure was one of the things that stunted my relationships with people growing up. when my friends don‚Äôt do acts of kindness, or go too long without reaching out, i feel unloveable and like they hate me and i spiral into really low points. i know this is kind of a typical bpd thing, i just wanted to vent i guess. i wish this kind of thing didn‚Äôt matter so much to me but im not at all used to people being kind like this until very recently in my life and sometimes i don‚Äôt know how to handle it lol",1705914568.0,False,20,3,mihael69deeznutz,None,19crl0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/19crl0m/i_crave_positive_attention_so_bad/
222,Does anybody watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?,"In season 10, I believe episode 3 or 4, the gang's friend Psycho Pete gets released from a mental institute. Dennis, Dee, and Frank go to a psychologist to try to get Pete's medicine so that he doesn't go crazy. In the end Dennis comes back with medicine for himself for BPD.

This caught me way off guard last night and I sat there thinking about it for way longer than I should have. If you watch the show, do you think Dennis shows actual signs of BPD or do you think it's just an exaggeration? 

I looked at my fiance last night and was like, ""Ohh noo! Am I Dennis""? This whole time I've been saying Dennis is psycho. Then covered my head in a blanket... haha.

223,Help me,"I dont know what too do my dad has borderline personality disorder and he caused me so much trauma I‚Äôm nearly certain that I have it but in my country you can‚Äôt get diagnosed with it until you‚Äôre 18. And because I can‚Äôt get diagnosed with it I don‚Äôt get government funds which means I can‚Äôt get therapy for it and I can‚Äôt go on medication which will help me because you need a diagnosis to be valid to go on medication. I‚Äôm going crazy. Every day is so painful I just want to kill myself. I cut myself all the time and I lash out and scream and yell at my mum and my family and friends. My life is so horrible. I feel like I‚Äôm gonna kill myself any day now. I can‚Äôt go on medicine to help me. I just need help, but I have to wait until I can get a diagnosis. This is affecting me every day and I don‚Äôt know what to do it feels like I can‚Äôt breathe like I‚Äôm suffocating and then I just end up being like my dad and screaming. It‚Äôs not just the mood swings It‚Äôs the fear that my mum is gonna leave me, it‚Äôs the depression that last two weeks, it‚Äôs the cutting myself. I don‚Äôt know what to do I just want to kill myself. I feel so horrible and like such a bad person, but I feel like no matter what I can do. Nothing will ever help me. it doesn‚Äôt make sense why am my country we would have to wait till we‚Äôre 18 to get a diagnosis for personality disorders. Nothing changes the day before you turn 18 and the day after people as young as eight, have borderline personality disorder and most people with borderline personality disorder start showing symptoms as young as 15. go on medication and I‚Äôm going crazy.

226,There's no saving me,"Tried medicine and therapy, it was a waste of time. I just want to transition into a girl, and do my passion at art. But my mental illness keeps getting in the way. I want to accomplish things, but I am stagnant in my life. I know hard work pays off, but I'm so damn lazy. So lazy, I can't even bring myself to eat some days. I have no excuse.

227,"New here, thought I'd introduce myself.","Hi everyone. My name is Michael. I just figured I'd introduce myself real quick. :)

I was just diagnosed with BPD last year while under a 72 hour hold in the hospital for psychiatric reasons. The hospital psychiatrist told me that he doesn't believe I'm bipolar type 2 at all, and that I am, in fact, BPD. It took me a whole year to accept and embrace this news and not deny it anymore, but I'm getting therapy for it. 

It's not the traditional DBT most get for BPD, but rather EMDR. My friend from college offered to give me therapy, so I took him up on the offer. It's a bottom-up form of therapy instead of top-down, so it theoretically addresses the root of the problem at hand, the developmental trauma that is so common among BPD patients, and heals it. He said it he would waive any copays and let it be a friendly favor for me, but the last few times after my virtual sessions, they've called me to charge my card. Maybe they forgot? I might bring it up with him next time. Either way, I'm just happy to be getting therapy. My therapist I used to see retired (saw her from the time I was 8 yo until she retired, and I'm 33 yo now), and I had one therapist through Better Help, but that didn't work out favorably when she decided she wasn't a ""good match"" for me in the middle of me having a crisis.

I'm also having to get used to the idea that *therapy* is my medicine, not medications (which, while they do help, they are not the main answer). When I was diagnosed bipolar, it was all about medicine management, and nothing at all was working. I've found a few meds that keep me stable emotionally and interpersonally, but I still have some ""blips"" here and there where I get extremely emotionally labile and angry for no apparent reason. Caplyta is the medicine that has turned my life around, and I am not parting with it no matter what! I was able to start working again because of it (first time in six years!).

Looking forward to participating in this community! :)",1616515408.0,False,10,3,mikl_pls,,mbi0fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/mbi0fr/new_here_thought_id_introduce_myself/
