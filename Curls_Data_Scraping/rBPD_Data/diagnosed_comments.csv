3,"I had a therapist tell me I had BPD when I was around 27 or 28. I dismissed it because he told me I was also a narcist. I know a person with BPD can also be that, but I really don't think that fits me. 

A couple years later I read ""I hate you, don't leave me"" because another girl in my therapy groups was reading it and described it. I went to my current therapist and asked if she thought I had it.

6,"31, very affirming to know that my twenties (which were chaotic and toxic) were so impacted by my BPD, but also distressing knowing that I spent more than a decade of my adult life thinking ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something seriously fucking wrong with me‚Äù, but having no earthly idea what it was.",Kersbergen,1c4whxt
7,I got diagnosed when I was 21 and immediately rushed out of the office (five minutes into a session) because my therapist was uncomfortable with treating me. She gave me some resources to reach out to. I reached out to a team and then their psychiatrist UNdiagnosed me because he didn't like the stigma (his exact words) and since leaving that office I have been rediagnosed four separate times by four separate professionals. I'm 26 now and I still have no source of emotional regulation,unblissfully_aware,1c4whxt
8,"45 here, and I got pretty stable in my 30's, but then was unfortunately laid off after 8 years with a company in 2016, and violently attacked in 2018, both of which retriggered the BPD severely.  I'm hoping my 50's go better.",SignificantRabbit766,1c4whxt

12,"26, about a year ago. Finally got a therapist and psychiatrist who clicked with me and both fully understood how my mind works pretty much immediately. We went from there and quickly entered the diagnosis path, and by the time I got the formal diagnosis for bpd and severe adhd we had already advanced a lot in therapy and figuring out the correct dose of mood stabilizers.

Still rough, but glad I‚Äôm still here and aware of what is happening inside my head most of the time. I¬†don‚Äôt see myself going without medication or analysis any time soon, but it has been easier to live with bpd and I can finally picture myself ending up healthy and mostly regulated.¬†

13,"I was told by a therapist at 29 that I had some of the markers for bpd but was not clinically diagnosed until I was 30. It‚Äôs insane to me that most of us get diagnosed so late and we‚Äôve just been suffering with this mental illness, unable to cope or understand why we feel the way we do. Also makes me incredibly proud of myself (and you should be to!) that we‚Äôve made it this far all while carrying the weight of this illness with us.",cutecharms,1c4whxt

I was JUST diagnosed so I‚Äôm still learning but from all the posts in this group and another one I‚Äôm apart of I‚Äôve been able to realise a lot of the things I‚Äôve bested myself up for are a normal part of BPD. It‚Äôs like getting a million different diagnosis for problems then finding out that they were all actually one condition and not a million others. It‚Äôs helped me understand but I‚Äôm scared it still isn‚Äôt right. I‚Äôve always wondered what‚Äôs wrong with me so to have an answer helped me a lot,Flashy_Sail_4458,1c4whxt

I lashed out a LOT and I was very abnormal behaved and thinking compared to my peers due to ongoing trauma and neglect as a child.

155,"I was 32. Therapist thought I might be bipolar and referred me to a psychiatrist. In 30 minutes out of a 60 minute appointment, I was diagnosed.

Before that, I was told over and over I had anxiety and depression. I thought the swings in mood, the aggressive attachment, the TEMPER, were normal. I didn't know it wasn't. 

I had never heard of DBT until I was already in the process of emotional regulation and learning when I need to step back and look at things with fresh eyes after I had had a little time to calm down. 

Lamictal helps keep things a little more stable, but I watch for patterns in my emotions. If I notice I feel negative feelings because a friend sent a message that sounded dismissive, I step back, calm down, and come back where I can read it better and communicate with what and why it made me feel that way.

Usually, to regulate, I pull away from others to prevent lashing out. I will tell people ""my mood is overwhelming/bad and I need some space to calm down so I don't lash out at you without meaning/wanting to."" Once I have communicated my need for space, I put on music, or those reddit tales where a voice over reads reddit posts while a minecraft parkour video plays in the background. Then I play a game that is both mind numbing and engaging. Usually, I'll do jigsaw puzzles, sorting games, matching games. Things where I let my brain shut off while letting the body keep occupied to derail the negative feelings. Things that make me think ""this goes here... and this here...""",Mission-Definition-6,1c4whxt

24,"I've been through three years of hell with my mental health, so I've barely worked, barring a few weeks at different restaurants here and there. In that time I also started pursuing a career in programming, before that I got my BA in marketing and did 2 other things before that. I'm now studying again and I can't say I am even sure I'm interested in what I'm studying anymore but I'm warming up to the idea that change is just going to be a regular occurrence until I establish a stable identity for myself. 

Anyway, I just wanted to give you context and let you know you're not alone. It seems BDP can really impact people's careers sometimes. A particular insight which I have found makes sense for me to apply is finding a career where I can get on to a career path with multiple routes and different types of opportunities. For example, I'm planning on starting in tech when I finish studying next year, and I'm going to look for jobs in IT Support and Network Administration, from there I can change into several different roles and explore different avenues. I'm trying to embrace the change and give myself a safe place to do so. It might take more time and a lot more dedication to a certain industry but I think it will be better than inducing a full on meltdown justify a career change and start from scratch. 

I don't know if that insight is useful or not and I'm not convinced by anything I just typed when I used my current career path as an example but I think the principle is: until I know who I am and can embrace myself fully, I will never find anything to be fulfilling long term because don't have key values to identify with.",chronically-iconic,16tf46s

Actually, seeing as how I have a complex brain with a lot of neurodivergent things going as well as seeing as how psychology in its self is fascinating to me, I am going into psychology. Clinical psychology. Gotta do some college first but it's where I've been passionate for over a year.

Your passions can be your career. Passions can be whatever you enjoy doing. I never thought I'd be going into psychology, let alone obsessed with it. But here I find myself.

Give yourself the space to find your interests. I spent a long time refining exactly what I want. I wanted to work with people but I don't wanna do retail or customer service. I thought about bartending but that field is very hot and miss and with my health issues, I either would have to manage and build skills to get into a hotel or go live somewhere I don't wanna live because of tourism or just known for having that kind of life style, like parts of California.

I thought about getting away from people and working with animals but that doesn't resonate quite right. And the education doesn't cover the things I really felt passionate about. 

I wanted to do construction (HVAC specifically) but my body WILL crap out on me. I mean, just doing the 8ish months of it after graduated has given me shoulder issues, hip issues, and neck issues. I've been working on recovering and here we are 8 months later and I still haven't recovered properly. So, I have to keep my body in mind as well with heightened awareness compared to the average person.

The frustration lead me to try therapy and I had a bad experience. But also it exposed a lot that I had kept behind a mask and then I started seeking my own answers. That's when I found that I am personable. People like me. I like people (for the most part) and know I have a lot of good I can bring to the clinical psychology field. I can put all of myself into that.

Even more, I can put myself there because I simply care.

That's my discovery. I questioned myself, I did research, I analyzed things. I looked at real estate and doing estate sales or online sales for people. I explored things to really try and figure out what I want. Give yourself the opening to question yourself and you will find the answers you need.",AppropriateKale8877,16tf46s

115,"Licensed Clinical Laboratory Scientist (CLS)

A CLS runs laboratory tests for patient samples (blood, body fluids, urine,etc.) that come to the hospital to determine whether the patient is sick or healthy.

Pros

Knowledge is similar to a doctor (without taking as much time to become one)
Only work on a team of others (usually very small) 
Don‚Äôt face patients like nurses or others in the hospital
Help diagnose physical illnesses and feel like purpose is contributing to the greater good
Pay is significant and high

Great for individual independent work. You can work all types of shifts (day, night, swing) There are enough people around to socialize just enough to consider it not isolating. Usually quiet besides the analyzers doing its thing.

Cons

Sometimes deadlines can be stressful or a piece of equipment break down. 
Requires a ton of preparation to enter the field, must complete a bachelors, complete a one year internship program, and pass a board exam for the license.

Ultimately best decision for me who loves learning and has been managing quite well despite multiple hospitalizations in recent years and attending IOP.",rawrmoosheartsissa,16tf46s

I worked in customer service for a few years, and it was like living a nightmare over and over again. I still have limits on things at work, but that helps me even more. For instance, i asked to not be placed by myself because i get too overwhelmed, i need someone to anchor me back down. so my job had me float between rooms and i was never alone! i found that working with preschoolers overwhelmed me, but babies could take me from 100 to 0 in a few seconds. i started working in the infant room, and that helped me more. i had to leave the daycare for school in august and since then i actually feel like i‚Äôve been struggling. the idea of getting a job in customer service, working with other people and stuff makes me so nervous and anxious. i am in early childhood education, but i worry about having my own classroom. i‚Äôve been considering being a one on one support, working as a professor for education majors, diversity and inclusion curriculum director, etc. i would love to be a para in a classroom, a co-teacher to another teacher, or to work back in my babies room because i‚Äôd have a coteacher myself. 

i understand completely what you mean by interests and money. i constantly worry about financial stability, but i also constantly bounce between careers i wish i could have, like working as a marine biologist. life is weird and crazy and strange. just take it one day at a time friend! try to look within yourself, but also remember plenty of people choose a career and change down the line. many of my professors were kindergarten, first, second grade teachers. i worked with somebody who had a degree in psychology but was interested in working with kids too, so she got her masters in early childhood. there‚Äôs lots of great things you can do, and life isn‚Äôt small and limiting, even though we feel that way. it‚Äôs just hard to put it in perspective. what i tell myself is whether i do it or not, the time passes anyways. so i can spend this time learning it, even if it takes a while, or i can watch it fly by me and wonder why i didn‚Äôt do it years ago.",AppearanceNo5191,16tf46s

Or you ‚Äúhire‚Äù a grave for 10 to 15 years, which means the rights stay with the government or graveyard itself and when the time expires your rights to the grave do aswel. (Common graves where 2 total strangers might be lying on top or next to each other.)",PsyconautFox,16tf46s

It consists of two parts, a test you take and then there's an oral exam part too. Your scores get added up into points, then your grades get turned into points too. 
To have extra points you can attend and win(!) a certain competition or be a very good athlete.
Also extra points are language certificates like B2 or C1 and/or you can take a higher level exam from the subjects but you have to do well on them for extra points, and they are very hard so your percentage goes down a little obviously. 

All of the extra points are maximised at a 100, you cannot get more, even if you technically could.

The max you can get is 400 (500 if you count that extra 100 you can earn), but it's almost impossible. For a perfect 500 you need to be a straight A student all throughout high school, you need to score a 100% on all of your exams and you need two higher level exams for the additional 100. So as I said, almost impossible.

An average student gets about 350-380. The points you need to get are determined by the uni or college.

For psychology you needed around 435, but they've increased it since and now it's around 450. Higher than law or medicine at some universities.
When I graduated, I had 413, but I was a good student, practically aced the exams and I even have a C1 in English and I did the higher level history for extra points.

Grad school is definitely a different beast than undergrad.

Last thing I'll say is that I applied without really understanding much of what I was signing up for and I pretty much never understood what was going on as far as program requirements.

i'm not ashamed, the meds just messed me up.  but now i'm on a bipolar-type Rx regiment by chance anyway so it doesn't matter!

as far as BPD goes, i got diagnosed at the hospital and didn't see it coming.  came from left field.  took me a while to accept it.  

i think it sunk in when after i told my GP this diagnosis, at one of my appointments, the nurse asked me if i wanted to unalive myself in the last era.  i forget how i reacted but i was definitely embarrassed and scared.  i probably lied and said no.  how much do they know about Passive SI, you know?",PseudoSolitude,1b581jz

50,"People hurting deserve to feel better and get mental help. For some a diagnosis brings relief/ a name for what‚Äôs been going on. For others it makes them feel worse because of stigma or what not. I wrote it somewhere else, but remember the US is the only place where we narrow down to these specific diagnoses (I actually have CPTSD not BPD). The rest of the world (80% of the population) diagnoses people with a PD period‚Ä¶that may have stronger traits in xyz, but personally disorders overlap and fall under an umbrella of trauma. That‚Äôs it. In the end, so many symptoms overlap and more importantly the goal of treatment is the same, heal and become mentally healthier. For every trauma based illness the therapy recommended is the same, DBT, CBT, EDMR or schema therapy. Like medications, what works for one person doesn‚Äôt work for another and people have to find their therapeutic fit. People are very rarely diagnosed with one illness and those with BPD are the most rare to only have BPD (95% comorbid conditions). It‚Äôs difficult to diagnose and on average takes five years because every person gets help for various reasons (present as depression, anxiety, anger etc) therapists travel down the road of symptoms someone describes. In the end, I wish the US didn‚Äôt narrow down all these specific conditions because it makes people feel stigmatized/misunderstood. You have a personality disorder, you had trauma, it affects you and you need help to get better. I prefer this condition because that one people think you‚Äôre a monster, but look at all of them, they overlap so much, they‚Äôre rooted the same and the same healing is prescribed. People get in wars over whether this person truly has BPD or wants attention or someone accepts CPTSD because they don‚Äôt want the stigma of BPD. My opinion, I wish we didn‚Äôt break all these things into narrow categories and follow the rest of the world that concentrates of healing from trauma and pain and learning new skills to foster better relationships. People would just have a personality disorder and describe it as trauma that affects them and not compare or argue which condition makes you a crazy person or a suffering person.

Now if you are ashamed and embarrassed by some of the actions you have taken that came as a result of your BPD, well that's a different story. You are going to have to forgive yourself for those things, but having some shame and embarrassment just shows that you don't have narcissism, which is what a lot of people with BPD get accused of. In the end a diagnosis is just a box for insurance companies to check off and for a blanket approach to what works for many people who share similar traits and experiences with you. In the end, like any personality disorder is the PERSONAL aspect. It's your situation, your trauma, how you are reacting. And you need to find out what is going to work best for you to avoid such shame and embarrassment in the future. It will also benefit you, to learn to how to have and maintain ""healthy"" relationships as well as if you keep putting it off too long where the disorder part starts having a real life DISORDER on your life. 

It's very common for BPD people not to want to be diagnosed. The entire BPD aspect it built around shielding yourself from whatever trauma was there in the first place. Whether you are regulating through friends, testing relationships or not seeking help for yourself. That is all part of not facing the thing you don't want to face that you are afraid will happen again to you in your life and cause you pain.

77,"*raises hand*

Several years ago, I fought to get the BPD diagnosis removed from my list of diagnoses. I felt like the diagnosis was a black eye on my medical record. I asked what criteria from the manual was used, and there were two things used that I had disagreed with, suicide and relationship history. My previous suicide attempts weren't done to garner attention or as a reaction to someone (with the exception to my grandmother when I was a teen). And my relationship history had changed over the years to the point of no longer having frequent, intense relationships. 

Fast forward to the breakup I had a month ago. I hadn't been in a relationship five years before this one. The way I reacted to this breakup was unusual. Never have I ever wanted to die over someone rejecting me, but at least I didn't get beyond suicidal ideation. And here I am trying to get back in dating as a bandage (something I did when I was way younger...echoes of the frequent and intense relationship history), but I haven't gone past the stage of small talk. My current therapist had asked questions that indicated to me that she was possibly thinking I might have BPD. The diagnosis did fit me 20+ years ago.",uncomfortablePOV,1b581jz
78,"For me it went like this:

A couple of years back my best friend and I split up after a loooong time of fighting every day. They kept attacking me on social media, refused to see their share in it and blamed me for everything. I knew she was doing it, bc she was hurt. I talked to my brother about it. He studies psychology and said, ""that reminds me of typical BPD behavior"". I was super ignorant to the diagnosis and only knew the stigma around it. You know, the typical ""the crazy people""-stigma. I looked up the criteria in the DSM-5 and as I was reading I started to see myself in it. I got scared, thinking I was a bad person, and suppressed it for many years.

Then last year I started therapy. Because of the things I was saying and the questions my therapist was asking, I remembered what I had read a few years back and thought to myself ""fuck, that sounds like borderline"". I was always scared she'd bring it up and tell me I have it. Then at some point, she eventually did. We went through all the diagnosing and shit and I spent months denying the diagnosis. 

Then I went onto this subreddit. I read a lot of things I could relate to and that slowly hacked away on my stigma. It gave me the courage to see BPD for that it actually is and change my perspective on it. Now I don't feel ashamed anymore. Im grateful for understanding myself better and being able to work on myself. And I'm grateful for all the people on here that paint such a broad and diverse picture on BPD.",Jutora97,1b581jz

The labels get people hung up or someone will say I was diagnosed with four conditions and it makes them believe they are the worst case ever, when that‚Äôs not really the case. Labels make people google and watch YouTube videos and lose site of feeling healthy but instead focusing on statistics, whether they can get better or not etc. Like anything, BPD is on a spectrum and what bothers one person the most isn‚Äôt necessarily what another person struggles the most with. Most people with BPD do have a higher level of intelligence than others it‚Äôs the emotional intelligence that‚Äôs different. I don‚Äôt have the answer but I think reminding yourself that you have a PD that has roots in genetics and trauma (and it‚Äôs how you‚Äôd be diagnosed anywhere but the US) is more important than narrowing in on specifically BPD and what correlates and what doesn‚Äôt. Look at all the Cluster B disorders and just think about symptoms that are related to you. People understand depression and it‚Äôs accepted but it means something different depending on the person. One person suffering can‚Äôt sleep and another sleeps to much. One works and another can‚Äôt. Medicines work for some and not others. You can become self aware about your symptoms but that can also cause hyper focus and rumination.

I apologize, you are correct, it has not been fully implemented just yet: 

The 11th revision‚Ä¶.‚Äùincludes a fundamentally new approach to Personality Disorders (PD). ICD-11 is expected to be implemented first in European countries before other WHO member states‚Äù

‚ÄúPD severity classification, trait domain specifiers, and the additional borderline pattern specifier‚Äù

The ‚Äúclassification involves major changes for health care workers, researchers, administrators, and service providers as well as patients and families involved‚Äù

‚ÄúInstead of diagnosing PDs according to familiar categorical types, the practitioner must now focus on general impairments of self- and interpersonal functioning, which can be classified according to their overall severity (i.e., Mild Personality Disorder, Moderate Personality Disorder, Severe Personality Disorder). Alternatively, the user can assign a sub-threshold Personality Difficulty code (comparable to ICD-10 Z73.1 accentuated personality traits).‚Äù

The point I was making was that labels shift and when mental health professionals adopt this new model the treatment algorithm hasn‚Äôt shifted.  Some people struggle with the stigma of the label itself. You aren‚Äôt  going to walk into your therapist one day and they‚Äôll say your diagnosis switched to a personality disorder with traits predominately in BPD just like people diagnosed with Asperger‚Äôs years ago still call it the same name and it hasn‚Äôt shifted.

Doc: **And what's even the point, at this point, right?**

What she meant, and what I always meant, was, ""Diagnosis is most important for treatment, and all these other disorders more or less cover all the possible approaches to living with independent autistic adulthood.""

But I do think that's changing. While there's a stigma from some people, I do think in some ways autism is gaining respect that, say, ADHD lags behind.

Anyways I have multiple personality disorders!

Late diagnosed autism and ADHD aka AuDHD, treatment resistant MDD with psychotic features, cPTSD, anxiety/panic disorder, sleep disorder or just plain ol' CFS I attribute to depression/trauma, fibromyalgia I attribute to trauma, autoimmune disease I attribute to trauma, body dysmorphic disorder, poly substance use disorder, in recovery from one hell of a random severe acute ED, and a stupid ass pathological fawn response that isn't a real diagnosis but I hate it I hate it I hate it. 

I think that's all the behavioral and behavioral-as-root-cause diagnoses.

I am not used to any medication ever working for me but they had recently discovered the benefits if topiramate in civilian PTSD and it's now starting to be prescribed for that pretty widely. Namely to prevent intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance, nightmares, rumination, and avoidance of reexperiencing symptoms so that people are able to go through with therapy to process their trauma and sit with painful thoughts and emotions in order to be able to release that pain for good. 

Not only am I prone to the nocebo effect, but I am genetically unable to metabolize about 1/3 of all medications well, so i expected nothing. It was a couple weeks in to the baby dose I had the sudden realization that i was in constant distress and I was fucking grateful and hella confused. Then as soon as I asked myself why, what changed, how am I no longer constantly not in distress and oh my god it's my head, it's quiet. That's when I did research because that was never the reason I went on it, and I found the literature about its uses for intrusive thoughts and PTSD and i was fucking sold, beam me up scotty, where's my dosage increase, life was never the same, the profound relief only increased and never has it waned in 7+ months so far. 

I can just... have a quiet mind, no rumination, ever, no inner critic, no unwarranted worrying, I have to think to think, all I kind of really do is look at things from a problem solving perspective now. It's fucking bizarre and amazing.",Technical_Slide1515,1ccdz5q

311,"Emotional dysregulation with the added lack of impulse control has been the most challenging thing to get a hold of.

When I feel, I feel very intensely, as do all of us affected by Borderline Personality Disorder. I have had to learn to navigate my inhibitions intensely. I am very guarded, reserved, and hypersensitive and thus, always feeling tired and often burned out. 

Because we have all seen and read posts of how those of us with BPD live through those cyclical patterns of emotional dysregulation followed by inappropriate reaction often ending with embarassment, shame, remorse, resentment, and more. But what happens when that last part is an empty space for you? I know what shame is, its importance as a societal tool. I have done things I should be ashamed of and yet I feel no shame. I have caused damage, I have hurt, I have broken. Folks here talk about these ever lasting feelings, regrets, all the awful things they do or have done that they cannot get over. I don't have any of that.

It's sort of just a normal part of my life and I don't give much thought to it, because I've just had it for so long lol.  I'm also not super sensitive like some people, fortunately.  I can occasionally eat something with a little bit of gluten for the sake of convenience without any obvious or immediate side effects, but I certainly can't just regularly eat it or stuff a donut in my face hole.  It was very difficult in the beginning, having to adjust and give up all those things that people love eating, and made me pretty depressed.  It also wasn't as high demand as it is now, and not many companies and brands were making alternatives, and the ones available were absolute garbage.  Luckily there is a lot of options now, and dedicated gf companies and such.

Does your wife take anything for the fibromyalgia?  I am on amitriptyline for mine, and I find that it really helps a lot with the widespread pain and brain fog.  I'm actually so grateful that there's an option to make me feel like I can actually function like a somewhat normal person who isn't in a daze and having their whole body hurt for literally no reason lol.

A true explanation for your ""issues"" makes all the difference when it comes to mental health.  I started doing a whole lot better after I ended up with a proper dx of BPD and began going to DBT... Really turned my life around and helped a lot that I could do something to correct bad habits that were having a negative impact on me and people close to me, as well as regulate my emotions and properly express them and whatnot.  It got to a point in my early 30's where my emotional dyregulation was so severe that it was actually ruining my life.  The self-gratifying behaviours were also doing me a lot of harm, because the happiness was short-lived and never really amounted to anything that made it worth it.  It also didn't help that I went about 12 years being misdiagnosed as having bipolar disorder...  It made so much more sense when I knew it was actually BPD.  Over the past year or two, some of this stuff started creeping back over, and my mental health took a real dive.  I couldn't figure out why I was better for so long, and then was all of a sudden having similar symptoms, and everyday life became SO MUCH.  And then, there was the other dx I needed:  ADHD lol.",x0x_anna,1ccdz5q

But once you have a name for it you can read up on the literature and join groups like this one full of people with similar experiences. You can get a handle on patterns, develop a framework for thinking about things and names that help you navigate them. 

I grew up in the nineties and I didn‚Äôt even understand what a trigger was until a few years ago. Even that alone- being able to identity the thing that made you feel unsteady before you lost control and then being able to dig into that thing later to try to understand where it comes from has been astronomical for me.

The amount that I‚Äôve grown in my understanding of my life and myself in just the last few years that I‚Äôve been digesting this can‚Äôt be put into words. Knowing doesn‚Äôt make the symptoms go away, but they become infinitely easier to manage. Especially these days, our understanding of bpd- where it comes from and how to treat it- is much more advanced than it‚Äôs ever been before. We have so many resources that our parents didn‚Äôt have, and that our grandparents definitely didn‚Äôt have.

167,"This year, 27, after 13 years with only a unipolar depression diagnosis as far as mood disorders go. I have generalized anxiety too and used to have panic disorder and agoraphobia.

A couple years ago my psychiatrist (same one I had all this time, mind you) and a psychiatric NP I had while in a partial hospitalization program both said I could have bipolar type II, but that slid off the table eventually.

This year I fired my psychiatrist and started seeing a psychiatric NP in the same office. She screened me during my first appointment, and I scored really high. She said she suspected I had BPD 10 minutes after talking to me.

So much started making sense. The ironic part is that I had at least two psychiatric evaluations throughout my life and the personality questionnaires, which screen for multiple different general problems, couldn't be scored both times due to contradictory answers I gave.

Hello, unstable sense of self.

Unfortunately being diagnosed late has caused me so much pain. I think if I hadn't gotten DBT in that depression PHP, I might be even worse off. That said, to say I'm pissed off about the diagnosis being missed for so long is an understatement.

I blame stigma. I don't fit the stereotype *I* had in mind, and I believe not fitting a certain ""profile"" is part of what caused professionals to not diagnose me correctly for at least 10 years.

The craziest thing for to learn is that it‚Äôs a spectrum. Some people may never have issues with manipulation, abusive behaviors or even a favorite person. The shit most other people are freaking out about might never happen in your life.

You don‚Äôt need a history of trauma, self harm, manipulation to be diagnosed. So anyone who leads with any of that I know that they‚Äôre completely uneducated. People have herd mentalities, they go off of what they heard and their own personal experiences. 

 People have been abused by someone with BPD, but to assume that we (someone they‚Äôll never meet or be in a relationship with) is going to be abusive is just lack of intelligence and critical thinking skills. 

Don‚Äôt listen to everything you hear on the internet about BPD. Because A LOT is misinformation.
I‚Äôve met plenty of people IRL who are open and welcoming about my diagnosis. They don‚Äôt care and they‚Äôll go off of my character instead of stigma.

3,"I agree that medical misogyny plays a big role in why bpd is overwhelmingly diagnosed in women vs men, and i have no intention to invalidate that. But! Another big reason is also that a huge chunk of men with personality disorders don‚Äôt get diagnosed, or are only diagnosed after ending up in substance abuse programs or in prison or other such institutions. I think women are more likely to seek out help before ending up in such situations, and societal norms play a role in how personality disorders are expressed in different genders.

6,"Thank you for sharing. I was diagnosed with BPD and CPTSD two years ago and to be fair I kind of suggested it because autism didn‚Äôt cross my mind, stupidly considering my half brother was diagnosed as a child and we share a Dad who was also probably autistic but born before it was even a diagnosis. 

I recently had a significant burn out (for like the 100th time) but this time I could not recover from it for months. I was really struggling. I spent all day in bed, was much more sensitive to sensory overload and had terrible social anxiety and barely left the house. I have a masters degree and am a healthcare professional and lecturer and I love my jobs but I had to stay off sick for five months and I am still easing slowly back into work.

During my time off I suddenly clicked one day about autism. This sounds stupid but I realised when my partner was playing around with chap GPT and giving it precise instructions. I realised that‚Äôs how my mind works. I need precise instructions to understand what someone else wants from me. Also I am very much a bottom up thinker. I have to learn everything I can about something in order to understand it which is good at increasing knowledge but pretty exhausting. 

Also I already was aware how I struggle to make eye contact with people I don‚Äôt know like my patients and I tend to over compensate by being super cheery to avoid complaints. That takes so much more energy from me than I realised. 

I also when growing up struggled with fluorescent lights at school to the point I was investigated for it because despite being top in the class at maths and science it would take me ages to write a paragraph of text because my eyes would hurt and I would get headaches. I also have a convergence insufficiency which is common in ADHD and ASD and that was diagnosed as a child and I still have the issue. 

I also have food sensitivities particularly around textures and although my diet is a lot more varied now, if something has the wrong texture it will put me off eating it again for a long time. I also have other autonomic issues with my body and I‚Äôm hypermobile which is also commonly linked to ASD. So I‚Äôve requested an ASD assessment and am kind of self diagnosed now and feel a lot better for recognising it, it‚Äôs the only thing that has made any sense of how dichotomous my life is. How I‚Äôm so organised at work and efficient but at home I‚Äôm a mess. I think I likely have the combination of ADHD and ASD and I think it‚Äôs particularly that combination that is misdiagnosed as well as BPD because I get rejection dysphoria, I have meltdowns when overwhelmed and overstimulated.",Magurndy,1bjzpo1
7,"I had the opposite affect. I display a lot of signs of autism outwardly, but that is due to growing up with a parent with OCD, and developing PTSD and BPD.

Being told that by lay-people let them say the rudest shit about me, and it triggers me now to hear it because I know someone is going to insult me under the guise of helping.

The great thing about the DSM is that it is essentially a checklist. If you meet criteria you have that disorder (according to our latest research and techniques). From one autistic borderline I will tell you that I feel very alone in a lot of autism circles, and also in borderline circles. The combination of the two is unique and genuinely feels crafted as a Frankenstein‚Äôs monster. 

On the flip side of that, the logic oriented, puzzle solving, pattern recognition part of autism has saved my life. It helps me research, understand, and track my symptoms. DBT was fast and effective for me, and I think for many autistic borderlines it is similar. Hopefully over time you can figure out what scientific explanations apply to your story and you can use those to help heal from what troubles you.

There's research to suggest that trauma-based illnesses such as PTSD are more likely to occur in autistic people. 

While BPD is not classified as a trauma disorder (trauma is not a requirement), it does seem that most people who meet the diagnostic criteria have experienced childhood trauma of some type (particularly sexual abuse and/or neglect, although not always). So it would make sense that BPD also occurs at a higher rate in autistic people.

90,"The differentiation is important because it recognizes the differences between how male autism and female autism present, and that leads to more women being properly diagnosed. Female autism is severely under diagnosed, while male autism is not. There‚Äôs a systematic difference in how autism is handled in males vs females. The differences are not just in relation to masking. Autistic females have been reported to present more frequently with affective symptoms and suicidal behaviors. Based on recent studies, girls, on average, had more externalization behaviors and had more intellectual disabilities than boys who receive a diagnosis of asd. Recognizing the differences between male autism and female autism is crucial.

109,">BPD is caused by trauma

Thing is, ASD can cause all sorts of things to become trauma, events which can happen at all sorts of early ages. And research is not 100% certain on that BPD is 100% always caused by trauma (even though it most commonly is) and that people can be either born with it or predisposed. 

I certainly can't speak for OP, but I can very similarly relate. I was raised in a very well- loved environment right from the start, and I seemed to be either born with BPD symptoms or they started before ages 3-4 (far back as I can remember). And I likely have ASD. Ultimately the BPD symptoms I have are extreme enough that even if ASD were the cause, I meet the criteria so the diagnosis ultimately seems to make sense. 

Though given testimonies like OP's and the growing research on autism, it's possible there's a lot we all still don't know about how it presents, and how it relates to many other illnesses.",SadUndercover,1bjzpo1
110,"Also misdiagnosed BPD here, I've had a rough life but my behaviours pre-dated any trauma I had and I do *not* fit the criteria for a lot of BPD behaviours save for the ones that overlap. 

If anything, I think psychiatrists are far too ready to slap a BPD diagnosis onto women that are quite clearly distressed or are struggling with their mental health - and it is not a small diagnosis by any means, it can be job ruining and social ruining and relationship ruining. A large portion of women in jail are diagnosed BPD, atleast here in the UK. People would rather see women who are struggling with these behaviours as ""problematic"" than neurodiverse, because the latter means they have to come to terms with their treatment of those who simply have a brain that is wired differently when a problematic diagnosis grants them the freedom to do so.

When they see these behaviours, they need to start looking at autism first, BPD second. There is no shame in having BPD, and it can overlap, but I dread to think how many women have basically been told they're unfixable when the reality is there is fundamentally nothing wrong with them.",padajuann,1bjzpo1

116,Yeah I have autism and bpd and I kind of dislike the notion that bpd women are just autistic when you and probably are both just an autistic person who was traumatised and developed bpd and it‚Äôs very common to have both or the holy trinity ( audhd and bpd) so I think people need to not think so one dimensionally,Putrid_Resist_1304,1bjzpo1
117,"I‚Äôm quite confused how you got to that point. Imagine two peoples thumbs are hurting, one cut their finger with a knife and the other has a splinter they both have the same symptom (a hurting thumb), but it has a different cause and it needs to be treated differently. The reason why bpd is the most commonly misdiagnosed disorder with autism is because the symptoms overlap. There is no other disorder that overlaps this severely. There‚Äôs also a high rate of comorbidity. Historically, when men were making the diagnosis of bpd they were basing it around autistic women, because at that time it was believed that women didn‚Äôt have autism so their traits were listed as bpd. Currently, it‚Äôs heavily debated by scholars if bpd is a form of neurodivergence. Now we have a much better understanding of bpd but we still don‚Äôt have a perfect understanding. I don‚Äôt have the same reasoning or cause behind my symptoms, my issues are related to my brain in a way that is different from people with bpd. People can have both but I don‚Äôt. It looks like it on the surface but when it‚Äôs analyzed it‚Äôs not the same. That‚Äôs why in-depth studying of patients is so important to avoid a misdiagnosis. Also there are more traits to having autism than just the ones that meet the bpd diagnosis. It‚Äôs not reversible. You can have autism and have all the bpd textbook requirements without having bpd, that‚Äôs because the bpd symptoms can be caused by a wide range of things, but you cannot have bpd and have every symptom/ trait of autism and not have autism.",TMay223,1bjzpo1

25,"I got diagnosed at 24. I‚Äôve showed some of the early signs since I was young and I picked up a collection of diagnoses from ages 13-23 (bipolar, unspecified mood disorder, premestrual dysphoric disorder, major depressive disorder, etc)  

What clued me in was that the normal treatment for bipolar disorder didn‚Äôt work, PMDD didn‚Äôt seem to fit, and nothing seemed to explain my hypersensitivity to rejection, impulsivity, and mood instability. I‚Äôve been in therapy since I was 11 and even though I‚Äôve gained a little bit of insight into my struggles, my symptoms never improved. 

Then when I was 19 in my educational path to becoming a therapist I learned about BPD in class and it resonated with me. But my therapist at the time told me there was no way I could have BPD bc I was ‚Äúso high functioning‚Äù (I was an emotional wreck). 

Bc of various stressors, my symptoms worsened when I was 23-24 and I got back into therapy. Got diagnosed with BPD by a psychologist who specializes in it. Started DBT and lo and behold, I actually saw improvement for the first time in my life. I really wish one of my therapists before had been better trained in recognizing and treating BPD bc then maybe I could have gotten the right treatment sooner ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",SecretCaregiver1070,1b7fj4q

then at 17 i was ‚Äúunofficially officially‚Äù diagnosed by a second psychiatrist. basically told me this was what i had but he wasn‚Äôt going to officially diagnose me until i was of age- at 18 i received my official diagnosis. 

so silly, the signs were always there for me. i wish i would‚Äôve taken it more seriously sooner, as once i did i started to learn and understand myself a lot better.",telllthemoon,1b7fj4q

I was like, yeah that‚Äôs relatable but it can‚Äôt be that serious. Probably just anxiety! 

And then I got treatment for everything under the sun and never showed any progress, other than getting worse, until I got diagnosed with BPD.

The only thing I knew was wrong was my manic episode. I was 16 when that happened, it lasted nearly 6 months.

My psychiatrist, before diagnosing me with BPD and GAD also thinks I have ADHD and Bipolar Disorder. I researched Bipolar Disorder for months after my manic episode only to throw it away when I was about to be 17 because my Dad told me he researched it on books.

There‚Äôs a lot of details I can‚Äôt get into but I think the biggest thing is that being rejected for my autistic traits triggers my BPD pretty badly. And being autistic makes it hard to meet new people and get close to them, which can create even more of a scarcity mindset and makes my BPD worse when I go through a breakup or when attempts at socializing don‚Äôt go well. 

Also, how well my ADHD and ASD are managed impacts the severity of my BPD symptoms. Having safe foods available, taking breaks to rest, and avoiding loud and crowded places help prevent sensory overwhelm which can trigger emotional instability and make me more impulsive, irritable, or otherwise responsive to BPD triggers. ADHD is easy to manage with medication so it doesn‚Äôt really cause me problems. It actually stabilizes me a lot to be on ADHD meds.

I can see things a lot more clearly now, i.e. instances my husband gaslit me, put me down, stonewalled me, etc. I might not know all the answers, but I know that I'm not the only one who can spiral. Unfortunately, my husband tends to scapegoat me to avoid taking accountability for his own shortcomings in our marriage.

So now I get to go through 33 years of unresolved internal conflict and feel bad everytime I remember something I did to my loved ones.

I'm fighting to get the other two diagnoses as well since I don't think it's fair that they know I've got other things but are refusing to take that seriously at the minute.

I feel it's definitely easier to get a diagnosis when you're 18 in some places, but if they spot it early then that's pretty epic. however where I am it's more likely you'll be diagnosed once you're in your 20s since they don't like to take teenagers seriously due to the potential hormonal issues with still yknow developing

18,"This is why I hate seeing diagnoses made so young.  :(  I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre confused as to whether you are ‚Äúdisordered‚Äù or not. Sigh. Here goes a big ramble 
 
We should all be aware of how psych  became science and the initial rationale behind the making of such categories (racism, sexism, eugenics, basically), but that‚Äôs another discussion. Fortunately that‚Äôs not today‚Äôs rationale. But it‚Äôs how we got to today. 

Accurately diagnosing a personality disorder (if such a thing exists) relies on two things: 
1. enough time having passed for the ‚Äúformation‚Äù of personality itself. 

Which is.. when exactly‚Ä¶? Most would argue older than 14 and more towards mid to late 20s at earliest. Some would say it quite reasonably changes throughout life as we respond to experiences so is never truly fully formed or fixed. You are born with a temperament, you develop a personality over enough time on and interaction with, earth. 

And 2. enough time having lapsed to see persistent, pervasive, destructive, dysfunctional patterns in relationships - with others and the self - repeatedly - to the point of disturbance. This means, there has to be a repeated pattern of thoughts/feelings/behaviour impairing functioning well beyond the hormonal teenage years which persists into adulthood. You have had to have had enough varied life experiences, and persistently reacted to them in adverse ways.

I studied and work in psych, and am also mad, whatever that is. I had a great module on my MSc years ago on the origins of psychology and psychiatry as science and now question everything diagnostic and pathologising when it comes to thoughts/feelings/behaviour - which are the subjective points of interest in psych diagnoses and which are fundamentally different in any and all ways from all other diagnostic points of interest in medicine. 

That is not to say that diagnoses can‚Äôt be useful for people to make sense of themselves, and there‚Äôs no doubt that therapies and some meds have the potential to be helpful. 

Today the rationale for diagnoses is not about all about eugenics and more about getting help and tools for individuals to function and have some level of wellbeing to ensure the safety and functionality of a workforce society‚Ä¶ but human beings do love to make categories and identify ourselves within or without them. Society and the passage of time dictates which flavour categories are more or less acceptable. This goes for diagnoses as well, incidence and prevalence change according to external, societal influences.  That doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs any fewer or more people suffering or behaving in that way.

A senior colleague once told me that a good way to understand the concept of PD, and identify a key difference between Axis 1 diagnoses (eg schizophrenia, bipolar, mood disorders) and Axis 2 diagnoses (personality disorders) is that you would never see Axis 2 if the person were alone on a desert island but you would see Axis 1.  

BPD - if it‚Äôs real - if science is real, if anything is real ü•≤ - exists only in the context of how we relate to other people. Persistently. 

I do believe there are a collection of behaviours and cognitive biases which pertain to a category of relational thinking/feeling/behaving, which we could call BPD. I don‚Äôt believe this is a ‚Äúdisease‚Äù or even necessarily a ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù. It definitely doesn‚Äôt make you unfixable because you got slapped with a diagnosis at 14.

I am in the U.K. and here we don‚Äôt make formal diagnoses of BPD prior to 18 but we do still have an ‚Äúemerging‚Äù type.  

I wish you luck op, whatever you decide to do!  How do you feel in yourself? Do you feel you would benefit from DBT? You could always get reassessed and raise the whole scenario with another psychiatrist. They are all subjective individuals and some do share my cynical view. 

Whatever you do, you are not unfixable!  Life is a journey and we pick up many tools and lessons along the way.  Unfortunately, the human brain is not wired to be happy, it is wired to survive.  And we are not fixed either which is a blessing!!

Thing is, with BPD, you often hear ""It gets better once you turn 30"", but that's not necessarily true. I've seen people in their 40s, 50s, and even 60s, who really struggle and fight every day- it's quite disrespectful to those folks to make such claims as ""BPD is a young disorder"". Those people who get diagnosed with BPD and just automatically ""grow out of it"" - respectfully, I don't think they have a personality disorder (because with every other pd, persistence in symptoms in crucial), and they shouldn't get labeled so early.

179,"I still don't have a 'formal' diagnosis, I'm 30 but a psychiatrist & phycologist working together told me it's BPD & PTSD and said that they will write letters to that effect if I ever need them for other doctors, therapists, benefits etc. So I don't really understand how or why it's not a 'formal' diagnosis or what that means. I think my psychiatrist just really doesn't like labels, I've been in her care since I was 18 because I got diagnosed with autism at 17 by child psychiatry & psychology services.

Got transferred to the adult services at 18 because I was still struggling with so many things that autism didn't fully explain and it was literally only this year I got told about BPD & PTSD because I specifically asked if they have any ideas, or names for what's been happening to me all my life. I had to practically beg them to tell me what they're writing about me in my medical records. üôÑ

My mum was also told when I was about 7 that I could have ADHD/Autism or both but that the child psychologist didn't want to label me so young so instead of access to help, understanding myself, having a label and reason to explain why I felt & acted the way I did I just struggled through hating myself and my life until I got so severely depressed at 14 that my mum had to beg the doctors to take my mental health seriously or she was afraid she was going to lose me. 

I think there is definitely an old school way of doing things and older doctors are way less likely to diagnose with anything at a young age. I partly think this is due to their own bias of mental health stigma in general and not wanting to be responsible for putting labels on someone early in their life but also partly just because it is harder to know when kids are young what symptoms they might grow out of or not. 

Personally I don't even agree with that, I think people who 'grow out' of many mental health symptoms do so for survival and are masking because without a doctor willing to help or diagnose them because they're a kid what else are they supposed to do to get through existing? üòÖ I'd rather we over diagnose and get kids/people in general help with symptoms regardless of if they grow out of them or not it's still an issue they need help with and that help has always and will always be easier to access with a diagnosis and labels ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. 

Some people are so against labelling & naming things and maybe it's my autism showing by I will never fully understand not wanting a name for mental health struggles that helps find community support & gives people, family, friends, doctors a very quick explanation for a bunch of common symptoms all at once without having to explain in detail every little thing you experience over and over again ü§£. 

I'll forever be mad at the ""You're too young for that"" crowd when it comes to diagnosis and mental health. Struggled for too long without help because of people who didn't need to walk in my shoes deciding labels are damaging without ever asking my opinion or what I wanted/needed.

""Adolescence and prodrome
The onset of BPD symptoms typically occurs during adolescence or early adulthood, with possible early signs in childhood.[123] Predictive symptoms in adolescents include body image issues, extreme sensitivity to rejection, behavioral challenges, non-suicidal self-injury, seeking exclusive relationships, and profound shame.[57] Although many adolescents exhibit these symptoms without developing BPD, those who do are significantly more likely to develop the disorder and potentially face long-term social challenges.[57]

BPD is recognized as a stable and valid diagnosis during adolescence, supported by the DSM-5 and ICD-11.[124][125][126][127] Early detection and treatment of BPD in young individuals are emphasized in national guidelines across various countries, including the US, Australia, the UK, Spain, and Switzerland, highlighting the importance of early intervention.[126][128][129][130]

Historically, diagnosing BPD during adolescence was met with caution,[126][131][132] due to concerns about the accuracy of diagnosing young individuals,[133][134] the potential misinterpretation of normal adolescent behaviors, stigma, and the stability of personality during this developmental stage.[126] Despite these challenges, research has confirmed the validity and clinical utility of the BPD diagnosis in adolescents,[124][125][126][127] though misconceptions persist among mental health care professionals,[135][136][137] contributing to clinical reluctance in diagnosing and a key barrier to the provision of effective treatment BPD in this population.[135][138][139]

A diagnosis of BPD in adolescence can indicate the persistence of the disorder into adulthood,[140][141] with outcomes varying among individuals. Some maintain a stable diagnosis over time, while others may not consistently meet the diagnostic criteria.[142] Early diagnosis facilitates the development of effective treatment plans,[140][141] including family therapy, to support adolescents with BPD.[143]""

Firstly just fyi ADHD and autism are both high comorbidities for BPD, autism actually occurs alongside BPD as much as 50% of the time. PTSD is practically a given. For such a long standing relationship there could definitely be a tendency to develop a treatment bias and they may have felt, be it a personal fondness for you and a stigmatized belief they were saving you a difficult future, that best practice was to help you understand yourself better by discussing BPD with you or at least providing that term, but not formally applying the label in writing to be carried over into future medical records. It's been an immediate red flag ""problem patient"" label for most of its existence, but that really now has for the most part taken a turn for the positive, there's a growing renewed interest in research and treatment and understanding. We're not really seen in that light so pervasively anymore, just don't go for the more uhh... old school? providers. 

I would honestly seek out a neuropsychiatric evaluation for a differential diagnosis, and honestly just always try to stick with AFAB providers that are under 50, and just tell her exactly what you said here.

A 15 year old kid being disrespectful and scratching their arms FOR A WEEK is not a long standing pattern of behavior. It‚Äôs a developmentally appropriate pattern of behavior and a 15 year old kid who can‚Äôt communicate needs finding a way to get their POS parents to listen to them after they learned it from other kids. Self harm also commonly occurs in autism and ADHD as a sensory relief tool and a way to communicate needs, particularly with higher support needs individuals. 

I‚Äôve been a therapist for several years and have seen all of 1, maybe 2 people who I feel meet the criteria for BPD under the age of 18.

In one instance the kid was actually misdiagnosed as having ADHD. 

Furthermore, many personality disorders are ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù in crisis situations and guess what, we all look like we have personality disorders in crisis. Suicide is also the leading cause of early death in autistic people too, particularly those with higher support nears. If I had BPD at 15 as they said wouldn‚Äôt I have had multiple hospitalizations, severe self harm, a significant substance abuse problem (I drank to cope with social anxiety and only drank when around people because of a history of being rejected so much) , a criminal history, a long history of involvement with psychiatric communities, etc? I didn‚Äôt. In fact I had limited involvement and went to college, graduate school and tried to work despite having complex trauma and no idea what was going on. 

Prior to that hospitalization, the second hospitalization came after I experienced a major trauma at the age of 32 and that is where they assumed I had BPD based on the diagnosis that was made after a doctor in 1999 talked to me for 45 minutes and my parents, who to this day deny that I told them half the shit I actually told them, for hours. 

There are similarities to my stories to the people on here, but I will put money in the fact that many on here are misdiagnosed or incorrectly self diagnosed. Furthermore most people on here have experienced complex trauma and would likely qualify for the diagnosis of CPTSD which the APA thinks they are too good for to include DSM V. Actually the DSM V has nothing to do with treating trauma because you can‚Äôt medicate it away the same way you can a mood disorder or a psychotic disorder. 

Furthermore there is such thing as differential diagnosis. Someone might come in and meet the criteria for 17 different disorders because everything in the psychiatric world is subjective, Does that mean all 17 disorders are  the ‚Äúright‚Äù diagnosis. No. Several things can be explained within one or two disorders and a skilled clinician has the clinical understanding to figure out which ones BEST explain what the person is going through. In addition, so many of the BPD symptoms can be explained through poor executive and sensory function and social communication difficulties which if occurring before the age of 3 is Autism (after the age of 3 is non verbal learning disorder, sensory processing disorder, and/or ADHD). 

Also my diagnosis came in 1999, not 2020. The only kids getting diagonals with autism at that time where those who were non-verbal and/or had significant learning challenges. Same goes for ADHD, but many of those kids had learning challenges and/or behavioral issues A 15 year old bullied and emotionally abused kid who couldn‚Äôt sit still and would do anything to feel included and liked, but yet couldn‚Äôt figure it out was not seen in that limited criteria for either ADHD or Autism. Despite even getting an ADHD diagnosis at 18 that has been confirmed time and time again was still not enough for these fuckers that diagnosed me in 1999.to even recognize and treat this. To them I have BPD and will always have BPD regardless of what evidence I present to the contrary including a formal grievance filed for medical abuse.

So to answer your question‚Ä¶I am on this sub occasionally because I do see similarities between my symptoms and others here because at the core we are both survivors of complex trauma and attachment difficulties which is what BPD is. I‚Äôve also gone through DBT, which while helpful for something‚Äôs did not help the trauma or fully explain the functional challenges I face despite having the education and training (that‚Äôs autism). Hop over to the autistic woman‚Äôs subs you‚Äôll see my sentiments echoed and my experiences validated by others who lived with the stigma of this label for years before they finally figured out why life was so damn hard despite trying everything to succeed",Anna-Bee-1984,1blloqf

236,"BPD and autism co-occure at a rate of nearly 50%, autistic individuals and AFABs in particular are severely misdiagnosed underdiagnosed or late diagnosed. AMABs receive a much higher rate of accurate diagnosis with autism than AFABs, but remain severely underdiagnosed and underrepresented with regards to BPD. 

It's also a common understanding or at least believed in theory that BPD is another form of complex trauma. The motivation behind, thought process of, and cognitive functioning of someone with BPD is unique to BPD though, and clinical studies have done plenty enough longitudinal data collection into the validity of the diagnostic criteria being a good enough delineation marker, with the diagnosis firmly constructed in certainty from comorbid factors through a neuropsychiatric differential diagnosis. 

I've had 3 neuropsych evals of 10+ hours of interviewing. I have BPD, treatment resistant MDD with psychotic features, cPTSD, autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder(I think thats bonkers though at this point I haven't been manic in 7+ years now and it was only a brief window in my 20s I had manic attacks, you wanna get up in arms about wishy washy criteria, BD is ridiculous), depressive personality disorder, and a TBI/cognitive dysfunction ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Technical_Slide1515,1blloqf

Even then, majority of mental health practitioners, therapists or psychiatrists, are not capable of diagnosing personality disorders even in adults - it is a very complex process that requires a doctor who specializes in personality disorders to accurately diagnose.

240,"If you never mentioned it before i don't understand why you would start now. Standard play is that it's not a problem until it's a problem. You're always best suited to assume your employer fores not give a shit about you and will readily fill your position without prior notice. Don't fawn and give them ammunition to make it any easier. Maybe you'll get lucky and find understandable and flexible employers who actually adheres to ADA guidelines, but likely they aren't and they won't.

Keep it vague if you become ""sick"" as any future employer doesn't find use in knowing your diagnosis, they are only benefited from knowing how long you'll be out of work and what your functional capacity returning to work will be. ""Ongoing health condition"" is about as expansive as you are ever required to be with anyone that isn't a part of your treatment team and you don't ever need to let anyone pressure you into feeling otherwise. 

I would also like to firstly recommend preventative measures to avoid becoming undependable or incapacitated by your BPD and get a treatment plan togetherto work on remission. I know Schema isn't even the best modality and a fairly large open source peer reviewed study found that a 2 year weekly commitment to Schema Therapy brought over a 50% remission rate, its just the one number I know off the top of my head. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Mentalization-Based Therapy date considered the best approaches with greatest remission rates and most rapid/profound symptom improvement. If you haven't yet done a DBT skills oriented IOP(all IOPs are going to utilize DBT as the framework for treatment though) if your in an area that has a selection to choose from, please do yourself a well deserved service of a huge improvement in distress tolerance, effective interpersonal communication, mindfulness training, and coping skills. Even when I lived in the boonies on state insurance I still found a weekly DBT maintenance group that was invaluable. I feel like that weekly group and a psychologist with a MBT oriented treatment plan will absolutely assuage those concerns of worsening to an unmanageable degree and then some. 

It's honestly a life saver whether you're already in crisis mode or not. IMO its the necessary course of action for anyone who receives a diagnosis.",Technical_Slide1515,1blloqf

242,"P.S. ""refused to treat my ADHD even though I've been sober for MONTHS"" sounds like you didn't want anything else besides controlled substances less than a year into addiction recovery when multiple non addictive options existed at the time. As long as we aren't including cannabis, amphetamines are the most abused substance globally, more than second and third places heroin and cocaine combined. It took neuropsych testing/confirmation, years in recovery(a decade at that point), failed trials on non CNS stimulants, and genetic test results showing garbage metabolism for ADHD medication except CNS stimulants to be an option an option. And honestly, it was great at first i guess, but unless you're constantly resetting your tolerance I personally dont fucking get it with the amphetamines. The dexa-, metha-, and levo-.. don't fucking get it. Quit ADHD meds went back to writing everything down and that's honestly functioning better. 

Also this is not to substitute shit a doctor would say, but have you not realized, whether it's simply coincidental or not, that you have literally described the diagnostic criteria for Avoidant Personality Disorder?

You will find alternative diagnoses offered in the US (again, varying State-to-State) explicitly on purpose for entirely different reasons. Most insurance companies refuse to insure people diagnosed with BPD, so even those who qualify to offer the diagnoses don't want to give it out. They would much rather diagnose with a different illness that requires similar treatment.

Editing to add, where I am they are most certainly not, and therapists are masters-level educated. They are not there to provide diagnoses, they are there to provide therapy. A therapist could surely say, you exhibit these symptoms or whatnot, but that's as far as it goes.",xLeone30x,1blloqf

0,"I was just going over shit, and my therapist connected some dots. Like I went to therapy when I was younger for anger management. I was constantly getting in fights at school and with some of the kids in the neighborhood, and that was something I talked about early on to let him know I had gone when I was younger and was put on medication. But I still felt that way sometimes, but that it was frequently changing.

I also mentioned that at some times I would sort of black out and go into my head if I felt it coming on really strong at time. Like I remember one time something happened, it shouldn't have made me angry or anything, but I just suddenly felt overwhelmed. I felt myself what I now as disassociate, then when I came to everyone seemed to be looking at me like I had just been really angry for no reason. 

At one point that I felt hollow. I couldn't describe it beyond that. Just feel hollow.

Then I mentioned that I was always worried that my boyfriend was gonna leave me. Or that I felt like everyone was. That people would eventually realize I wasn't a good person or annoying or what ever it is.

And then the final thing was one day I mentioned my boyfriend having commented one time that I tend to change my personality sometimes when different people are around. I didn't think that much of that at the time. It was just something that I would think about from time to time. I figured it was probably a bit more common than it is... turns out it's not. Lol

It was legitimate pain and anguish and fear and suffering, this was no show, there was bno gain, I didn't want this for attention.

The first diagnosis was major depressive disorder. But my self harm was so severe and I think that was probably the biggest indicator and why it was diagnosed before it usually is in adulthood. I distinctly remember the moment I **felt** the diagnosis become official. Under instructions of my then psychiatrist, a couple of occupational therapists who were trying to make a therapy program for me were interviewing me. I remember being weirded out because the questions were like those of an initial screening when you're just first getting help.

Everything else was unremarkable, but then they asked me, ""So how would you describe yourself?"" And I went completely blank. It was such a simple question, but it felt like I suddenly had an out-of-body experience. The two of them gave each other a look. And sure enough, I saw BPD on my discharge papers. I had a strong feeling already though, but having it confirmed like that was an experience I would never want to re-live. On the one hand, it's comforting somehow to know that what I was experiencing was real. On the other hand, it made me feel alone and terrified, almost like a death sentence.

It is a good general guideline to have though don't get me wrong but if I hadn't been diagnosed when I was, I would have not gotten the correct help I actually needed and I probably would've either died or never left the hospital. But psychologically speaking it's incredibly difficult to determine BPD in under 18s due to the way brains develop in that time and unfortunately it is way too common for misdiagnosis in under 18s. 

But this is why the diagnosis of emerging eupd is more common in the UK, because it's slightly different to the full diagnosis and is now the new guideline for under 18s with suspected BPD. Usually that diagnosis gets reviewed at age 18 and then the person is either diagnosed with EUPD/BPD itself if it still applies or undiagnosed if it no longer applies.

In the adolescent psych wards I was in, about 80% of the patients were diagnosed with BPD and in terms of the ones I'm still in contact with, a huge portion of them no longer have that diagnosis. I think the emerging label could help with that issue however if the consultants decided to hand that out like they did with BPD in hospital then it would end up being pointless.

Julian from Trailer Park Boys

I was pretty put off by quite a few scenes and Rebecca's actions for a couple episodes, but it's painfully relatable, outrageously funny and heartfelt and just really well done. It grows on you, now it's one of my all time favorites. Best character writing, comedy, drama whatever, even the huge amount of musical numbers is actually SO GOOD. Whatever you do, don't miss this gem. 

It'll pay off greatly, especially in later seasons, where BPD actually becomes a focal point of the show. They hadn't planned to do so initially it was supposed to be just a show about an actual 'crazy ex girlfriend', so the study of mental illness becomes more intentional and believable later on. I was still surprised by how neatly it all flowed and made sense from the start when I rewatched it ..now I wanna rewatch it lol.

But yeah, can't remember there being another medium where I've cried and cackled hysterically witnessing Rebecca's and everyone's development all the time like with CEG. It's also the kind of representation that might reinforce harmful stereotypes, but the way it's handled and slowly unravels becomes an even more powerful means of subverting such a popular cultural image and still managing to deliver a deep level of mental health awareness and desperately needed education most media cannot be bothered with. We don't tend to get to see truthful representation or get to truly relate to a character that isn't simply either vilified or portrayed as a laughingstock. None of the characters are handled as mere stereotypes or caricatures of their faults, and it felt so healing to watch, some scenes will always stick with me. It really helped me so much through a time when my BPD was far less manageable than it is now.

104,"Not by the people who are using it because they got diagnosed in a medical field that uses/used outdated and ableist language. 
As people with BPD, which is so heavily stigmatized, I think it's disappointing to see the community care so little for an educated and respectful approach to other forms of neurodivergence and disabilities. 

It's like continuing to approve of someone merely knowing and asking one Black person for their blessing to practice cultural appropriation, who might just also have certain privileges compared to the vast majority of the Black community, or they might just not care/have the energy to care about this particular issue, or they're just like most people and not educated on the subject while living among white people in a Western country, or stay willfully ignorant, compliant or avoid challenging a white person's view to protect themselves as a minority within that very same racist hegemonic society. 

A lot of us here are women or afab, so we should be well aware of how the misogyny can come from inside the house, after all we're still spoon-fed the same sexist indoctrination and pressure to conform since birth. Research is far behind and not supported within our capitalist system, ableism is rampant and most neurodivergent people lack the education to make informed decisions even on their own disorders. I'm not saying this to talk over anyone's experience, but if a woman tells me of their opinions that reek of internalized misogyny I will call them out on their behavior being inherently harmful to themselves and others. 

Current research is very clear on the distinction of autism and 'asperger', or high and low functioning labels being a misconception that's caused by psychiatric conditions to this day being defined through the severity of impact on neurotypicals, not the person affected. 

The kind of person we'd likely think of as high functioning might keep a job and seemingly really have their shit together outwardly, while silently suffering from being denied so many other accommodations they'd desperately need,  but an ableist system doesn't care about the needs of individuals as long as they don't impact the rest of 'normal' society too negatively. Struggles with noncompliance, which a lot of neurodivergent people have, can exacerbate the issue. 

A person labeled as low functioning might struggle more overtly with certain specific tasks, yet they could do amazing things they're really good at, but because they're 'too disabled', they'll generally be denied even the chance to prove their capability when applying for almost any kind of job, usually leaving them to pathetically payed and unrewarding work in sheltered workshops they'd not be stuck in if someone with more agency could just be bothered to give a crap.

Neurodivergence is a spectrum, as the entire neurodiverse landscapes of human minds actually is. Functioning labels will always put people already greatly limited in their chances to enact agency into boxes they can't possibly fit as individuals, while neurotypicals can continue to stay ignorant and leave them in those neat boxes instead of unpacking their own lack of interest in supporting people with disabilities and struggles different from their own that they can't possibly relate to. 

I won't go into more detail here as there are many very quick and easily accessible resources  put out by actual autistic people who are 'lucky' or privileged enough to even have a voice, or fought tooth and nail to make it heard, who took it upon themselves to advocate for their rights, it's definitely better than just talking to some neighbor who happens to not be aware or bothered by the issue.

I hope it's clear that I'm not trying to be preachy as if I'd even come close to dismantling all of my internalized ableism yet, I just hope you'll care to listen to what others might have to say and challenge your perspectives.",meliorancholerissa,16zt25m

5,I personally just don‚Äôt have the resources to be able to go to therapy. I‚Äôve spent my whole life delving into mental disorders and later on turned specifically to bpd.

12,"> don‚Äôt people know themselves better than anyone?

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It depends on what specific aspect you‚Äôre referring to. You also have to keep in mind that BPD often comes with persecutory delusions. If someone is experiencing delusions, they have no way of accurately judging themselves. 

Also, people may know themselves well. But diagnosis is not simply ‚Äòcheck off the boxes, if you check enough then you have BPD‚Äô. It‚Äôs about assessing the etymology, and ruling out every other possibility. For example, ruling out ASD and ADD which can cause emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and difficulty with relationships, psychotic disorders and mood disorders, which can cause self harm, difficulty in relationships, feelings of emptiness, dissociation, etc. 

There‚Äôs a reason psychologists and psychiatrists can‚Äôt diagnose themselves either. We‚Äôre all biased and we‚Äôre incapable of not being biased toward or against ourselves. 

> most times people speculate they have the illness they don‚Äôt just flat out say they have it

I think that‚Äôs confirmation bias on your part. I would need to see some studies to back that up. 

> I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs inherently bad to self diagnose

The problem is that ‚Äòself-diagnosis‚Äô makes no sense. You can say ‚ÄòI think I have this‚Äô. That‚Äôs not self-diagnosis. That‚Äôs speculation. You can speculate and then go get an evaluation. Diagnosis is a confirmation that you have something. ‚ÄòSelf-diagnosis‚Äô is people pretending they‚Äôre capable of diagnosing themselves, and claiming to have a diagnosis that they don‚Äôt have any idea whether or not they actually have. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to speculate that you have a disorder. It‚Äôs not okay to claim you have a disorder that you haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with. The difference between them only matters if you‚Äôre telling others you have it anyways. So at best, you get lucky and you correctly diagnosed yourself but have now spread the idea that it‚Äôs okay to do. At worst, you‚Äôre wrong and stigmatize the disorder even more. 

I speculated I had BPD long before I got diagnosed. It led to me discussing it with my psychologist and going in for a formal evaluation. But I never once said to others that I had BPD before being diagnosed. That would have been a self-diagnosis, and it would‚Äôve been wrong to do. 

> Mental health isn‚Äôt all that complex, BPD has a list of symptoms/criteria

That‚Äôs not really how it works. Or rather, that‚Äôs a HUGE oversimplification and is a perfect demonstration of why you can‚Äôt self-diagnose. I live in Canada, and here, only psychologists and medical doctors can diagnose. Psychometrists and councillors are not legally allowed to diagnose, despite having masters degrees in their fields. Specifically because they do not have the required expertise to diagnose mental health disorders. They are far more complex than checklists. If you think you meet enough of the criteria, then speculation is perfectly fine. 

> Getting diagnosed can be complex, and not everyone has the insurance to be able to be diagnosed.

This is especially true among younger people and teenagers, where the desire to fit into a group, even if it‚Äôs a stigmatized one, is very strong, and things like emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, etc. can be very common.

15,"it doesn't really have to do with the range of symptoms as much as what the symptoms are. it takes an expert to parse out bpd from other disorders that it is similar to, whereas autism is kinda just autism. moreover, while autism has a wide range of presentations, the diagnostic criteria is actually pretty limited and simple: iirc it's just restricted interests, social difficulties, and sensory issues",i_hate_sex_666,1cpi0ro
16,"That‚Äôs were you are wrong. BPD is very complex and almost everyone would think they fit the criteria because they are common things to experience. The difference is the severity in BPD. If you think BPD is clear cut than you probably have met someone with BPD. It overlaps with a lot of disorders. Also BPD has to severely affect your life to the point you can barely function normally because it is a serious mental illness and that means it severely affects your life and relationships. Why do you think they don‚Äôt normally diagnose people under 18 if it‚Äôs that simple. What‚Äôs the point in professionals if it‚Äôs as simple as the criteria?? Also the criteria isn‚Äôt for your use it‚Äôs for professionals. So it is simplified. I have seen a lot of different mental illnesses. A lot of people disagree with them. You would only realise that self diagnosis isn‚Äôt good or easy once you have had a lot of exposure. And I mean a lot. 
BPD is quirky as shown on social media. It ruins people‚Äôs lives. It is not the same as autism. Far from the same actually. Autism is more simple and not as severe majority of the times. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs a mental illness.",West_Pumpkin_4679,1cpi0ro

This is something that has always confused me about ""self-diagnosing""... you can't self-treat and the whole point of obtaining the diagnosis (from a clinical standpoint) is so you can access the right treatment. I so often hear the argument that people are self-diagnosing *because* they can't afford therapy but you don't go to therapy just to get a diagnosis, you get diagnosed to get therapy to treat the symptoms

The risk of misdiagnosing yourself, internalizing that and then exposing yourself to materials meant for a disorder that you don't fit the criteria for because you couldn't afford therapy is going to do way more harm than good because then the individual now has to unpack all of that stuff IN THERAPY and it'll end up being more expensive. If you don't have access to therapy, there really is NO POINT in trying to self-diagnose, your energy would be better spent focusing on trying to manage the symptoms that are causing you issues",7ymmarbm,1cpi0ro
20,"I disagree. Speculation is fine. But ‚Äòself-diagnosis‚Äô is lying to others about being diagnosed with something. You‚Äôre either diagnosed or you‚Äôre not. 

Perfectly fine to suspect you have something. Not okay to claim you have something that you haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with. Self-diagnoses doesn‚Äôt help you get therapy or treatments or aids. The only difference between speculation and ‚Äòself-diagnosis‚Äô is claiming a diagnosis to others. People have watered down diagnoses as they became popular and trendy, so much so that it‚Äôs difficult for people with real diagnoses to get taken seriously now. It‚Äôs also people with the most mild forms and the self-diagnosed people who are all getting super popular as well, which has effectively shifted supportive communities from being for those who need it most to ostracizing anyone that doesn‚Äôt promote the popular ‚Äòvisual‚Äô. 

It‚Äôs not uncommon to find people with lower functioning autism describe how they were attacked and villainized in autistic communities because they didn‚Äôt fit the quirky uwu aesthetic or dared to try and suggest people who were ‚Äòself-diagnosed‚Äô should perhaps not be the spokespersons for the entire community.",Maple_Person,1cpi0ro

Autism makes my social interactions and issues with bpd even worse, i feel socially innept.

My Anorexia is a direct outcome of my ptsd and bpd i belive, sometimes i feel too bad to even eat, and i get the guilt and shame, severe insecurity, pressure to be good enough, perfect, not be a bother or make a mess, etc.. food and body image are very hard for me because of this.

Ptsd is more self explanatory.. obviously very mixed into and overlapped with my DID and bpd. Having both is fuck a mind fuck, especially when it comes to trying to have a solid sense of identity, if its not bpd causing me to be confused , DID also affects my sense of identity strongly. I will also have alters that.. experience our bpd in diffrent ways. As im more affected by paranoia, other alters of mine struggle with diffrent symtoms of bpd in more or less severe ways than me somehow. One of my alters have very bad issues with codependency and obsessive behavior. But one of my alters have no eating disordered behavior at all (which i find intresting) i also dissociate very often.

So I‚Äôm gonna go in order from age 18.

Originally I was diagnosed BPD age 20. This is going through a bit of a query at the moment as to whether I‚Äôm actually BPD‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll get onto that in a moment as my new therapist & psychologist believe that my symptoms aren‚Äôt BPD and AvPD, but CPTSD, ASD and ADHD comorbid. It‚Äôd explain why even with a strong dose of Quetiapine/Seroquel, it doesn‚Äôt exactly help.

So for me in order:

- Anxiety (Social & Generalised, medicated)
- Depression (Mostly situational/reactive)
- Borderline (Quiet) and AvPD 
- Complex PTSD
- ADHD (Though I knew from a young age)
- ASD (Asperger‚Äôs, very good masker)
- FND (Conversion Disorder)
- Fibromyalgia & Chronic Fatigue

I got no reason late at night or early in the morning to just get stuck on words, lose my thoughts and even pass out.

My new PCP is keeping his distance but someone reported me to BMV requiring a form completed every 2 years to still drive. He‚Äôs considering next year to formally remove seizures from any BMV verbiage but believes my behavior is like a seizure and believes the BPD is playing a role. In fact the neuropsychologist who evaluated me believes that if my anxiety is too much, or my PTSD is triggered or even if I have rage I disassociate and don‚Äôt remember much and the passing out is me sort of rebooting to being normal again. She explained it like that I‚Äôm feeling in trouble I don‚Äôt have to have a flashback because I seem to block them. But I overload myself. I‚Äôm trying to split but I‚Äôm possibly fighting it and things just shut down so I pass out When people see me or find me they believe it‚Äôs a seizure full out but it never was.

218,"Hey, yeah. The same thing happens to me. I was just finally diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder with Mixed Symptoms last week after years of testing. It is different for me everytime. The passing out is a new thing that is happening for me so I am thinking it is morphing into PNES. I used to always freeze as a kid, but not blackout. 

Sadly my girlfriend also has PNES, but she has seizures every other day/everyday with hospitalizations once every 2-3 months. I really am afraid its gonna turn into that with me with passing out as well. I don't know if its like a domino effect with us both having the same conditions, but sometimes being around her is a constant trigger (i.e. she will have a seizure and then I will pass out). 

Yeah these episodes of passing out also happen to me after a high trigger/emotional dysregulatory episode. I forget how to walk, stand, etc. I am on gabapentin (up to 800mg/day because I can't tolerate the same dosage of medication as the average person - a little goes a long way for me) right now and it helps a little bit with the idopathic neuropathy from my FND, as well as any sort of motor issues post episode - allows my nervous system to calm down and rest. Gabapentin also seems to help my girlfriend in the ER, they give her that to stop the seizing when it happens.

9,"DSM: Associated Features¬†

Individuals with BPD may have a pattern of undermining themselves at the moment a goal is about to be realized (e.g., dropping out of school just before graduation; regressing severely after a discussion of how well therapy is going; destroying a good relationship just when it is clear that the relationship could last). Some individuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, body-image distortions, ideas of reference, hypnagogic phenomena) during times of stress. Individuals with this disorder may feel more secure with transitional objects (i.e., a pet or inanimate possession) than in interpersonal relationships. Physical handicaps may result from self-inflicted abuse behaviors or failed suicide attempts. Recurrent job losses, interrupted education, and separation or divorce are common. Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental loss are more common in the childhood histories of those with borderline personality disorder.

Prevalence¬†

The prevalence of BPD in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions data was 5.9%. A review of seven epidemiological studies (six in the United States) found a median prevalence of 2.7%. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder is about 6% in primary care settings, about 10% among individuals seen in outpatient mental health clinics, and about 20% among psychiatric inpatients. At any given point, 1 in 33 are experiencing BPD, and 1 in 16 will experience it at some point in their life.",aperyu-1,1cs8ptj
10,"DSM: Diagnostic Features¬†

The essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and mood, and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.¬†

Criterion 1: Individuals with BPD make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. The perception of impending separation or rejection, or the loss of external structure, can lead to profound changes in self-image, mood, cognition, and behavior. These individuals are very sensitive to environmental circumstances. They experience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger even when faced with a realistic time-limited separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden despair in reaction to a clinician‚Äôs announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when someone important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an appointment). They may believe that this perceived abandonment implies they are bad. These abandonment fears are related to an intolerance of being alone and a need to have other people with them. Their frantic efforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or suicidal behaviors, which are described separately in Criterion 5.¬†

Criterion 2: Individuals with BPD have a pattern of unstable and intense relationships. They may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or second meeting, demand to spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate details early in a relationship. However, they may switch quickly from idealizing other people to devaluing them, feeling that the other person does not care enough, does not give enough, or is not ‚Äúthere‚Äù enough. These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people, but only with the expectation that the other person will ‚Äúbe there‚Äù in return to meet their own needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their view of others, who may alternatively be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive. Such shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had been idealized or whose rejection or abandonment is expected.¬†

Criterion 3: There may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self. There are sudden and dramatic shifts in self-image (e.g., suddenly changing from the role of a needy supplicant for help to that of a righteous avenger of past mistreatment). Although they usually have a self-image that is based on the feeling of being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have feelings that they do not exist at all. This can be both painful and frightening to those with this disorder. Such experiences usually occur in situations in which the individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship, nurturing, and support. These individuals may show worse performance in unstructured work or school situations. This lack of a full and enduring identity makes it difficult for the individual with BPD to identify maladaptive patterns of behavior and can lead to repetitive patterns of troubled relationships.¬†

Criterion 4: Individuals with borderline personality disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging. They may gamble, spend money irresponsibly, binge eat, abuse substances, engage in unsafe sex, drive recklessly, etc.

Criterion 5: Individuals with this disorder display recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, or self-mutilating behavior. Recurrent suicidal thoughts or behavior are often the reason that these individuals present for help. These self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection or by expectations that the individual assume increased responsibility. Self-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or burning) are very common and may occur during periods in which the individual is experiencing dissociative symptoms. These acts often bring relief by reaffirming the individual‚Äôs ability to feel or by expiating the individual‚Äôs sense of being bad.¬†

Criterion 6: Individuals with BPD may display emotional instability that is due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days). The basic dysphoric mood of those with BPD is often disrupted by periods of anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being or satisfaction. These episodes may reflect the individual‚Äôs extreme reactivity to interpersonal stresses.¬†

Criterion 7: Individuals with BPD may be troubled by chronic feelings of emptiness, which can co-occur with painful feelings of aloneness. Easily bored, they may frequently seek excitement or self-destructive impulses to avoid their feelings of emptiness.¬†

Criterion 8: Individuals with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense anger or have difficulty controlling their anger. They may display extreme sarcasm, enduring bitterness, or verbal outbursts. The anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen as neglectful, withholding, uncaring, or abandoning. Such expressions of anger are often followed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they have of being bad.¬†

Criterion 9: During periods of extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g., depersonalization) may occur, but these are generally of insufficient severity or duration to warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in response to a real or imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting minutes or hours. The real or perceived return of the caregiver‚Äôs nurturance may result in a remission of symptoms.¬†",aperyu-1,1cs8ptj
11,"Gunderson on the Element of Interpersonal Hypersensitivity in BPD:

‚ÄúPeople with BPD are born with a genetic disposition to be highly sensitive and reactive to their caretakers. They are more apt to attribute rejection or anger to parental behaviors than are other children. They have usually grown up feeling that they were unfairly treated and that they did not get the attention or care they needed. They resent this and, as young adults, they hope to establish a relationship with someone who can make up to them for what they feel is missing. The desired relationship is exclusive, setting in motion intense reactions to real or perceived slights, rejections, or separations. Predictably, both their unrealistic expectations and their intense reactions cause such relationships to fail. When this happens, people with BPD will feel rejected or abandoned, and they cannot resolve their anger about being treated unfairly and their fear that they are bad and deserve the rejection. Both conclusions can lead them to become self-destructive. Their anger about being mistreated, their shame about being bad, or their self-destructive behaviors can evoke guilt or protective feelings in others. Such guilt or rescuing responses from others validate the borderline person‚Äôs unrealistically negative perceptions of mistreatment and sustain their unrealistically high expectations of having their needs met. Thus, the cycle is apt to repeat itself.‚Äù",aperyu-1,1cs8ptj

He asked me ‚Äúwhat can I do for you?‚Äù and I told him about my symptoms (for me these were: feeling heavy pain in my body because I felt SO alone, uncontrollably crying, self harm because I feel so much tension in my body). He then asked me questions about my past (first time of self harm? First time I‚Äôve ever felt this way?) and about my parents and when I feel these symptoms the most (my answer: stress and the feeling of rejection) he then asked me about my current relationship (and I literally told him I‚Äôm in a new relationship and that I never felt like this before and I really love him just so much!!!!). He then came to the conclusion: it‚Äôs clearly bpd. He thought I might‚Äôve have some anxieties too and suggested sertraline, if I wanted to.

I was totally shocked afterwards and immediately reached out to a therapist for a second opinion (I mean come on - 50 minutes for a personality disorder diagnosis?!). I told this therapist about my problems and he gave me the same diagnosis. I was of course more suspicious and asked him how he came to that conclusion? Why so quickly? I‚Äôm 27 and never went to a psychiatrist/hospital - how is that even possible with bpd?! And he told me: you know, bpd is a spectrum. Some are low functioning, some are high functioning but the underlying issues are (more or less) the same.

10,"I would take it with a grain of salt and get a second opinion. I‚Äôm sorry because it is INCREDIBLY frustrating waiting so long and feeling dismissed. Most importantly, walking away and feeling you are misdiagnosed.

Psychiatrists (from my experience), tend to be very medication and use ‚Äúmedical-based models.‚Äù My therapist took five sessions, multiple tests, and more, to feel confident to diagnosed me with BPD. While psychiatrist chalked it up to depression, PTSD and potentially bipolar disorder. Some practitioners are more treatment/cure based (as they may lack understanding of BPD) while others explore as they know the connotations of that diagnosis. You can meet multiple providers and they can all give you different diagnoses (fun right‚Ä¶)!

There are nine criteria of BPD, and you only have to meet five to get the official diagnosis, which is why every person with BPD exhibit different experiences, symptoms, intensity, loss of quality in a life worth living and more. Fear of abandonment is one criteria and black/white thinking can be more involved with another one (unstable interpersonal relationships that alternate between idealization/devaluation ‚Äî> what others know as splitting). 

In my opinion, yes some of your symptoms could be chalked up to depression, while some leaves the branch of depression and leads to other diagnoses.

TLDR: terrible it only took five minutes. Get a second opinion. You can still meet criteria of BPD without meeting fear of abandonment and black/white thinking.

Turns out I was misdiagnosed but still it affected me for a really long time. They put me on mood stabilizers right away and they didn‚Äôt even work, they actually made me worse?

BPD is a complex condition and should only be diagnosed after an extension discussion, and more likely several. Five minutes and three questions is certainly not enough to ascertain whether or not someone has BPD.

You might have BPD. Sometimes the fear of abandonment can manifest in surprising ways. The lack of black-and-white thinking makes it less likely. Still, you don't necessarily need either to be diagnosed with BPD. You only need five of the nine core symptoms to be diagnosed.

People who have not been diagnosed formally often (almost always) times feel alienated and unsure in who they are. This sub is a good place to figure that out. It‚Äôs absolutely a place for people who think they may have BPD. 

It took me 12 years of treatment, two hospitalizations, and many, many wrong diagnoses in order to be diagnosed with BPD. And after all that, it was my own research which lead to it.

(Weed) It took about 3-4 years before they actually helped me and I‚Äôm not even diagnosed now because it‚Äôs taking such a long time to do a inquest because the mental health care where I live is really bad they almost only help the ‚Äúeasier‚Äù illnesses and if you have one that is ‚Äúmore serious‚Äù it‚Äôs very complicated to even get a diagnosis.

16,"I will say that whether people self-diagnose or not, I don't really care personally. I don't think it necessarily affects me, and I feel like people do generally gravitate towards things that feel true for them, and if they're being directed toward skills that help them, then great. If they're being directed to things that don't help them...okay? They'll continue to look for things that will.

As you said, BPD is complicated -- however that also means that different professionals are going to potentially give different diagnoses as well. BPD isn't a hard science and I don't see a formal diagnosis as necessarily infallible confirmation of a ""true"" diagnosis or lack thereof. From my personal experience, I was damned sure I had BPD, and when I went to get diagnosed the psychiatrist basically asked me why I thought I had BPD. I explained it to him, and he said it was up to me whether I want him to give me diagnosis based on whether or not I felt it was helpful. I don't feel that I was at all harmed in having identified as someone with BPD in the years leading up to that diagnosis. 

I think the bigger problem is the weight that we put on the diagnosis. BPD can be very severe but it is not in the same category of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is further on the spectrum of ""organic brain disease"" whereas BPD has a much higher environmental/contextual factor. Not to mention that all of the symptoms are pretty much adaptations to trauma, whether overt or simply a result of a highly sensitive person who's nervous system can't adequately adapt to living in this world.  That is part of what makes it complicated to diagnose, and why I don't really care if people self diagnose or not. BPD is on a spectrum, and as far as I'm concerned if you're anywhere on that spectrum, DBT and other skills are gonna help you. I mean, DBT can really help anybody.

The fact that professionals can misdiagnose is, IMO, proof that unless you can get treatment and are WILLING (how many times haven‚Äôt people without BPD come to this sub to talk about someone who obviously has it, but refuses to get help? The lack of a diagnosis won‚Äôt make their symptoms go away) to put yourself through it, there‚Äôs no value to it besides validity in the eyes of strangers and to confirm what _you already knew_.

28,"I absolutely agree! That‚Äôs why I specify that my BPD and other conditions have been (professionally) diagnosed in my flair.

BPD is *extremely* difficult to diagnose, given its complexity and comorbidity with other illnesses. Many of the symptoms of BPD can result in even mental health professionals misdiagnosing their patients with another condition (BPD is often misdiagnosed as Bipolar Disorder- due to the mood instability- and vice versa).

I understand that some people cannot seek professional help, however that is still no excuse for ‚Äúself-diagnosis‚Äù. You simply can‚Äôt ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù yourself or anyone around you with such a complex illness, even if you‚Äôre a trained professional- even they must seek out an unbiased, objective party.

I actually feel very offended by people who ‚Äúself-diagnose‚Äù with BPD, usually because they‚Äôre only doing so for attention or as a means of justifying poor behaviour (which in turn fuels the nasty BPD stereotypes we all work so hard against). 

They often romanticise BPD, which drives me absolutely mad. Seeing teenagers act as though BPD is just a ‚Äúcool trait‚Äù makes my blood boil.

There are so many different variations of symptoms for diagnosis of BPD, you are completely right that people should not be self-diagnosing themselves. It's not a diagnosis that anyone should aim to achieve like a medal, if you don't own up to it and get help, then it can be a life sentence.

I hate how the Internet has made it so easy to just look up your symptoms and decide, ""yep, that sounds exactly like me!"" - okay and your symptoms will probably also sound like constipation if you search other pages... 

There seems to be a massive glorification about being mentally ill and people seem to think that a diagnosis will make them feel validated, and that they don't need to go to the doctor for ACTUAL help because they can find all the help they need on the internet üôÑ",flumpymews,kuf9ni

36,"To be honest with BPD, self diagnosis or professional diagnosis only makes a difference if the person is seeking treatment via therapy. BPD as an 'illness' is nothing more than a set of commonly cooccurring thought processes and actions that a small percentage of the population share. I don't really see it as something that can be compared with Schizophrena because Schizophrenia has mostly drug based cures as far as I'm aware. BPD is supposed to be one of the most annoying mental health diagnosis for doctors to give because there is no 'cure' as the 'cure' is understanding why you do the things you do and trying to manage them in future to better align yourself with 'normal' people. 

I went to the Doctors because I needed help in my late teens, they saw all the scars all over my body and just referred me to a suicide hotline.

There will also be ppl on this planet who claim they have something they dont or self diagnose themselves.

I'm no professional but talking things out with people can be helpful for them and reinforcing them to seek out a professional is always a plus. I noticed a lot of people get upset about this and sometimes it comes off as ""this is MY illness"" but no one is taking that from them or invalidating their struggle. If talking about it openly with others helps get them in the door for some professional help, why not?

If you can't afford to be diagnosed, which is a whole thing i don't get because im way below the poverty line and get my medication for free and all my doctors appointments for free aswell as when i had a therapist for free through state insurance, then maybe people shouldn't go around sharing what they -think- could be wrong.",loopyboops707,kuf9ni
56,"I think it's just part of a growing trend of people who like to pretend they have a mental illness so they have an excuse for their shitty behavior. 

No, you don't have depression just because you've been a little sad for a few days in a row. No, you don't have OCD just because you like to keep things organized. No, you didn't split on someone just because they did something that you didn't like. No, you didn't get triggered just because something or someone pissed you off. 

People want to have some kind of issue that's beyond their control because they are lazy and self centered. They know they have self control issues, but would much rather find an excuse than work on bettering themselves, and are too vain to admit they have flaws.

I agree with you that the only way to know for sure if you have something is to be diagnosed by someone with the knowledge AND experience to make that call. Do some of the undiagnosed people that claim to have BPD actually have it? Possibly! But they can't say for sure, and they shouldn't be going around saying that.

Me, for example. I've shown a lot of BPD traits whenever I am in a relationship. Getting overly attached to someone, getting upset if they don't reply to my messages right away, swinging between hating someone's guts and being crazy in love with them...My ex girlfriend, same deal. But could we tell people we have BPD? No. I've never been diagnosed with it. And I'm fairly certain she hasn't either. COULD we have BPD? Maybe!

What I do tell people is that I have Dysthimia. Not because I'm in a mopey mood fairly regularly. But because I was diagnosed with it years ago and am still receiving treatment for it and have taken almost every antidepressants known to man.

I think a lot of undiagnosed people that strongly feel they suffer from something probably do. And it's very sad when they can't get the help they need to know for sure, so they can start doing something about it and start feeling better. But honestly? I think a lot of people are just self-centered assholes.",overmind87,kuf9ni

I never even thought I would have a single chance of having it because I was always taught it was just a form of an anxiety disorder when realizing I had over a decade worth of trauma from my childhood to adolescence to unpack and process combined with my dangerous impulsivity, my dissociative and psychotic features, my extreme moods and my lack of ability to form ""normal"" relationships and much more (we get the point)...it's a lot to take in.

66,"I sort of feel triggered by this post. It's because I'm very triggerable but it also makes me feel extremely sad and extremely alone. I feel like I'm the forever outsider that cannot be labeled and cannot be helped.

I've been to two psychologists in my 20s and 30s who both told me something like ""you know there is this BPD, have you heard about it, I don't want to put labels on you but you might want to read about it etc etc"". I actually knew about BPD so I was sort of afraid that I just acted it out because I read about it.

So there was that, I got up and fell down, got up and fell down over and over. Some approaches helped some didn't. Sometimes I want to do anything to feel better, sometimes I just want to die or self-destruct. I've felt like an outsider my entire life. Sometimes when in a relationship I forget about it and throw myself into it and become another person. But then I wake up and still have no idea who I am.

When you are suffering like hell and people just expect you to be okay because your life looks liveable for the outside observer you just want someone to come and say you have this and this and here is the solution for that. You also want support, to be able to say, yes, crap, I suffer because I have this and this and it's HARD. You want to say, I suffer and I want to find people who relate. Not just roam around every corner of the psych-help-support internet like a ghost that asks herself the question every day if she is only faking it and maybe just unable to live a normal life because...just because.

I don't know if any of this is making sense or anyone can relate, I'm not hating anyone I'm just incredibly angry and would break something but it's late and don't have the energy so I'm gonna just self destruct alone probably.

And still I can imagine people with BPD might feel offended by someone taking a label they don‚Äôt understand and using said label for sympathy points in the r/BPD community. But I don‚Äôt know if those people represent the majority of those who‚Äôve self diagnosed. 

BPD is so complex and is frequently misdiagnosed even by the ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù, and I believe the path to diagnosis with BPD isn‚Äôt linear, especially because lots of said professionals will default to a less complex diagnoses if there‚Äôs any ambiguity of symptoms. If it could mean one disorder or another, and it‚Äôs inconclusive which one is prominent, then said professional will choose the less complex diagnosis and then refer the individual to ‚Äúservices in the community‚Äù aka ‚Äúyou‚Äôre on your own.‚Äù And I‚Äôm in Canada where my insurance is fully covered, but mental health care is still stigmatized and pathetically insufficient. 

Given the complexities of BPD and barriers to obtaining help and/or diagnosis, I believe giving self-diagnosed people the benefit of the doubt is more helpful to the community than trying to weed them out. We already face so much stigma, rejection, and judgment as it is. And this is something pwBPD fear deeply.

84,"I also don‚Äôt want to argue with anyone but I really agree with this counterpoint. 

As someone who has been misdiagnosed and medicated for decades (depression/anxiety/bipolar/ptsd, none of which felt accurate) to finally find an answer that fits me has shown me there is hope. I did not know BPD existed before I had a complete meltdown and made some extremely bad choices. I spoke to a counsellor who suggested that I speak to my doctor about BPD. I have since started to work on DBT alone (it‚Äôs really expensive here and I can‚Äôt afford a therapist) and it has really opened my eyes and has started to help. 
Once I was able to, I went to my doctor and she googled bpd (right in front of me) when I told her that my counsellor told me it was something I should bring up to her. She then went through the checklist with me (I‚Äôm a strong yes to every facet of every symptom) and then offered to prescribe me more anti-depressants which I do not want or need right now, I want to continue work on DBT. I still can‚Äôt afford actual therapy and her ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù means less than nothing to me, except that now I can medicate some more if I choose to. 
So as much as I understand that it is a trigger for people who can afford a legitimate diagnosis, maybe just think about how much of a trigger it is for the rest of us (who are working really hard to get better) when someone completely invalidates something we know to be true, or tells us that something we think/know is somehow not good enough. 

IMHO there is no place for gatekeeping when it comes to mental health issues. If you know there is something wrong and you are trying to get better, no one should invalidate that or make you feel like you don‚Äôt have a right to seek support for your issues.

I had symptoms since I was very young and only realized I did when I found bpd online when I was like 15 or something. But when I brought it up to my doctor, he said no and I dropped it. I was diagnosed with it years later, though I didn‚Äôt bring it up to the new doctor I was going to

I think self diagnosing is a good thing when it‚Äôs only used as a clutch to find help and to bring it up to professionals as a possibility and suspicion. I have issues with people who say they have it for sure with only self diagnosis",patexie,kuf9ni
114,Ohhh and then there‚Äôs the therapists that insist on diagnosing people they don‚Äôt even know!? My mother‚Äôs therapist had told her that I have BPD despite never meeting me!? This also adds to stigma ‚Äî Ive met a few people that have horrible ideas about BPD because their therapists have thrown around the diagnosis for every impulsive and manipulative person they know.

118,"I think the way you went about it is the good kind of self diagnosing, knowing something‚Äôs wrong and having a suspicion, but not saying it for sure before a professional confirmed it

I‚Äôve seen the 20 question tests that show what percentage you have of having certain disorders (like you get a chart of how big your chance is to have like 6 different diagnosises). Those are the most useless ones and no online quiz should be used as a valid form of diagnosis 

Thank you for sharing your experience!",patexie,kuf9ni
119,"You‚Äôre projecting a lot there. I never said it made us ‚Äúlook bad‚Äù or that anyone was doing it for attention. I have nothing to be jealous of, I have a great support system who‚Äôd listen to me whenever I need to vent and a wonderful doctor who understands and helps me. I get frustrated with how ignorant people can be by basically claiming to be qualified and versed enough to be able to diagnose a really complex and complicated mental illness that isn‚Äôt that well understood on themselves. People seeing a couple of symptoms and immediately claiming they have a debilitating mental illness without much grounding is like a slap to those who suffer from it. I‚Äôm not saying everyone is like that, but some people are

Self diagnosis isn‚Äôt 100% valid, most people make mistakes. Especially with a disorder that has a lot of symptoms that overlap with a lot of different disorders. Autism, anxiety disorders, npd, depression, ptsd, dpdr, osdd, etc. Some people are correct with their self diagnosis, some aren‚Äôt and we should acknowledge that

My issue is with people who self diagnose and treat that as a fact. If it‚Äôs treated like a possibility or a suspicion because symptoms check out, then that‚Äôs fine. I have no issue with people speculating and trying to figure themselves out, honestly more power to them. I did the same just like everyone else. Just don‚Äôt claim to have it 100% if you don‚Äôt have a professional who has experience with personality disorders and has learnt this, confirm it. Sure, there are a lot of professionals who don‚Äôt diagnose or do it incorrectly because bpd is really damn hard to diagnose, but that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone who doesn‚Äôt get a professional diagnosis is 100% correct about their assumptions

Maybe you should get off your high horse and look more into why I triggered you so much that you got so condescending and defensive. I never told anyone what they have or don‚Äôt have. I never diagnosed anyone or invalidated anyone. I just talked about a frustration I have",patexie,kuf9ni

Reread my post. I never said people are doing it for attention. I said that everyone who self diagnoses because they are feeling really unwell have valid problems and issues that they need help with

I just said I get frustrated with people who confidently claim to have a very complicated disorder when they very well might not have it, but have something else instead. Self diagnosing is alright as long as it stays an assumption rather than a valid and official diagnosis",patexie,kuf9ni

And I agree with everything you said. While BPD doesn‚Äôt have it that bad when it comes to trends, OCD among some other illnesses does. I can‚Äôt imagine how frustrating it must be for you to see people use it as a quirky trend. And it‚Äôs disgusting to use mental illnesses as excuses for shitty and abusive behavior.

I‚Äôve been in therapy since I was like 13 or 14 and only this last year has helped a bit because before a psychiatrist who specializes in mental illnesses, non of my therapists could help in a productive way to help my symptoms

This is why self diagnosing and just running with it can be so harmful, people can get worse if they don‚Äôt get the help and treatment that they‚Äôd need for their own specific disorder and instead get treated for something else

The person who coined ""bordergender"" defines it like this:
> A gender identity lacking a firm grasp on ones identity, while still experiencing gender, to varying degrees, but having trouble pinning it down to just one label or identity. Having the sense of grasping at labels as much as possible to describe a gender we keep questioning because we keep second guessing our sense of selves and, consequentially, our sense of gender.

Especially with BPD, it's undermining as all hell when people are like ""okay so I have really bad moodswings and I get upset really easily, I took an online personality test AND checked my symptoms and I've got BPD"".

This irks me because I‚Äôve had mental health issues since I was eight and I‚Äôve been trying to figure out what‚Äôs wrong since I was 18. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with several illnesses and disorders for which I continuously sought treatments and therapy, and nothing worked. Now I‚Äôm 38 and it was only last summer my family doctor suggested I look into BPD.

I recoiled when I first looked into it because I was offended he suggested it. But over the following weeks and months I researched, self reflected, found online peer support groups, looked at myself from different perspectives, and I was stunned to discover this *ugly thing* might be what I‚Äôve had all along. 

I found one of the only psychologists in my city who work with people who have BPD and he wouldn‚Äôt diagnose me but said I should seek DBT, talk to my family doctor about other medications, and see a psychiatrist (this will be my fifth time seeing one). So at this point I‚Äôm only self-diagnosed, but my family doctor and I agree it‚Äôs likely what I have. And I just started lamictal in addition to all my other psych meds.

Your op read to me like you had painted all self-diagnosed people with the same brush, meanwhile you seem to agree there are circumstances when it‚Äôs acceptable to self-diagnose. I understand why some people have disagreed with this post, and iirc some of them were officially diagnosed with bpd after misdiagnoses, suffering, and great effort.

Also, regarding to that reply. The comment I replied to said that they were diagnosed by multiple professionals, they just couldn‚Äôt get an official, formal diagnosis yet. The professionals said it, so I take that as an accurate diagnosis where they can fully say they have it

199,"and how do you know? there is no way you can say for sure that these people arent relating because they do experience those very symptoms. We have ALL had those moments where we have read something or heard something and thought ""that sounds like me"" . Sometimes we are right and sometimes we are wrong but it always starts somewhere. It doesn't start from our first symptom to immediately being diagnosed. You also don't know what these people circumstances are. How can you say they have access to professional help when you arent them? Maybe these young ppl on tik tok do want to go to someone but don't have resources, or support, or access. You have no idea. One of the first things you learn in DBT is not to make assumptions about ppl which is why I think it is shocking everyone agreeing with the OP's point is making wild assumptions about ppl they don't know. Frankly, i would LOVE to see young people get diagnosed BEFORE going through the worst moments of their lives. BEFORE getting to a point of being in the hospital, before they are at their wit's end. I think it is GREAT that BPD has become more known about. It allows people to question their behaviors and to ask themselves is this something more. It means possible interventions before people hit rock bottom and that should be celebrated. I have been in many Mood disorder/dbt/and BPD clinics through hospitals. It once was everyone was in their late twenties and older. This last program I was just in there were a TON of teens in it and it made me so fucking happy. So happy to see they may be able to figure this shit out before their in their 30's. Happy they may be able to find recovery so they don't waste some of the best years of their lives searching for help. It was wonderful. I think many people seeing it from your point of view are seeing it from a selfish point of view. There is nothing wrong with someone trying to explore reasons for their feelings, emotions, or actions because the truth is the more it is talked about, the more it is investigated, the more it is diagnosed, and the more people will be helped sooner in life before it becomes an emergency. There are always shitty people out there looking for attention etc. You are never going to stop those people from doing it but the VAST majority of people exploring BPD is because they feel some sort of connection to the symptoms which means they are probably struggling with some sort of mental health issues. Who are we to say they arent allowed to try to figure it out just like we did.",oceansidedrive,kuf9ni

The 9 criteria is up for interpretation, which is a liscenced PSYCHIATRISTs job of doing. what people self diagnosing don‚Äôt get is that the list of criteria isn‚Äôt a fucking yes or no questioneer. If I was asked ‚Äúdo you have frantic efforts...‚Äù straight up, which they DONT do, I would be confused, especially with the lack of self awarness I possessed at the time. They matched me for frantic efforts to avoid abandonment by observing and listening to the shit show I was and my life was. I was 17 turning 18. I didn‚Äôt know what bpd was or that I was about to be diagnosed with it. I was just a traumatized wreck of a human destroying my world around me. I met 9/9.

Maybe this sub is helpful for you because you can relate, a lot can. But unless you had the grief of being diagnosed with something I didn‚Äôt want and was ashamed of, you don‚Äôt have bpd.

This is where he learned that it's easier to fake having a mental illness then to prove you're mentally stable.

especially given the initial misdiagnosis and hesitancy to assess you properly it may be time to reach out to another dr who will take you and the research you‚Äôve done and your symptoms more seriously. maybe a psychologist instead of a psychiatrist. i have two quiet borderline friends who are female and had no issue with their assessment/diagnosis, so if you are concerned that you‚Äôre not being assessed properly in some part due to gender you absolutely should discuss that too. remember, doctors are there to accurately diagnose and treat illnesses and if you feel that you‚Äôre not receiving proper care don‚Äôt let it slide find a new doctor or be candid about what you think is preventing your current dr from diagnosing you. if anything, bringing up gender in a firm manner will probably lead to a more serious in depth assessment because no doctor wants to be accused of providing improper care due to gender stereotypes. 

good luck, i hope you find the right diagnosis if it‚Äôs not BPD. and keep in mind that while we should always be respectful, doctors are providing a very specialized service and get paid a lot to do so. once they stop providing you with that service on an acceptable level it‚Äôs ok to move on.",DefiantKnowledge1303,wldd1y

I won't speak to the OCD since I don't have a full blown case of that but in my experience with the BPD and ADHD, they can have similiar  outputs but the inputs are different.

For example, I can experience extreme rage at someone for speaking to me when I am trying to concentrate or because of competing sounds. That rage comes from sensory overload and is greatly diminished by ADHD medications. The rage that comes from BPD? ADHD meds have no effect on that. And it comes from emotional triggers rather than sensory overload.

101,"BPD is one of the most commonly misdiagnosed mental health conditions. It's so misdiagnosed, in fact, that there isn't even an accurate prevalence rate for the condition. What we do have is an estimate of 2‚Äì6% of the population, which actually makes BPD very prevalent.

https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/October-2017/Why-Borderline-Personality-Disorder-is-Misdiagnose

If you take it at 4% that‚Äôs 1 in every 25 people.

I‚Äôve done a lot of research on it. I fall under quiet bpd. I‚Äôve had 2 exes both I had to ask if they had bpd and they confirmed diagnosed only one of them showed the more extreme symptoms while I was dating them but I work in pattern recognition like my whole life and suffering from it myself I just see it, and I‚Äôve seen it quite a bit. 

I have another ex who was diagnosed with cptsd but related to me way too well and had way too many similarities and even acted exactly as I predicted she would act when confronted with certain things. Her bestie was diagnosed and said that her therapist was wrong even though I could tell from our first interaction. Also had one more I suspected was as we acted a lot a like and she told me her ex who was npd told her that she probably is, we went from dating to her marrying someone she just met in a month time span.

Was also able to tell my boss as i could tell that his niece was bpd from his stories and he was able to confirm.

I‚Äôd say from my experience if someone experienced early childhood abandonment either physically or emotionally from one or more care takers there‚Äôs a good chance they are in the borderline spectrum but most wouldn‚Äôt know it unless they got into a relationship with them. This is why I believe it goes missed most often as not all therapists can get beneath the surface especially on people who direct inward instead of outward. 

Just sharing my research as I‚Äôve been a magnet for bpd people and it sort of makes sense, just as it makes sense that npd‚Äô seem to sniff bpds out.",Takenforganite,wldd1y

It‚Äôs not that absurd. Just because someone is a professional doesn‚Äôt mean they are good at their job. They‚Äôre just still people. I have a BS and a decade of experience in my field and people are wrong all the time despite their label and psychology isn‚Äôt exactly the most complex thing in the world when you‚Äôve grown up with people who all had multiple disorders. People are flawed, fallible, and a product of their environment. 

Like literally if you fit all the markers and have a proven history of them what more do you need? To tell someone what you already know and for them to either diagnose you based on that or not diagnose you because of the stigma or because they think you‚Äôre looking for one. I‚Äôve also dated a psychologist and she has even agreed that it explained a lot. I‚Äôm just saying personally I‚Äôve done a little more than just take surveys, I‚Äôve had legit breakdowns triggered from perceived abandonment which is what started me down this road. I had moved in with my bpd ex and I literally found a play by play of what usually happens and what did happen written by psychologists. 

Just saying not everyone is incapable and not everyone is capable. We are all at different stages in our lives and my life I‚Äôve had very little hand holding and have had to seek out knowledge be it through texts or talking to people and I‚Äôve talked to tons of diagnosed and tons of psychs as friends or anonymously. I just personally would rather not get a diagnosis as you deal with much more bullshit when that‚Äôs on your chart going to the hospital and I already deal with enough anxiety when I‚Äôve dealt with medical professionals. 

I‚Äôm just saying according to the national alliance on mental illness and professionals who have done studies were looking at 2-6% of the population that has it‚Ä¶ so if you have the markers, the pattern, the cycle of emotions hinging on an FP or feeling numb when you don‚Äôt have an FP or feel neglected by them, lack of boundaries and intense emotions with new relationships and a history of early child hood abuse and abandonment there‚Äôs a very good chance that you have it.

0,"""What is borderline personality disorder? Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that severely impacts a person's ability to manage their emotions.

Symptoms can include: Efforts to avoid real or perceived abandonment, such as plunging headfirst into relationships‚Äîor ending them just as quickly. A pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family, friends, and loved ones. A distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self. Impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance misuse, reckless driving, and binge eating. However, if these behaviors happen mostly during times of elevated mood or energy, they may be symptoms of a mood disorder and not borderline personality disorder. Self-harming behavior, such as cutting. Recurring thoughts of suicidal behaviors or threats. Intense and highly variable moods, with episodes lasting from a few hours to a few days. Chronic feelings of emptiness. Inappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger.

Instead, I got a BPD diagnosis, no benzos, and a doom loop of triggering ""group therapy"" sessions that caused me to go full ""fuck it"", deny my BPD diagnosis on the basis of one doc's undeniably shitty course of treatment, and go emotionally free-balling through the next decade and a half before taking it seriously.
I did do a lot of work on getting my cptsd better contained. And it took hitting a wall with my CBT to make me acknowledge that I couldn't ignore BPD into remission or pretend it into a somehow more savory disorder.
Thankfully, acknowledgement and acceptance of my BPD sent me into a spiraling depression, so I still found a way to put off working through my BPD for a little whileüòÇ/s.

And, years later, I can now sheepishly admit that my initial defiant reaction to that doc who told me I had BPD - that was me being scared shitless and doing some hardcore avoidance and blame-shifting. I was so resolutely determined to prove them wrong that I went about engaging in some of the most textbook examples of borderline behavior. Fml, right?

3,"I don't think you're too young to be diagnosed, so there is the option to get a second opinion.

But the real question is though, is your therapist despite not wanting to fully/formally diagnose you, going to make sure you get the appropriate therapy like DBT or schema therapy, depending on the symptoms maybe medication? And is not having the formal(read:written in your dossier) diagnosis going to impact getting you the help you need.

I didn't get my full diagnosis a year after my actual intake, when I was in actual therapy, I was 34 at the time. For me my diagnosis discussion was helpful, because before I always thought I only had BPD, after the discussion I learned I have BPD and AvPD, with co-morbid severe depression and severe ahedonism, economic and housing problems and a few more. Also I have suspected myself to have ADHD, but still undecided on if that diagnosis would change anything, I relate to certain traits in ADHD, but not all and I have already changed my life in a way that they no longer impact me in a debilitating way.

What I'm trying to say is, will there be help for you despite the formal diagnosis? Or do you need the diagnosis to get help?

21 is not too young imo, bpd symptoms start to show in your early twenties and get better as you age, so it‚Äôs fair to say that while in your early twenties you display more ‚Äúintense‚Äù symptoms.

another thing is that therapists and the like absolutely HATE when you self dx, it would be best if you described your symptoms to them and make them come to their own conclusions. just be careful to not label them either, for example: you wouldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI have abandonment issues‚Äù, instead give them an example on you displaying this behavior such as ‚Äúwhen my s/o doesn‚Äôt answer my texts right away, i become stressed or anxious that they don‚Äôt like me anymore‚Äù. they will immerse knows how to label it themselves and they‚Äôll be reassured that your aren‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the idea that you have this or that disorder.

That‚Äôs a bit of an exaggeration, but essentially disability is meant for those who are 100% incapable of getting a job, even a shitty job. If you can work a terrible job and be miserable while doing it, you‚Äôre probably not getting disability.

Hasn‚Äôt showered in 6 months, catatonic, bedridden, unable to make food to feed yourself, etc). Even those with psychotic disorders can‚Äôt get disability unless their psychosis is severe enough to cause a complete inability to work even a minimum wage job.

The main problem with self diagnosing is that so many mental health disorders have overlapping symptoms, and the tendency fuelled by social media trends is to pick and choose your own symptoms to match a diagnosis you may subconsciously 'WANT' to have.

Because lets face it, nobody self dx NPD but people love to self dx BPD.

Unless you look at a broad spectrum of disorders that may relate to your symptoms, then you have not done enough research to accurately presume you may have 'this disorder' or 'this disorder'.

Then comes the issue of what is normal and what isn't? When looking at a list of symptoms. Anxiety is a normal, human emotion, but many would self dx with an anxiety disorder just because they get a little anxious when the train is a few mins late.

Let me quick that last line: No, I don‚Äôt have BPD, but holy shit have I heard this exact argument towards ‚Äúself-diagnosing‚Äù about everything. I am both depressed and trans. Yes, self-diagnosed for both. The amount of times I‚Äôve heard that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot depressed‚Äù and ‚Äúnot valid‚Äù because I haven‚Äôt gone to a therapist to confirm is astonishing. I‚Äôve put hours and hours into researching both subjects **thoroughly** and have come to the conclusion that I am both trans, and depressed.

Trust me, if I could choose to not be depressed and not be trans, I happily would.

Just to clarify, I‚Äôm not trying to make this comment about me. All I‚Äôm trying to say is that if this post can cause such an emotional response to me, then holy hell can I not even understand how furious and saddening this can be for others *with* BPD reading it.

I see a lot of people coming to this subreddit saying ‚ÄúI think I have BPD‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not diagnosed but I really relate to this‚Äù and that isn‚Äôt something I have a problem with. However, I do take issue with self diagnosis for these reasons:

1. SOME people self diagnose turn things like BPD into a whole ass personality trait and use it as an excuse to do unethical things. They almost brag about it, like finding any excuse to bring it up? This is definitely a minority of self-diagnosed people but they are pretty harmful, especially because they tend to spread a lot of misinformation and that influences others.

2. I think it contributes to the issue of people diagnosing their crazy exes, abusive parents, or other harmful people with BPD. If someone can diagnose themselves why can‚Äôt I diagnose other people, right? 

Again, fully acknowledge that getting an official diagnosis is literally impossible for some people, but it‚Äôs these things that make me feel a bit icky.

While I believe that healthcare is ridiculously expensive and not everyone can afford to or feel too much external stigma to get a professional diagnosis, I do believe that with TikTok psychology there has been an uptick in people feeling like they may have this. They may have an anxious attachment style and see a lot of similarities in fears of abandonment. All of this to say - if your symptoms are not deeply impacting your wellbeing and you do not meet the minimum criteria, it‚Äôs likely you don‚Äôt have BPD but that doesn‚Äôt make your journey any less valid. Mental healthcare is not only expensive, but deeply impacted especially since the pandemic began. Requiring a professional diagnosis is following a very capitalistic and privileged narrative.

45,"Generally speaking, some people like to use the excuse or reasoning that not everyone has the privilege and the money and the opportunity to get a diagnosis and that's why they self diagnosis. I understand where they are coming from because I used to live in a country where it was very difficult to get help for mental health issues. Plus, it still isnt as normalised in that society and community to talk and work on ones mental health. So basically the awareness is very poor. I understand that not everyone can get help. 

But there's a reason, especially when it comes to personality disorders, that not even trained therapists or GPs can diagnose a person. Usually, psychiatrists are the only ones who diagnose and prescribe medications and so on. Psychiatrists go through extensive training, studying and research to be able to identify what the issue is and even then they can be mistaken. So logically, a person who hasnt worked and studied in that particular field wouldn't be able to understand what really qualifies as a diagnosis. 

Of course you can speculate and relate to certain issues. But to say you have a certain condition for sure is not wise as it basically disregards the work that good psychiatrists (and mental health specialists) do. To diagnose someone (or yourself) is a very sensitive process, and most people are simply not qualified to do it. 

Instead of trying to promote self diagnosis, I think everyone should promote normalising therapy and having a therapist especially in areas where its shunned or not talked about. Everyone, even those without traumatic experiences and evident difficulties need someone to talk to. Getting regular check ups should not just be for physical health but also mental health. Finally, it should be easy and affordable (dare I say free?) to go to a therapist every once in a while. So basically taking care of one's mental health is extremely important and everyone should be able to do it. I don't know of that's going on in more developed countries but where I used to live getting help isnt easy and that's why I believe that society is struggling so much.

I was diagnosed with bipolar at a really young age and went through so many awful medications and treatments and hospitalizations and group homes being treated for this. I never felt that I fit comfortably into the criteria for bipolar and then I read about bpd and it clicked. Me self diagnosing back then is what helped me be able to start to build self awareness and manage my symptoms. 

A diagnosis doesn‚Äôt have much use except for being able to treat the symptoms of the disorder. I‚Äôm not able to afford dbt and I can‚Äôt get consistent therapy because of work and various other reasons so me having a formal diagnosis doesn‚Äôt have much use anyway.

55,"I do agree BPD is an awfull struggle to deal with, the problem is not self-diagnosing.
Speaking for myself, grewing up in a invalidating, emotionally abusive household, i was convinced something was wrong with me.
Struggling with depressions before my 18th birthday, got told that i needed professional help at school and such only to get told to not nag and  carry on at home.
After finding out more about depressions and as i got older finally got some professional help it never really helped, and from studying, reading and trying to self-diagnose i thought for years i might have suffered from BPD.
Though i read there are more women affected by BPD, mainly cause there are more cases traumatic sexual experiences and guess what i experienced myself, one of my trauma's was indeed something sexual awful.
I never self-harmed though and after my ex gf dumped me after a miscarriage i gave up on relations, never had much in the first place all the other symptoms could have fit in.
In hindsight, my self-image aka the chameleon effect was never changing, it would always been negative, but i still sure ashell needed proper help.
Bad coping, emotional dysregulation, addiction problems were ruining my life.
In the end, it seemed to be cPTSD which has many overlaps with BPD, and only due my own self-diagnosing i managed to get the proper professional help i needed, with these help i could finally get myself a safe space and out of the toxic dysfunctional family to start my healing.
I also think there are many more people who can't get the help they badly need for their condition but have no access to them for many reasons.
Shitty behaviour however is shitty behaviour and labeling yourself with a condition you don't have as an excuse to make fake shitty content is still awfull shitty behaviour. I don't think self-diagnosing is the problem right here, its the way people act for a bit more attention on a social media platform, misusing conditions as an excuse.
Also my current gf suffers badly from bpd, let's say we both from time to time suffer from it, it's indeed an awful condition to deal with every day thats for sure.

I was initially diagnosed with BPD and wasted 5 years of my life taking completely wrong medications that really fucked me up. Until I had the opportunity for a consultation with a expensive psychiatrist who also had qualifications in psychology, that I finally found out I have been misdiagnosed and actually suffer from CPTSD.

Since not everybody is privileged as I was with this chance, I urge you people to learn about psychology and watch classes on the subject - YouTube is full of legit uni classes.

I have no shadow of a doubt that this is what I am dealing with and have been dealing with since I was very very young, and I‚Äôm sorry if it displeases you, but I am honest enough with myself to know that if anyone is going to be able to say what I‚Äôve been going through, it is myself.

Bpd sounds scary and it's scary for who is inside or outside, there's not so many information out there to help us. What you can actually find is questions like ""how to deal with a (insert kind relationship here) that has bpd"" or ""watch out this story about a crazy person while I blame it on bpd"".
The ignorant people already fear us or see us as weirdos. I know that those little TikTok videos don't help at all.

Please don't say that ""you can't say you have BPD until you are diagnosed"", some people can't pay for it - yeah I know it may sounds (and it's indeed) horrible. Diagnosis is for privileged people, I'm sorry if you needed to hear this way but it's what it is.

I only was ""diagnosed"" late on the hospital while fainting and the doctors fighting for my life. If I knew what I was passing by, if I even in the tiniest thought knew it HAPPENS to a lot of other people. If I KNEW I wasn't alone at all, a lot of things would have changed for me.

I was struggling with my feelings, I thought I was some kind of monster for feeling this way.

As bad as it can get. I promise you, gatekeeping won't help anyone. Are you feeling hurt cuz some people make funny videos trying to ""act"" as they have bpd?

109,"I wanna positively chime in on this because it is so correct. I know this is an old post but hear me out and tell me your thoughts. Huge spill here.

BPD is very very often misdiagnosed as Bipolar 2. A lot of people do not know how common this particular misdiagnosis is. I am in support groups and have heard that same story several times. If professionals can make those kinds of errors, how do people think we can pull it off? Mental illness isn't as simple as a google search and a few weeks of research.

I meet the criteria for ADD, PTSD, BPD, and Bipolar 1. I was formally diagnosed by two professionals. It took a little longer than a year of observation, therapy, and medication trial and error to get my correct and now treatable diagnosis'. 

So many of these disorders are so similar that misdiagnosis is almost guaranteed without consistent surveillance and professional training.  Mood and trauma related disorders are so difficult. Professionals can read the fine print that only years of experience treating people with these conditions can give. 

I personally don't recommend anyone self- diagnosing at least most of these disorders because you could under-react to something really serious. 

For example, say I was flying high in the clouds the past week and had a sudden drop in mood. There is a huge difference in talking to a person with BPD about sudden mood swings and someone with Bipolar 1 for example. It is a severely dangerous difference. If you don't watch for certain signs, you could be a danger to yourself and others with manic episodes of Bipolar. I know when it is time to check in and I've been taught to catch it early by medical professionals. They all seem the same in writing on google, of course. They describe changes in highs and lows making it super black and white but until you actually experience the two yourself interacting or have treated patients for years with these illnesses, you really have no idea. Mood and trauma disorders are once again very complicated. 

I do however recommend people coming to our communities. I recommend anyone going where they can relate to others. I recommend getting advice on coping mechanisms for any issue that they have. I don't think anyone should gatekeep any mental illness, but they should be open to all possibilities until said otherwise for their own well being.",TheCaptivesparrow,ptza9o

162,"Self-diagnosis is the first step in seeking an official diagnosis. There's a huge difference between someone who, for example, reads up on a condition and all its intricacies and comes to the conclusion that they may have it, and someone who watches a three-minute video on the internet and begins labelling themselves with it (see also: people claiming they have ""trypophobia""). 

Mental health diagnoses are difficult enough to obtain even if you don't consider the financial burden for some people. I'm lucky enough to have the NHS, but that didn't make my quest for a diagnosis any easier. I spoke to a crisis team in 2014 after dissociating for several hours and catching myself before I could jump into oncoming traffic several miles from home. I voiced my concerns that I may have BPD. The team laughed at me. Said I was just a normal 19 year old who was ""going through some things"". I've seen the report they wrote up from that visit - they said I didn't even have depression and anxiety. 

Fast-forward to last November and I'd all but given up on getting my diagnosis. It was only when speaking to the clinical psychologist working with my weight loss specialist that she unearthed a historical diagnosis made in 2008 that explicitly confirmed I had BPD. I was 13 at the time and had never been told about it. So I made an appointment to speak with my GP. He was dismissive of my symptoms and experiences until I told him what the psychologist had said. He did a quick search of my medical records, found the diagnosis, and immediately changed his tune; he even booked me an appointment to get reassessed by a psychiatrist at my request. I finally got my diagnosis confirmed a few months later - ""mixed anxiety and depressive disorder with EUPD traits"".

It took nearly seven years for me to get the diagnosis I was looking for. And the only reason I got it is because my childhood psychiatrist had already made a note of it. Without that, I wouldn't have anything. But I *knew* I had it. All that time, I *knew*. Don't discard self-diagnosis simply because someone isn't a qualified professional. People know their brains and themselves better than anyone, and a good doctor will acknowledge that and work towards an official diagnosis with their patient rather than try to prove them wrong.",TheVisceralCanvas,ptza9o
163,"I respectfully disagree. I think thoroughly examining the traits you have, how they have a cause and affect relationship with one another (for example, fear of abandonment causes hallucinations), how it presents in yourself versus others with a diagnosis, the level to which it negatively affects your life, the severity of each trait, how long the traits have been displaying themselves, whether there‚Äôs family history, and researching the same things for disorders it‚Äôs commonly misdiagnosed with can lead to a better diagnosis than a mental health provider can give you. The first therapist I went to after I realized I might have this, laughed at me for self diagnosing, lectured me every time I tried to bring up any trait I display, minimized everything I said, and told me I have an overactive imagination when I said I saw things. Now I‚Äôm too afraid to bring it up with other professionals.",ApprehensivePOS,ptza9o

173,"I absolutely agree that there is a ton of misdiagnosing - ASD and BPD also being an example. Although the symptoms are not so alike, how the symptoms present can be extremely similar and distinguishing an ASD meltdown from a BPD breakdown is key. However, patients aren't given the tools to help distinguish, or professionals don't know the disorder, or patient well enough to know - Or they follow biased, ASD is typically seen in men, being 'overly emotional' is seen as a women's trait, so BPD is assigned.

I think there's a *HUGE* problem in how disorders are diagnosed. I think it begins with the professionals, many of aren't in the profession for the right reasons. Those that are, some begin on wards so have a biased as to what an illness 'looks' like, others aren't given the time and tools to assess a patient. Diagnosis cannot be given after an hours chat. 

Self surveillance (when applicable), *experienced* professional *long term* monitoring, and input from those who spend time around the patient are crucial to an accurate diagnosis. 

(this para is in reference to self diagnosing only) I also think that the professionals have a stark lack of power, considering the seriousness of what they all deal with - Some decisions they make are literally life or death. A psychiatrist should be able to tell you why you're wrong and why, without risking loosing their job. **Whilst a patient may know themselves better, they do not know the disorder better.** This is where the cooperation has to come from both sides in order to reach an accurate diagnosis - I know this paragraph will likely bring a lot of hate, but truth sucks when you're trying to excuse being a bitch through your self proclaimed PD!

Sadly the cooperation is seldom there, but people don't realise this. Its all fine going to your appointments, but unless you go with an open mind, willingness to do what is asked of you etc, then you're not setting yourself up for an accurate diagnosis. Of course disorders can and do interfere with this process, but then you have to be honest about that too - *""I'm really anxious and that's making it hard for me to explain what happened in the week,""* \- There's so much vital information required for accurate diagnosis that we don't even realise, my example being an example of that.

See, a year ago I would have totally agreed with you in reference to joining communities. Unfortunately, social media has given leg to helping the trend of faking disorders grow and thus, penetrating what once were 'safe spaces'. Communities are a great place to share experiences, rant about life, get support and have a laugh, but receiving advice can be dangerous for a few reasons. People become keyboard warriors and blame it on a disorder, or you ask a bunch of people with the same troubles to help with your own troubles and it can become a bit of a mess. 

Otherwise, communities shared by those with similar struggles are absolutely *life saving* and I don't mean that as an exaggeration - I have a discord server to thank for a lot of my joy and happy memories last year, and I don't want to come across like these places can't be greatly beneficial, just ask and receive advice with awareness.

I fully understand the stigma issues, believe me. I don‚Äôt wanna rehash things I‚Äôve dealt with in that regard but believe me I get it.

204,"yeah acting like an on paper diagnosis of something as incredibly stigmatizing and misunderstood as BPD is.. frankly, really irresponsible (not to mention i dont TRUST professionals to accurately diagnose BPD - its a diagnosis they throw on people, generally women, when they are ""emotional and irrational"" with some self harm. i know sooo many autistic and other ND women misdiagnosed with BPD bc 'professionals' are idiots, do not exist without bias, and frankly many aren't INTERESTED in helping anyone without an ""easy"" diagnosis).

like, ive never been ""officially"" diagnosed w bpd - but ive been given DBT therapy by a therapist who handed me a treatment plan labelled ""symptoms of BPD"" because we *didn't want BPD on my medical record!* because i'm personally in a lot of groups that put me at higher risk to have my autonomy stripped and to have the system abuse me.

i am also annoyed w ppl - mostly teenagers btw!!! - turning mental health issues into tiktok trends. but as somebody who *was a teenager w developing BPD,* im not mad. teenagers have issues, and they have a ton, and even teens without a diagnosable mental illness have their feelings and struggles disregarded by everyone as ""thats just what being a teen is like"".

like, it sucks people are out there pushing misinformation or making things like this a trend. 100%. but self diagnosis is not the issue there - the issue is the way social media is a drain on society, and the way teenagers are treated, and the way society at large *already* viewed mental health.

i've met plenty of ppl w self diagnosis. and in my opinion, its pretty easy to tell the difference between people who have done their due research and are wanting a community, and people who are being ableist about it. *very* easy. and its even easier to simply not engage with them, instead of pushing people under the bus who dont have a """"""real"""""" diagnosis (which can happen for many MANY valid reasons).

if people find a label suits them, and that being a part of that community helps them, then why should we discourage that?",hatchins,ptza9o

218,"No, NO. DO NOT APOLOGIZE! I am so glad you chimed in with these points and definitely appreciate someone so like-minded. You've made some seriously good points that I haven't thought about. You're a huge contribution to the discussion.

I had never known that ASD was so similar. I don't know much about ASD and definitely should speak to more people to learn more about it. I've seen a massive jump in ASD cases that makes me very uncomfortable as well. I feel like it may be yet another disorder that is hugely misdiagnosed in adults and even more commonly self diagnosed. You noticed that here lately? Lol I feel like some illnesses are a trend for attention seeking. BPD, DID, Depression, ASD.. It is pretty wild how people can take life threatening illnesses they searched on google and say hey, this is totally me right hehe. 

You are so correct about the length of observation before diagnosis. Holy shit. I never hear anyone else say this and it is 100% true and this is why. So crazy you mention it because I've got a super positive story. My doctor and psychiatrist gave me a year of weekly visits and therapy before coming up with a correct treatment plan. They were able to distinguish that my Bipolar 1 was not the only mood disorder related illness that was present from consistency and that my trauma was presenting itself in a whole different spectrum. I would have never gotten my life back had these doctors not fought tooth and nail to correctly diagnose and treat me. I recently got my life back from Borderline after YEARS of being treated for Bipolar 1 and PTSD alone elsewhere with small results. Nothing worked. Talk therapy made it worse, medication only dulled it slightly. These doctors valued my life, my time, and health. I initially didn't believe the diagnosis (no one outside attention seekers want to be borderline due to stigma) until I was sat down by both together with the medical criteria, my patient history, and notes in the past year of treatment. THIS is how everyone should be diagnosed and treated.. They literally SAVED MY LIFE!! :) 

About the community part, that was some serious food for thought and appreciated. You are completely right and I didn't see it that way. I am probably going to piggyback your opinion now. I never considered the potential repercussions of this and now I do. The internet is so dangerous because people walk in with all this endless knowledge available and cannot handle it responsibly. I also feel very uncomfortable sharing my safe space with a potential attention seeker because I mean, look what we deal with. It is offensive, insensitive, and cruel how often BPD is used for attention on places like tiktok..

246,"I'm so glad you had a proper diagnosing experience, and its evidential how important that has been to you! Mine was pretty much the opposite - Despite 3 OD attempts (impulsive and not) I was refused the chance to see a psychiatrist. I see now this was because of the BPD diagnosis that I later received, but it wasn't beneficial to not explain their reasoning. If they had, I could have understood more why they wanted to take the time before diagnosing. This is I guess, what I mean about communication and cooperation on both sides. 

There is totally a trend right now, ASD and BPD for sure, and DiD absolutely, although that is the most bizarre disorder to want to take. I feel the gatekeeping of diagnosing is partly to blame (at least in the UK, they take the 'treating the symptoms' approach), as well as a general lack of MH being taught in the education system.

I actually have a weird situation with a friend about this. We both have ASD older brothers who caused us both trauma. However, it was also 'joked' that I was ASD by my family. My parents turned down an assessment as a teen, so I had one as an adult and was diagnosed. This 'friend' seemed to enjoy pointing out that it could have been learnt behaviour, only now to have a list of her own self diagnosed disorders, ASD being one of them. Strange stuff.

Its so damn complicated, there are so many faults in the system and weird fuckery thats been unboxed with the growth of social media. I only hope that as it becomes more obvious that poor mental health is a world wide *crisis,* that those at the top do something *proper* about it.

252,"BPD is a very serious diagnosis. There's something called differential diagnoses, BPD is very similar to other milder or serious psychiatric illneses. BPD requires med, inpatient treatment and constant therapy. A doctor studied more than 10 years just to be able to diagnose psychiatric patients, what makes you think reading google a few times and completing a quiz make you capable of diagnosing yourself? BPD has psychosis and depersonalization as key symptoms, you can't be aware when these happen. That's how we usually end up in the psychward, that or a suicide attempt.

It's irresponsible to diagnose yourself BPD, making it worse for the actual people that have BPD there. I can't relate to most posts.

i hate the way that some groups and particular platforms tend to trivialise certain mental illnesses, it sucks and makes it even more difficult for people without a diagnosis to be taken seriously by medical professionals. the more we have this culture of ‚Äúmental illness is trendy‚Äù, the harder it is for the people who do suffer to find the proper help and diagnosis they need.

291,"its so crazy growing up and looking at your teenage years and realizing huh so it was just my mental health all along haha. but yeah! i read about it on tumblr, had just this moment where i was like oh my god this makes so much sense!! but after reading more, i saw it could be similar to puberty, which at the time i was like sure thats probably more likely i have to be just depressed its more common anyway. its really sad because even after receiving formal diagnoses for depression and anxiety as a kid i just always felt like it wasnt right. when i became an adult and realized this definitely cant be puberty anymore, i finally tried to get to the bottom of things.

and i'm in the us, but i feel you wholeheartedly. mental health care is horrid and it sucks. i had to cut back on sessions with my personal therapist because its just too expensive. i honestly owe a lot of money to my therapy center but they're very  kind and have been letting me pay it off slowly :s

i think another thing a lot of people forget is that diagnoses really only exist for insurance purposes. a lot of people might have many or even all of the symptoms of bpd, but unfortunately they have to be dealing with them at a certain severity otherwise they don't technically have bpd. the unfortunate reality is that resources are finite so naturally they should be allocated to those who are either a) an active danger to their own lives or b) unable to fulfill certain aspects of living (like being able to work or go to school). with that being said, i wish people could understand that at the end of the day diagnoses dont matter. you dont need one to validate your suffering. your suffering is real and no one can take that away from you, professional diagnosis or not. but for some weird reason people, especially people on the internet, don't seem to think that you can suffer with your mental health without having mental health issues. everyone struggles with their mental health to some capacity and everyone deserves access to any kind of help they may need. but we dont live in a perfect world sadly",tangcrine,ptza9o

2,"Well, people with BPD are often hesitant of therapy. The whole point of BPD is shielding yourself from facing whatever trauma caused it to begin with. Typically it's when that is poked, whether accidently or a relationship, person getting to close the truth that the ""splitting"" action or monster is going to come out for self protection. 

It can take a long time to diagnosis BPD, five years in that respect is nothing, as it presents the symptoms of so many other things and they run you through the gauntlet of treating you for being bipolar, OCD and all the others.

The best success typically comes from once you have a diagnosis and you messed up your life enough times to find a therapist who specializes in personality disorder and go in with a specific plan for your personal situation.",MainAction9667,1b83z4o

1,"Hiya,

Please try and remember that you are you and your disorder is separate from you.

I know and I understand that BPD is learned and develops from a young age. A lot of the ways we behave and things we believe about ourselves are so engrained in our minds, they blend the line between learned behaviours and core beliefs, who we think we really are.

It is very easy to pathologize with BPD. Blaming all of our troubles and behaviours on the disorder. Yes, this disorder does anything but make life easier to live but what it does not do is tell us what to do. That's on you, on me, on all of us. The disorder does not represent your personality, who you are. It simply clouds that up, makes it a little more difficult to find that person deep down in there, in safe and healthy ways.

With a lot of work, effort, therapy, it can be done. BPD is the most successfully treated personality disorder. You do have to _treat it_, though.

10,"Don't worry. It is pretty normal. See, I don't know how aware you were earlier what BPD is but regardless if there is something we are diagnosed with and are unaware about, we'd get curious/concerned about knowing more about it.

I was diagnosed with BPD 4 months back, and I never knew about it. It has been very difficult for me to still accept that I have BPD. It is a big pill to swallow. The day my therapist told me I had BPD, I started looking for what it is because I had no clue. Unluckily, I went through all the stigmas around BPD and started going deeper and deeper to the point I got very scared. I told my therapist the very next session that I am very scared and told her about all the stigmas I read (at the time to me those were the truths). To which, she asked me to never google what BPD is. And told me to ask for resources than going them over myself. And that is what I did for a while. My therapist also gave me psychoeducation sessions to make me understand what BPD is. And throughout, she used to also give me some resources to read and some youtube videos to watch. After some time, I got a little comfortable and started exploring on my own again and that is when I found this subreddit too. 

I would just say not to worry, it is pretty normal to be obsessed with what you are going through. Ask your therapist to give you some resources than you yourself wandering for it. Ask all the questions that come to your mind to either your therapist or this subreddit or to someone who understands what you are going through. You can do self exploration too but just keep in mind that all information might not be right (I learnt it the hard way). I still am very obsessed with knowing about my BPD. I just try to keep myself aware that if it triggers me I have to stop then and there and ask my therapist about it when we meet. (Stop myself from processing)

1. Not everyone has every symptom. This is very important and I know you might know this I am reminding it because I have struggled a lot here. I find myself trying to a bit forcefully imply some symptoms on me when they are actually not there. Essentially, even though we all share the same disorder everyone has their own struggles with it I guess. Something applicable to someone else might not be applicable to you even if both of you have bpd.
2. If you find anything triggering or something that makes you curious or you don't understand try talking it out to someone especially your therapist they will be able to make you understand it better.

Now, here is the resource list I was shared throughout my 4 months and I can tell you this that I haven't gone through all of them (for eg. I am unable to read books so the books I was recommended I have never read). The list -

I talked about the unhealthy part of me, which for me, I see as my inner core pain, lack of self worth, loneliness, dysfunctional attachment styles and lack of sense of self.

None of this is an excuse for my actions, rather, it is a reason. None of that, makes actions that are detrimental to others either OK or not OK.

This notwithstanding, I think you make a good point, which is that, if one believes one is inherently ""wrong"", one can use that to be ""wrong"" to others. Kind of like a self-sustaining cycle. In this case I certainly have experience of being like that. It is a great challenge to me, to feel that wrongness, and act differently, and not blame others (my mum) for why I feel that way. If I try hard, I can separate the internal feelings of wrongness, from enacting that on others, but it is immensely challenging and involves first being willing to feel that horrendous inner pain.

That's absolutely okay. It's recognizing, acknowledging, _radically accepting_, even, that it is within the realm of possibility for you to overcome it.

I empathize with you greatly. I fully understand that BPD begins to develop at such early ages that our core beliefs are shaped and molded by the disorder. It makes it so hard because the lines seem forever blurred. Is the disorder causing me to behave this way? Part of it has to be me, right? Because deep down inside I truly believe and think this way about myself and about the world. I have never thought any other way so it must be a part of me, who I am.

I hope you are actually able to come to a place where the pain is _there._ That's a good goal, hey? Because that's just where it is and needs to be. There. Then. It sounds as though as if the pain is still present. Here. It's still being felt it's still being worked through. That can sometimes take longer than it often took to put the pain there in the first place.

2,"The best course of action is to actually get a psychological assessment from a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. Most will require time to evaluate and won't jump into a diagnosis immediately, which is good because that's what they should do.

A personality disorder isn't and shouldn't be diagnosed lightly as you'd have to have impairment in 2 of the 4 areas and qualify for 5 out of 9 of the criterias. You can also ask them if you display certain traits. It is quite concerning that your gf armchair diagnose you rather than pointing that you might benefit from seeking out a professional on this. 

There are other disorders (C-PTSD, Bipolar, other PDs, Dependent PD etc.) that may present similarly to BPD and this requires someone who's trained and  knows what they are looking for to differentiate them. For example, low self esteem and difficulty setting boundaries are also seen in individuals that display codependency.

Your couple therapist may have a decent picture of what's going on and both of your personalities. In that case, if you trust their opinion, then what they say about you being manipulated may hold true as well. Of course, there's also the third possibility, that you may have BPD/display traits and you're also being manipulated.

And it seems like you have seek out second opinions on this. So you have 3 opinions on this, aka the initial therapist saying you met 2 out of 9 of the criteria, the psychiatrist hesitant to give you a diagnosis and the current therapist suggesting manipulation in relationship. 

You are of course, free to seek out another opinion but perhaps exploring with your current therapist on the part as to why they said you're being manipulated and how to set and enforce your boundaries so that you don't get lead around might also be a good idea. And at the meantime you can continue assessment with your psychiatrist. For the 2 criterias that you met, you can still practice DBT even if you don't have BPD. Mindfulness is useful when splitting and Interpersonal Relationships is good for learning to set boundaries.",BuTerflyDiSected,1capsdx

0,"Labeling them as episodes is sort of misleading. The core of BPD is emotional disregulation. We are not able to have ""normal"" emotional reactions. This derives from a deficiency in key areas of the brain, particularly the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. As for causes, there are many possible factors, but it can happen due to genes, chronic stress, and/or trauma, as a large percentage of people report experiencing trauma as children.

It's also common for it to be comorbid with other diseases like anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Any emotion we experience can be very intense, and moods can shift wildly minute by minute. Negative emotions tend to last far longer/come out stronger in us than neurotypicals. Paranoia/extreme distrust of others due partially to past bad experiences is also part of it. So the erratic behavior can come out as ""episodes"" and they are usually triggered by feelings of abandonment or rejection, which can happen for almost any percieved reason or no ""reason"" at all.

Do you suspect you have it, or maybe that a loved one does?",Vegetable_Drag5448,1aw9ozv
1,"I agree with what someone said about not labelling these as episodes but I do know exactly what you mean as my BPD definitely follows a cycle where it is terrible for a few months- impulsivelity, empty lost feelings etc, then a couple of months of pure depression, followed by some time where I try and rebuild my life with the commitment never to be like that again.

I think over analyzing everything allowed me to really see that, not everyone is happy all the time, not everyone is as they say. That a lot of people do put on a show.

3,"I was diagnosed at 21 and my mum was in the room with me at the time. The psychiatrist didn't come out and say BPD outright. He said something like ""severe personality defect with anxiety and trauma disorders"" and the classic lines of ""we don't like to label people"" and ""it's the symptoms that matter, not the name of the condition"". I didn't know I had BPD until about 10 years later when I was talking to my CPN and we were filling out my PIP review forms and I asked her what my main diagnosis was so I knew what the write down and she said EUPD/BPD. I was asked why I was never told and it was because of the stigma and it often does more damage to the patient to know. I felt better after knowing. It made more sense to me when therapists, psychologists, doctors etc all danced around it and would say things like ""your dissociation is a symptom of your personality trouble"" or things like that. I'd even asked before if I had it and they squirmed in their seat and said basically what the psychiatrist said. It was only my CPN who was open with me. I then got my medical files for PIP and there it was all over my file from 10+ years before I knew.

So in the sense of when I personally found out I had it, I told my husband first and he wasn't shocked. He pretty much knew I had it and in terms of when I was diagnosed but not properly told, it was my mum. Husband has always been supportive and doesn't judge me for my physical or mental conditions. Mum on the other hand, let's just say she has some personality troubles of her own and they make BPD look lovely.",spooky_scully_mulder,1826uaz

I think BPD and depression and anxiety can co-exist, so it might be that those things are coming through a little more at the moment. If you're in therapy, I'd speak with your clinician about it. If not, speak to a doctor.

2,"Thank you so much. It's a rough journey but I was the same before the diagnosis and managing to find ways to cope, some of them healthier than others...

I've been on a rollercoaster since. Part of me thinks that I have bipolar because of how long my ups and downs can last, but then there's the turbulence in-between. I think I'm the quiet BPD type, because I rarely lash out at people but internally I'm a mess and I'm convinced I'm a horrible person who deserves nothing, even the diagnosis. I struggle to talk to mental health people because I don't feel like my feelings are worth anything. It's a tough ride, and the self-doubt is real.

But through everything we have each other. I realised a while ago that it's my mind doing me dirty so try not to give legitimacy to those type of thoughts. It's helps a little bit, but it's a daily struggle.

5,"Yeah it's really, really rough, especially when other people don't seem to understand x

What's helped me is forcing myself to ask for leniency when I need it from others, and realising the emotions do eventually pass. My mind is my own worst enemy and I've managed to spot when things are going off, so I ask for some time and then make decisions when I feel ""okay"". There's no rush

Sometimes having that pressure taken off for a bit can help a lot.

We in the trenches together broskie but there is a bright future. The sad reality for us is that it takes a lot of personal work on the daily... Forever

How are we supposed to be the 'strong one' in a relationship when we doubt everything we do, doubt who we are and go into dark head spaces at the smallest aggravation.

We‚Äôre (generally) bigger, stronger and harder to ignore when uncontrollable emotions come to the surface, as a result it‚Äôs easy to get misdiagnosed. On top of that the way we‚Äôre socialised is the absolute worst in several ways but especially when it comes to BPD, the support we need is often completely opposite to that which is acceptable in the eyes of society at large. As a result we often don‚Äôt seek out that support. I‚Äôm privileged in a way being gay.

The only time I lash out at others or myself is when I'm well and truly past my breaking point. If I can keep my cool I go inwards and take things out on myself. Totally shut down but vibrating on the inside. I also have ME/CFS  (chronic fatigue syndrome) and haven't been able to go to school or work for 10yrs. Grown up in a Christian home which sometimes gives me hope and other times makes me feel condemmed and convicted. I find myself exhausted in every conceivable sense. Multiple broken relationships like most us - even have a kid I don't get to see which hurts a lot. Right now I'm in a 90 day men's addiction recovery program. Hoping I can learn some coping skills here in a wholesome community. Might help me get visitation with my kid too. But it's definitely the hardest thing I've had to do in awhile. I'm constantly worried that I'm going to burn out my physical health which just adds to the phycological stress. Taking it one step at a time and seeing about some anti anxiety meds. Not sure what my point is but it's nice to know we are not alone. If the Christian God is as the way He's been described to me then He has a soft spot for all of us going through it.

It sounds like your Mom is supportive and honestly that's HUGE. My Mom has been my lifeline pre and post diagnosis, I am so grateful. I have had to do a lot of self-help, so my advice would be to journal (especially if you try different medications for your disorder), talk it all out And don't let any emotions fester, find an exercise that you LOVE and start a routine (has helped me emotional regulate a lot). Have dance parties in your room to your fav music (not kidding this helps me). It's all about putting tools in your tool box.  If your in therapy or starting therapy, that's awesome ! Have an open mind, but don't forget to advocate for yourself on what works and what doesn't. I have yet to find a great therapist for me post diagnosis, so I have limited knowledge on that (hence all the self-help). Practice as much self-love and forgiveness as you can. Be gentle with your mind. Take it one day at a time üíú You got this. I know it can be scary and is, but this diagnosis is not a death sentence. You will find your way ü§ó

69,"I was just diagnosed this summer, at the age of 39, by my new psychiatrist. Over the previous 6-10 years I had asked my last two psychiatrists about the possibility of BPD, and had brought it up to my husband as something I was potentially concerned about. All said no, I was too grounded and high functioning, not manipulative enough. On the first visit with my new psychiatrist he called it out without any prompting from me. When I asked him recently what made him make that call, after other doctors had not, he stated that many doctors are hesitant to over-diagnose, but for me he felt confident making this diagnosis for the following reasons:

* Years of ineffective treatment (therapy and medication)
* History of personal trauma
* Pervasive suicidal ideation and (minor) self-harm
* Overbearing (though supportive) parents
* Prone to feeling easily irritated/annoyed
* Poor sense of self and self-worth

I think there were others, but the biggest thing I took away is that *because* I have struggled for so long, it was easier for him to make this diagnosis. It doesn't take away the other diagnoses - currently GAD and MDD - just makes a more clear picture, and a better path forward for treatment. 

Additionally, like many others on the post, it became more difficult to function after tragedy (the loss of my 57 year-old mother to brain cancer last year). If I had met my new psych prior to her illness, I may not have received the same diagnosis. We are where we are because what has already come to pass.",tlc1783,xjnwrz

I felt completely disconnected from my first child and went through a similar experience then. When he was for months old, he wouldn't stop crying one night. I could feel myself start to snap. I wouldn't hurt him, but my dad just happened to walk in my room at that exact moment. It was 2am. I gave my son to his dad for fear of seriously hurting him. With my second son, I did do something that led to no actual injury but a hospital visit out of deep concern that I'd really hurt him. Because of that, we found out he had a stroke while I was pregnant. I decided that my ppd saved my son in the most horrible way possible, I got myself as far from what was causing the most mental anguish I was going through, and tried to do better. He's 18 now and such a wonderful kid. He has major depressive disorder and was hospitalized 2 years ago, but he gets the help he needs.

I want to live a happier life, and my perspective on life has changed for the better a lot. I learned to stop relying on others for my emotional needs so much and rely on myself instead. I learned to sit with my intense feelings without always acting on them so way less impulsive. I had a couple of health scares in the last few years that put things into perspective for me.

1,"It took me about 2 years to come to accept everything about the disorder and at every turn i kept seeing more and more and more awful shit about myself and all the reasons people blew up at me, went no contact, ended friendships, etc. They had every right, quite frankly. I was a fucking shit. 

It does get worse, only initially, it should. You should have to face all the worse parts of yourself and you should look for even uglier things, you should look for the ugliest worst parts of yourself that you never wanted to see or know or become aware of. It's only in that that you will have the power to understand and know what you have to confront and change about yourself in treatment and become the person you actually want to be. 

You have to be willing to sit with your discomforts and challenge yourself if you're actually going to be able to work towards remission with the disorder. And remission is possible. I believe in its ability to be cured, but that's controversial still. For people who enter the recommended treatment protocol, there's a greater than 50% remission rate just within the first 24 months. In a longitudinal study, at 16 years (i know it's a long time for you but this is following everyone regardless of treatment received or not or life circumstances) follow up from the time of diagnosis 72% of patients were experiencing 8 years of remission, that reflected data of similar longitudinal studies. The longest follow up at 27 years found 92% were in remission regardless of treatment received.  

I can't stress enough how treatable this condition is, regardless of what you may hear otherwise. Get yourself into treatment and don't stop, ther days where it's hardest and the days you don't want to go are the days you need to be there the most. Learn all you can about the most up to date information. 

Congrats on being diagnosed at 18, you are at a fantastic advantage, use it and heal. 

And absolutely do not avoid processing your trauma either. That is every bit as important to treating your BPD as any other treatment protocol to reduce long term suffering.

Here's a 2024 systemic review on the most up to date literature of the disorder, read this and jump start your journey, you got this, you're gonna do great:

I started looking back in hindsight once I realized I probably had it, and once I was officially diagnosed and started working on recognizing the behaviors, I started noticing then everywhere. I see them everywhere if I examine my past behaviors though, too. Lost jobs, lost friendships, spending sprees, etc...

0,Why do you need a diagnosis to start working on yourself? Medication doesn‚Äôt treat BDP it alleviates some symptoms. Either way you‚Äôll have to go to therapy and gain self awareness and develop Health habits and coping strategies. DBT isn‚Äôt just for BPD it‚Äôs for almost everyone.,EmotionalVacation26,ytbb9t
1,How long have you been seeing your psychiatrist for?,hornwormsreeeeee,ytbb9t
2,"If you can, find someone who specializes in trauma. BPD is often caused by/similar to complex ptsd. Medication won‚Äôt really help get to the root of it. Yes meds can help stabilize moods, but you‚Äôll never actually heal unless you‚Äôre working through a process with a trained therapist. Psychiatrists are better at throwing meds at something, while trauma specialists can use DBT and other techniques with you to help you actually rewire your patterns and understand WHY you have these symptoms.",Actual_fairy,ytbb9t
3,"On top of the other advice I just wanted to add that I actually had a much harder tike getting help and support WITH a BPD diagnosis and have friends that experienced similar. There is a lot of stigma around the diagnosis that even doctors aren't immune to.

You don't need a diagnosis to get better and sometimes focusing on your individual struggles instead of a blanket diagnosis can be even more helpful bc everyone experiences BPD or any mental illness in a way that is unique to them. Keep advocating for the help you need but you dont need to wait for an official diagnosis.

im not gonna lie i was Very straightforward with my counsellor and psychiatrist and said that ive looked into bpd and done loads of research and want to discuss the symptoms i show because i think i might have it and i was Very persistent.

you could also talk with your psychiatrist and say that you dont feel you're being listened to. i know its intimidating but they're there to help you, if they arent helping you then you need to tell them that, otherwise they cant change the way they do things to accommodate to you. remember its not your job to make them feel accomplished and tell them the truth that you feel ignored, because trust me they've heard that (and Much worse) before. you cant be a psychiatrist if you cant handle criticism.

I've also heard some providers will purposely not diagnose because they think they're saving u from stigma and some just won't tell u what your diagnoses are at all. It's pretty crazy. I'd been in therapy at a youth program in a community center from age 11 to 18 and when I first found out I had a disorder at all I was 27. U would think upon turning 18 at least someone would have said SOMETHING, but I found out a community center is considered a non clinical setting and apparently there's rules that non clinical settings can't diagnose u with anything. Pissed me off because they're leaving ppl with mental illnesses totally in the dark and uninformed! That's terrible! And in terms of stigma, it's been my experience that u don't need a diagnosis to be stigmatized. Like I said, my first official diagnosis of any disorder was at age 27 and the diagnosis was autism.... but I'd been stigmatized in virtually every environment since I was born. I learned i also have BPD last year! Ppl r just astoundingly mean to u if u r neurodivergent in any way at all. They knew I was different somehow and were horrible. Period. There's no escaping stigma even if u have no official diagnosis....idk why anyone thinks simply not writing it on paper helps us escape it. If anything, I was happy to have an explanation as to why it was happening. At least now I know....it also explains why my entire moms side of the fam is messed up.

Now that you‚Äôre aware, you can recognize behavior and try to change how you react and interact with others. I have many days I hate this but now I know I can try my best to mitigate it. Take care!",tamtamgonewilde,17jsv6k
2,"Maybe I'm not the best person to help with/answer this since I've only been diagnosed since Friday morning, but I still wanted to say something <3

I'm right there with you about feeling empty after the diagnosis, and not knowing what to do or to feel. I don't think it's fully sunken in yet, despite me having suspected being BPD for quite a while. 

However, I felt the exact same way after getting diagnosed with ADHD 4 years ago. Once the emptiness left I had a variety of very different feelings, most notably relief (I had an answer for what was ""wrong"" with me), grief (for the person I could have been if I had known this from the beginning, and not at 25) and anger (""it isn't this hard for everyone? Then why the fuck have people made me feel less for not being able to handle it as well as others?!"")
 I'm hoping that this diagnosis will be somewhat the same; because nowadays I view getting diagnosed with ADHD as one of the best things that has ever happened to me. It made me understand how I work, what things I struggle with/things that are impossible and made me able to give myself some grace for coming up short from what's expected of a neurotypical. It allowed myself to find strategies for dealing with life, and while it's still not easy, it's *better*.

I also understand the fear of people thinking differently of you because of your diagnosis because a part of me feel that way as well. But as several people in my life has pointed out to me - the diagnosis doesn't change who I am. I was BPD before I got this diagnosis, the same way I was ADHD before getting diagnosed with that. The only real change is that I now have the means to understand it, and get better suited help.

Finally, I just want to say that you don't have to have everything figured out immediately. Give yourself some time, and take care of yourself <3",Ok-Tumbleweed-504,17jsv6k
3,"I was diagnosed about a year and maybe a month ago and I wont lie, I had to deal with a lot of internalized ableism I didn't know I had towards those with personality disorders. I was very confused, I denied a lot of it from the start but when I finally got through that I started DBT. I'm about to finish my group therapy in the next two weeks and I manage rather well with low doses where I used to be maxed out on my meds. 

I still struggle, and I'm sure I'll struggle for most if not the rest of my life. that's just the way it may be for a hot minute. 

not to sound like a clich√© weirdo, but it does get better but recovery isn't linear and this is something you should take a day at a time before you move to a week at a time and so on. 

in terms of relationships, I'm not much help. my best friend stuck and suffered through it all; all of my bad and toxic behaviors he suffered it just so he can see me NOW at my best. my parents were very supportive and so I don't know how to cope with that fear of abandonment but communication is key and being able to take accountability of your actions and making an active change and activly getting help will show those in your life that you mean business.

take the time you need to take to cope. read up on it. look into books. and look into therapy options if that's something you have access to. you got this üíï‚ú®",desertcoyote97,17jsv6k
4,"There was a lot of denial at the beginning for me. To be told that your personality is an illness is heavy. I was adamant that the diagnosis was wrong, and that made me push people away and lose faith in my therapy. Suddenly I was being treated differently by all doctors and nurses. Plus I made the mistake of reading a lot of judgemental articles about bpd- ones that said we were inherently abusive. That continued to the point where I stopped attending treatment- then I suddenly became a lot lower functioning and had to face that I did have bpd and what that actually meant for me. I started trying to have empathy for myself, and for what I‚Äôve been through. Acceptance is still hard, but it‚Äôs the only thing we can do to make the healing easier. You‚Äôre not a different person now that you‚Äôre diagnosed, you‚Äôre still you and this has always been a part of you. It just has a name now and you don‚Äôt have to tell people about it until you‚Äôre comfortable, or at all.",Technical_Green1782,17jsv6k
5,"I got diagnosed in July, this year, and I am so happy I was. My friends understand my bpd, and I‚Äôve made lots of new friends with bpd who understand what it‚Äôs like. I wasn‚Äôt happy about it at first, I was kind of mad someone caused this. Throughout the months though I have learned lots about bpd and have slowly learned how to stay in control and not let my emotions take over, and how to live with the disorder

There is no real reason for your partner to leave just because of a bpd diagnosis. If anything, it will help strengthen your relationship as you guys learn about bpd and learn how to make a relationship work through the emotional ups and downs. 

My relationships are more stable now, and so am I lol. With therapy, medication, and a lot of working on myself, my symptoms have drastically decreased. They are still very much there and can be very intense at times, but it‚Äôs manageable! I do struggle with feeling empty a lot of the time still, but you learn how to deal with it. I don‚Äôt like to sit still when I feel that way.",Saved_Promo,17jsv6k
6,Try to think of it in this way: now that you‚Äôre diagnosed you have more clarity on why you behave the way you do which gives you the chance to put the work needed in. Without the diagnosis maybe you were wondering a lot about certain things and now they‚Äôre clearer? It‚Äôs not an awful thing to be diagnosed and it doesn‚Äôt have to be the worse thing to have bpd. You can work on it and manage it well. There are some things that people with bpd have that make them special.

I actually pursued my diagnosis with the help of my partner. I was a wreck, and they compassionately told me that my mood swings and sobbing break downs were concerning and severe. We started looking into conditions that could be underlying the GAD and MAD diagnoses I was being treated for. I actually took a BPD screener online by accident thinking it was a Bipolar Disorder screener, but I checked every box and my partner agreed. When I asked my therapist at the time, she listened to me speak, telling her I was nervous about brining it up, but needed some guidance. When she spoke, she was dismissive and inappropriate. She said I couldn‚Äôt be Borderline because they are ‚Äúrude and disrespectful‚Äù and I was ‚Äúkind‚Äù and ‚Äúasked about [her] day.‚Äù I switched to a therapist who specializes in BPD and herself has been diagnosed with the disorder, and guess what I have??? Anyway, all this to say, I am so glad I got my diagnosis. It probably saved my life. One thing I struggle with is seeing the patterns in my behavior. I never feel like I‚Äôm where I want to be.

i'm sure it feels weird and probably quite low, so i'm sorry this has got you so down, but good things can happen from here! now that you know how your brain works, you can go in the direction of healing in the way that fits you.

if possible, ask your doctor about medications they can prescribe ‚Äî antidepressants alone can help but they won't do the full job, so i'd look into mood stabilisers and antipsychotics if you feel you may benefit from them and if you're open to it.

try DBT! if you don't have access to DBT therapy, there are some workbooks online you can use and download! i'm not sure if reddit will delete links on these posts as it might count them as spam, but if you have instagram i recommend @itsrainingbpd, and click the link in their bio to find free DBT workbooks.

0,"Hello! One way is to contact a therapist (if your area allows them to diagnose) or psychiatrist and be seen for evaluation. I‚Äôve heard many can complete the MSI-BPD screening tool, available on Mood Treatment Center, and present it to their mental health professional to inspire assessment. Medications can benefit symptoms but not core features of the disorder. Psychotherapy, often DBT, is first-line treatment. However, medication for other conditions-occurring conditions, such as distinct depressive disorder, is recommended. As an aside, up to 85% of those diagnosed with BPD no longer meet criteria for the condition 10 years out. So, it is not a death sentence. Best of luck to you!",aperyu-1,1ct0li3

3,"i was diagnosed last year (26F) and found out i‚Äôve had it since high school.

talk to your medical provider and have them recommend you to someone who specializes in mental health. 

if you end up getting diagnosed with BPD, i would recommend asking for a pharmaceutical mouth swab (i think it‚Äôs called? forgive me if i‚Äôm wrong)

it‚Äôll show you lists of meds you can metabolize (in other words that work for you) and ones that don‚Äôt. 

there is no specific medication for BPD. i just recommend the swab because after so many years of trying so many meds i found out none of them work well for me.

always ask about the side effects as well and be sure to communicate when you feel like you can‚Äôt handle them.

Remember, a diagnosis doesn't change who you are as a person; it's simply a label used to describe differences from what society perceives as 'normal.' Personally, the diagnosis has been helpful for me. It's given me insight into why my brain works the way it does and has brought me a sense of peace. I encourage you to view your diagnosis as a tool for better understanding yourself and for self-compassion. It's okay to forgive yourself if you make mistakes or experience emotional outbursts.

Talking about your feelings with loved ones can also be beneficial. It helps me to know that I'm not alone, and that many others also struggle with this personality disorder. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and seeking support from others can make a big difference.",Due-Hotel4811,1chsubt

2,"What I usually say is that when I do something that is a result of this disorder, I do not excuse my actions because I have BPD; however, it explains them. I am responsible for my actions, not my illness. My illness only makes it harder to control my emotions, as I tend to overthink and overreact. This overthinking can lead to overreactions, making it difficult for others to understand where I'm coming from or the intensity of my emotions.

It's important to surround yourself with people with whom you can have honest communication‚Äîpeople who can separate the disorder from your true self and express how you've hurt them without insulting you as a person. However, we also have to accept that people don't have to tolerate everything, and if we hurt them too much, they may need to protect themselves and create distance.If you want people to listen to you and be compassionate, you must do the same for them. 

I know it's hard; many people tend to criticize us. But what matters most is not some random person's opinion, but that you are surrounded by people who love and accept you. Everyone will always have something to say about anything, really. People find it easier to criticize others than to work on themselves and do something constructive. Try not to dwell on it too much. You are loved, and you are not your illness; you are a person, and labels don't define you.",Due-Hotel4811,1chsubt

I have been giving them space as I'm angry at them for that and other things and they know I'm suffering really bad rn it just didn't help my mental health.,Im_the_new_kid,1chsubt
4,"Living with BPD is a significant challenge, but you're not alone. There's a supportive community that understands your struggles and offers hope for improvement. While some days may seem overwhelmingly difficult, remember that pain can lessen with time and support.

Facing insults in response to your struggles is concerning. It's vital to have open conversations with loved ones about how hurtful these responses can be. If the environment lacks understanding, temporary distance may be necessary for self-preservation.

Reflection is crucial when emotions run high. Understanding the impact of our words fosters healthier relationships.

Despite BPD's challenges, it brings unique strengths. Our capacity for intense love and happiness is unparalleled. Being emotional isn't a flaw; it's a beautiful aspect of the human experience. Finding joy in small moments is a testament to resilience and the beauty of life.

Remember, healing is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.",Due-Hotel4811,1chsubt
0,"When I was diagnosed I just got the diagnosis and was then left to my own devices. I tried to read up on it, but couldn't concentrate. Instead I binged Dr. Daniel Fox and also On The Line (Kayla) on YouTube. It helped a lot at the time. Dr. Fox is a psychiatrist and has a positive view in terms of recovery and Kayla has BPD herself and is training to be a therapist (her channel is inactive, but the vids are still there). It helped me understand some of my patterns (as well as things I don't relate to) and convinced me we can definitely recover from BPD.

The one I'm currently with was on a referral basis from the hospital and is a short term crisis intervention as if I didnt agree to it I wouldve been sectioned. The current place lasts 1-3 weeks per person depending on individual circumstances (confusing but the more help you need the less time you spend with them as they give you quicker appointments and prioritise you so you can seek out further help quicker after being diagnosed if you need one or quicker referrals if you've already been diagnosed).

5,"I was diagnosed after a suicide attempt at 16. I couldn't accept it at the time because my dad has NPD or APD(he is a violent, cruel man) and I didn't want to be anything like him. Not even a little bit. So I kind of denied it for a long time, while knowing it in the back of my mind to be absolutely correct.

I went ahead and did CBT(there was no DBT back then) and I learned a ton of self control and self soothing behaviors, I learned what common boundaries people have, since I didn't learn any of that as a kid. I have never achieved full remission. I'm 39 now. I'm in the first sustained-happiness long term relationship of my life, going on 7 years. I've had other good relationships, but they never lasted more than a year or so because I would break up with them. And I've two really, really bad ones.

Anyway, CBT helped a lot, I recently went back to therapy for a few months to get that sweet sweet DBT and now I'm doing that on my own(now that I know how the therapist wants me to do it). It's hard to say if your story will be different because I could never swear off relationships like a lot of people who got better. The drive in me to find love is too irresistible. I also have a lot of abandonment, I was adopted as an infant and then my adoptive mother died when I was 10 and I was abused and never allowed to grieve, it was a lot. I have CPTSD as well, which makes my case more complicated than just BPD. The thing is, I'm okay with going to intermitted therapy forever. I mean, it's not ideal, but I basically have brain damage, so if I have to go to therapy to have a good life, so be it. Seems like a small price to pay compared to what some other people have to do to manage their disabilities. I understand you're still coming to terms with that. I can tell you that it gets better if you do the work. I held down a job for ten years and got promoted a few times, quit to go back to school, and now I think I might have a healthy life with a partner, stepkids, and a career for the rest of mine. That's something to get out of bed for. And it didn't start falling into place until I was 33-34 years old. My stepmom was 45 when she left my dad and met the love of her life, they've been together for 24 years now. You have time to figure this out.

[Codependents Anonymous](https://coda.org/newcomers/) and [Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families](https://adultchildren.org/literature/laundry-list/) were fantastic and helped me manage my symptoms just as much, if not more than, CBT. I love the groups for their practical advice and getting to the root of the problem, but also just being in a room with people who are going through the same thing you are. Especially the ACA groups, it's such a relief to have a space to talk about child abuse without people being like ""wow you're a real bummer.""",BeePeeDee_fam,183llxc
6,"I know for me, my BPD has gotten significantly better as I‚Äôve gotten older. I had extreme symptoms when i was like 11-14, slowly it‚Äôs getting a bit better and more manageable. There‚Äôs no cure or direct medication that stops the bpd, but you can definitely try different medications for anxiety, etc to help ease some of the symptoms. I kinda always knew that I had it, so for me, the diagnosis was just validation and an answer. I can also understand struggling to accept it, as it is a condition that is stigmatized heavily. But finding a professional that is familiar with the diagnosis can help a ton. DBT therapy is known to be a great resource as well. I hope you feel better about your diagnosis, and know that there are ways to manage it and you‚Äôre not alone!",sillyfizz,183llxc

8,"I was diagnosed over a decade ago but didn't really take it seriously until the last 5 years or so. It is difficult to accept, but there is truth to the statement I read above that feeling sorry for ourselves will not help feel better or learn to get better. Ask yourself, what's the difference between ""being weird"" and ""having borderline personality disorder""? Ultimately, nothing. They just have different names.. Your experience with it doesn't change. For me, the more I learned about it, the more those ""ah ha!"" Moments started to happen. Like arguing with my spouse and getting that overwhelming chest tightness, brain terror * That's what i call it*, and immediate argumentative stance, I recognize now as splitting. So now I pay attention to the physical reactions I have to emotional stimulants and try to walk away or communicate, ""I'm having a hard time right now."" Sometimes, you have to look back at an altercation and take accountability because OUR reality is not always THE reality, and it's super important to recognize and honor both, especially if it impacts someone else. When splitting, it's really easy to look as a situation as black and white and not really acknowledge the other parties' experience.  Sometimes my husband antagonizes me without really knowing, and it'll cause me to split, and I'll say awful things and react horribly... after its important to say ""I shouldn't have said xyz and I'm sorry"" but ALSO, ""please respect that I'm not myself when in that space and use your rational mind to refrain yourself until I'm okay again"".. communication is key to everyone around you. Yoga, exercising, partaking in things you enjoy, good sleep, and mood stabilizers work best for me. 

Also, if a partner doesn't understand or respect BPD as the mental disorder that it is, they're not the right one for you. Even though there is a technical.something ""wrong"" with us, it's really important to remember this is still who you are and having the right people around you makes a world of difference when trying to help yourself get better. The key is maintenance in every day.life and interaction not to cure yourself. 

Last thing, with the help of a therapist or even journaling, try to pinpoint the moments in your life growing up when you felt abandoned, ignored, and unsupported by your caretakers or support system. It helps me in my hard moments to be able to recognize why I'm responding a certain way to something.",BrieJckChz,183llxc
9,"I've been diagnosed for 3 years. Don't blame yourself, having BPD isn't your fault. Having this diagnosis can help you understand your thoughts/emotions and how to react to them.

I would ask your psychiatrist/therapist/doctor what the diagnosis means for how it will affect you in your life. Try to think of it as positive.

BPD is very, very wrongly demonized, and it's frustrating because VERY effective therapy and life management techniques exist.  

BPD is secondary trauma based dissociation.  That means (typically) one ""apparently normal part"" and multiple emotional parts.    

PTSD and cPTSD is primary trauma based dissociation.  if they manifest emotional parts typically only have one (related to their specific trauma(s)

 DID is tertiary trauma related dissociation and features multiple ""apparently normal parts"", often multiple emotional parts, *and* parts have an emancipated sense of self and agency.  

The majority of techniques for managing BPD are the same as for PTSD, cPTSD, OSDD, and DID, with specifics tailored to BPD.",Sablesweetheart,139spnq
3,"My therapist told me that BPD naturally gets better with age, because people in general tend to be less emotinal with age. I would also suspect that older women are more stable once their hormones stop to fluctuate so much. I don't think the psychiatrist is right.

I was lucky to find a therapist that knows BPD, but doesn't judge people with it at all. He's always tried to keep the focus on me being just a person who needs to figure out how to take care of myself, not a diagnosis or a basket case or what. Sure, my symptoms are not that severe, but still. It's about the people. I hope you'll find someone more understanding to help you.

I also used to think that I'm bad because of my BPD (""not a good person"") and I have to change and cure and be better... but during the course of the therapy I realised there's nothing wrong with me. I'm just a sensitive person who's been around insensitive parents and then partners, every time I panicked someone's gonna leave me, I was right and they did (they already wanted to before I started to ""cling"" anyway). It's no wonder I am the way I am. In a way, it's a normal reaction to abnormal amount of bullshit. The braind needs to protect itself in some way and chose this, not ideal, way.

I've always felt like I need someone else to save me, to help me, so that I survive. No wonder I was so desperate to keep a man. My therapist kept reminding me that I'm adult now, strong and capable and stuff and this feeling of ""needing someone"" is just a ghost from the past.

I was so hard on myself, the hardest, no one else even saw me as bad as I've seen myself. Even in a relationship, no one ever really told me I'm bad in any way. I was telling that myself, I was thinking I should be better, take all the pain, not even feel it, not be needy, just make my partner happy all the time. I blamed myself when people left. But the truth is, they just didn't want to make the effort.

So yeah, I'm still not cured, but I don't care. I think my BPD is a part of me and embracing it without letting it dictate my actions is possible. I've wondered my whole life what's ""wrong with me"" and now that I know, ironically, I am okay with it.

When you start reading forums any hope you have will be diminished or completely evaporate. The advice she found on here and Quora was that it would never get better. 

It won't without help. That much is true. My ex has Autism, undiagnosed until about the same time I got my BPD ""badge."" Her behaviors were dismissive, cold, uncaring, very little empathy. She was neglectful to the point is abuse. Stonewalled, totally avoidant personality.

I wanted her to go to couples therapy so she could learn about BPD and help me recover. She resisted and said it was my issue and not a relationship issue.I accepted that everything was my fault and she did no wrong. This is never true in any relationship.

No one can tell you how you're recovery will go and unfortunately you will never be guaranteed that people can handle your condition. Or when they might stop being able to deal with it. 

You can do it. I didn't think I could. I won't lie it's been hard some days. Sometimes for a few days at a time.  But 2 years after diagnosis and 1 year after she left I'm still kicking.

Remission is the act or process of remitting, which is a verb that means to refrain from in this context. So the process of refraining from your self destructive behaviors, given the context.

However, I have had testing in the past where I didn‚Äôt receive results until a month or two after.  I would say this depends on what professional you are seeing and what their company protocol is.

Trauma work is so, so crucial, but the person needs to first achieve a state of stability and understanding of most or ideally all of their parts, *and* have a therapist who can handle trauma work.  

The therapist who knows how to manage trauma work seems to be where the professionals are failing.   Using EMDR without a trauma trained therapist can backfire really badly because you are basically inducing a flashback.  

But, that is the way through, resolving your traumas, grounding all of your parts in the *present*, and learning healthier responses.",Sablesweetheart,139spnq

2,"Cheers!

I also have an OCD diagnosis and I also chalked up some of my BPD symptoms to OCD (mainly my obsessional/insecure attachment style).

For me personally, it helped having that second diagnosis to understand myself better.

I will say, my struggle with OCD was quite rough in my early teen years and then when the OCD was a bit more managed I couldn't figure out what the heck was still wrong.. In some ways, getting that BPD diagnosis felt like a slap in the face and like I was starting from the bottom (of my mental health journey) again. But this isn't true!!! It's an accomplishment in itself to get diagnosed.

0,"First of all, you already know what's wrong with you.  You have BPD.  Second, you're right: it's all in your head.  That's where the problem lives.  That's not your fault, and you didn't do anything wrong.

Now to the real point of your question, BPD is one of the most underdiagnosed, misrepresented and misunderstood conditions in the mental health community.  It just simply doesn't get the attention and nuanced understanding that it needs by the vast majority of general mental health practitioners who largely need everything to fit in a box of very neatly crafted criteria that are easy to diagnose and easy to treat (and more lucrative to medicate).

I don't know how you're seeking and selecting the mental health professionals that you've worked with, and I don't presume to know your financial and insurance situations, but you need to research to find quality, recommended practitioners in your area that are trained in, and specifically focus on, treating BPD.  That is where you're going to get your best help.  

Having a BPD brain is like having a very complicated and very specialized computer that's broken and can't be understood or fixed by anyone other than the people who built it, but you keep trying to take it to the Geek Squad and begging for help from anyone wearing a name tag.",sincosincosinsin,1b2ewsg
1,"Well.... technically it is correct to say it is all in you head. This doen't mean it doesn't exists.

The problem is that medicine in general, but especially mental health, is not an exact science. You cant ask for 3 or 4 symphtoms and find an exact diagnosis. Also, diagnosis often shares traits, or are generally vague.

What should you do? Stick with a diagnosis that looks more adeguate to you AND the mental health professional. Then start the treatment and see how it goes.

Look for improvements, not a definitive cure. With time, titration and reevaluation, things will be better.

Also, focus on improve everything in your life.",staccodaterra101,1b2ewsg

3,"So I don't think your psychologist was very good, they are not allowed to (in most countries) diagnose you with anything they can treat you for what they think you have but yeah the fact that they did that and then said you were too much for them is very unprofessional, and while self diagnosis is valid if you have not done the research I would not recomend just accepting another's diagnosis. Right now, you are diagnosed bipolar which presents very similar to bpd. I would recommend talking to a psychiatrist if you don't feel like going through informed self diagnosis. They can also give medication if appropriate.

Mental health is in your head, but it is real. Chemical and hormonal imbalance are a big part of mental health. If you do have bpd, it also includes the trauma and its effects on your personality. They are very much anchored in your physical self, and they matter. You are not at fault for needing help.",GRIMMxMC,1b2ewsg

30,"Something that I found interesting too is that she said that people with BPD actually have an extra sensitive nervous system.  Our emotions are an physiological response to external stimuli.  So someone with an extra sensitive system will feel emotions more intensely.  That‚Äôs why medications like Lamictal are very helpful.  I‚Äôve personally found it to be very helpful, it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre taking meds.  It just makes me feel...stronger.  Like my emotions are much more manageable and I every sad thought I have no longer immediately jumps to suicidal ideation.",TripEcho,ixd34y
31,"Obvi the basic dbt stuff first.  Something I thought was kinda silly but actually worked for me was blasting star wars music in my mind when I have intrusive thoughts.  She also said screaming to heavy metal is very helpful too.  It‚Äôs actually been scientifically proven to help with mood and she does it too lol.  A really funny thing she told me is that she doesn‚Äôt give a shit if I drink or use drugs, just as long as I stay alive so I can continue doing therapy to continue trying to get better.  Also a big part of bpd is feeling a loss of self and feeling disconnected from your surroundings, hence why she advised me to start taking mushrooms to feel more connected with the world around me as well as feel like I get a glimpse of who I actually am.  When I do mushrooms all my dysphoria, intrusive thoughts, overwhelming emotions and depression temporarily fade away.  Getting used to this feeling by experiencing it more and more is making it easier to stay in that mindset when I‚Äôm sober.  Obviously it‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs been really helpful to me.  She also recommended ketamine therapy, apparently it has shown to be very effective at treating depression.  What‚Äôs cool is my therapist practices what she preaches lol, she micro doses mushrooms, has done ketamine therapy and walks me thru how she personally uses dbt when her bpd symptoms come to the surface.",TripEcho,ixd34y

Like I got medicated with escitalopram for depression and anxiety around 1.8 years ago. Which calmed my depression and anxiety symptoms.

But... It made me super lethargic and my psychiatrist reduced from 10 mg to 5mg of it. Which made me better, leaving more energy. 


Now recently 2 months back my therapist diagnosed me with bpd. Should I talk to my psychologist and change my meds??",BPDing-myway,ixd34y

I too am on Lamictal and began 3 months ago. It has lifted me out of a pit of absolute despair. I‚Äôm so lucky to have it. I understand they simply will not prescribe it in the UK which is a bloody tragedy. I still feel real fear and emotional pain but don‚Äôt react to it anything like before.

43,Lamictal is very helpful and it‚Äôs lack of side effects is especially notable as long as you do not develop any rash in early stages. I would urge you to work with someone who is sensible enough to prescribe this drug. It has really really helped me,benbob76,ixd34y
44,"I felt the same way when I took escitalopram.  I think the absolute best thing for anyone with bpd is to take Lamotrigine.  It really had zero side effects for me and just made me feel more together.  Like my emotions were more stable but I didn‚Äôt feel lethargic or empty or anything that some depressants make me feel.  Plus it only takes 2 weeks to start seeing results.  It‚Äôs very common that people with BPD will need to take an antidepressant with a mood stabilizer like Lamotrigine.  I take Bupropion, it effects the dopamine receptors unlike SSRI‚Äôs which are what most anti depressants are.  It also is used to treat addiction, I have had alcohol addiction and taking Bupropion completely got rid of my cravings",TripEcho,ixd34y
45,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear you‚Äôve been going thru it.  I‚Äôm really glad that you‚Äôre feeling better now.  Something my therapist told me is that we have 3 selves.  A child self, adolescent/teenager self, and adult self.  People with BPD often go thru something traumatic in childhood that causes them to have to grow up early.  They have to mentally mature faster because otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle the trauma.  Because of this, a lot of people are left emotionally immature because emotionally they are still a child.  They may be mentally and physically an adult or teenager but their inner child‚Äôs emotions are still very much there.  This is why my therapist taught me about mindfulness.  Essentially when I feel an intense emotion, I try to observe the emotion from almost a third person perspective.  Try to determine which ‚Äúself‚Äù is trying to be heard.  It could be the traumatized and abandoned child self or the anxty and angry teenager.  The teenager self is usually aggressive and defensive because it‚Äôs actually trying to protect your child self.  Both can be full of pain but for different reasons.  A good example of this would be if a friend doesn‚Äôt respond to your text for a day.  You will feel very upset and maybe angry or even feeling abandoned.  You can observe this emotion you‚Äôre feeling and recognize the self that‚Äôs trying to express itself.  If you are feeling abandoned then it‚Äôs most likely your child self expressing this emotion. What you need to do essentially is imagine you are talking to your child self.  It helps to look at a picture of yourself as a child.  Try having a conversation with them in your mind and tell them you understand what they‚Äôre saying and validate and acknowledge their feelings.  Let them know that everything will be okay.  Sorry this is so long, I can keep going if you‚Äôd like :)",TripEcho,ixd34y

for me personally i‚Äôm not formally diagnosed either i‚Äôve only had it confirmed it‚Äôs bpd. but they‚Äôre refusing to evaluate me so im in a similar situation.
being diagnosed is so important to me cause i can finally put a name to it. right now since im not diagnosed im experiencing intense imposter syndrome where i feel like it‚Äôs not valid for me to experience the symptoms and struggles i have cause im not diagnosed. it feels insensitive for me to say i have bpd cause its not on paper.

1,"Depending on where you live getting a diagnosis can be the first step to getting more appropriate help. For example some DBT course providers may only reserve places on their treatment lists for people diagnosed with a personality disorder. Having a diagnosis also allows you to claim disability, or sickness benefits for your illness. Here in the UK I get a blue badge for disabled parking and I wouldn't have that unless I was disabled. Sometimes people need extra help and that help is reserved for people with medically recognised issues only. 

You can't guarantee what the reaction to BPD will be but if you identify with the condition it is definitely worthwhile pursuing if you think that you need the help. Sometimes getting that confirmation can give people a lot of peace of mind. I haven't had a bad experience or noticed much stigma and everyone thats worked with me has shown me a lot of empathy for my personality disorder. Having the diagnosis also helps my mental health team understand my issues and they can communicate things to me easier. When things are bad for me they know how to validate me and avoid making things worse and also have passed on my information to out of hours crisis services. They can better contextualise my emotions when they are difficult and because they know BPD is a very overwhelming condition are now able to accomdate my situational needs like sometimes needing extra time to talk about my feelings. Without getting my diagnosis I think the people trying to help me would be more confused about my behaviour and I wouldn't get treated like I have a serious problem. This way I feel like im taken seriously and im not being dramatic or making things up, I am recognised for having a hard time when those hard times come. If I didn't get diagnosed I wouldn't have been able to start getting better or make changes in my life to make my day to day living manageable.",Huntrinity,16p63ps
2,[deleted],,16p63ps
3,"I had this exact experience!! They all brush it off, it's because they feel the disorder can make the person feel stigmatized, or insulted because of the name, but also because once it's on your record it's very hard to remove.

Some therapists think it's almost ""better off not knowing"" or it's ""not necessary"" to have the label, that only the treatment/ recovery matters. I kept going on at them about it but was dismissed for like 5 years. Either because ""I was too young"" or whatever. I finally saw a psychiatrist recently and got my diagnosis this Monday just gone. I feel so much more validated now. Much more secure.

They do this a lot. If you want a diagnosis then tell them straight up and ask for a psychiatrist. You really have to persist about an evaluation. If you think it'll make you feel better, it will.",Worldly_Worry2149,16p63ps
4,"You can try getting the DBT book from the library or a free share pdf and start reading and implementing the skills.  They are awesome life skills anyway. The sub r/DBTskills has good info too.

5,"What for? If you are asking you probably don‚Äôt need it. 

BPD gets better within age for most of the people. You can go trough DBT to regulate your emotions better, but the risk of suicidal or reckless behaviour won‚Äôt disappear, people still act antisocially even after they are no longer diagnosed with BPD",Active-Tea-4979,16p63ps

7,"I honestly might make an evaluation and see. Partially I just feel so hopeless, I‚Äôve begged so much for help and I get such superficial responses that I feel like it would be the same with getting diagnosed with BPD. I guess I don‚Äôt know until it gets diagnosed and addressed.

My last therapist changed jobs and after one session with a new therapist she immediately dismissed all my long standing diagnoses. I spiraled and was in ruin for weeks just because of that. I felt so invalidated and unreal.",chexmexxx,16p63ps

I‚Äôm gonna look around for a good psychiatrist and just get an evaluation. I even went to the psych hospital voluntarily because it go so bad a couple weeks ago and left four hours later with nothing. They couldn‚Äôt do anything for me and that was even more depressed it made me spiral more like I was incapable of being helped.",chexmexxx,16p63ps
11,I honestly might look more into that! Thank you. I was just doing CBT and EDMR but issue with that is my therapist left the clinic and even while I was with her everything was always going to shit so we could never even get to reprocessing because I was always in crisis. I might give DBT a try.,chexmexxx,16p63ps
12,"I do understand the fear you express, I've thought about it a little bit and you could write down a list to take to your appointment with all the reasons you could be BPD, and all the reasons for not having BPD. For each symptom on the 9 criteria list write down how long you have been experiencing each of them, so you can really break down your information and make it as easy as possible for the mental health professionals you'll see to understand alot more without necessarily having to try and remember it all in order in conversation. This will show to others you have considered things, and it can help to explain that you have come this conclusion after your experiences feeling like you're not moving forward with your recovery.

I hope your push ends with what you want, and that you feel more like you have a set of next steps as compared to before. There's light at the end of the tunnel and if you don't get diagnosed there are still free BPD resources online like workbooks for Dialectical Behavioural Therapy. All the best :)",Huntrinity,16p63ps
13,"I see that it would validate you a lot to have the diagnosis, same as me- do you also find yourself making things worse for yourself so they have to listen? There's no harm in straight up telling them that either. I did tell my therapist that if I don't get a diagnosis I just think I'm making it up, being dramatic, and all the unhealthy things I'd do in retaliation to cope with that invalidation. It's frustrating that a massive trigger for us is invalidation yet we're constantly invalided in the therapeutic field without a clear cut diagnosis.

Definitely do find a decent psychiatrist, I hope you get your diagnosis and some security from it! I hate that it takes such a long time to get it, but I promise you it is possible and you won't be treated like this forever.",Worldly_Worry2149,16p63ps

I just kinda sat there staring at a wall for the rest of the meeting, I had suspicions about having BPD but being officially diagnosed was wild.

I literally flipped out. I got angry, I was in denial the entire day. I cried and cried and cried. 

Next day, I read the paperwork 4 times over before I was able to admit that it was probably true. And then I felt guilt, and embarrassment. 

Back in the day, they used to portray Bipolar people as monsters on TV. There were so many horror stories about bipolar people on TV, and I was worried to be labeled, so I felt a heavy weight being put on my shoulders with the diagnoses.

9,"My diagnosis was very bittersweet. 
I've struggled with my mental health since age 14, I am now 26 and was diagnosed earlier this year. It took me years and having to threaten my own life for someone to take me seriously. I always knew I had some form of personality disorder as antidepressants never worked for me, but when she said BPD after talking to me for just under 2 hours I was shocked, it felt like the floor was pulled from under me. It was the one condition I knew nothing about. I still feel a bit weird about it, but I now take the 'It is what it is' approach. 

With this in mind, I finally feel like my emotions are validated, and I'm not just 'overly sensitive' as I have been told countless times among other things and the medication seems to be working for me. 
Researching BPD was difficult, and I still haven't done too much reading about it. Most of what I could find online seemed to be very opinion-based, biased, and just negative. This did give me a lot of anxiety. 
But the information I did find was helpful, and I can understand more as to why this diagnosis made sense.

I totally understand that. I don‚Äôt think therapy is always what someone needs right away. I think therapy works best when you want it to.
But if you ever really struggle with BPD and how it affects relationships/life I say don‚Äôt cancel it out as an option. A good therapist will know how to help without having to prod and force you to talk about things you don‚Äôt want to!

as for ur fear of ending up like ur mother, u should know that u can stop generational trauma. we can all stop trauma, if we choose to end it with us. it is a choice to want to get better, to be better than those who have hurt u in the past. it‚Äôs only through learning from people‚Äôs, more specifically our parents‚Äô mistakes that we get to understand what is right and wrong. so OP, being afraid is okay. but at the same time, remember that we all understand u here, we are not the same, but in many ways we are. u are understood and u are allowed to feel the way that u do. u will learn so much in the future about urself, just never forget to keep fighting for urself ‚ô°",ClickPuzzleheaded610,1b58js9

A diagnosis shouldn't change your future, at least not in the major ways. (I'm still a college student earning my degree, but now I get some help from my university's disability resource center.)

3,"I'm self diagnostiqued for now. I can't get a diagnostic and I don't even know if it's really well know in my country.

I think ""blind"" self diagnostic is dangerous : just using relatable feeling of other people who have it to decide if you have. Because it can be a loooot of other things, even more so with bpd who overlap a lot with other disorder.

I think ""thoughtful"" self diagnostic can be useful (Aka really doing research on it, reading medical paper, check it with other crossed disorder in the DSM-5, ect). I use that self diagnostic for two things : 1) reminding me that I'm not crazy, and I can change 
2) help me ""see"" patterns and problems in my behaviour to correct them.

I don't say I have bpd because I don't have a diag and I don't want to feel invalidating or create trouble, but there is a thing with people clamming they have it on self diagnostic in my country (since bpd isn't well know, there's not as much stigma, and it's like autism being a ""cool/quirky thing to have"", which is bullshit).

I don't want attention and was denying bpd even being a possibility for a good while... thing is I've had enough relationships go south, fit 8/9 of the criteria... I don't owe my whole experience but I've taken the time to look into the disorder, interact with and understand people that are diagnosed... looked into the disorders that are often confused with bpd like bipolar or adhd... and though I could have like adhd, allowing myself the explaination of having bpd has helped me. I don't tell people irl, even most people I know online don't know... I still fear the stigma and don't want to be diagnosed knowing how invalidated people with a diagnosis or looking for one often are by doctors and other people... (and it's insanely expensive and my parents don't believe in mh enough to help)... 

to condense this... I don't think self diagnosis is bad... and can be helpful in understanding yourself and getting resources you may need... but I don't think this needs to be public info and making it public... especially with that little amount of research makes it seem like she's just seeking attention or trying to excuse her behavior in some way... I don't think you can convince her to not self-diagnose... you could present her with other possibilities and if she comes back with 5 more disorders (self-dxed) at least you know it isn't real though...",realbedo,1926oal
5,"Mental health can be complicated and diagnosis is a tricky process. 

I'd say the advertising it on social media is a bit odd and kinda inappropriate, but my feelings on self diagnosis are a bit mixed at the moment. I feel that since many mental health symptoms are indicators of multiple different disorders, it's not the best to claim you have something for certain without seeing a professional. It's possible for the symptoms to be genuine, but fixating on one potential cause may cause you to ignore other explanations or conditions.

But at the same time, sometimes it takes seeing yourself in the symptoms to seek out a path that gets you proper help. And in some edge cases it may be fairly obvious what an individual's possible disgnosis is. But I personally tend to err on the side of caution and only go as far to say I suspect I have a condition. 

Though while I say that, I did eventually drop my suspicions about my BPD and just started saying I had it after several voiced suspicions, the first being from a person living with the diagnosis, the others being professionals. I only just recently found out that a BPD diagnosis was put into my medical record a year and a half ago and nobody told me. I found out on my own when looking through them.

it‚Äôs the ‚Äúhave‚Äù for me. If someone is saying they HAVE bpd compared to ‚Äúmaybe i have‚Äù or ‚Äúi think i have‚Äù pushes limits for me.

Basically, the MBT therapy included an assessment at first to make sure you had the diagnoses ‚Äùrequired‚Äù for MBT. I did. The diagnosis was made after about 6 sessions where we went through my history of mental health issues and i took a bunch of tests and forms and talked a LOT with the psychologist in charge of assessing me.

In order to better understand mental health diagnoses I often watch videos by Psych2Go on YouTube. I really like the format of the videos as they are informative but also compassionate. It‚Äôs helped me better understand myself and loved ones with different diagnoses. So I‚Äôd suggest maybe looking at some of those. I really like lots of videos featuring clinical psychologist Dr Ramani as I find she does a good job at explaining where diagnoses come from and how they affect people. 

Resources I‚Äôve found helpful are DBT workbooks and DBT sessions they really help me to emotionally regulate.

I do agree that placing value on educating oneself (further) on diagnosis as well as the condition that one claims they have is very important. My personal resources for learning about BPD were some medical articles and BorderlinerNotes (which is a YouTube channel made by a person with BPD, dedicated to making content on BPD and it mainly consists of interviewing patients as well as psychiatrists and mental health professionals acquainted with the condition. You may have stumbled across an interview with Charlotte, their most well-known patient, in fact: [https://youtu.be/MpMHl4Hby0I?si=FCM5zBBh4XCcNfMI](https://youtu.be/MpMHl4Hby0I?si=FCM5zBBh4XCcNfMI) ). Dr. Daniel Fox is also really good. I do occasionally follow content from other sources as well, though, like Psych2Go and MedCircle <3

But I shall check out some DBT workbooks and sessions too \^\^

May I ask, though, how did the diagnosis go for you (you can keep it vague if you want to)? Did you have trouble remembering certain examples when asked for personal experience concerning the symptoms? How many examples were you asked to list (if that's how it works at all)? How did you personally remember everything you wanted to say during diagnosis? I think this is where the mood tracker idea came into mind; that it may 'prove' that I am indeed unstable (at least from an emotional standpoint), which seems to be a more accurate and impartial (when done right though?) way of assessing and even, confirming my theories, instead of having to rely solely on my memory (I'm not going through therapy at the moment, rather psychological counselling, and I do remember my counselor telling me that the brain has a tendency to create 'narratives', exaggerating on the impact or frequency of certain ideas and ignoring or dismissing any scenarios that may disprove them).

I hope you're content with the diagnosis, and I wish you a lot of success for your treatment. I think you should be proud of yourself for not only recognizing your issues as well as reaching out for help, but also for recognizing that your BPD is NOT you. There's more to us people than our conditions (though this may be hard to believe, I know), which a lot of the times were developed and not acquired.

To answer your questions:

May I ask, though, how did the diagnosis go for you (you can keep it vague if you want to)? 

My diagnosis came about whilst being an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital. My diagnosis was made following observations, mood tracking and talking therapies. I think what made my doctor think I may have BPD was the following symptoms impulsive behaviour, long standing moods, quickly switching between positive and negative, shifting self image, anger management issues and a black and white mindset. My diagnosis also came about after detailing the neglect I faced as a child and the CPTSD I developed after witnessing and being subjected to violence. 

Did you have trouble remembering certain examples when asked for personal experience concerning the symptoms?

Yes I did have trouble remembering certain times and dates that I showed my symptoms however my parents were also asked about my behaviours so they gave examples. I also gave examples over a number of weeks so there was less pressure to remember examples in one session. 

 How many examples were you asked to list (if that's how it works at all)?

When I described my week to my doctors I had to say how the week had gone and what I‚Äôd felt during the week and give examples. So one week I was extremely irritable so I gave examples that I‚Äôd have to hide away in my room to stop my anger from exploding. Another week I was extremely euphoric and thought I was amazing and I was very bubbly and erratic so I was always cracking jokes and causing trouble. Again I was an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital so they could also monitor these moods for me through observing me and me engaging in talking therapies. 

How did you personally remember everything you wanted to say during diagnosis? 

Some weeks when I met with the doctor, psychiatrist and psychologist I didn‚Äôt remember every point which is why after a few weeks I made sure to write down everything I wanted to say. I think for you a mood tracker would be great to show your emotional disregulation and help with your diagnosis.",Ill_Orange_9054,1caa2b5

If you can‚Äôt afford therapy google ‚ÄúDBT skills workbook Marsha Linehan PDF‚Äù and you can download a manual with the therapeutic skills that are taught to people with BPD. That can be really helpful. 

Also professionals are often reluctant to diagnose BPD its a stigmatising disorder, especially if you are under the age of 21.

I'm of the opinion that arguments from authority often don't make sense... and to truly get a diagnosis what you actually need is objective awareness of the criteria and where you fit.  

Ask yourself. ""What is a diagnosis?""  It is really just a way for us to classify something that is intangible.  It is a concept we have created once we have observed a grouping of symptoms that manifest... the root cause of which is still being explored. 

IMO... what ultimately matters most is NOT the diagnosis, but your **management of the symptoms**.  You wouldn't be here unless you had some symptoms.

People give those with mental illness shit for not trusting medical professionals... but it is typically because we have seen just how messed up the people can be... especially when people start playing ""telephone"" with fine details that are critical towards getting an accurate diagnosis.  Lots of doctors fill in the blanks with imaginary details and they don't even realize it.  They ASSuME.

When you commit to the real and reality, when you commit to awareness and nonjudgment, when you choose kindness, patience, compassion, understanding, when you gain insight and soften your reactions and notice what is alive in you and in others, and when you break that alienation from self, from others, from society and from your purpose, and you take the risk to connect, and you acknowledge the fear and you remember that it's okay to feel.

1,"It's just your negative BPD thoughts taking over, not psychosis. You're catastrophizing. It's called a cognitive distortion, and it's extremely common in BPD. You can definitely learn to push back or challenge these distortions (without antipsychotics). You can learn some DBT methods online or in DBT therapy. It's very helpful for most with BPD. For example, one way to fight a cognitive distortion is ""fact checking"", also mindfulness and radical acceptance. If you study up on these and other DBT methods, I think you'll acquire better tools to provide yourself with some much needed reassurance. It does take time, patience with yourself, and much dedication to learning and practicing the skills, but It's well worth it. Dr. Jennifer May has a lot of DBT videos free on YouTube btw.

I could make up scenarios in which my boyfriend is cheating until I'm crying my eyes out.",EpitaFelis,y1wtsb
3,"What many people don't know about Borderline is that it's called Borderline because when it was discussed, back when the now disputed concept of neurosis was universally used, the person with borderlin symptoms meant they were on the edge of neurosis and psychosis.

Which I normally explained to people as creating an entirety reality in my head about a feeling I have even though rationnally I am extremely aware it is just that, a scenario. However, this scenario I created then create even more negative feeling that trigger the neurotic symptoms (anxiety, etc...). I hope this helps make sense of the symptoms.",marsupialsi,y1wtsb
4,"I can relate 100%. I feel like Jekyll and Hyde (I don‚Äôt know if I spelled that correctly, lol). Things are good, I love and appreciate my partner, I can‚Äôt imagine him cheating on me and have no jealousy. Then there is this other part of me that sometimes gets triggered by random things and comes out and strings together ‚Äúsings‚Äù and ‚Äúevents‚Äù and create these conspiracy theories where I am 100% convinced he has been cheating and it becomes all consuming like an obsession. The feelings and convictions are like a tsunami, so strong - it‚Äôs almost like acid burning my insides and being a human pressure cooker and the only way to get relief is to throw some scene, accuse and act completely childish and mortifying, in ways I don‚Äôt even recognize myself. I am an intelligent and very rational person in every other areas of my life. I don‚Äôt even believe in confronting and none of my behaviors make sense to me when I am in that state. It‚Äôs like another person is doing those things while I watch in horror and despair. When I am in that state, I am 100% convinced I am right. When I am not, I am 100% convinced I am wrong and he is not cheating (and for the record, I reality tested most of my suspicions that I was totally convinced of and I literally have physical, unequivocal evidence it was all me and my paranoia is completely unfounded). It‚Äôs a scary thing because it‚Äôs almost like a demon possessed you and you are so helpless and ashamed even while it‚Äôs happening, but it‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt control it. I would recommend you looking into DBT chain analysis. That helped me. Also, to write affirmations and reminders to yourself about. Here are some of mine:

- Be kind to yourself- the feeling is normal 
- Do not act - if you can occupy yourself just for 15 minutes, then another - rewiring  amygdala 
- If he is cheating, there is literally zero you can do to stop it or control it - nothing in life is certain 
- Remember how bad and icky you felt about yourself each time you acted on the urges and behaved excessively. It only lead to shame and more pain and accomplished nothing 
- How much it pushed him away and how terrible that made you feel 
- And if he doesn't want to be with me, then he doesn't. I love him more than anything right now, but my self worth is much more important than a guy.
- Trust is fluid - people do untrustworthy things sometimes but it doesn‚Äôt make them bad people.
-  You have done too - don‚Äôt judge people by worst mistakes 
- Jealousy is just as perilous in the long run as cheating itself 
- Issue is not whether he cheats or not  but knowing I will be ok anyway - think of the peace you had single and that even though it‚Äôs going to hurt and suck for a while you have always found a way
- At the end of the day, he choose me as his girlfriend 
- Treat him with kindness, see the good in him
- Think of how empowering it will be to have better control and a different reaction 
- Think of all the useful things you can do instead of interrogating/freaking out/analyzing 
- Even if he is cheating, it‚Äôs much better for me to stay calm and focus on other fun and productive things and on my life. Getting upset, trying to over analyze  and questioning him accomplishes nothing and leads to nowhere other than upsetting myself, making it hard to sleep etc.
- Live your life, stay open to experiences and have him be a slice but not all of life
- Let go of control
- It‚Äôs ok to bring up some of it to him but do it kindly, calmly and with empathy  

- Breathe through your feelings . I am safe, I am ok, my basic needs are met right now. Even if not all of them I am resourceful and will find a way
- Look at cute text messages from him
- Remember this discomfort may be hard to sit with but it can and will settle down if you can wait it out. If you don‚Äôt, it will result in much greater and longer lasting pain and consequences 
- Read his cards to you/keepsakes, sweet moments together 
- Cold on face",Lilith_314,y1wtsb
5,"This is a symptom. I'm 41. Have been dealing with BPD since I was teen. Well.. likely longer or just diagnosed as a teen but ya get what I mean..

However yes. We are ""story tellers"" of other peoples thoughts and actions. Weather they were actually thinking/doing said actions or not... They did it.. They really did... At least I think they did.. Pretty sure they did.. Did they???

I have to hold back my emotions and feelings and remember to ""talk it out"" let my wife know I'm feeling such a way. Sometimes instead of talking it out she'll get mad at me for how I'm acting and instead talking out my feelings I end up just getting more mad and more rash in my actions like start driving faster... 

Do your DBT or which ever tools you use. Don't forget they are there. The more often I practice staying positive and squash the story telling the easier it gets. Granted even after years of therapy and tool building my ""alter"" still comes out.

Do you have 2 mindsets? The mindset that is you that lives your daily life and then there is the you that likes to get lost in thought and feel angry. Then when someone talks to you while you are all pumped up and angry you let lose on them later regretting your actions. If you've experienced something like this, say hello to your alter. 

My years of dealing with this, anti-psychotics are fun but honestly make life worse for me. I get this mindset where I'm better with them. Then when they wear off and I don't have more I go deeper in to a well of negativity. I've learned it's better to learn to deal with my emotions and feelings without the meds.

He doesn't pick up anyone to carpool, and my head was like ""There's a woman there he's seeing.""

22,"This is emotional reasoning. You feel something happened, therefore it did",winethough,y1wtsb
23,"The more disturbed, or the stronger the feeling and emotions are the farther your mind drifts from reality. You see and perceive everything that‚Äôs happening in that moment in a way far from whats true. Various factors from BPD and anxiety (if you have) make you create fake scenarios and you believe them, in other words you deceive yourself to self sabotage. Usually when this happens you end up making something, or at least thinking of something impulsive. 

There is something called chain analysis in psychology. It‚Äôs a way to analyze this crisis‚Äô and what‚Äôs causing them, although it might not work every time since BPD is very volatile and sometimes you really don‚Äôt have a reason to do said things, it helps you understand how your mind works in these situations. It goes like this: 

Vulnerability-Prompting Event-Links-Problem Behavior-Consequences

Now I‚Äôll explain what each means exactly. 

Vulnerability: This refers to an inside factor that makes you more vulnerable and more sensitive to emotions. This is different for everyone, it could be things like being Tired, Hungry, Being alone all day, A recent argument, Or a recurring sad or angry thought (like a passed away relative, or memories from a traumatic event) 

Prompting Event: This is and inside factor that triggers the rest of the chain, leading to impulsiveness to do the Problem Behavior. Most of the times it‚Äôs a thought that makes you feel a strong emotion like Shame, Anger, or Sadness. Since you are under a Vulnerability (most of the time) it is easier for emotions to escalate, drawing your consciousness and critical thinking farther from reality. People with BPD and other illnesses take this farther and one‚Äôs own mind extends these thoughts and creates fake scenarios. 

Links: These are past factors that could explain the reason of both the Prompting Event and the Problem Behavior. Like childhood trauma, or grief. For example the passing of a relative, or abuse. 

Problem Behavior: As the name implies is the behavior, or impulse that is harming to you. It can range from being rude or toxic, to drug abuse and self harm, or even quitting a job or ending a relationship. 

Consequences: These are two factors, short and long term consequences. Where the short term (immediately) consequence is positive and brings relief, and the long term brings damage and almost always, regret. 
For a Problem Behavior be one, it has to have these two factors. 
For example, drug abuse can cause relief and relaxation or distraction from the situation in the short term, but long term it can cause a variety of problems ranging from doing harm to your body, developing addictions, and harming emotionally your relatives and driving them away in some cases. 

You can look up ‚ÄúChain Analysis‚Äù and find a more in depth explanation, this is what I learned from a type of therapy specific for BPD, called DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy)

I would HIGHLY recommend either finding a DBT therapy near you, or at least practice this every time something like this happens. You just write everything down to analyze it. Then you see what you can do to prevent the Problem Behavior to occur",Goriate,y1wtsb
24,"Thank you all, hearing your kind words and knowing I'm not alone in this, is wonderful. I spent a lot of my life thinking I was all by myself in the hellscape that is in my head. I joined this sub last night and I feel glad to know I have people to turn to when no one else understands. 

Ahh, thanks guys.",tacehtg20,y1wtsb
25,"People with BPD are known to experience delusions under periods of extreme stress (it's called borderline because we're considered on the border between psychotic and neurotic ... A terrible name imo but I digress). It doesn't mean that you have a psychotic or dissociative disorder. It's a normal symptom, sadly. I experience it a lot too and it sucks -- the only thing that has worked is just trying to ride out the alternate reality for longer and longer each time. I started out with just a few minutes and now my record is not freaking out on my bf for multiple weeks! It is a long process with no shortcuts.

But the dissociation, feeling like someone else is experiencing it, and having delusions are all part of the BPD deal. I don't think you should be concerned on a medication level (though definitely talk to your doc if you trust them) -- therapy is better for this in my experience because it really is about just fighting back. I was put on antipsychotics So Much when I didn't need to be and I think it really messed with my development. Some people with BPD do function better with them but I don't think that's unequivocally the solution here.

I'm sorry I don't have better advice but it is normal and it can get better.

Anytime I'm outside away from the house I feel like I've done something wrong and I have to go home or I'm going to get in trouble or something bad will happen. My yard is ok and can sort of walk around the neighborhood. Also if I'm at the office or someplace I'm supposed to be like a doctor appt that seems ok.... Grocery store? Nope.. Standing in lines? Heck no..  
I've not taken anti-psychs in such a long time. I just know from my experience they are a ""temporary"" solution. The idea I guess is to calm you down > fix your head > take you off drugs. Not really sure if calm is the right feeling... Been a while.... 

I remember going on meds, ""graduating"" therapy coming off meds and I had a few freak out moments. Would act up, say stuff, realize later I made a fool/ass of myself and head goes back in to that dark space and all the while I'm rethinking of the therapy and how I acted, figure out what caused me to be like such, think of how to handle it better next time when i feel such a way, then I'll forget all about it till next time. So next time I feel that emotion... I'll act the same way and be like UGGG I should have done XYZ or said XYZ to validate/verify my feelings before acting/saying such things. 

Yet all the while I'd remember those meds and how they chilled me out, I handled myself better but I was just slow while on them. Mentally slow.. So I wasn't myself.. 

I'd rather be myself and do my best to control my feelings and emotions than be a drone. 

These days I just remind myself, stay positive, can't make everyone happy, who gives a fluff what others are thinking (<< BIG ONE), stay positive, never be afraid to walk away, ALWAYS talk my feelings out and don't let them fester even if it feels silly (I still fail to do this but this usually is key to not making a scene.) Stay positive, it's ok to not feel ok sometimes, if I catch myself thinking of the past or future, stop.. Last but not least.. stay positive cuz WHY THE FLUFF IS IT SO HARD TO STAY POSITVE???? LOL Also if others tell you you are being selfish, unresonable, a douch, pretty much anything, its' time to stop and do a self evaluation  << do lots of those. 

It may not be from a doctor or therapist but these are my own rules I can remember that I keep coming back to that work for me.

I do this for my wife and kid who have endured much. And for me of course.

Your feelings are valid. Your past feelings, your feelings now, your future feelings. No matter how big or small, your feelings are valid. And you reacted and did things the best way you knew how with the tools you had. My psychiatrist explained it to me as having little to no emotional skin. And when you think of it that way, as like being a third degree burn victim who is constantly getting bumped into and then being scolded for saying ‚ÄúOw! You hurt me!‚Äù? Uh yeah, you acted pretty rationally give the reality of your feelings.

So now you have more information. Now you know you don‚Äôt have skin and you can get help to get more skin or at least get help on managing the pain while you try to grow more skin.

You're right. Things are not okay. _Right now._

Don't worry about the diagnosis. You said it yourself, you _have_ BPD. You are _not_ BPD. All Borderline Personality Disorder is, is three words put together to name a group of symptoms and behaviours that you already had this whole time! Now you just know what it's called.

It's common for BPD to be misdiagnosed as bipolar. While symptoms can be similar, the cause (as we currently understand) is very different.

Bipolar is usually caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. BPD shows no direct correlation to an imbalance. It's a personality/behavioral/psychological issue (there has been some mentions of a genetic predisposition). Giving someone without bipolar those meds can negatively affect their brain chemistry. This can lead to other detrimental side effects. It does not address the pwBPD's symptoms and underlying issues.

An inpatient put me on an antipsychotic because they believed I had BD. It did not help my mood swings and caused side effects. 

Medication is often prescribed for either co-occuring disorders (anxiety, depression) or to help with symptoms of BPD but that doesn't treat the cause of BPD. The primary treatment for BPD is therapy (DBT).

Also, it is possible to have BPD and bipolar.",fadinghumanity,rrm47h

Secondly, there definitely is a stigma with this disorder. A lot of people make assumptions about you when they find out you have BPD. We can be treated quite harshly. But I try not to let that bother me. All I can do is focus on my treatment, take my meds like I'm supposed to, and do my best to heal. The haters will always be there and sometimes they'll be loud. But I don't have to listen to them.

Now as far as my experience with BPD, I was diagnosed about a decade ago. It's been rough. This disorder has absolutely wrecked my life and my relationships. It's turned me into a hollow shell of a human. It has me questioning whether or not I actually *am* human sometimes. But through all of that, there have been gifts that have come with it. It's given me a heightend sense of empathy that allows me to connect with people and love them deeply. It fuels my creativity and my art. I'm learning to appreciate the way this disorder makes me see the world. I'm learning to not hate myself and begin to love myself. So yeah that's my BPD in a nutshell.

The stigma is what is making it really difficult because I‚Äôve heard the stigma that people with BPD are abusive. It makes me feel like the abuse that my ex partner put me through is my fault. It makes me feel like I couldn‚Äôt possibly have been abused and mistreated because I have BPD. Being told that I‚Äôm emotionally unstable also makes me feel like my feelings aren‚Äôt valid.

2,"First of all, the abuse you've been through will never be your fault. Know that in your heart.

Fuck the stigma. People with BPD are not monsters. We're not inherently abusive. We're not automatically the problem just because we have this disorder. We went through severe trauma that we didn't deserve, and it altered our brains and our ability to emotionally regulate. But that doesn't mean we're broken beyond repair or that we're worthless, nor does it mean that our feelings are invalid. We may have to do more work to control our emotions and our thoughts, but that's okay. 

All the work you've done to be a calm, kind, and caring person *does* matter. It's good. Keep doing that work. You're on the right path. 

There are a lot of things that help me manage my BPD. I've been through DBT and there a lot of skills I picked up to emotionally regulate. I highly recommend looking into DBT if you haven't already. It's tailor-made for this disorder. It works.

Beyond DBT, taking my meds on time and every day helps me out a lot. I'm on a combination of Prozac and Risperidone and it's a powerful combination that keeps my emotions and my anger in check. It can be hard to treat this disorder with meds but it helps me.

I also dive head first into my creativity like I mentioned. I write. I'm kicking around a few short stories, a novel, and I'm always writing poems. Having a creative outlet really helps.

I also have spiritual practices I do that help a lot. I meditate. I pray. That helps too.

So yeah those are some the things I do to manage my BPD.

If you're ever struggling, you can always reach out to me. I'll do my best to listen. I remember how scary it was when I first got diagnosed. It helps us to not do this alone.",thuskindlyiscatter,1bw0yxu

1,"Thank you so much. 

I do think that‚Äôs the word I‚Äôm looking for but I guess I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs a thing for other people with this disorder as well? 

I did some research and it seems like the science is back and forth but the general consensus is that BPD does cause varying levels of executive dysfunction at times. So, I‚Äôm just wondering if that‚Äôs something that all people with BPD experience *all the time*, or if it‚Äôs just something that happens when you‚Äôre, say, having an ‚Äúepisode‚Äù, if that makes sense? 
Personally, I feel like I do exhibit the symptoms of BPD all the time, but some days are significantly more stressful and unstable than others (like today). So is this disorder similar to, say, bipolar or schizophrenia? Just as far as some days being ‚Äúokay‚Äù and other days when you‚Äôre having an ‚Äúepisode‚Äù, or whatever I‚Äôm trying to label this here, being a complete dissociative disaster? 

I should also apologize. Like I said, this is all very new to me and I‚Äôm sure my therapist and I will get to it eventually, but I just have so many questions in the meantime. I really appreciate everyone here being so patient and helpful.",yogi_medic_momma,17wuv1x

I get very couch-locked. Sitting for minutes or hours. Screaming at myself in my head sometimes to just. Do. Something. This needs to be done. Or do that thing you like, anything. But I just cannot move. It's difficult to hold onto the thoughts, too. Everything gets lost in too much noise.

At any rate, _do_ talk about this with your therapist. It is uncommon for BPD to be diagnosed on its own. There is usually another disorder or illness co-existing. There are many people here who have ADHD co-morbid with BPD. I imagine they are very familiar with something like executive dysfunction.",DeadWrangler,17wuv1x

I also had a lot of negative stigma in my head about BPD (literally felt like I just couldn‚Äôt be diagnosed with Raging Bitch Disorder so they settled on BPD). Fighting the diagnosis wasn‚Äôt very conducive to me improving my situation though. I definitely believe if you want a second opinion that‚Äôs valid, but I never felt it was wrong, I just hated it and didn‚Äôt want it and honestly, I just wanted something with a faster, easier treatment plan. It had all to do with me not wanting to work on deep issues and wanting a quick fix. 

However, after years of challenging and arguing with nearly every mental health professional I‚Äôve come across, a psych who I argued about it to broke it down and explained it in a way that made me feel better. He was the first person to really give me time and help me understand why it wasn‚Äôt a bad thing. 

He basically told me ‚ÄúAlright. What about we go through the criteria together?‚Äù So he did and I belligerently agreed and even exclaimed that I KNOW it looks like I have it on paper, but that it‚Äôs not true (I was very much upset about it still). And he explained, ‚ÄúWell, seeing that you meet the criteria, I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôd be beneficial to remove this diagnosis. Really, all this is is a list of troubles to be worked on and dealt with. While you still need to heal and work on these things, I think it‚Äôs worth keeping in your chart.‚Äù 

He made it clear that it wasn‚Äôt a death sentence or a FOREVER thing; it‚Äôs a roadmap of problems to tackle. With proper treatment and a ton of effort, you CAN put your BPD into remission! That‚Äôs been my goal ever since that conversation. Now that I‚Äôm working on myself and my symptoms are, while present, less suffocating, I don‚Äôt feel shame about having BPD anymore. Everyone has problems and weaknesses, and these happen to be mine. I‚Äôm blessed in many other areas that others struggle with as well.

But after having time to process it, I realized that having some answers, even if I didn‚Äôt necessarily like them, was to me better than having no answers. I was suffering a lot and I had no idea why or what I could do about it. I felt hopeless, crazy and alone.

I know that you might feel a bit conflicted about being ‚Äúlabelled‚Äù, I honestly still do, but in my case, I know that being diagnosed really improved things.

13,"this isn't helpful. the whole point of getting your bpd diagnosis is starting a process of learning about your emotions and mental processes and getting to a place where you can take responsibility for your actions. 

btw, idk who was diagnosing 'a bunch of 15 year old girls' but that sounds like malpractice imo. while adolescent bpd is a thing, it's rare and shouldn't be diagnosed unless the pt is experiencing extreme symptoms. i find it highly unlikely that a 'bunch of 15 year old girls' at your high school had bpd. in teens, a lot of the bpd criteria can be attributed to normal teenage emotional turbulence and depression, that most people grow out of.

0,"I‚Äôll answer your questions in order, I am on mobile so sorry I‚Äôm advance for the formatting.

The signs for me: black and white thinking ESPECIALLY surrounding other people, serious emotional instability, difficulty managing and maintaining personal relationships, constant suicidal ideation, and the disturbed sense of self/identity. 

Getting diagnosed: I was in therapy at 19, suggested I might have it to my therapist and was immediately dismissed. I stopped seeing that therapist and didn‚Äôt go back to therapy for 8 years. My current therapist diagnosed me within the first 3 sessions. I didn‚Äôt fill out any question sheet, they just asked me some questions after I explained what I was going through
I spoke to my psychiatrist about that diagnosis and they agreed based on a few questions they asked me. 
This will really depend on the specific psychiatrist or therapist you are seeing. 

I think getting help is the most important thing. For some people, a diagnosis means nothing, some therapists even think this way, and don‚Äôt really bother diagnosing (except for the purpose of insurance) they just want to propose solutions to the problems
For some people (like me) a diagnosis is very helpful. It lets me categorize thoughts and behaviors so I can better understand the solution. I approach therapy from a scientific POV so that makes it easier for me to ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù and actually implement solutions like new coping mechanisms and mindfulness.

Don‚Äôt be scared! You‚Äôre taking steps to get the help that you need. Regardless of any diagnosis, this is a big big step, that a lot of people never have the courage to take. You should be proud of yourself for taking this step, and working to improve your well being and your life!!",QuailBuddy,17y5x6z
1,"the signs for me; unstable self image, unstable relationships, impulsive decisions, self injury, FEAR OF ABANDONMENT and chronic feelings of emptiness.

2,"I've always been into psychology and I've always been aware of BPD but never felt like I fit the bill because my symptoms were never very outward facing. Then I stumbled on a video on youtube about 'quiet' type and had a realization moment. I did further research, finding symptom sheets and realizing that I was looking at myself in a list.

I've previously been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my early 20s, but I always felt like something else was going on. I asked my doctor for another eval with a psych. At 42 I was finally properly diagnosed. It was a video consultation, and he asked me a whole bunch of questions which I answered honestly.

I then found a therapist that specializes in BPD and DBT and it's truly changed my life.",geekdeevah,17y5x6z
3,"Hi! I was 20 when I got diagnosed and it's been 6 years since then. I'll give my answers in order as well: 

1. The signs: Explosive anger. Stomping everywhere, screaming, throwing punches at walls, and throwing things. When I was hospitalized at 17 they noted ""Crises de colere"" on my chart which means ""fits of rage. Recurrent suicial thoughts/behaviours, self-injurious behaviour, risky behaviour (sleeping around unsafely, drug abuse, driving recklessly), very unstable relationships and an absolutely crushing sense of emptiness. 
2. Getting diagnosed: I wasn't hospitalized after age 17, but had several attemps over the next few years. I saw my physician and a few psychologists here and there, DBT was recomended but I denied having any problem. At 19 after another attempt my doctor had me start filling out a lot of long questionnaires. She would not tell me what these were for other than ""mental health assessments."" These questions were mostly tracking my anger, anxiety, asked a lot about my relationships, friendships, and attachment to others, as well as my family history. The appointments were usually about an hour each, I would be asked questions about my drug habits, my emotions, etc. along with filling out assessments. After 4-5 appointments to fill out questionnaires and talk with my dr. over a couple of months, she told me I had many symptoms of Cluster B personality disorders, specifically BPD. 

It can definitely be daunting! I personally didn't know what BPD was when I was getting diagnosed, so I was kind of blind throughout the whole thing. I had come across BPD online at one point during the process and literally thought ""Well, it's definitely not that because then I would be really insane!"" but it turns out thats exactly what it was. 

Just try to be as honest as possible, and don't worry about being judged. I hid a lot of my issues and true emotions out of fear that my healthcare professionals would judge me for it, but most of them truly are there to help you out. Good luck!",rainbowlavalamp,17y5x6z
4,"My experience was a bit different to what others have wrote so far.

I wrote down where I believed it came from (traumatic and chaotic situations in childhood). She looked over it and asked me a bunch of questions.

2,"I have mixed feelings about self-diagnosis, but I'm from the US and BPD (known as EUPD in other countries) is diagnosed here, and I know it isn't diagnosed in some places.

BPD is nearly (if not absolutely) impossible to accurately self-diagnose due to how closely the symptoms overlap with other disorders (such as bipolar disorder, C-PTSD, autism, ADHD, etc.) I'm not sure how old you are, but literally everyone experiences a lot of the symptoms of BPD when they're in their early teens/going through puberty; that's why it's usually not diagnosed in people under 16 (and mostly only diagnosed when the person is 18+). 

In my mind, self-diagnosis is when you claim you absolutely do have an illness/disorder and/or tell other people you do. People who do this often try to invade spaces for those who have been diagnosed and try to speak on issues that pertain to that illness/disorder, even though they don't know for they have it and/or try to act like they know just as much (or more) than people who are diagnosed. That's not okay. 

Self-diagnosis is not saying things like ""I think I may have.."" ""I really relate to this, maybe I have it too"" or trying to educate yourself on whatever the illness/disorder is. There is nothing wrong with doing research and asking people who have been diagnosed questions in order to understand yourself better. Even if you don't have BPD, it can be beneficial to talk to people that do, since it's entirely possible that your symptoms are similar or the same.",,ypk51b

5,"I feel self diagnosis is dangerous, there's nothing wrong with looking into potential conditions and arriving at the conclusion of ""shit this could be me"" your doctor could do a little better than saying you're emotionally unstable.

I would say please keep pushing your doctor to refer you to someone for further investigations (if that's how things work where you are) even if they get tired of it, keep pushing. It took me a solid 6 or 7 years to get a diagnosis tbh after all the attempts at therapy and medication

It sucks having the diagnosis but knowing that it's confirmed is somewhat relieving because you know exactly what you're dealing with and you might find it easier to handle rather than wondering ""Is it, though?""",,ypk51b

I understand your frustration but it‚Äôs important to remember that the diagnosis is just a means to an end (especially a diagnosis so fuzzy and likely to change in its criteria as science progresses as BPD/EUPD). A diagnosis is simply a tool to determine proper treatment.

So not really that I fully self diagnosed but...take it for what it is worth.

I was horrified to think that I too had BPD.

I went to my therapist and asked her about it and she said ""Honey, people with BPD wouldn't be walking in here asking if they have it and how to get rid of it."" Her assessment was that I picked up on the same stress response behaviors that my mother exhibited since that's who raised me. I was also self-aware enough to see them as bad behaviors and over the years seek out new ways of responding. In my case, I probably would have been fully diagnosed many years ago but no longer have episodes. I no longer hate myself. I have deep connected and respectful relationships. I know who I am and I know my value.

 I still have the same triggers but they do not create a response in me like they used to. Sometimes they get me down but most of the time I can pull myself back and go to a bird's-eye view and see it for what it is, process and move on.

17,"i feel like there's a difference between self diagnosing and suspecting. i think what you're talking about is suspecting. 

self diagnosing (in my opinion) is looking up any disorder/illness for five minutes then saying ""yup i have that and no person or professional can tell me otherwise!""

suspecting is putting effort into researching it while also saying you aren't officially diagnosed with the disorder, but you suspect that you *may* have it.

i'm totally on board with people suspecting they have something and putting in research before seeing a professional, in fact i think it's great. i'm *personally* not okay with people who self diagnose, as well i'm less likely to take them seriously. i also think it really waters down the severity of BPD or any other disorder/illness in general and makes us who do have those disorders/illnesses look stupid, but i have no control over what other people do with their lives. 

suspecting you have something is totally okay as long as you don't say you're officially diagnosed. especially if you're currently unable to get access to professional help.",,ypk51b
18,"I self-diagnosed myself.  I'm schizoaffective and my psychiatrists really don't feel like taking the time to diagnose me.  Their philosophy is one diagnosis, good enough. I learned about borderline pd this year at age 43.  I first did some research online, eventually I opened the DSM5 and found I met 6 out of 9 of the criteria.  I was methodical and scientific.  I discussed it with my family and they said it really sounded like me.  I identify as the quiet borderline subtype as well.  My doctors rarely diagnose, I have several diagnosis that probably will never get done.",CaptainDustyRed,ypk51b
19,"Sort of. We (me and my psychiatrist) were studying the possibilities for my case. I enjoyed this task with him, and we were tending to BPD. At the time I was 18, so 2015. This year 2022 I was finally and formally diagnosed as a person living with BPD.",noirmoonstar,ypk51b
20,"Recently diagnosed, suspected having bpd for the last 3 years. In my experience self diagnosing tends to be right, bc looking through diagnostic criteria, reading articles, taking tests, studying diagnosed people experience, looking back to your life and observing your behavior currently makes a damn good research. 

Funny enough that I settled on not having bpd bc I don‚Äôt relate that much to bpd people‚Äôs experiences and was still diagnosed, possibly misdiagnosed, and now researching other variants. 

But if it makes a little too much sense, it‚Äôs probably it. I was completely, 100% sure I had ADHD and MDD before I was diagnosed with both. Diagnosis is not the most accurate thing in the world, the fact if it makes sense to you and if you believe it‚Äôs right is very important, so additional research isn‚Äôt going to make any harm. However a professional opinion matters too and while saying ‚ÄúI think I possibly have bpd‚Äù is completely fine, saying ‚ÄúI have bpd‚Äù without having a diagnosis could be harmful to both you and the community.",mecurtsum,ypk51b

22,"I think you have some super insightful perspectives on this. I don't know if I agree that it's nearly or entirely impossible to accurately self diagnose. While it's true that BPD symptoms overlap with a range of illnesses/disorders like ADHD, autism, Bipolar, etc. and you shouldn't just 100% say you have a disorder like this without confirmation, there are still some very notable differences and if someone is coming to the conclusion that they have BPD, especially as an adult who compares their symptoms to those in the DSM, I think we shouldn't put them down for it or assume they're making it up. I personally have thought that I've had BPD for a few years now, and basically had it confirmed when my mom was diagnosed last year and now in therapy my therapist seems to agree that it's BPD, but even getting to the point where I felt I could bring it up to a therapist was hard bc of everything I've read about self diagnosis and I felt invalidated bc someone didn't tell me directly this is what I have. To me it is way more harmful to tell someone that they don't have BPD bc they aren't professionally diagnosed, especially in the US. Health care is expensive, and seeing a therapist or psychiatrist is expensive even with good health insurance so expecting everyone to have that available to them is unrealistic :/ I just think it could be more harmful to tell someone that their experiences aren't valid just bc they don't yet have a professional diagnosis. Learning that you could have a mental disorder like this is the first step to getting better, and it impacts me exactly none if someone incorrectly self diagnoses themselves but still seeks help and gets a correct diagnosis. Assuming they aren't spreading misinformation or taking up spaces for the hell of it like you said, I don't see much harm in self diagnosis. Like you said people like us just want to get better and have support. I also wholeheartedly agree with your last paragraph üß°",cyd1997,ypk51b

There's usually trauma involved, burning through relationships, impulse control issues, ruminating issues, unhealthy levels of attachment/ dependence, and possibly addiction.

BPD is a whole other way of thinking, our perception is distorted and theres many things we don't even realise aren't ""normal"" or exclusive to us until we are told or taught otherwise. Self awareness is important to learn. If you have BPD but only being treated for a few of the symptoms like depression or anxiety, it won't help BPD. Personality disorders are notoriously difficult to treat because like Aspergers for example, its a neurological disorder and its something that stays with you and can't be treated with medications but rather managed by learning and how to behave differently. Im surprised theres nothing you can do about it medically even with everything we have in science today. It doesn't make sense and personality disorders are still new but not new enough to be so under studied. It scares many psychologists and alot dont offer to see patients with personalality disorders. I live in Chicago and there aren't any here (that take medicaid atleast) and its crazy cuz we have everything here so that really says something about the whole nation.

Symptoms can vary in intensity, BPD is like a fingerprint in that it‚Äôs different for everyone.

I think your symptoms have to meet a certain level of intensity to be classified as BPD, otherwise psychiatrists will probably just chalk it up to an unhealthy attachment style, depression, anxiety etc. We generally have a disturbingly low understanding of the disorder. 

There‚Äôs also the argument regarding certain types of BPD (quiet, self destructive, etc) which also holds pretty considerable weight.

**MANIPULATION IS NOT PART OF BPD** 

(sorry, its a huge pet peeve) and it makes me worried that the dr has no idea wtf he‚Äôs talking about it he thinks that‚Äôs part of it.

pwBPD are MUCH more likely to be victims of manipulation than the perpetrators. And if they are manipulative, it‚Äôs not part of BPD. 

Also, your symptoms don‚Äôt need to be ‚Äúextreme‚Äù they just need to be present. If you have at least 5 out of the 9 symptoms it doesn‚Äôt matter how ‚Äúextreme‚Äù they are, you qualify for a BPD diagnosis.

7,"Yeah, but that‚Äôs very surface level stuff from google. It‚Äôs what everyone THINKS BPD is. 

The problem is‚Ä¶ A lot of people associate threatening suicide as somehow a manipulation tactic‚Ä¶ 

But people with BPD mean it. In the moment they mean it. They want to die. They want to off themselves‚Ä¶ So we‚Äôve gotten labeled as manipulative because we often talk about suicide especially When our emotions are high and we‚Äôre arguing with people or we‚Äôve broken up with people‚Ä¶

People also just misunderstand what manipulation is in general. Everyone tries to get their way. Everyone is manipulative in one way or another. But that‚Äôs not true tactical or malevolent ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù.

And because of our typical extreme fear of abandonment we‚Äôre much more likely to act and say things that someone can see as manipulative.

True, but some people really try to cross your boundaries, doesn‚Äôt mean that they are BPD, or that non BPD people can‚Äôt behave the same. 

I see. See, I have unhealthy attachments, but I‚Äôm not really extreme in that.. like if someone wants to leave me I‚Äôm gonna panic and probably cry over it for several days, but never too extreme. That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs hard to relate, like the biggest symptoms betrayed is the deep fear abandonment and the destructive behaviors (self harm, addiction). 

By the way, doctors and therapist don‚Äôt know anything lol I‚Äôve been thinking about it. Like I told the doctor that diagnosed me with BPD that I‚Äôve been diagnosed with ADHD before, and said that I don‚Äôt have that. There is no way to know that from one conversation.

What disrupts your life might be totally acceptable for my situation. 

You have to look at your own life and determine what you truly want it to be like. 

You can have friends with BPD. You can also socialize with others.

Whether you feel like you have it or feel like you don't, attempting to get a professional to help find out is a good step. I felt like I might have it once I read up on the symptoms, and eventually was able to get diagnosed.  I'm sure there are a lot of stories similar to this on the sub.  To be fair, you won't find a ton of posts about people finding out they don't have it (because if they get diagnosed with something else, then the likelihood of them continuing to post here would be small).",JcTheSavior,ut83pz
5,"I considered it a possibility, yes. I think given enough time and disfunctionality it became obvious; I had vicious mood swings beyond normal hormonal range, but no genetic predisposition to bipolar. Poor sense of self, psychotic symptoms, other symptoms that didn‚Äôt fit in other disorders. I even had a friend tell me they thought I had BPD when I was maybe 16. 

But I never entered psychiatry/medicine hoping for a diagnosis or even mentioning it, mostly because of that misconception you mentioned - I didn‚Äôt want to be dismissed for being self-aware. I also didn‚Äôt want to assume, given that there could‚Äôve been options I‚Äôd neglected. My thinking on it is that when you self-diagnose or go into it with a preconceived idea of what problem you have, you‚Äôre more likely to forget other symptoms that don‚Äôt fit in the diagnosis or to make up symptoms you don‚Äôt have.",theyarentreallyhere,ut83pz
6,"My experience was pretty funny cuz I'd been in and out of treatment for ""depression and anxiety"" (plus self harm lmao) for years but started questioning it in my early 20s, I think I learned about the diagnosis through an online or  maybe IRL friend? I was in one DBT program (solo and group) where it wasn't really mentioned, and when I started seeing my current therapist (at a DBT practice, who referred me into their skills group a few months in) I eventually brought it up but said I've always questioned it because there are ways I'm fairly high functioning or don't ""act out"" as much as the classic idea of a BPD person. and she was like uhhhhh yeah I think you may have BPD. Fast forward a few months later when I ended up in the hospital for yeeting (""""high functioning"""" lmao) they asked if I was in treatment and I said yeah solo and group DBT and they were like ""DBT, huh? have you been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder?"" and I said ""not formally, but it's been discussed"" and then when I looked at my outtake forms after getting released I saw they'd written down BPD.

9,"No not at all. I had no clue, I just felt chronically depressed for a decade. Constantly self harmed & had periods of mania that where manifested in extreme impulsive coping mechanisms. I couldn‚Äôt keep relationships for too long, they always ended in a storm of emotion. My depression would get so bad I couldn‚Äôt keep jobs. I struggled with addiction. Everything was chaotic. I knew I had some form of ptsd due to a lifetime of trauma. My dad was physically & verbally abusive towards me. All of my boyfriends had variations of similar abuse towards me. 

I was in therapy for 2 years‚Ä¶ it took them a very long time before diagnosing me. BPD is characterized by behaviors over a period of time. After a suicide attempt the hospital psychiatrist said I was textbook borderline. I was in a chaotic romantic relationship at this time which had classic tell tale signs. 

I told the nurse that they gave me that diagnosis & he said yeah I had a feeling. He gave me a pep talk on how medication wasn‚Äôt going to fix me, that I needed to put in the work for myself. He reassured me I could heal. 

I learned about DBT, I met others like me, I tried every day for 3 years. I am flourishing now. 

I was misdiagnosed with OCD & cPTSD over the years. BPD tends to escalate in your 20s. That‚Äôs when I was sky rocketing in chaos. 

I think sometimes it is extremely difficult to diagnose ourselves. It‚Äôs kind of like reading your horoscope & finding things you relate to. People may have similar feelings but again this behavior is characterized over a number of years. It‚Äôs learned behaviors that are ingrained into your personality. It‚Äôs not just a feeling. 

If you are concerned you should seek mental health treatment. Most people with BPD require years & years of therapy. 

I was so unstable I was going 2 times a week to my individual therapist & 3 times a week for 2-3 hours a day to my DBT group. 

The DBT group was only 10 weeks but it was intensive. After that I could manage individual therapy once a week. Now I only go every 2 weeks.

I was sectioned/inpatient (again don't really want to get into Im sure you can imagine). Anyway, it took a lot of DBT and I accepted that it was a diagnosis that made sense for me and helped me address a lot of underlying issues. I also went through CPT was was great and 10/10 would recommend to anyone (**make sure you trust the therapists perspective).

I have been suicidal since I was 10-11 and that sent me over. I cried for about 16 hours straight and ended up on a psych hold because I was going to attempt suicide again. It took me about 5 years to come to terms with and believe my diagnosis since I‚Äôm generally unbothered until something upsets me (very high tolerance for things before they upset me) but then I go off the deep end. Every major upset is a reason to off myself. Also the FP pattern is a constant presence in my life and usually my trigger.

Pills and talking to NHS doctors isn't enough anymore. I fucking hate counselling, too. I feel like they try so hard to be your pal when they sound like fucking idiots. I was originally diagnosed with autism but considering my most recent behaviour and downward spiral, I think they're looking to re-evaluate me.  

I keep lashing out when I just want people to love and understand me. I have abandonment issues. I react poorly in situations. When I've done something bad I punish myself and can be spiralling for MONTHS self harming or suicide attempts which is what happened recently.  I'm constantly on edge. My brain doesn't shut off and thoughts are constantly rolling whilst simultaneously trying to numb it with weed or whatever drugs I can find.  I hate the pills the doctors prescribe. They just relax my body, not my mind.

I also do things not realising that it irritates people due to mimicking other people's mannerisms not realising this isn't appropriate or normal.  So, I'm constantly in a mental battle with my brain and now I'm just remaining mute fearing I say or do the wrong thing.  

And a job?  Forget it. That shit would mentally exhaust me.

U will still think about them a lot at first but when u are able to go out and make other friends (even if u had to force yourself out) and when u invest in hobbies that actually interest u.. u notice yourself thinking less and less about them during it. Unfortunately I just moved and didn‚Äôt have anything to do except sleep and think about them so it didn‚Äôt go well lol. I know this is all easier said than done but have faith and invest in yourself and your own happiness.,BigComprehensive5409,1ck87ig

There is a lot of wisdom to be gained from struggling and overcoming struggle. However, if you have SMI (serious mental illness), you have to be honest with yourself on how you are, are you healed enough to help others without getting triggered or bringing your things into session? Every clinician will experience counter transference, but is yours/your ‚Äústuff‚Äù so severe that it interferes with your ability to perform your job?

i started therapy a couple of weeks ago after being on the waitlist for nearly a year. i‚Äôm going to be 25 in less than a month and i brought up that i suspect i have bpd in my first session to her and she‚Äôs been bending over backwards to support me. she‚Äôs emailed my doctor to hurry them along to get me assessed, she‚Äôs looking into booking me with another organisation to get group therapy that specialises in personality disorders, she‚Äôs made me feel so validated and understood every single session. i‚Äôve been terrified to get help my entire life in fear of being laughed at and/or dismissed. but she‚Äôs made me feel safe to be vulnerable with her throughout the entire process.


you deserve that kind of support and understanding from a professional. you do not deserve to feel invalidated and helpless",Nolleo,1bmjoy5
1,"it sucks that they laughed in your face and caused you to feel bad about it. i think that‚Äôs very unprofessional, and they could‚Äôve handled that better, even if their intentions were good.

that said, many psychiatrists refuse to diagnose personality disorders in young adults, and you are still a teenager. whilst you may fit some of the criteria, it may take time before they can assess you for it and give you a proper diagnosis. self-diagnosis is discouraged, and while you may be certain that is the case, it‚Äôs important to let someone else do the work and focus on a differential diagnosis, as it could be something else entirely.",jakobkiefer,1bmjoy5
2,"Obviously no-one should laugh at you or make you feel uncomfortable in that type of setting, so for that alone I'd maybe look for a different practioner. If you are fairly new to this journey then it is a lot easier with the right team.

In regards to diagnosis, as has been said some places won't diagnose someone of your age. You said it's just been a month, for context my journey from seeking help to getting a BPD diagnosis took roughly 3 months of weekly sessions with regular assessments staggered thoughout. Now, I'm in the UK and my treatment came post crisis so I can't speak for everyone. But it isn't a diagnosis that can be made in one sitting. They'll want to see you on good days, bad days, before, during and after therapy to see if the symptoms are persistent or if they've been reactionary to something going on. All in all, don't dismiss it if you think you're on the right track, but definitely seek out a better team.",scoraiocht,1bmjoy5

They are the gold standard in diagnostic differentials and confirmation. Depending on your insurance you may or may not need a referral to see one. I'm really sorry you had this experience.

Word of the wise. Anyone trained in gestalt or schema is very likely to be specializing in and compassionate towards personality disorders. You can look for mental health services filtering for these modalities and

6,"Finding the right psychiatrist is even harder when you have BPD. Most of them are psychoanalysts and it doesn't help a lot when you have BPD. Especially if the psychiatrist is freudien or lacanien. (My opinion) 

For 10 years, diagnosed bipolar,  having to swallow very heavy medication which never helped, I completely lost my faith about finding out what was wrong with me. But I discovered BPD while searching on the internet. I asked about it to my former psy and she laughed and said like ADHD it was kind of ""made up""! I stopped seeing her and contacted an association that help people with trauma and there I met a group of psychologist who practise DBT who addressed me to a doctor at the hospital. So, my actual psychiatrist is experienced about complex trauma and BPD. It really helps. 

I'd suggest you look up the trauma centers or associations close to where you live. With an experienced professional you can get diagnosed without being judged or laughed at!  Where you went to ask for help, they are certainly not professional.

0,"Unfortunately bpd does have a huge stigma and many therapists want nothing to do with it. However it's not a death sentence you can no longer meet criteria. Notice I didn't say curable it will never be gone completely. There's no magic pill that gets rid of it like how some disorders are able to be fixed. 

You can think of it like a disease like hiv while not able to be completely wiped out, through treatment you can live a way better life which atleast is better than what the belief used to be. It used to be believed you'd be a mess until you finally just die but that's not the case anymore. 

You have to relearn certain things and learn to cope with what's going on up there but it's not a death sentence. I will say tho it's very difficult I've been to 2 therapists which weren't much help but others have had alot more success than me. Theres atleast some hope that we can be somewhat normal.

don' waste chasing girls or boys. I mean it. Make yourself a space for YOU. Like find hobbies, get skills in something, join clubs and stuff and find something you like and get better at your hobbies and new found hobbies. Socialise a lot, go out a lot with school stuff. 

By making your own space and having small successes, it will help in the long run with the feeling of emptiness and lack of self esteem.

Your Mother having a personality disorder is among the leading causes that can hand down to you, but it doesn't always happen.

So again, like I said you sound like you have a good therapist. You should be happy.

Some good books are 'get me out of here' by Rachel Reiland.....a very powerful autobiography by a recovered woman who had bpd. Buddha and the Borderline is another interesting autobiography. Heads up though, cause both don't hold back and could potentially be triggering. But also.....comforting and relatable.

Meditate lots. As in, make yourself be still and watch as your impulses to move or daydream come and go. Steady your breathing. It's a good exercise for building a sense of control.

Positively reward yourself when you accomplish hard things.....like, perhaps you didn't act on a negative impulse! So do something nice for yourself.

I talk to people sure and I have no problem forming connections but it's keeping that bond that's almost impossible for me.

Currently I'm in the healthiest relationship I've ever had and I'm very hopeful and certain of our future surprisingly. But sometimes I revert back to my mindset of ""they aren't being honest with me, no one is. I'm on my own. I need to distance myself.""

Putting someone on a pedestal and when you feel wronged by them you feel range, the intense fear of abandonment, all or nothing in relationships. I definitely had all those signs before I was officially diagnosed and when I was it made sense for a lot of things in my life. You should schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist or behavioral health specialist. When I did it they asked me a set of questions, stuff about my childhood life and home environment, schooling and interaction with peers, if I faced any bullying etc, and I also shared personal examples and stories about my emotions and they were able to basically diagnose BPD . The process was quick and easy for me and in a way I felt relieved to know what was going on with me. You should definitely get diagnosed just to see if anything ! Wishing you the best",,17uhlwe
1,"Sometimes I think ""I don't do that anymore"" and then I remember that at the beginning of *this semester*, a professor did something that made me so upset, I was ranting to my boyfriend about how much he had offended me. Now I love that professor, think he's so talented and great at what he does now that he has proven himself to me. That seems like a natural progression, except that the intensity of how I **hated** him when he was rude to me, and now the admiration I have are extremely far apart. I don't love the guy or anything, but the complete 180 is evidence that I can still be that way about people.

I have been in therapy for so long that I know what's acceptable and how to deal with my intense feelings, my boyfriend is cool with being an ear I can vent to about whatever to get it out of my system, and I have my best friend for a backup when I need to be validated twice, haha.

It's really not about controlling your emotions, because that's somewhat impossible, it's about making sure your thoughts and feelings are not acted upon. You can control your behavior. You can help reel in your emotions a bit with mindfulness techniques. You will always have these symptoms but it does get better as time goes on and you can recognize what's happening before you make a mistake. You just need to keep working some kind of therapy program like CBT and DBT, the results get better the longer you keep it up. The disorder is the enemy. Train yourself to aim your rage and determination at that instead of beating yourself up or mentally beating up a friend.

Then into adulthood, the problems continued and even got worse. I started using drugs and drinking on top of that. I was in a very toxic relationship. My ED got much more severe. In an impulsive moment, I tried running into busy highway traffic. My bf pushed me down just before I would‚Äôve been hit. 

I finally went to a psychiatrist who had me fill out forms explaining my history prior to the appointment. Then she had me go into more detail during the long session. Afterwards, she said ‚Äúhave you ever heard of BPD?‚Äù and she advised me to do research on it. I did, and it sounded exactly like me.

She didn‚Äôt describe it as qBPD, but she said after having me as a client for so long and consulting other psychologists with BPD experience, she feels comfortable diagnosing me. 

She didn‚Äôt feel comfortable diagnosing me earlier on because she was worried I was mirroring symptoms I read about online. Self-fulfiling prophecy, confirmation bias, idk. She eventually realized that being a part of these online forums and communities were helping, rather than hindering my progress. 

So, yeah. Diagnosed at 28. Sometimes you have to fight for the diagnosis. Unfortunately mental health professionals have their hangups about pwBPD and might avoid giving the diagnosis.",midnightpatches,108cryf
4,"My symptoms aligned with qBPD quite a bit, where all of my emotions and actions are turned inward. Self loathing, anger, self harm, extreme anxiety, cutting people off, people pleasing and always thinking I‚Äôm a burden on others. I can only describe it as an internal war zone, anxious about when the next bomb will drop and send me spiraling.

I had to seek out a psychologist because I was tired of feeling so much wrong in my head and wanted to get to the bottom of it. I got an assessment (not cheap) and it was worthwhile. I know it‚Äôs sometimes difficult,  it journaling your feelings and thoughts will be useful when it comes time to seek a diagnosis. They will want to know your history.

My psych was at first reluctant to give me a BPD diagnosis because he didn‚Äôt want me to face stigma, but felt I fit ‚Äúquiet bpd‚Äù criteria. Of course that‚Äôs not in the dsm, along with cptsd.

Two diagnosed me with bipolar II and medicated me. I started doing research and stumbled upon qBPD because I just didn't think my diagnosis fit everything. Keep in mind I was 29 at the time and been in therapy (including 14 months of inpatient as a teenager) for 15 years. I knew something was really wrong.

I sent the symptom list to a GF at the time, and subsequently my next GF, and they both said it was literally me. Like jaw on the floor. 

So for me that's enough. I have no health insurance right now, the prescribed treatments for the disorder like DBT, medication, and therapy methods help.

I fell into a pretty deep depression and started showing up to class late. One of my instructors recommended counseling and I had enough breakdowns in there to where my counselor brought up the possibility of me having bpd.

I was more open to the idea by this point because I'd been in therapy for years and another therapist who'd seen me for one emergency session 4 years prior had suggested I might be bipolar. 

Things really turned around for me after that. My grades shot up and I didn't take feeling alienated as personally anymore.

Being scared of being abandoned, being impulsive and dysregulated, and having passive suicidal ideation are all symptoms of trauma (which most with ptsd and many with nuerodivergence have). Even cutting and self injury can be a sensory seeking or self regulatory activity in people with adhd and autism.

moral of the story: don‚Äôt be afraid to advocate for yourself in these situations and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask. it‚Äôs annoying yes but if you have the opportunity to talk to a treatment provider i would recommend just saying what you‚Äôre feeling and asking if you could get evaluated for a diagnosis.",,108cryf

48,"Well i think its kinda different for everyone, so i can only talk about my experiences.

What i usually tell to people who know nothing about bpd is that its all just low selfesteem and selfworth. Everything i do comes from the belief that i cant be never good enough to anything or anyone. So with all the overthinking and big emotions comes this fear of rejection and abadonment. I loose people because managing my emotions is too much work, i cant care about others properly, they get tired of helping me. So this way my belief of being the worst person is always proven right. I feel like i have to be 2 steps ahead so i can runaway easily, it gives a false sense of power. But i cant let myself be happy this way. So i destroy myself even more to punish myself and to see if someone cares enough to pull me out of my own selfmade misery. When i feel something i cant believe it gets over or i ever felt other emotions, it consumes me. Sadness feels suicide all the time, nothing makes it go away for too long, but im used to it. This i all i know, so i keep falling down into this pit. But im the pit, ive always been, so it never gets filled. No amount of alcohol, drugs or anything helps to do so. I need someone to look after me, to take care of this, but i cant let them, i know how it ends, because i know who i am. It gets better as i learn to live with it, but never goes away, its a constant fight against myself. Mostly i just feel like a scared little girl all alone, a piece of garbage even when everyone loves me. If someone tries to prove it to me i push them away, i get grossed out, but all i crave is to be cared for finally. I need to learn to care for myself first, so it can be sorted out, but i always do something i regret. Again and again and again. The same shameful cyrcles without and end.",Upper_Wasabi_6173,108cryf

51,"Thank you! This is very recent development for me. I went to get diagnosed for adhd with nothing else on my radar and ended up with the bpd diagnosis. It really sounds like something that shouldn't be taken lightly so it's surprising to me how easily she handed me the diagnosis. It was not like a regular therapist who knew me. I literally met her once. 
Even with all that though I do see some of the diagnostic criteria fitting me just not in the extremes that seem to be presented and I think that it's because most of it happens in my head. I dont fit some of the diagnostics though. I dont consider myself impulsive, I haven't engaged in self harm since I was a teenager (over 10 years, and even then it was brief), I want to die all the time but I wouldn't kill myself. 
So much overlap between commorbid conditions. Like is this bpd? Is it a trauma response? Is it depression, anxiety? Am I just a horribly flawed human? Even adhd, she says I don't have it but so many of the symptoms seem to fit, especially executive dysfunction.
I will say I have sought out another therapist who used dbt in therapy and who claims to have success working with individuals who have tried therapy before and it hasn't helped. Hopefully she is affordable and can help me work through all of this.",pickinusernamessucks,108cryf

1,"Honestly, I thought I had bipolarism (was the wrong BPD apparently lol), but my therapist explained that I had borderline personality disorder.

I didn't even know what is was so I googled it & everything started to make sense. I personally liked having a definition to my disorder because I can describe it to other people if needed. My childhood made sense (that's when I developed it) to my adult self (wasn't diagnosed until I was 25). To me, it was an eyeopener.

I was blessed to have an understanding support network - partner, friends, and some close family. They don't understand it, but no one criticized me for it.

The only people I haven't ever talked to it are my parents - they're the reason I developed it and my relationship with them is estranged now that I'm an adult. My mom specifically...I once told her I think I had depression and social anxiety and she practically laughed at me, then went behind my back telling my sisters I was having a psychotic breakdown. This literally traumatized me and I still can't think about it this day without some tears forming. (So, definitely never going to tell her.)

I understand they went through their own childhood trauma, but that doesn't excuse what they did to me and the environment they raised me in.

My partner even did some research on this disorder so he knew what I was going through and how he could combat it with me (:

TLDR; my childhood was whack and it hurt my inner child. But telling people you **truly** love & trust (like, sincerely trust!) is the best way to go! It develops your very own support network!",Dazzling_Injury_690,16jjw3i

I let my friend who I knew was safe know. They have c-ptsd so we have similar behaviors. Basically ended in a got each other's back response.

I also let my cousin who is more like my sister know and we joked about it (in a healing way)

I will be keeping this diagnosis from my Dad's side of the family and quite a few other people. An adverse, or perceived adverse reaction would wreck me.

Then was told I probably have both BPD and bipolar even though I insist I don't see myself having bipolar at all, it seems like it's all just symptoms of the others. Was also told it could be a combination of C-PTSD and psychosis. All of this was through the process of getting 5-7 psychs, only a few of which I went to for longer than a year, so I really only trust their opinions. Most psychs are also very iffy about diagnosing patients with BPD for a lot of solid reasons. At that point, I'm not even going to attempt to get a solid diagnosis. Whether I have both bipolar and BPD or just BPD doesn't really change how I tackle it. DBT is used as treatment on all of these mental illnesses regardless, so as long as i have ways to manage the emotional pain and work through my issues, I don't care what my official diagnosis is.

Combined, these all share certain traits of BPD. 

My last relationship caused the most insane level of paranoia around cheating/being abandoned, that I was literally stuck and frozen emotionally and physically for 2ish years. I split on her for almost 3 whole years after our relationship ended. I managed to hookup with a old friend/aquatence and I was pretty cold towards her, and eventually it built up over the last 2 years to us having a massive fallout. She didn't want FWB anymore and never explicitly stated so, but kept subtly downplaying my advances for a long time, which when mixed with my jealousy/fears of abandonment made me go sicko mode. She has BPD and even told me she definitely thinks I have it. 
I was so angry and shameful about the whole situation that I brutally punched a box with old stuff and gouged my hand on a ceramic plate, it bled for a couple days and even after a few weeks it's hard to stretch...

1,"Hello friend and welcome,

Some people with BPD have a lot of very obvious childhood trauma, some have some more hidden emotional/psychological abuse in their past, and some can't point to any trauma at all. You don't *have* to fill some trauma requirement to have this disorder, it's just very common. And from your post it does sound like there was a chaotic home environment and abuse.

The guy who diagnosed me told me to think of a personality disorder this way: All the traits of a personality disorder are normal personality traits anyone can have. What makes it a disorder, is our ""collection"" of traits (which in this case fits with BPD), and how our traits are exaggerated to a degree that disrupts our lives. There are also degrees of severity - mild, moderate and severe.

As you hopefully go into remission and recovery, you will still have some traits, but they will be less exaggerated and thus disrupt your life less. At some point you may no longer fit the diagnostic criteria, but you may still have some difficulties and you may still have to fight to maintain your progress. So for many it's ""curable"" depending on how you look at it, and it's definitely possible (but not easy) to reach a point where you'll have a nice life.

Good luck on your recovery journey!

0,"Hi,

I don't have BPD so I am not sure how much my advice will help. However, my wife was diagnosed with borderline personality and I do have some knowledge and experience dealing with this disorder.

Getting diagnosed and knowing about the disorder can be overwhelming and difficult. But it becomes easier to manage it and overcome it once you learn the underlying mechanisms and can work on it. So don't worry, with time it will get better.

I hope someone with personal experience comes ahead and shares their journey and suggestions so that it's more helpful for you. In the meantime, I'd suggest the following personally:

1. Keep working with your therapist. At the end of the day, they are a professional and should be able to guide you better.

2. Focus on hobbies and vocational activities. Do something fun and constructive. It helps tremendously in the long run.

3. Practice mindfulness and meditation.

4. Learn more about the disorder. Educating yourself and understanding the mechanisms are crucial. Try not to blame yourself or anyone else, but focus more on improvement and finding a solution. 

5. Don't be hard on yourself or try too much. Remember, you are only human and sometimes these takes some time for them to get resolved. It's only normal, so don't get demotivated. Focus on the process, don't bash yourself up for not getting to the destination faster. Most importantly, believe in yourself and don't lose hope. You can be whomever you want to be, achieve whatever you want to. A disorder doesn't have to define you, you are so much more than that. In life we don't always get to choose the hands we are dealt with, but we definitely can choose to do what we do with that hand. And it goes a long way.

Cynism and poor outlook on life is a part of a lot of people‚Äôs mental illness (including BPD). You can and will get better with treatment and time. If you see someone rant about how they‚Äôll never get better, just know that people with BPD do get better. That person is just going through it. 

Don‚Äôt expect people to be there to emotionally regulate you. I promise you that there will be no one capable to better regulate you than yourself. Grab your surfboard and ride the wave. If you want longevity in your relationships, this is crucial. If you notice you are starting to idealize or devalue someone, give yourself space to do activities alone and glorify the crap out of it. If you want, post cutesy pics to social media if that motivates you. I have OCD and I have gotten so proud of myself when I don‚Äôt go to others for reassurance. It is so empowering. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt use your supports, but be meaningful with it. See if you can ride the wave first. 

Match the energy people give you, but also don‚Äôt keep score either. It will prevent resentment, and you‚Äôll find it helps a load. 

If you are ever being hard on yourself, think of yourself as a cat. For some reason I have an easier time accepting mistakes when I think of myself like a cat. I don‚Äôt know how to explain. 

Take accountability for everything you can. You do not save yourself emotional harm not doing so. You deny yourself so much growth.

2,"If I'm being honest I wish I'd been diagnosed in my teens before I split and cut out my ex FP to prevent abandonment when I was 24 years old which was the worst mistake of my life because it triggered depression and devastating grief that lasted for years and with it came isolation, weight gain which to this day I'm struggling to lose, strained relationships and just pain to the fucking extreme. It also would have prevented a lot of shit with my boyfriend and how destructive the early years of our relationship was I genuinely thought he was the problem and I wasn't that's how deluded I was. If I'd been diagnosed as a teenager or even when i was 20 years old it would have prevented a lot of shit. My family are convinced all I have is Asperges and depression and that's all they've ever been convinced of it was my sister who begged me to get diagnosed probably because our relationship was at rock bottom idk but yeah that diagnosis would have come in real handy before I cut this girl out and then went in a downward spiral that lasted 7 years.",apurpleglittergalaxy,1b177yt

5,"That I had been able to confront my issues as a teen so my ptsd wouldn't develop into BPD and my life spiral out of control as an adult and I would lose everything...

With my kids I am encouraging them now to work through their pain. Honor their pain. Be accountable. Do repair. When they're older I'll encourage counselling/therapy for general support. They will break this garbage cycle my family lines have put us through.",MJSP88,1b177yt

0,"Hey! I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through this but first step to recovery is a correct diagnosis and you‚Äôve done that already. 

I knew I had BPD before being diagnosed. My first psychiatrist wasn‚Äôt ready to diagnose me with BPD. I ended up going to another doctor and he did infact diagnose me with couple tests.

5,"Hey mate, appreciate the response üòä.

Out of my own curiosity, what tests did you have to do to be diagnosed?

How did you know beforehand, was it something you came across?

Do you think it helped with the diagnosis? As in, made it easier to understand type thing.",RHCPFlea,1bifbhb
6,"There‚Äôs a test that i did called MCMI. It basically gives insight into to a lot of personality traits and disorders. A professional read these stats and then accordingly makes a diagnosis. That‚Äôs how I was diagnosed. 

I was just exhausted with the kind of experiences I was going through. The kind of fears and paranoias I had. The way I processed and perceive feelings and emotions. So I just researched until I came across BPD. I read the symptoms per the DSM-5. A lot of personal accounts of people that had it as well and it was like a light bulb went off. That‚Äôs how I knew. 

A diagnosis definitely helped. It made me realise what I‚Äôm going through has a name. Also having a diagnosis means I can get better because there would be medical professionals who‚Äôd understand me and would be able to medically treat me. Also fellow BPD diagnosed peers that would get me. I didn‚Äôt feel as alone and helpless anymore.",myfuturewifee,1bifbhb

2,"No, but I think ik why she diagnosed me so fast‚Ä¶ my sister has schizophrenia, so it was actually her psychiatrist, but then I OD and went to the hospital. After I had an IV in me and there was an available room in psych I was admitted. I was evaluated by a group of psychiatrists. Once I got out, my sisters psychiatrist was also mine. We met like 3 times after that, than I went back to the ward for self harm. I was then evaluated by on the previous psychiatrists from the the fist time I was in the ward. She talked with her team and they talked with my sisters and I‚Äôs psychiatrist before me and her a day after that. Mb if this is confusing.",Taylushi_,1cri37j

0,"This is rough and I‚Äôm in the same spot right now too. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it; this is exactly what BPD looks like. It got easier for me when I accepted that my mental health had, and will continue to contribute to a reduced quality of life. 

DBT and CBT are useless if you‚Äôre not properly medicated. It‚Äôs like hiding insulin from a diabetic 10 year old in the cookie jar on top of the fridge. Eventually they help a bit, but if your cycle is too intense, they just can‚Äôt provide the kind of relief you need during the times you need it most. 

Try everything and see what works best for you.",HoldOut19xd6,1cg010v
0,"I meet every symptom of BPD and first was flagged for it on a psych assessment we did while learning about mental health in a psychology class, then diagnosed by a therapist, then diagnosed by an independent psychiatrist after I stopped trusting my therapist. Despite this, I feel imposter syndrome every time I feel normal. While in relationships, I constantly feel extremely affected by BPD, but when I‚Äôm alone (working at home, only social when I‚Äôm feeling up to it), I feel almost completely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù despite being flat all of the time. During these times, I feel like maybe I‚Äôm actually just fine and overthinking everything. Then I get back into hobbies, or spend time with other people, or have get anxious, or experience literally any emotion and it becomes very clear that BPD isn‚Äôt something like anxiety that is always the same and something you can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù all of the time, it‚Äôs a personality disorder. It‚Äôs something that affects situations and thinking, and something that isn‚Äôt always obvious until it is.

Keep in mind one of the biggest pieces of BPD (other than emotional instability) is issues with identity. The lack of ‚Äúself‚Äù and regularity in how one feels about themselves and who they are makes it hard to relate to not just other people, but also aspects of self. When I feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, I really don‚Äôt feel like I have a severe personality disorder. It‚Äôs when I have to deal with emotions, people, or the outside world that it becomes very apparent that my brain doesn‚Äôt work the same way.

I‚Äôve always bounced back and forth from being super into hobbies like making music and cold quitting for long periods of time because my confidence disappears and my self image switches and I just don‚Äôt really care anymore. I never really understood the on and off tendencies (I get REALLY into it and work with friends making music then completely fall off of the face of the earth and I know it‚Äôs annoying to them, but it‚Äôs just not something I‚Äôm capable of doing when it‚Äôs not ‚Äúme‚Äù). Realizing it‚Äôs because my self image and goals bounce from being a confident artist to just being an lifetime employee to laying on the couch for a week and not doing anything has been eye opening and helped me understand my tendencies a lot more.",KingJex,15j8j9u
