0,Therapy is bs,"Been having a really tough few weeks and I caved and went to my therapist. Such a waste of my money. All she did was tell me I‚Äôve been having the same problems for four years and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just a human and sometimes life is hard, push through it.‚Äù Like?? 

You could tell she was so over it and she ended my session ten minutes early. I know I‚Äôve been having the same problems, shouldn‚Äôt you be trying to help me instead of saying ‚Äúget over it‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think they even fully grasp how stuck in the cycle you can get and they get fed up and dismiss your problems.

1,How do people afford therapy?,"A lot of people here mention that they go to therapy often, take medications and have tried many, have been to a specialist that can diagnose them, etc. But also...talking about how they don't have a stable job or only work part-time or not at all (which basically means you don't have health insurance if you are in the US). Therapy sessions run $150-$250 an hour where I live just to see a mental health therapist (not a psychiatrist or even psychologist). How are people doing this? Are there just a lot of young people who are on their parent's insurance or have someone else paying? People always tell you to put your mental health first, but I literally wouldn't have money for groceries if I saw a therapist once a week.

2,Therapy invoice process is causing me more anxiety than the therapy fixes,"I (29F) am having issues with my therapists office. They are a middle-sized popular local psychology centre, and my therapist is absolutely incredible. 10/10 talk and EMDR therapist. The administration processes however, suck.

I have fortnightly therapy at the moment. If I could afford it more regularly, I would go. We have been doing outside office hours EMDR sessions since December, due to my therapist having university classes for her PhD during the other hours I would be available. 

Because of this mismatch of timetables, I am at the office when the admin team has left for the night. That means I can't pay by eftpos, because they have shut everything down for the day. I've been receiving emailed invoices, which I pay directly to the centres bank account and it clears automatically, immediately. 

Over the past 2 months, there have been 4 incidents where I have either:

- not recieved an invoice 3 days after asking for one, sent the amount with my name and the appointment date as the payment refetence anyway (to make sure I pay for all of my appointments before I forget), and then recieved an invoice 2 weeks later (the day of my next appointment)

- or have received an invoice, paid it immediately and then been called asking for payment again a week or so later. 

Both of these instances end with the admin team either ignoring my email, or replying saying ""Oh sorry about that, I am in a Wednesday slump too"". ?

It has gotten to the point where when my phone rings and I recognise my therapists office number, I get into a full panic. It has happened again today, and I am supposed to have an appointment tonight, but I'm just so exhausted by all of this. I don't want to go anymore. Not because the therapy isn't great, but because I really hate this cycle of bullshit.

27,Has anyone else been disappointed by therapy?,"I‚Äôve been to many different therapists over 10 years, about 14. Seeing one right now. I‚Äôve done DBT CBT, ERP for OCD and had some REALLY horrible attempts with EMDR and IFS. 

People just talk about how therapy is so great, that if you put in the work it‚Äôll get better, but I‚Äôve just been so disappointed and honestly hurt by therapists.

I‚Äôm in a program rn specific to BPD and it‚Äôs actually okay.  I like my therapist a lot. She‚Äôll point stuff out and confront me, but she has good timing and it‚Äôs in a respectful way. I also just process my trauma on my own now and do mentalization and transference therapy with her.

There‚Äôs also a lot of autism in my family, and I think neurodivergence might be a bigger role in this. I‚Äôm going to get a Neuropsych evaluation (finally!)

Tips for finding a therapist:

It‚Äôs really important to find someone you click with, and sees and is interested in getting to know you beyond your diagnosis. 

If they do something you think is off, you need to confront them right away. How they react to this is really important.

31,Does therapy require 100% honesty in order for it to work? ,"I have recently started therapy after being on a waiting list for nearly a year and half. My therapist is extremely intimidating.. He's seemingly barely empathetic and he doesn't interact much during our sessions. That's not the issue tho..

I have dependency on this specific prescription drug and I'm aware of it being a problem that requires a solution.. However, I don't feel like I'm ready to take that step and quit because it's LITERALLY my only coping method and source of motivation to get through the heavy load of my day.

But I have reduced my intake greatly to a single time a week) now my question is.. Should I just be honest with him regarding my abuse in order for therapy to work? Or can I just hide it and focus on other aspect in my life that need improvement?


-the main reason I'm scared to tell him is because I'm afraid he'll stop the therapy and send me to drug counseling instead and I'm afraid they don't know how to handle BPD behavior.. -

I am a pretty regular smoker and I cope a lot of self harm with weed. I don‚Äôt see myself stopping completely, just because I like it and it works so well as a coping strategy. I feel so bad and kind of like I am failing at my goals, because I have to lie to my therapist. I feel like an addict because of it. 
How do you deal with this ? 
I know that I also could just see it as a chance to develop new habits and stop, but I am so not ready.

39,In full remission after 6 years of therapy :),"After having being diagnosed with BPD and PTSD 6 years ago, I (26F) have been in such a good mental place (even though this last year has been very heavy) and after a few tests got the news today that I am in full remission. I personally have known for over a year that the symptoms no longer influence my day to day functionality (no more than any average person) and even with the passing of one of my parents I have been able to regulate my emotions and take a step back when needed. 

I always felt as if this diagnosis would be with me for my entire life and I would never be able to feel better or be able to function normally in society. I am incredibly proud of where I am today (healthy social relationships, being able to go to uni and a fulfilling job) and I now know that I do have the power to change my life and make healthy decisions. 

This life shit gets easier with every healthy and balanced decision I make but that doesn‚Äôt mean there won‚Äôt be painful, traumatic or hard moments. I‚Äôve just accepted that it‚Äôs part of life and no longer see myself as an victim of my surroundings or environment. Today I know that whatever happened to me, is not my fault. But it is my responsibility to deal with it now as an adult. 

I‚Äôm not just going to say that it‚Äôs all going to get better because I obviously don‚Äôt know what any of you are going through. There is so much more that I could share about my hardships but I just really wanted to share my experience and some positivity!

I'm posting here in compassion with those suffering with the disorder and truly want help/change but really have no direction to go or just don't know what to look for. Look into EMDR and neurofeedback, do some research on success rates and symptom relief from this treatment. Whether you suffer on a severe level or a rather minor level. This treatments are what I would recommend.  

I had the best results when using neurofeedback. As I had a brain graph done and I could actually see the WHY I was having issues. As my brain waves were completely out of sync and resembled that of a traumatized brain. 

Give it a fair try if you are interested. We all deserve happiness and love. I wish my ex was able to receive and reciprocate that experience. But she'd given up long before I met her. I was unaware how deep into the victim hood she'd sank until I had to leave to save myself.

84,"Is there any hope if you are ""incompatible"" with therapy?","I want to put aside diagnoses for a second. 

&#x200B;

Yes, I am fairly certain I have BPD, but that's not the point. While diagnoses can help people, they are also mainly a tool for insurance to fit billing into neat categories. I don't want to talk about the diagnoses. I wanna focus on the symptoms. I wanna talk about the problems. 

&#x200B;

One reason I don't like diagnoses as a label is because I don't suffer from BPD in the same destructive ways as most. It feels obvious to say ""I am experiencing manifestations of psychological phenomena in a manner different from other people"". 

Going a step further, I believe I've always been held back by that very setup. ""Oh, but *unlike* others with BPD, you're actually good at X"". Same with Autism. I used to be shit at socializing, and eventually, something snapped in my brain, and I became an excellent public speaker. However, that success has masked my struggles with socializing in other key aspects, which have gone largely ignored by therapists because I'm ""good at it"". 

And this phrase... ""Good at it""... It's haunted me for years.

Getting into the problems, I would say my two biggest issues have been

* Insurmountable waves of anger/frustration. It causes me to disengage from anything I struggle with that does not have an external deadline (I've tried to draw for 10 years but cannot pass the shame I frustration I feel drawing like shit)
* Shame. So much shame. I don't know where it comes from. All I know is that it, alongside the anger, comes along and destroys every part of my identity every few months
* Fear. That fear consumes everything I do. I'm afraid of creating ""bad things"". I'm afraid of getting better. I'm literally unable to practice drawing because I cannot stomach creating something sub-par. I cannot stomach creating something that isn't the pinnacle of art.

My creative ventures are all dead because of this unholy trinity. My personal growth has hit a wall head on and continues to do so. I was in DBT for 3 years with literally no progress. I had such a hard time forming routines and doing the diary, something I knew and told the therapist upfront I was struggling to do, that we ended up developing a toxic relationship by the end. 

Unfortunately, I'm limited in what therapies I can access right now. I'm seeing a therapist for psychoanalysis to develop my autonomous thinking and reflecting skills. However, I still cannot trust myself. I can't trust that I'm not the devil or wicked and unworthy of heeding. 

And I don't want to fail out of another therapy.

I'm at the end of my rope here. I've genuinely tried changing my mentality. I've been building resilience. I've been tolerating distress. In the end, nothing has changed. I'm not getting better at my crafts. I am not getting better at not giving up.

&#x200B;

I need a solution. I want to find some sort of mastery that is easy, somewhere I can build a foundation. I feel truly incompetent at everything, and that discourages me from trying everything. 

&#x200B;

Please help me find a solution for the one who failed out of healing.

Should I speak to a psychiatrist or therapist again. I really don‚Äôt like to assume things like this but My entire relationship has been strained by symptoms of what I think is BPD or something similar. 
This is something I‚Äôm really ashamed to speak abt.  But basically my girlfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me and it was my fault. Every time she would go out with her friends and stoped replying  spoke to any other guys or did anything small I would panick and start and argument. The thing is I knew she wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong I would just get so emotional to the point were I would have panick attacks and say thing that I regret later on.  It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt control my feelings when something so small happens. When she broke up with me I started begging and doing anything possible to keep her from leaving. It got to the point where she would just have to ignore me. I finnaly managed to let her leave but this was only because she said that she doesn‚Äôt think that we‚Äôre done forever and she willing to see if we come back together naturaly so I  convinced myself that we‚Äôll get back together this made me feel empty or js better ig. We stopped talking for a few days and she texted me asking how I was. after a few minutes of texting she stopped replying and the panicking started again. I‚Äôve been bugging her non stop every time something that hints that she‚Äôs moving on happens.  and each time I regret it so fucking much because I know it only makes things worse. The most shameful part of all of this is that I started cutting myself to get some kind of attention from her. I feel so empty telling myself she‚Äôll come back to feel somewhat better.

I‚Äôve been in trauma therapy for the past three years. When I first started seeing my therapist my BPD was still extremely reactive and actively causing problems in my life. I‚Äôve processed a lot of my trauma within these last three years as well both in session and out of session and I do think that I have a way better control of my BPD and have found some great coping skills that work for me. My therapist has been preparing me for discharge, and in our next session I think will be our termination session. 

Luckily this therapist said they are still willing to do a check in once or twice per year afterwards, and it‚Äôs not a case of I‚Äôll never talk to her again but rather if something traumatic happens she is willing to work with me still. 

I do agree that I think being discharged is good because I‚Äôm at a point in my life where my traumas aren‚Äôt as triggering every day, I have a better handle on my emotions and coping skills. But ya kno, I‚Äôm still nervous for what the future will look like not seeing a therapist regularly.

I did my best not to derail or bring up too much past stuff, or current heavy family police drama. But maybe suppressing those problems causes a new stress too.

93,Kicked out of group therapy,"Hi all. This definitely wasn‚Äôt on my 2024 bingo but here we go.

I have been going to BPD-specific group therapy for over 6 months now. It‚Äôs a one year treatment that I really need, especially because it‚Äôs for free (state-funded) and I don‚Äôt have the money to pay for therapy. I got a phone call today from my therapist asking me to come in for a talk. She said that the group therapy is not working for me, and that it is ‚Äòtoo challenging‚Äô for me. I was in shock.

We get feedback on every session and it always states that I have participated actively and in a relevant way. Other patients appreciate me, including patients finishing the treatment and asking to stay in touch with me. I also have a good relationship with the therapists. I felt like this therapy has been massively helping me, and even people around me have noticed a change in the way I am and think. I have a very stable life, am managing studies and a job, stable friendships and a relationship. I am sober of all drugs. The biggest problem is that I am very affected by my PTSD, and on one occasion I stated that I didn‚Äôt feel ready to work on letting my guard down with men because it feels like a life or death situation.

I am extremely confused and overthinking and spiralling. I have even been feeling suicidal. It‚Äôs not even my first therapy breakup but this comes as a huge shock (last time was because I moved far away). I asked the therapist for more information and she refused to tell me anything before our appointment next week. It is really hurting me that she thinks the therapy is too challenging, and I feel like I‚Äôm too mentally ill to have access to therapy.

107,How did BPD come up while in therapy?,"Hello everyone, 
I'm looking to get some perspective on here from those who were diagnosed/ found out they had BPD while in therapy. 

When every thing you feel or do is labeled as normal by your therapist, how do you deal with it? 

I started seeing a therapist a month ago because I couldn't deal with my own emotions and reactions after a relationship ended. Three months ago I stopped dating an older man I was deeply attached to. At the end of it, I felt like my only escape from the pain I was feeling was dying. I developed extreme behaviors: such as feeling hatred and planning revenge because I felt betrayed, used and manipulated; hateful towards that person; drinking a bit to make myself feel nothing or to fall asleep at night, self harming and attempting  because I couldn't see any way out from this state. I felt like a zombie and disconnected from the world most of the time, nothing made sense to me anymore. The only things I felt would be numbness or extreme unbearable distress accompanied by anger. 
 I realized such extreme reactions were not normal. So I started reading a bit about abandonment trauma and fell deeper into the psychological definitions, disorders and their symptoms. It is when I fell upon a few articles about BPD and read how it is presented and found myself in those descriptions. I informed myself a bit more and, although I can't self diagnose, I suspect I might have it, but I'm not sure how to talk about it with the therapist I'm seeing.  
I truly feel like I'm alone in this world, that nobody cares or values me- even those that claim to, but actions speak louder than words- and that I'll never be lovable or worthy for anybody. My entire life I felt abandoned by everyone I had met. 
Even though three months have passed, I still find myself obsessing over that person and the injustices toward me, and mostly because I still can't see how I can move on from it. I feel like my life has stopped the moment he left. 
Whenever I bring up such statements: 
""Nobody thinks of me as a priority. Nobody wants me for who I am. I feel I don't belong anywhere. I lose myself when I get attached to someone, unable to rebel against mistreatment. ""
 I get responded with "" You give too much value to the others. You give them too much importance. You need to value yourself. Don't give more than you're given.  Don't generalize everything based on a few failed experiences "" 
Rationally I know these things are all correct, but at the end of the day I still ask myself: why am so unlovable that nobody wants me? It is a feeling that immobilizes me because it is the same experience I'd always had. So how can I expect it to be different in the future? 
Although talking with my therapist makes me feel better momentarily, I feel like the real problem is not addressed. 
How should I deal with it? 


Thanks

114,Getting better without therapy,"I see a lot of posts on here that are written by people who seem to really struggle with the idea of recovery and their can't see their  lives improving without intense and lengthy psychological assistance. So for the people who think that splitting will always be an inevitable occurence, or fear they'll always have or need a Favourite Person, I want to share that things can get better. Relationships with others don't have to be filled with fear and scary what-if's. You can learn to be accepting of the person you are. There will come a time where you can be honest about how you feel and with time you'll learn a way of communicating that doesn't backfire on you. You can achieve emotional balance and control of your thoughts.

Being diagnosed with BPD doesn't define you or who you are forever. The things that make you different from other people are worth embracing. Out there in the world are good people who can love every inch of you and you can learn to trust again. The hardest part  will always be in looking after yourself but I promise that you will one day care about yourself the way you care so deeply about others. You can have friends and lovers and have it be healthy for everyone. Despite being given a disadvantage there is always room to positively adapt.

I haven't had DBT or any specific treatment for my BPD, PTSD or disociative issues. That being said I have overcome a lot of my own difficulties, especially my BPD. Yes I still need treatment and am currently on disability for my illness but I wanted to share that it's possible to live with minimal symptoms. Things have been very manageable and I have learned to accept a lot about myself and my life. I've got a healthy relationship that is stable and satisfies me deeply, and has lasted a long time. My life though challenging at times is somewhere I want live and something I want to keep working on. 

For a long long time I thought what I had could only be something that would exist in my fantasies. I have come here today to try and show you that no matter how difficult or severe your BPD is, there is still hope for you. Things absolutely do get better and I promise that all of the dark questions you have like ""will i always be empty"" or ""will anyone really love me"" can be answered in the end. Things can just get better. It may take time and some experience but life won't always be some horrible, unending series of disappointments and traumas. It's okay to struggle but please know that you won't always be the same way. Keep working on yourself and one day you'll be able to stand in the light. I promise you won't suffer forever - even if it's all you've known so far.

My Bf (M 27) thinks I should go back to therapy and or make friends with people who have BPD. For context I (F 19) have BPD and have been in therapy most of my life (ages 9 to about a month being 18). I do not trust therapists as a whole do to many of them breaking confidentiality laws with me and simply not being taken seriously. I am very reluctant to go back as being in it almost all my life with not the best happenings has worn me out. I do not want to keep explaining myself to them and they make me feel like a science experiment that's under watch thus I cannot fully be open with them. I have agreed to go back for my bfs sake of mind, as I have often talked about k\*lling myself with him, I think about it more than the average person and used to s\*lf harm but he is worried for me and that greatly stresses and bothers me. I told him I would go under the conditions that: I can stop whenever I want, I will not get back on meds, and I will only go as constantly as I feel necessary. This seemed to really relieve him but he suggested I try to make friends who also have BPD as I feel that no one really understands me or what I live through. I've tried to explain it to him and past exs but they just don't understand. I tried to explain to my current bf how I feel like an impostor, how even when surrounded by friends I feel alone. I don't feel human most of the time and am both hyper-aware and unknowing of myself. I cried to him about all of this and he is very instant that I go back to therapy and has offered to pay for it more than once. In the past the only people I've known with my disorder were past lovers and the relationships were very abusive and toxic. I am scared to make friends with someone with my same disorder as I do not want that too to become abusive and toxic but I told him I would try. So um yeah I guess I'm basically asking if someone with my same disorder would like to be friends? I've had a very hard time in the past making friends and spent about two years alone because of it. It would be really nice if I had a friend who understands what I'm living through and could vent and talk to without judgment. Sorry if this was awkward I tried my best and I'm very anxious/nervous.

130,Do I need BPD Therapy?,"I self-diagnosed myself with depression at a very early age due to traumatic things that happened in my life; lots of acting out, self-harm, verbally abusive in relationships.

When I was slightly older, I was diagnosed with epilepsy, this had a huge impact on my life as it changed every facet of my life from my work/university to even how I felt as a man (wetting the bed and in college at age 20 is pretty embarrassing). Because of this, I was diagnosed with depression and began therapy, I only had 12 sessions and they weren't beneficial in the slightest; it seemed like the therapist didn't know what I wanted to talk about.

Later in October last year I had 3 seizures in one day in London causing me to have major brain trauma, major concussion, two skull and two jaw fractures and blood clots under my eyes, the doctor thought it would be a good idea to tell me I was lucky to be alive, which rested well on my consciousüôÉ.

I had to have two months off work as my brain simply didn't work, I couldn't remember questions thay were asked 10 seconds prior.

I then went for more therapy as I think the physical and mental trauma of this event has caused me some minor PTSD (waking up in cold sweats, almost having panic attacks when thinking about the event). This therapy was so helpful and really pinpointed areas in my life where I was going wrong and how I could improve myself and those around me.

But obviously, as soon as the therapy stopped. The drugs returned and the self loathing, its this demasculating thought that im not a real man and could just drop dead at any minute.

The main problem is when I'm feeling good, I'm on top of the world and nothing could bring me down. I feel like the world is literally my oyster. I love my family, friends, nature, work, EVERYTHING!!! And then...this is what makes me think it could be BPD.

Really sorry for the lengthy description and if you read through all that, I salute you. Any feedback or just any comments at all would be so appreciated! Or even if anything I've spoken about, you can relate to, im always here to speak.

131,therapy triggers me. but i want to start doing it again,"i almost posted this on the talk therapy sub but last time i talked about my symptoms being a barrier to treatment and interfering with my therapy / relationship with my therapist i got a lot of people dogpiling on me,, as if i should just magically stop having symptoms lmao,, i was even asking for help with seeing the more logical reasoning for the situation (since i was thinking in black and white) and people were just shitting on my symptoms haha as if im not mentally ill. that post is still in my history if youre interested. i was actively in an episode at that point so i think its a pretty good example of just how much therapy can trigger me. 

  
anyway, every therapist ive ever had has triggered me in one way or another. and ik its not THEM its ME but its really frustrating trying to get treatment and then literally fucking up your relationship with your therapist so bad they stop working with you \*because\* of your mental illness which you're trying to get treatment for. 

i always either get way too attached and they become my FP (which is a whole issue and really messes with progress) or i start relying on them for emotional validation on a normal level and if i dont get it i will have an increase in harmful behaviors in an attempt to recieve that validation. ive literally never had a therapist that didnt trigger my symptoms in some way \*even\* the ones i really liked and clicked with and was making progress with until i started having an increase in symptoms.

  
i kind of gave up on therapy last year after my fp/therapist ""abandoned"" me (mostly my fault and life circumstances but um,, my nervous system still thinks it was abandonment soooo). i was working with another therapist at the same time for addiction help and dropped him after i split and ghosted my dbt referal after one session bc i felt like she was trying to replace my fp. 

its been months and i was ALMOST in remission but i remitted all my symptoms a month ago and im struggling again and i want to go back to my referrals but im really scared of the same thing happening again‚Äî getting triggered and fucking over my relationship with the ONE person that actually has a chance at helping me (dbt is so hard to come by these days oml). it hurt SO much the last time. and idk how to stop it from happening because obviously i havent fully recovered yet. 

  
idk if anyone can relate pls send some support my way. maybe even good stories of good therapist who stayed with you through a split. or advice so that i can preemptively prepare. i really just want to recover and go into remission but its so, so much harder than it seems. like just going to therapy and implementing it doesnt magically make everything better. and in my case it made it worse for a period of time.

136,How tf am I supposed to afford therapy?!,"In a few years I have to get my own insurance but I don‚Äôt want to go through my parents insurance because the ones that take out insurance are literal garbage humans. For context, through age 14-17 I was going to this one practice (the only one that took out insurance in our area) and the people kept leaving. Either they quit, switched locations or took a break to have kids. I would get to knowing one just for them to leave me. Not only that but the last one I had didn‚Äôt believe I was raped and said I was just 14 year old at a Catholic school who regretted losing their virginity.

I‚Äôm 23 now and I finally hit a point where it‚Äôs either I get help or I end up an addict to a substance. And my cravings for things to give my mind a damn break is becoming stronger, it‚Äôs to the point I‚Äôm actively seeking out places and people to buy from. 

And getting help I need is expensive and someone recommended better help because it was affordable for them. I took the stupid quiz and it‚Äôs $67 a fucking week. I make only $300-$340 per damn check. I don‚Äôt think I prioritize my damn mental health that much because money is more important rn. I‚Äôd rather have at least one god damn meal a day and to be able to get to and from work so I can make more meaningless money just to do the cycle over again and not have anywhere to fucking go from there. 

So for the person who told me better help was affordable, go fuck yourself you piece of bitch. And yeah I can put my parents insurance in but I don‚Äôt feel like them asking what‚Äôs going on with me when they get the damn statement from the insurance. And even then it‚Äôs still would be like $40-$50 a week. It‚Äôs not worth it.

This is exactly why I fucking gaslight myself saying I‚Äôm not that bad but know deep down it really fucking is.

I really want to repair things,  but I don't know how, considering I don't know how I could have avoided it . 

I've been extremely stressed lately.  A lot of things I can typically do to cope aren't options at the moment.  I'm recovering from a major surgery and I haven't been the easiest to be around.

Then Ativan,  which made me act extremely out of character and   I could have put my friends life at risk .I could have lost everything. 

Chat GPT gave me better advice than any therapist I've had , gave me reassurance that things will work out okay if I put the effort in to repairthings ,and gave me plenty of solutions on how to navigate this not just socially but therapeutically too.

Everyone‚Äôs processing is different, and the written word is a funky thing to approach in the digital age. I think it solves some of the issues of BPD processing for me. Decision making and information processing gets muddled with emotional confusion and trauma response in BPD. For me, creating an extra step of putting my thoughts on the page allows me to separate some of that emotion and confusion, and I can better trace my line of thought to follow clearer reasoning, following the facts and not jumping to conclusions. When I can read back to remember why I even started down a certain thought, it orients me from spiraling into some crisis. It gets a lot more existential as processing big feelings turns exceptionally philosophical when you follow a thought through its full potential, not getting overly distracted by the flashes of emotion along the way. It has therefore allowed me to do some true healing. I think the existential questions are what has worked best for me in these areas for real change: I have to define my values to have the strength to get better. I have to decide what it is I want to become. Why I want to become it. And how I‚Äôm going to get there to make real change in my life.

147,DBT group therapy (Help please) tw.,"Hi,

Making this post to hopefully gain some perspective and understanding.  
I was admitted to a psyciatric hospital last year, due to an attempt and was diagnosed with bpd. The diagnosis explained a lot for me, and I finally understood why life had always been so painful for me. I've now been in both individual and group DBT which has been running consistently besides each other, for almost a half year. I'm done with the modules by the end of this year.  
I feel like some of it has helped me a lot, as far as self destructive behaviours, fact checking, and crisis management but I feel like I'm far from feeling healed and everyday still feels like a battle. Group therapy has been a struggle lately, and it has been like that (on and off) since I was halfway trough it. I don't know why, but at some point I started dissociating in there and now I do it pretty much every time. I had one session where it was my turn to talk about the homework we had done that week and I felt like I was about to go into a full blown panic attack. I still don't know why that happened to me.  
I do know that I keep having negative thoughts while being in there for example: ''Nobody in here likes me'' ''I can't contribute with anything'' ''They are probably judging me'' ''If I say this does that make me sound stupid'' and it keeps on spiraling from there. I get so incredibly anxious and I feel like I'm reminded about past times in my life. And then I dissociate. It has made me feel like I'm not gaining anything from group therapy anymore, because I'm simply not there mentally and I'm struggling to bring myself back with mindfulness as soon as I've already dissociated. Lately I feel like many of my symptoms have swung back on me, and I'm starting to go home from therapy feeling worse than when I went in. I feel like such a failure and that I'm probably an expection. Therapy won't work for me and I won't ever get better. I feel like no one else in there shares this particularly struggle with me.

152,Afraid to start therapy,"I finally made an appointment to see a therapist starting next week. That's a good thing, right? Except now I'm having second thoughts.

I'm afraid that while getting help and guidance for navigating my disorder may make me a happier person, it won't make me a better one. I pretty much fall into the quiet type of BPD, I turn everything inward and devalue myself. I know my maladaptive strategies have negative effects on my family (I'm a married woman with two kids, and I'm not always successful in hiding how miserable I am from them). But I'm afraid that if I start to think of myself as a more ""worthy"" person, I will become selfish and won't give as much to others as I do now. I don't want to become even more of a burden on the people that I love than I already am.

I'm also afraid that by going to see a therapist, I'm taking a space from someone else who needs help more than I do (reading this sub has both been validating to me as it shows that I'm not alone in many of my experiences, but I also see so many people who are suffering more than I am, so what right do I have to complain?)

I feel like if I could just be stronger, I could keep holding it all in, I could just squish my wants and needs down to nothing and be only what others need me to be. I know that's unhealthy and maladaptive--and a crummy example to set for my kids, too--but my self-worth is so low it feels ""right.""

I've been to 7 sessions in 7 weeks, but I'm still clueless. How is therapy going to help me? Am I supposed to be going towards something? What am I supposed to do?

*I haven't been diagnosed officially for BPD, I've been seeing a psychiatrist, they help me with my adhd and ocd and I've seen them for over an year, they informally diagnosed me by asking me about the 9 dsm v symptoms. I've also self diagnosed bpd, I'm pretty sure i have it.
I stumbled onto a sponsorship for therapy, So I took it, and I've been going to therapy since, with the goal of treating BPD, atleast in my mind. Also, The therapist I'm seeing is actually recommended by alot of people I know, and they're pretty good. They have also talked with my psychiatrist about me.* 

The thing is, everytime I go and have a session- I talk about what's going on in my life and mostly about my past. The relationships I've had with different people etc. I talk about my behavior patterns, I have expressed to them a rage, BUT. I don't see how it helps!? 
My therapist just asks questions and advises me to do things and tries to validate my feelings, but most of the time I don't need it. I think we're just aimlessly talking about things and I don't exactly like that lol, i mean sure they're nice to talk to but still..

I'm not diagnosed yet and my psychiatrist believes I do have BPD because I meet the criteria for a diagnosis, I just don't know what to do anymore bc I feel helpless.

I feel like the adhd meds' current dosage is low, but my psychiatrist refuses to increase it back at 36mg because she claims that I don't need that high of a dosage.

I wanted to ask which therapy method really helped you with your BPD.

180,Mentalisation Based Therapy,"Hello all

I'm meant to be starting MBT this summer and I'm not totally sure what to expect. I know it was designed for people with BPD and can be used for some other issues as well, and the psychotherapy team I've been working with has said it's quite effective. I've obviously looked it up a bit online but was hoping someone here had maybe had a firsthand experience. 

It's been delayed by a few months, but I've been told now it'll likely start in the summer. I'll get 12 weeks of once weekly group seasons at 90 minutes each, and then if thay goes well I'll continue with the same group sessions each week as well as a once weekly individual session at 50 minutes each for an 18 month period. 

It may end up getting dekayed again as NHS Glasgow need to fill up the spots for the group session before it can start, but hopefully it won't take too long. I'm really quite grateful I'm being given this opportunity.

186,Therapy makes me suicidal,"It doesn't matter whether a session went okay or really bad, whether I could communicate normally with my therapist or was just raging and crying, whether I felt understood or not - a few hours later I will break down and crumble with rage, panic, self-hatred and suicidal thoughts. I basically split on her after every session. I am then convinced that she was lying to me, finds my problems pathetic and me disgusting, hopes that I will kill myself so she can focus on the patients she likes instead of wasting time on me. I'm convinced that I am just a faceless number to her, that she forgets everything I say, does not understand me and doesn't even try, because it's too annoying and exhausting to deal with that BPD-craziness. I am sure she forgets I exist and forgets my name the second I leave her office.

All that is obviously bad enough. But what's almost worse is that it makes me realize that I will never ever get better. Because all these things I feel after a session are obviously the (BPD)-things I usually felt when in a (romantic) relationship and that made me get help in the first place. But the *help* makes me feel exactly the same way. After 5 or 6 days with no contact I feel calmer or numb (just like after a break-up); I see her again and the pain/rage/doubts and suicidal thoughts are back.

It's a vicious cycle since, what should help me, actually destroys me since it makes me realize that I cannot be helped.

(And yes, I did discuss it with her a million times; she tried to reassure me, tried to ease my fears and worries - it helps for a few moments, but the second I'm home it's all gone and I'm sure she just lied to me and doesn't give a shit. And yes, I've experienced exactly the same with other therapists in the past, so it isn't her - it's me being unable to handle relationships.

The problem is that I have an extremely negative attitude about it and don't want to do it. I already don't like the group leader. Plus, the group is a part of a substance use facility, so there is a bunch of other rules I have to follow even though I don't have a substance use problem. 

For excample, I can't drink or do any drugs ever. I'm not following this rule though because I don't have a problem with substances (I only do them maybe 2 a month) and I do them responsibly. I don't see why I need to stop.

I'm also trying to really enjoy life more and make up for lost time and experiences I've missed out on. I'm getting married soon and have a lot of other fun things going on this year, some of which include drinking or occassionally drugs. I'd be extremely upset to not be able to do these things just because of a support group. 

To make things worse, they can drug test me if they think I'm doing some kind of substance. I'm going to refuse to do a drug test because they have to watch me pee and will absolutly flip my shit if that happens so I'm just not going to do that. However, this will likely result in me being kicked out. 

It just feels like I'm be punished and viewed as a bad person who can't make responsible decisions. 

The threat that I could be kicked out at any moment also looms over my head and, as you can imagine, for somebody who has abandonment and rejection issues, this isn't going to feel like a safe enviroment. It doesn't help that I have to hide that I occasionally drink or use drugs (just weed 98% of the time). 

I just don't know how to change my very negative attitude about it. It doesn't feel like I'm joining a group to better myself, but more like I'm being punished and that I need to be baby sat to make sure I'm living my life by somebody else's rules. 

Any advice?

I‚Äôm currently taking a Masters course on psychedelics and mental health and it‚Äôs crazy how there as objective changes in your brain that occur and sets the perfect mental framework to be more receptive and open during therapy. I have tried drugs recreationally, but I‚Äôm specifically looking to find practitioners who are certified in psychedelic assisted therapy AND trauma informed therapy. There has been a lot of clinical trials on this topic but I‚Äôm struggling to find places where I can do this atm. I would literally fly wherever I could find someone who could help me.

211,does anyone else with bpd struggle to stay in therapy?,"20f with bpd/autism/adhd here; I‚Äôve tried CBT multiple times in the past and never been able to stay in therapy for more than 2 months. 

i was diagnosed with bpd in october of 2023, and all my past experiences with therapy were prior to this diagnosis. i struggle a lot with recall, and never really know what to bring up in therapy. i have some complex trauma related to the undiagnosed autism/one helicopter parent with undiagnosed bipolar (and maybe bpd as well)/one emotionally absent parent, but it‚Äôs hard for me to really talk about it because i invalidate my own trauma. i guess impostor syndrome since i developed it but my siblings didn‚Äôt? who knows..

 i‚Äôm pretty self aware (to the point of over analyzing every action i take) so i don‚Äôt have as many issues as i used to, but i know i still should be in therapy because things definitely still come up. for example getting overly anxious in my relationship and then splitting and snapping on him. but i‚Äôve gotten a lot better than i used to be, and it makes me feel like i don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù therapy. 

does anyone else struggle with this? i know logically that i need therapy and i go through this cycle of
( something bad happens>i respond very poorly and blow up my life (quit jobs, end relationships, drop my classes)>realize i need therapy>go through the process of finding therapist/starting>start therapy and struggle to find things to talk about>feel like i don‚Äôt need therapy and quit going )

212,Types of therapy,"I started therapy a month ago and we still haven't started the actual therapy. The whole time has pretty much been trying to figure out what approach to use. I have many ""layers"" (BPD, ADHD, PTSD,  CPTSD, autism, and generalized anxiety disorder though I think the anxiety is just the combination of everything else rather than a separate condition). I'm also very high masking and internalize everything so I need to learn how to let go and thing out rather than to control outward symptoms.  
The plan right now is to start with parts therapy and go from there. I intellectualize everything so I think EMDR would also be helpful but my therapist worries that it could retraumatize.

She says it'll take a long time and a lot of practice at the same time she keeps repeating, ""Do you really want people to have this power over you?"".

214,My gf finally agreed to go to therapy,"Almost a year of support, that's what I gave her and I don't regret it, she has BPD but is the most wonderful, smart, nice person I know. It wasn't always easy but we made it and last week she told me she agreed to go to therapy and I'm so happy for that, I'm getting ready to support her and go through this with her when she needs my help, because I know it won't be easy for her (she already gave up on therapy once). But, at her rythm, we're gonna beat BPD together.

At the beginning she told me to run away from her, we went through tears, anger, joy, all the emotions possible, I had to learn a lot about BPD, learn how to react and how to talk in a way that wouldn't hurt her, she even blocked me once during a crisis, but I couldn't lose her, we spent hours talking that night and everything was fixed. The only thing needed is patience, but being in a relationship with someone who has BPD is totally worth it, she's so pure. And I just think that when you learn about BPD and take time to understand the emotions people who have BPD go through, you just discover a new world and as a bf, it's my role to bring her the happiness, the support and the love she deserves. Sometimes listening is all it takes, when she needs to talk about her problems or something that triggered her, I'm here, and seeing her smile when she's done talking, because she feel better, is all I need.

I'm gonna pay for her therapy but I can't do this alone, it's gonna be very expensive, I share with you the link of the crowdfunding I made for her treatment if you want to help me.

Thanks for taking time to read this, if you have BPD, I know it's not easy sometimes but don't give up, there are people out there that just want to help you and, step by step, when you let them do, they can change your life in the good way. If you're in a relationship with someone having BPD, it's not gonna be always easy, but be patient and take time to learn about this, and you'll experience the purest kind of love you ever had.

they went over dbt skills and i found it so repetitive it's stuff i already knew and it didnt help me whatsoever. it was difficult to engage because i was also feeling too bad and the setup was awful, with sessions getting cancelled all the time.

i tried to put it into practice but it didnt make me feel any better, it was stuff i was already doing and was not helping. i kept an open mind but then they started bringing up using worhsip to help and i have intense religious trauma and it was awful to listen to.

after it ended i asked for a review call (which they offer to figure out next steps) and they havent replied to me since. i found out that further referrals from them take at least 1.5 yrs to access 1-1 therapy. i cant go on that long i really cant. 

i asked to be put on mood stabilisers because antidepressants have not worked one bit and my gp sent it to them but they just said 'engage with therapy it is clinically-proven to help' but the sessions have ended and im lost on what to do now. i dont know how long it'll take to access further help.",1697452707.0,False,1,4,lemongrenul,user has bpd,17930d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/17930d9/therapy_not_working_lost_on_what_to_do/

We initially thought it was going to be virtual, but I got a text saying it was in-person, and my partner suddenly got very excited.

I am petrified with fear. I cannot stop playing out scenarios where we explode, argue, break up, and he‚Äôs  letting everything out at me on the 1 hr drive home. Granted I would deserve all of it. He would know that I have to keep myself composed and would have to just take everything they have to say without getting upset, and I deeply fear that this will happen.

221,realistic expectations about therapy,"hello :) so after a long time of back and forths and switching healthcare providers and inpatient stays and changing diagnosies i finally found a psychiatrist i feel comfortable with and we re did all the diagnostics and i have BPD (unsurprisingly). 
i have.. i‚Äôd say a quite intense form of it? i show symptoms of other disorders as well, including PTSD, a lighter form of DID i guess (still figuring that out), and more, but essentially all the symptoms are caused by BPD itself (my psych. has a really good way of explaining it). 

saying this, what can i expect from therapy? i feel like everyone i hear from on this sub and otherwise who claims to be in remissions is working out daily, meditating, no social media, has no romantic relationships & is highly focused on their work but.. i mean i can understand how such a lifestyle can limit the effects of BPD and basically alleviate symptoms but like.. 

thats not the life i want. i want a life with close friendships that i can have trust in, have a stable and very close relationship (this is really really important to me), focus on things i enjoy, not on work and meditation and limiting my social life and following strict rules and limits in order to accomplish the ‚Äòremission‚Äô. i want a normal life.. and honestly if living the way i want means that i will never truly go into remission and will always show symptoms thats kinda of okay with me i suppose? like.. what effects can i expect from therapy without severely restricting myself in ways i don‚Äôt want to. i want to stay in touch with my emotions and listen to them, let them guide me, not meditate and rationalize everything away into neat little boxes and bury them under work and tight schedules. maybe i have an skewed view of how remission works but i feel like most examples i‚Äôve read about involved these things.. and i‚Äôm not sure if achieving full remission and ‚Äòfreeing myself‚Äô of BPD is worth submitting myself to a lifestyle that seems controlling and restrictive to me.

i‚Äôd love to hear some of your perspectives and experiences :)

228,Do I need BPD Therapy?,"I self-diagnosed myself with depression at a very early age due to traumatic things that happened in my life; lots of acting out, self-harm, verbally abusive in relationships.

When I was slightly older, I was diagnosed with epilepsy, this had a huge impact on my life as it changed every facet of my life from my work/university to even how I felt as a man (wetting the bed and in college at age 20 is pretty embarrassing). Because of this, I was diagnosed with depression and began therapy, I only had 12 sessions and they weren't beneficial in the slightest; it seemed like the therapist didn't know what I wanted to talk about.

Later in October last year I had 3 seizures in one day in London causing me to have major brain trauma, major concussion, two skull and two jaw fractures and blood clots under my eyes, the doctor thought it would be a good idea to tell me I was lucky to be alive, which rested well on my consciousüôÉ.

I had to have two months off work as my brain simply didn't work, I couldn't remember questions thay were asked 10 seconds prior.

I then went for more therapy as I think the physical and mental trauma of this event has caused me some minor PTSD (waking up in cold sweats, almost having panic attacks when thinking about the event). This therapy was so helpful and really pinpointed areas in my life where I was going wrong and how I could improve myself and those around me.

But obviously, as soon as the therapy stopped. The drugs returned and the self loathing, its this demasculating thought that im not a real man and could just drop dead at any minute.

The main problem is when I'm feeling good, I'm on top of the world and nothing could bring me down. I feel like the world is literally my oyster. I love my family, friends, nature, work, EVERYTHING!!! And then...this is what makes me think it could be BPD.

231,Should I get into Therapy again?,"Hi, 

Storytime. I was in therapy for 5 years. With the help of meditation and medication, I managed to get a sense of purpose and meaning in life. I became a buddhist. And that allowed me to see a lot of things very clealry. All the emotional instability, all the agenda that people had in every interaction. Through a mix of DBT techniques and psychodynamic therapy, I gradually took control of my life. 

Then COVID happened. Therapy stopped. I was still largely in control, but over time, I stopped practicing the skills, I forgot a lot of things. And now, it is like one step forward and two steps back. I dont have emotional dysregulation, in fact, I dont care about anything. No motivation at all. 

Everytime I speak to someone, they say that I need to start small. I love walking. So maybe they say that is something I can start with. And then over time, I can build mastery. 

I don't want to die, but I am tired of life. 

I cant decide. Should I go back to therapy. Because whyen I do try a therapist, they tell me most of what I already know. Am I missing practicing the skills? Should I just spend time relearning?

Please share stories of successful skills  and successes you‚Äôve had in couples therapy so I can stop catastrophizing. Any tips for feeling rejected and unwanted also welcome!

234,Looking for good resources/therapy,"hey, first time making a reddit post ever, I'm just looking for advice. My BPD is getting worse and it's interfering with my daily life and I'm afraid it's going to interfere with my relationship more than it has in my mind. I'm looking for any good resources or therapy options, preferably something on the cheaper side since I'm not making much money as of right now.

235,Therapy anger,"I just got done with a therapy session and my therapist made me mad on purpose. I told him what he was doing to make me upset (basically invalidating what I was saying) and used that as a point to push me to cry. He said that expressing myself that way was good because I tend to keep things locked up and maybe anger was the way to express freely. Because otherwise he doesn‚Äôt know how to guide me. He said he was proud of me for being angry at him and showing emotion. But I feel like this is very manipulative (which I know therapist are in some ways). I feel very unstable and unheard. I feel like I was left with this weight of emotion that I don‚Äôt know how to navigate. And I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm supposed to be continuing with him, because maybe he is right? Idk. I‚Äôm just a mess now",1678755389.0,False,2,0,Wonderful-Ad3576,None,11qrusw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/11qrusw/therapy_anger/
236,Why is it that no therapy is helping me? I've tried several therapists and therapies and I still feel like sh*t everyday.,"I have no purpose in my life, I'm tired of everything, I just want my life to pass everyday. Which it does, because I've been doing it for 10+ years and now I'm 31. This is getting nowhere. I have NPD and BPD traits, I'm basically a chameleon, identity diffusion with a bad self image and constant self depreciation. I could go into lengths about how it came about but my problem is that no single therapist seems to really understand how and why I suffer. I probably have ADHD too, which makes my brain work at like 20% its capacity, I'm unable to focus on stuff and forget lots of things really quickly. And nobody ever told me about all of this, basically everything I have to untangle on my own with a lot of mental work and therapists often misunderstand me. I'm just tired of it. They are not effective at helping me find the cause of my unconscious fears and maladaptive behaviours, they don't seem to understand how identity diffusion is affecting me, how I behave contrary to how I want to behave, how I feel that my real self is trapped beneath and my decisions don't reflect my real wants, why I undermine my own life out of fears, etc. I wish so bad that they saw past the horizon and say something like *'I have to stop you there, because this is not the real you I'm talking to right now. This is not you. Your maladaptive behaviours, your lack of faith in yourself have taken over. These thoughts don't reflect what you truly are and what you really want'* \- because that's what I really feel. I don't know how to represent my real self. My real self disappears really quickly and we should work on how to find and strengthen it. And I wish someone understood that intuitively.
