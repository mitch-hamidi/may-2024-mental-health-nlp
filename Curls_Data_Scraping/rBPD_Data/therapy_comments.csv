2,"BPD is notoriously difficult to treat by talk therapy. Unfortunately, very few people specialize in it and have the proper training to handle the emotional weight and potential legal implications that come with interacting with pwBPD. Many therapists make it a point to not take on pwBPD as clients. pwBPD have an exceptionally high rate of suing their mental health providers. While pwNPD are unlikely to seek therapy, pwBPD are more likely to experience tremendous difficulties during.

7,"She sounds like a bad therapist. And in my experience, the bad ones far outweigh the good.

It‚Äôs controversial but I think psychotherapy is mostly bullshit. I‚Äôve got far more from books that deal with the precise forms of therapy I require, particularly DBT. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs helped some a lot, but I think therapy mostly helps those without mental illness per se, who just want to vent about work and life generally.

14,"Tbh I found therapy very useless but then again I can't afford private and so had NHS CBT which was largely patronising BS of the sort you'd find on a Buzzfeed list about improving your mental health.¬†


DBT I waited a year for and the therapist was genuinely disinterested and mostly spoke about herself which was utterly weird and as I understand completely unprofessional. I think crap therapists sadly work for the NHS because they aren't good enough to go private where the 'big bucks' are.¬†¬†


I actually improved the most via self-realisation, devouring every well received self-help book connected to BPD (written by professional specialists), meditation with purpose, EMDR (via an app), *very cautious and infrequent* use of THC, using nicotine pouches, nature walks, getting physically fit and healthy, getting a pet, and developing several FPs so I dilute myself between them and therefore annoy them less.¬†¬†


I'm still not 'normal'. I still have occasional meltdowns but usually only when alone, however my life generally is way better than 15 years ago when I literally wanted to kill myself daily.

25,"Therapy has been always BS for me. I never found the right one and i have seen people say that alot. My parents stopped it anyway because it's expensive and we can't afford it (should have thought before traumatizing me) but yes it wasn't really helping too but my psychiatrist who gave me the diagnosis was really someone i looked up to i would msg him in my breakdowns and he would acknowledge them in the next meeting but since it has now been an year he has given up too. He is like yes that's what happens in bpd that's nothing out of box. So? You want me to do something that is concerning for people to help me out. The designated people. 
I have been on these fucking stupid ssri and bzd for 8 years and my body throws up at the thought of a tablet.

I also found out if you do the cheap/""sliding"" scale stuff, you aren't even getting a therapist, it's most likely a social worker. Doesn't make sense to be kicked out of therapy if I didn't have a therapist to begin with.¬†",GothicBland,1c51zji
36,"This. I've found self-help books written by global authorities (active researchers taking an evidence based approach) on BPD / DBT to be *way* more helpful than talking therapies. Genuinely gotten the most self-improvement from them.¬†¬†¬†¬†


That said, I can't afford private therapy, and so have only used public health therapists in the UK (NHS). I think they are probably crap *because* they work for the NHS; otherwise they'd be doing private work for *a lot* more money.¬†¬† ¬†


I do get the impression also that the vast majority of psychotherapy is rooted in unscientific BS and will be laughed at in 50 years time, the way we laugh about dunking mentally ill people in ice cold baths then scorching hot baths to 'cure' them, which was considered 'cutting edge' by psychiatric hospitals in the 1940s etc.¬†",Illustrious_Guava_8,1c51zji

40,"100% why I've continued therapy for the last decade, even though I've gotten progressively worse somehow. I am much more knowledgeable about psychology in general that I used to be, but have just been relearning the same shit over and over. I've done group, intense outpatient, 1:1, so much CBT & DBT. I get it, I get the concept, but my brain can't grasp how to actually use any of this in my real life. I've tried SO SO SO many therapists, social workers, psychologists‚Ä¶more knowledge, or same old shit. My brain just reverts to unhealthy coping mechanisms, emotional irregularity with the biggest chance of rumination and anxiety. I love hearing when therapy does help someone with BPD...unfortunately I hear more stories like ours, than success stories ever. It sucks cause I got diagnosed a decade ago now, and they had told me the only treatment for BPD was therapy...and that at best, I would need it consistently for 10 years to get better. Welp, I am worse than I started out 10 years ago. I will do it to appease my loved ones though. Maybe one day I will be able to make the connection in my brain on how to apply everything I've learned in therapy‚Ä¶but I don't have high hopes. ü•∫",lsant1986,1c51zji
41,"It's hard to do group therapy. I get it, we need to find the others, yada yada. I get ut, I really do. But for me, I've been held back by people for most of my life. People have held me back in group because they aren't feeling it, or they aren't serious about therapy. It was very much a school setting, which I never did well with in the first place. I'm struggling to accept group because I don't want someone's bad day making my therapy session useless. It costs money and if I got nothing out of group that day, I paid for nothing. I'm even more frustrated because I'm supposed to be here and learning things just for someone I don't know not putting in the effort when they eventually pair us together or put us in groups to learn about skills that are *very important*. It feels super half-assed to me (don't know any other way to put it) because we don't know the skills and because there's not enough therapists or helpers or whatever, we don't learn it correctly because we've never done these skills.¬†


I'm tired of being pit in the pack just to fail. I explicitly dropped out of school because I couldn't keep up. Group therapy is a copy of this.¬†",GothicBland,1c51zji
42,"I feel ya. I tried DBT group. Wasn't for me. They required cameras on and I'm not able to handle that. I told them it was actually painful and disrupting to me to have it on.

43,"I didn't think I could either, but I actually liked it better than 1:1 therapy. I went in person and the first couple of times were terrifying of course, but actually being able to sit and listen to what others were going through, how they handled it, and getting their perspectives on the things I chose to share was so helpful. Not the least having a group of people always supporting me and listening to me with absolutely zero judgement. I honestly think everybody should have a therapy group, I miss it.

47,"I got dropped as a patient when I had a very serious attempt on my life. This was prior to an official BPD diagnosis, but that was actually what led to my diagnosis. Therapist that dropped me did so cause she didn't see the signs...and it culminated in her having to start therapy for herself. Yeah, I didn't see the signs earlier, it was impulsive after months of bad shit just happening over and over, just going from bad, to worse, to miserable, to helpless/hopeless. The night I OD'd on Prescription medicine, my sister had told me that I was ruining my parents lives, that it was supposed to be their golden years...and they were still stuck with an adult child that couldn't figure life out. She told me that it'd be better if I just killed myself, things would be so much easier for parents. I love my parents more than anything in this world, and I was already in a bad place...it just made me believe that she was absolutely right. I had just gotten my mail order delivery of my 2 slow release blood pressure meds that day‚Ä¶3 months worth of both prescriptions. I was also on the highest doses of each med. I took all 180 pills, and went to sleep. I woke up from a coma in the Neuro ICU a month later.",lsant1986,1c51zji
48,"Oh yeah it's total BS. The reality is, psychology degrees are largely about the science behind mental illness rather than the methods for treating it. This is true of a lot of degrees. You learn almost nothing that you can actually apply in your job. Hence, psychologists will just recycle what they read in a CBT book or fill half a session with meditation, which are things you can do solo.

It actually angers me. I think mental illness comes with a lot of buzz words and there's a notion of taking care of yourself or being in touch with yourself if you go to therapy. But for a lot of us who suffer, speaking to someone for 1 hour a week is unlikely to do much.

Also, a lot of the DBT courses etc. are so dumbed down. They have to tailor to everyone, I get it, but they feel like grade 10 intro courses to your feelings. Literally, just take meds.",Warm_Vacation,1c51zji

And I hate being told, ""well you just gotta keep at it!"" like you know how much money and how much time has been put into this??? I don't wanna keep trying and taking up therapists time when someone else can find comfort in it. Im in the same boat as you when it comes to trying all the different types of therapy. I've even tried religion just because I see so many people benefit from it, but I don't get it, I keep poking holes in their ""logic"" (sorry, I don't mean to be rude, I really wish it helped me). 

Something that helped me was researching the chemical compounds (or connections or something) and how your brain work during episodes or panic attacks. I found comfort in breaking it down. Trauma therapy (exposure therapy) has helped greatly too because I just got so tired of talking about it.

This might be an off-the-wall suggestion, but it took me about 9 years to even be ready to commit to therapy.

I found a bit of control in my life by doing a ton of research on the disorder and watching a ton of YouTube channels catered to BPD until I found a few that clicked. I also watched other therapists whose message resonated with me.

Managing stress is #1 to managing my symptoms, and I've found vagal nerve exercises, deep breathing, and getting enough sleep to be enough to make quite a difference.

DBT is supposedly effective treatment for BPD. I bought the client workbook *and* the teaching workbook. 

Since we deal with a lot of interpersonal conflicts and sometimes feel worse feeling judged or criticized, this DIY approach really made me confident enough to stick with therapy.

That's not to say DBT is the only option though, there are other types of therapy that can be of use. 

I will say that personally, what you'd think of as ""typical talk therapy"" doesn't really help me. The types of sessions where you just kinda talk about what's currently going on/bothering you. It's too easy to beat around the bush, and often I never really get much input on what I can do about them. They might sympathize, but it's not goal directed enough for me to make any real progress, and it's way too easy for me to gain control of the dynamic and derail the sessions so I never make any progress. 

I've had plenty of skills and strategies presented to me, that I think come from other modalities like CBT, and I have a hard time with them. I think because they're a little more logic focused, and because I guess my BPD doesn't match therapy logic, I've never really gotten anywhere with these sorts of approaches. The analytical approach is just kinda incompatible with how my BPD works. I usually feel invalidated by what I'm being asked to do.

I haven't done full DBT either, as I can't afford the out if pocket cost, but the few strategies I have from it have helped more than anything else from my 4 years of therapy experience. The distress tolerance skills feel more validating to my experience, as the goal is to accept my feelings and work through them and with them, hopefully in a healthier way.

6,I don't how to tell them without sounding needy or clingy. And kinda worries me that if this therapy doesn't help then I might lise some of my support network and go back right to the very beginning.,Complex-Society7355,1con2ek
7,Like I said in the post I have been reccomended PDCS (personality disorder community service) idk if its essentially dbt. But I can show you the leaflet thingy I was given about this.,Complex-Society7355,1con2ek
8,It‚Äôs not clingy to ask for information about services that are being offered to you :) You need to ask what the pros and cons are of joining this therapy and if losing your other services will affect you. Asking is a responsible thing to do and means you are advocating for yourself and your health. üíú,ejdhdhdff,1con2ek
9,"ü§î Ok I can understand that. I know it feels scary. I would suggest rather than say things verbally to them, maybe make a small list of questions on a sheet of paper, you can ask them to read the list, then, you can ask them to please write down the answer or allow you to write their answers as they verbalize them. Then, after that, ask them to read the answers you wrote to make sure that you both understand what they are saying and the intention of the words in their answers. For example you can write down: 

Who
What
Where
Why
When
How

Who is saying/asking that you to loose the other two people who are helping with your care if you decide to take the therapy?

What makes them feel that this will be more beneficial than having all three to help you continue your mental health care journey?

Etc

Then if they say "" My supervisor believes you have made great improvements since we started your program and would like to see if we can improve further."" You can write that down and re-read it whenever you are feeling anxious or uncertain. 

And any time that you feel like you are getting into your own headspace, you can bring that list with you and ask them to please reiterate for you verbally again. 

I know it's scary to have changes to a set pattern you have established, but remember that the therapy is truly there to help you to be functional throughout your day and allow you to navigate uncomfortable feelings with coping mechanisms and strategies.",wannabe_wonder_woman,1con2ek

0,"Well (not to sound ‚Äúsmart‚Äù) considering that‚Äôs their career, I would expect them to be paid. Now, given the cost of the education, amount of work, and the long years it takes to get a degree in MH, they would have some level of dedication to the MH field. Non-caring or non-empathetic people don‚Äôt typically choose this career path even for the money. You‚Äôll run into therapists, etc. who are burned out and if it‚Äôs the end of the day or week, it could account for the ‚Äúcareless‚Äù vibe. There are different therapy styles you may do better with, and not every therapist can meet your expectations, so you may need to find a different one or give this person a chance if it hasn‚Äôt been long. You can ‚Äútest the water‚Äù by sharing your daily/weekly struggles before digging deeper into trauma history in case you need to find a different one. That way you won‚Äôt have to reshare/relive your traumas over and over.

Non-caring or non-empathetic people don‚Äôt typically choose this career path for the money, but because it‚Äôs fulfilling. It takes a special kind of person to sit there and listen to people go on about their problems and help them. I think the same goes for special education teachers. They do what they do because it‚Äôs fulfilling. Ask your therapist why they wanted take this career path and what good does it do for them.

0,"I'm in therapy. One thing that I can say is DO NOT LIE TO YOUR THERAPIST. I know a lot of people with BPD that are so concerned that their counselor won't like them or will think they're a piece of shit that they hide things from them. Remember, it's not their job to like you or judge you, it's to help you help yourself. They can't do that if you're not honest with them or yourself.

Also, whatever you don't want to talk about is probably exactly what you need to talk about.

38,"Yup, super dangerous game. A lot of people just wind up more stressed from their counseling because they just sit there and mask for an hour.

Lying or omitting things only delays your progress so it hurts you. Building a good relationship with your therapist is an important step too",RevelNlife51,nmcsad
40,"It might take some practice opening up. Especially if you spend a lot of time masking. It might be worthwhile to try to open up just a little at first and see how it goes. You don't have to jump off the highdive right away. You can practice.

Also, it's worth shopping around for a therapist that makes you feel comfortable. The process is honestly hard even when you're with someone that makes you comfortable, so don't waste your time trying to force chemistry/the feeling of safety when it doesn't exist.

I like to think of myself as someone who's constantly battling demons. I want people on my side who I have confidence in, otherwise it's just added stress and more money to pay.",,nmcsad

44,"Lamotrigine helped as the first Ned I was successfully put on. It helped with stabilizing my up and downs to a degree but I was still very depressed and having constant debilitating panic attacks lasting for up to six hours and trips to emerg in the middle of the night as I used to wake up with them. I was put on escitalopram and that made my depression so much better!! But still emerg trips. I had to take clonazepam from family as the docs wouldn‚Äôt prescribe it to me and they‚Äôre strict here in NS, Canada about benzodiazepines, although emerg would always send me home with several. So after a few months of having to get those from family and on the street (I was desperate, I have an 11yo and it was 100% physically debilitating; I could barely talk let alone think or stay still. Puking every two to five minutes, pacing and crying/moaning and shaking and sweating bullets and just pacing aimlessly sometimes to the bathroom as I also had diarrhea. It was fucking hell man. Then my doctor finally listened and put me on buspirone and it helped immensely. I never had to take another benzo from the first day I took it. No withdrawal as I was only taking enough clonazepam to function and basically it was a safety net ensuring I didn‚Äôt have to go to emerg with my daughter with me‚Ä¶ which luckily never happened. I have never let anyone see me at my worst state that way as I am not myself and it is terrifying. Anyway, I‚Äôm properly medicated now! I don‚Äôt even get flutters  anymore unless it‚Äôs something legitimately dangerous or embarrassing and obv when I get overwhelmed etc‚Ä¶ this calmness has enabled me to focus more on therapy. Not speaking to one yet but I did before for many years. I can‚Äôt wait to get into DBT therapy. I think it will make a big difference!

9. I became financially and (somewhat) personally independent.

All the work that goes into fixing you is actually done by yourself. Friends and family support you along the way, but they can‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù you either. 


Therapy is there to help you understand yourself and the problem, and offer guidance on what actions to take like DBT or CBT. Then you implement what you learned outside of therapy and practice enough to relearn how you respond to triggers. Therapy is usually an hour or two a week, at most. There‚Äôs no way that can be some magical ‚Äúfix‚Äù for anyone with significant mental health struggles that accumulated over years.

I read that you decided to try again, I hope it'll go better this time.
You can do some work on your own by reading this book ""Reinventing Your Life"" by Janet S. Klosko and Jeffrey Young.
It's practically a manual based on the schema therapy, helpful for everyone trying to improve their life and overcome maladaptive schemas rooted in childhood, and suggested primarily for pwbpd.
You can gain perspective and understand what you really struggle with and why.

You can also take a look on YT channels of Patrick Teahan, a therapist for childhood trauma and HealthyGamerGG, a psychiatrist who faces all kind of problems in his videos. They're really helpful and not all talk.

Hope it helps!",Living4Hope,197nmzk

Focusing just on this part of your comment, what do you mean? There are definitely unhealthy coping mechanisms, but you *have* to develop healthy ones to get to a better place.

Things like progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, journaling, breathing exercises are all means of coping with the painful symptoms we experience.

0,"It‚Äôs wonderful to hear that you‚Äôve found a comforting strategy with your dog‚Äôs help! Deep Pressure Therapy (DPT) provided by pets can indeed be a soothing way to manage anxiety and emotional dysregulation. The weight and warmth from your dog can naturally stimulate the release of serotonin and dopamine‚Äîneurochemicals that help regulate mood and relaxation.

Your experience beautifully illustrates the power of connecting with pets and the comfort they can provide. This type of therapy isn‚Äôt just emotional; it has a physiological basis that can be profoundly calming and grounding.

If you're open to it, you might also explore other supportive measures that could complement the help you get from your dog. These might include mindfulness exercises, journaling your thoughts, or structured relaxation techniques, which can also help manage the feelings of loneliness and self-criticism you described.

Thank you for sharing your experience. It‚Äôs a valuable reminder of how important our furry friends can be in our emotional lives, and it might inspire others to consider similar approaches.",ladyhaly,1cjresx
0,"so I never went full through with my DBT therapy because I was in a psych ward and decided to leave after a few weeks due to serval reasons but: usually it‚Äôs in a group & talk about emotions (which  ones do exist, what makes you feel etc.) you often have discussions (good ones to like learn & hear other people‚Äôs thoughts), sometimes you might do a bit of ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù exercises. But overall it‚Äôs about: what are you feeling? How? What can you do with it? How to cope with it & how to live your life & find good ways to cope and reduce the overwhelming emotions. but you will always be guided in a good way especially in groups, you won‚Äôt feel left out or lost, trust me.

0,"First,  there is no cure for bpd.  We can go to therapy and learn alot of skills to help us with our daily living activities and how our thoughts and emotions can affect us and others.   So I don't think therapy is bullshit,  but it is work and a commitment.   With therapy and time,  learning skills and sometimes medication we can have times of remission so you just have to decide if you want to give it a try.  I personally think everyone including ""normal "" people would benefit from the skills in dbt.",tryinghard2live,x5q1sd
1,"If you go in with the attitude that it's bullshit, that is exactly the result you leave with.

That's like an alcoholic going to drug therapy, disregarding everything their therapist says, cracks open a beer after their session and cries ""this is bullshit"".

A big part of your success regarding therapy is whether or not you can admit that you could be **wrong** about a lot of things.

Walking in with that attitude is basically saying ""I'm never wrong, now fix me.""

That obviously isn't going to yield results.",,x5q1sd
2,"I'm a huge advocate of therapy but definitely agree with other commenters here that if you go into it feeling like you're doomed & can never get better then you're unlikely to. It's a self fulfilling prophecy: ""I can't get better, therefore I won't"". It might not be intentional but invariably it's what happens (speaking from experience here too).

Also, just to throw it out there, BPD has the highest rates of full remission of symptoms of any personality disorder. It's something like over 90% of folks with BPD will experience full remission. Therapy works & there's a high chance that the majority of us with BPD won't experience it forever! 
It's not easy and can take years (think how many years of abuse it took to get BPD & how many you'll have lived engraining bpd behaviours/thought processes, its a lot to ""undo"") but it's possible.",help_itsme,x5q1sd
3,"Therapy isn‚Äôt like taking an aspirin, it‚Äôs like math class. You have to do the work. It‚Äôs not a passive cure, it‚Äôs guided active change.

The hardest thing is to take responsibility for the impact of our behaviors, and actively work, constantly, to change them. It‚Äôs not an overnight process. 

Stuff like DBT can help, especially with behavior, but we also need trauma resolution, and crisis management, and current state management, and sometimes meds, and all of it can be overwhelming, and expensive, and feel like a waste of time. 

It sucks, trying to face our shit, trying to find good fits with doctors and therapists, trying to pay for it all, trying to see through the corrupting lenses of trauma, etc etc etc. 

The changes are so small and take so much time, but suddenly you realize you are keeping friendships longer. You‚Äôre not blowing up as often. You‚Äôre not as hurt by people and abandonment. Having better relationships. Communicating better. You have a stronger sense of who you are. Not perfect, but better. Day by day. 

Avoidance is self-reinforcing. It‚Äôs up to you to choose change, to choose the work. 

My favorite line about trauma is that it‚Äôs like someone dumped a pile of flaming garbage in your front yard. Now, it‚Äôs not your garbage. But it is your front yard. You can point to how unfair it is, and you‚Äôre right, but that‚Äôs not going to keep it from burning your house down. 

It‚Äôs your yard. Clean it if you want to. No one can do it for you.",teebalicious,x5q1sd
4,"Different methods work for different people. As someone with BPD, I was made to believe DBT was the only way to go, that it helped everyone struggling with this disorder. I started to feel like it was a lie because I failed at it so many times, would just give up ya know‚Ä¶ finally I was introduced to EMDR therapy and it‚Äôs changed my life. I praise it like crazy. But that doesn‚Äôt mean EMDR will be a good fit for everyone else either. It sucks that therapy could be just as hit or miss as medication, and can make throwing in the towel so easy for us.",,x5q1sd
5,"There are SO many different types of therapy. Understanding that has helped me understand therapy a lot more. Some therapy is focused to keep you behavior socially acceptable. Some therapy is focused to get you stable for work. Some therapy is focused to dig really deep and to heal childhood issues. There are a lot of mixes and variations. Different types of therapy work for different issues and different times in your life.

If you want to start university in half a year starting a trauma therapy might be difficult and a more behavioral one would be sweet. Trying to REALLY heal deeply within... a deeper childhood type of therapy might be needed. And so on! :)",Kironos,x5q1sd

10,"Depends on the therapy and the therapist.  CBT for instance is based on a total bullshit theory.  But it can work, if you ignore the bullshit theory and have a therapist that doesn't shove that shit down your throat.

DBT is Buddhism reskinned for Western Capitalism.  And has been working for people for 2500 years.",,x5q1sd
11,"As someone who has done DBT on and off for 10+ years now (and regular ol‚Äô psychotherapy for even longer), it is not placebo at all. It‚Äôs incredibly helpful. But, just like everyone else has said, you have to go in with an open mind and be prepared to face your problems/mistakes/misconceptions head on and actually make the conscious effort to change things for yourself. Things are not going to improve overnight and it is HARD. WORK. But it‚Äôs well worth it to keep going, bc after a while, therapeutic approaches and replacement coping mechanisms become second nature and life gets so much easier. 

There is no cure for BPD, this is true. However, over the course of many years and lots of therapy that you are *actively participating in* you can and most likely will go into remission. When I was diagnosed, I displayed all 9 diagnostic criteria. Now I only struggle with about 3 or 4 of them, which means that I am technically no longer considered borderline.",Exciting-Ad9158,x5q1sd

14,"This is a question that has been asked by psychologists for decades. Research method is applied to therapies  in order to determine how the experimental group (therapy receivers) hold up against the control group (those not receiving therapy).  I'm sure that we could find a meta-analysis paper on the efficacy of DBT or CBT or other therapies ... but I'm too lazy to do that right now. Some professionals think that talk therapy may be a placebo because it takes so long to see results that natural remission can't be ruled out. It seems as if therapy only  works because the therapy-seeker is dedicated to the possibility of their wellness. 

I can be dedicated to the possibility of my wellness Mon-Thurs, but on Friday, my spouse is upset with me and I spiral, completely redecorating my mental landscapes. And it can be anything -- not enough sleep, too much work, hormonal fluctuations -- it's difficult to remain dedicated to the possibility of wellness when one continually receives feedback that things are not improving. So, yes, I've certainly thought and felt that therapy is bullshit. 

But, I don't think that having a support system  or a tested model in place for a struggling person is bullshit. So, I guess I don't really think that therapy is bullshit --- I'm actually just scared that I'm a lost cause.",vaguelyprosaic,x5q1sd

That is why when you start therapy they tell you that your attitude will have a direct impact on how successful the treatment is. Because if you walk in negative with this idea that it's all a placebo you are naturally not going to take the recommendations of your counselor seriously let alone their guidance. Not to mention that you're actively cutting yourself down and invalidating your own treatment when you do this. A large part of treatment is learning when to admit that your thought process is abnormal and your perspective is incorrect or warped.

Instead of arguing, I started leaving and waiting several days to respond to something with a clear head. Instead of attacking people personally with insults I articulate what they did and how it makes me feel, which makes me less invested in whether or not they accept my pain as ""valid"", because doing this helped me accept myself as valid.

Make sure to ask yourself if you're going to therapy to make a relationship with abusive people work, because that defeats itself, or if you're pursuing help for you.

You're not gonna get results if you're trying to one sidedly repair a toxic relationship. Therapy is about looking inward at your pain and how it connects to your life so you can gently roll it back and live.",,x5q1sd

I was skeptical about dbt as well but overall I‚Äôve found learning the skills and learning about Marsha Linnehan‚Äôs theory on bpd very helpful. She is the one that that invented dbt and suffered with the diagnosis herself. Me personally, I have a very hard time making changes in my life. I for whatever reason feel invalidated when told I need to do better even when I recognize this myself. Dbt and my therapist helped me understand this contradiction about myself in a way that removed a lot of the shame that was keeping me stuck from moving forward.

It would also defeat the purpose because that's something you have to do yourself.  

Accepting your issues, questioning your therapist, being open to new approaches, pursuing your self worth and understanding the mistakes on your part is how you get results. Those parts are on you. The counselor is just there to guide you and support you when the M.I. starts whispering in your ear.

For example when I'm spiraling I ask my counselor what about my situation and reaction is excessive or overboard, because while I know I feel right there is an equal possibility I'm twisting reality without realizing it.",,x5q1sd

It would trigger my hyper vigilance and I'd have vicious night terrors. 

I still do though not as much since I started smoking weed before bed. It gives me a more dreamless sleep. The short term memory effects help me fall out of the night terror when I wake up. I say ""fall out"" because it's the weirdest sensation. But at least I'm not stuck in it 10 minutes after waking up anymore.

It's like being accidentally launched out of a roller coaster at top speed and right as you're about to splatter you land gently like a feather. So I wake up going ""why the hell am I covered in sweat and shaking? Oh. Night terror.""

62,"When you start articulating your feelings as facts you can rewire your brain a small bit. With practice you can maintain healthy communication even when you're upset. 

I noticed for me a big BPD trigger is being invalidated and feeling unheard because it makes me feel like my feelings don't matter. This triggers my spiral and my thoughts turn into buckshot, blasting my brain with 20 negative thoughts a second and possible horrible outcomes.

Once I started articulating I noticed my thoughts started slowing down because I felt heard, even though my abusive family still ignored me. That's when I realized that 


1. I felt less invalidated because it turns out **I was internalizing their judgement and invalidation without realizing it** and

2. I had become my own worst bully by adopting self gaslighting and self invalidation because that's what I had been taught.

Turns out it's true. You CAN be your own best friend because even if nobody listens, you can lend an ear to your own feelings. It won't fix everything, but once you start validating yourself it becomes easier to put negative thoughts to rest because you learn to recognize them and pair them with your coping mechanisms.

The key for me is that it provides predictability and stability. I know I can count on him to be there each week and that's been healing in itself.

Another thing that makes it easier to adjust whatever the hold up is in your life is listing out all the negative things that will come from keeping doing whatever it is that you are doing and the areas of your life that will be affected  with not changing for 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years and so on and to really feel it, make it as if it was a reality and today is your first day living with that new truth. Now list all the positives you will get in all aspects of your life by still doing whatever the thing is that you are questioning and using that same metric. Also you have to do it for changing this thing and all the negatives changing will bring to your life and also all the positives it will bring to your life in those time frames.

**You shouldn't be intimidated by them** bc (1) they are there to help you and (2) they are not there to judge you. The fact that you feel intimidated is suggesting you're not a good fit.

23,"Okay, I don't have BPD, but I was misdiagnosed with it and in treatment for it for six months. You aren't delusional here, unfortunately; I noticed how patients with this disorder are often treated. I was treated horribly; therapists would just assume the worst and not listen to a word I was saying. It was so hard for me to bring forward the issue of misdiagnosis because my therapists kept on assuming that I wasn't showing symptoms because I was manipulating them. Like wtf... And then I got lucky, and an absolute angel of a person was sent to me, who listened to me and believed me. She observed me for a month, still to make sure that I was right and that I had been misdiagnosed. She immediately made the necessary referrals, but while I was waiting, she kept working with me because I was in a crisis situation back then and we talked a lot about how patients with BPD are approached, what care they need, how they need to be talked to for treatment to be effective etc. 

From this experience, I can tell you that what you are experiencing is not normal and that your therapist is being negligent. Addiction treatment is a part of DBT, not separate from it. A lot of people with BPD have addictions, and usually, DBT is used by therapists to treat the addiction. He's not wrong to claim that you might need addiction treatment first, but he cannot withhold all treatment from you and make you fend on your own. If your therapist is not qualified to guide you through the addiction treatment, he should make a referral to someone qualified. And the way he's treating you is actually sabotaging your chances of getting better- get yourself a new therapist. You need someone who's nice to you, listens to you, doesn't buy into your bs, but is still gentle and patient with you. Treating BPD is really hard, from conversations with this amazing therapist I got lucky with, I learned that treating BPD is a very delicate process of navigating between a firm and a gentle approach. You guys with BPD are not dangerous deviants; you guys are traumatised people who have deeply internalised their abuse. You guys need discipline, yes, but you also require a lot of kindness, softness and patience- a stable, safe and trusting environment. From what you have described, your therapist doesn't seem to be suited to work with people like you.

1,"Changed my life. 

I am rational person in most regards, probably became like that to counteract my BPD and parental NPD, but I always had bouts of emotional dysregulation that were impossible to resolve logically. Often left me with residual emotional issues. I was kind of aware, but its not much use to know that you are irrational about something when you cant change that and half your brain is telling you you are right, its so confusing. DBT gave me the skills to cut through the shit. And using the skills again and again over time changes how my brain reacts.

Before DBT (about 19 months ago):  
For example, when I get triggered by person F (regular occasion), I used to have paranoid ideations and ruminate about the issue or whatever I made out of the issue in my head for days. Happened all the time. And I thought very crazy stuff, not completely unrelated to reality but it was basically me ruminating myself nuts about my greatest fear from childhood. Person F was becoming a worse person in my head with every time that happened. This was not reality but at the time I thought it was.

With DBT:  
I still get triggered like that sometimes but its only happened twice this year and it used to happen about once a week. And when it happens, I immediately know whats going on. Got triggered, check. Have paranoid ideations and the urge to ruminate, check. Dont ruminate, check. Process the original feeling, check. This is still somewhat unpleasant, but I feel in ""control"" of this process instead of being a victim of my own mind (as I felt before).

0,"I‚Äôve smoked everyday for around 6 years now, and for me then and now, it‚Äôs used as a coping mechanism for anxiety, especially when I was unmedicated.

I did a 3 week online dbt program and I forget if weed was prohibited, if it was, I had to have lied about smoking, I find it strange it would be a strict rule given the entire model of DBT-

I do remember being asked to track my weed in my mood tracking sheet/journal, which I found to actually be really helpful for me to understand my relationship with weed and if it was helping or harming me! I basically just wrote a rough estimate of how much I smoked that day, and when.

I understand the feeling of not being ready to quit on someone else‚Äôs terms so if you are doing a mood tracker in therapy/DBT, maybe that could help you feel productive and motivated. That way if you noticed a trend of weed having a negative effect on you, your mood, your behaviours, then you can make that decision. A lot in DBT will give you stronger skills to make that decision as well.

That being said, I still smoke weed every day, because for me it works. I‚Äôve always been upfront with therapists, telling them I know it‚Äôs a dependency, addiction, coping mechanism, whatever they want to call it, and I‚Äôm not ready to stop yet. One day with better coping strategies, maybe, but for now, no. And I‚Äôve generally had good response and helpful support that had me feeling more informed and less judged.

Keep in mind you only get out of therapy what you put into it, they‚Äôve seen much more let‚Äôs say ‚Äúcreative‚Äù cases than someone who smokes weed.

I remember once being embarrassed to tell a therapist that I stop for ‚Äúsugary treats‚Äù to cheer myself up and get through the day because it feels like I won‚Äôt make it if I don‚Äôt. I told her how bad I knew it was and how unhealthy of a habit it was, she looked at me plainly and said ‚Äúif the cookie keeps you from k____g yourself, get the cookie‚Äù

It‚Äôs a very complicated story but what I can say is that I tried DBT and group therapy, which both didn‚Äôt really work for me. But EMDR and trauma focused therapy made all the difference for me because it was so much more focused on reprogramming my brain instead of treating symptoms I guess? But I do have to say that the thing that helped me the most was working on myself every day and it started with getting into mindfulness, spirituality and a lot of self help books/podcasts. Almost every spare moment I had I used to research and read and try out exercises. I started reconditioning myself by observing my thoughts and started countering my negative inner ‚Äúvoice‚Äù by speaking kindly towards myself. After quite a heavy and suicidal time in my life, I had a very positive psychedelic trip which was completely centred around love, compassion and gratitude. I definitely would not recommend this because drugs are still drugs but it changed my entire outlook on life in a positive way. 

I also knew that some of my behaviour or certain actions didn‚Äôt align with the person I knew I was and wanted to be. I was sick of regretting my behaviour and just little by little with years of practice and learning and growing I just automatically started making healthy choices. 
I do need to say that I didn‚Äôt go to therapy every week since that didn‚Äôt really work for me because I had and still sometimes have a hard time showing up and didn‚Äôt want to disappoint myself or my psychologist. While I was actively doing my best to learn more about how to actually love myself and how to regulate my emotions, I was seeing my psychologist once or twice a month. I‚Äôm very lucky to have had such an incredibly open-minded and compassionate psychologist who understood that I needed to figure this out on my own but still needed somebody to talk to about my emotions, trauma and offer me tools when I needed them. I think what mostly helped me work on myself is to not focus on a disorder but to take an holistic approach.
Love, compassion and gratitude are the cornerstones of my recovery but also who I am as a person.
I can recommend listening to Ram Dass his older material and I also listened to Selfhealers Soundboard a lot. I really liked ‚ÄúA New Earth‚Äù by Eckhart Tolle and generally spent a lot of time reading.

Obviously everyone is different, but having my irrational thought processes challenged head-on did worlds of good for me. In both cases, they were something I had to seek out on my own. (Most psychiatrists these days just prescribe you an excess of medication. Greedy fucks.) 

I've grown much better at ""seeing the bigger picture"" in my interactions with others, and catastrophize situations far less frequently than I used to. I can *step back* when I'm feeling upset. Actually being able to self-regulate my emotions to some degree has been extremely liberating.

The most important thing to remember is that DBT/CBT therapy is not always a comfortable experience. Don't go into it expecting constant validation for 100% of your feelings, as that kind of defeats the purpose.

Good luck, and don't lose hope.",PyreticDharma,1cdi76c
3,"For me, psychotherapy, CBT, DBT is really helpful.

5,"Some good suggestions in the comments. I'd also like to mention the following options:

1. GPM - Developed by the late John Gunderson and seems to be as effective as DBT on recent studies. Maybe even better because it focuses not just on treating the symptoms or the disorder, but also improving the overall quality of life.

2. Spirituality/Philosophy - Spiritual/religious beliefs, stoic philosophy, Buddhist-derived psychotherapies might also help. Note that these can have some overlap with mindfulness and some components of DBT.

3. Developing perspectives - Treating others the way you want them to treat you, thinking from their point of views, focusing on the process and not the outcome, building horizontal relationships, overcoming your fears and insecurities, all of these goes a long way. I'd recommend checking out the book called ""The Courage To Be Disliked"" which explores some Adlerian philosophies .",Denisovan-6125,1cdi76c

‚ÄúI feel like shit‚Äù

But recently she had a good take, she said I can‚Äôt tolerate any discomfort and I need to learn how to do that. 

She didn‚Äôt tell me how, though, and the other sessions I spent storytelling and keeping her entertained with my little stories.",Character_Steak_7799,19f2kgs
2,"the big secret about our feelings is that they really don't matter, at least not to the extent that people who haven't achieved emotional maturity think they do. 

feelings should be felt, and honored, but not catered to. they should be consulted when it comes to making decisions, but they are rarely the only basis for decision making or for taking action. 

if you want to achieve emotional maturity, you are going to have to give up your attachment to your emotions. they cannot have primacy in your life. 

emotionally mature adults manage their feelings. they don't deny them, they just aren't controlled by them. while you're learning to do this, it may feel robotic to you. that's ok. learning something new is rarely a comfortable experience. learning new sports is physically awkward. learning new academic materially is mentally taxing and can involve struggle. learning new ways of managing emotions is going to be uncomfortable. that's just how it works. the more you work on this, the more nuanced your emotional skills will be and the better able you'll be to access your authentic self while still behaving in an emotionally mature way.

are you happy with the other way? if so, then don't continue. however, if you want to learn to manage your emotions better, then trust the process. you can always go back to doing things your old way if you want. you're not signing a contract, you're just trying out a new way of being.

you should also bring this objection up to your therapist to hear her opinion.",LeafyEucalyptus,19f2kgs
3,Hmm this is tough for me cause while she could come off as dismissive it can also be a useful technique to stop spiraling. Is it possible that this was regarding feelings that you are ruminating on and leading to negative spirals? Or do you feel that they were not feelings and thoughts that lead to harmful or negative behaviors? Hope this makes sense!,bubhoney,19f2kgs
4,"the thing that made me quit therapy was the idea of money and therapy, 

you see therapy requires such a bond b/w you and your therapist that you‚Äôre basically telling them things you won‚Äôt to anyone else..ever

but the idea of just sitting in a room once a week and giving money to somebody just to listen to you whine seemed to..fake",Wadii0,19f2kgs
5,"I want to second this and add‚Äîemotionally mature adults know when to feel their feelings too.

If you‚Äôre at work then you want to distract from your rough feelings, because it‚Äôs not appropriate to show them to the extent you need to at work (I know bc I have done this at work üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠)

Are you speaking to having difficulty processing your rough feelings? I‚Äôve found that a lot of therapists don‚Äôt really have good advice or guidance for that in particular tbh. If you don‚Äôt have BPD or another SMI or trauma, people can feel their feelings and let them go.

I used to have a therapist say ‚ÄúI think you have trouble feeling your feelings‚Äù and I was like‚Ä¶.wow thanks I didn‚Äôt know that üòêüòêüòê and then he‚Äôd asked me where are they in my body and I was like I mean here and here and it didn‚Äôt do anything LOL

Idk if this is helpful but I think talk to your therapist about how you are feeling. There‚Äôs a lot of value to be had in ‚Äúconfronting‚Äù an authority figure (therapist is a type of authority figure in a way) and standing your ground in an adult, mature way when you say something isn‚Äôt helping you. 

On the rough feelings note, IFS (internal family systems), parts work and inner child work has helped me to be able to feel my feelings without getting overwhelmed by them. None of my like 13 diff therapists over the years had suggested it to me I had to find it myself and find someone who practiced it.",gtaco777,19f2kgs
6,"I believe that this advice was provided due to ruminating over the negative thoughts, absolutely. When I am in a good headspace, I receive this advice in a positive way usually, and am generally able to apply it as best as I can at the time.",Littleghoste,19f2kgs
7,"Thank you both for commenting! Both responses were incredibly helpful. 

To answer your question, I am mainly struggling with ruminating over these big feelings, and how to communicate them in a way that is not harmful to my relationships. When I am in a good place emotionally, I don‚Äôt usually feel this way when it comes to therapy and the advice my psychotherapist gives me. 

At the moment it feels like I am just learning to become a robot, and everyone else can have their feelings, but that same rule doesn‚Äôt apply to me. But I do plan to speak to my therapist about everything, as I don‚Äôt want to let my feelings control me like this. 

I have also done some research on shadow work, and have been considering journaling to distract myself, but also to get some insight on areas where I need to improve, work through, or let go.",Littleghoste,19f2kgs
8,"It still is easier said than done to stop ruminating, so i understand that her advice can touch a sore spot when you are already in a bad headspace. If you generally have a good relationship i would definitely bring this up in therapy to maybe figure out if there is a different way she can communicate and help you with this issue, and to hopefully find a middle ground that actually feels helpful to you.",bubhoney,19f2kgs
0,"It's not uncommon to ""split"" on therapy. Even if it left a bad taste in your mouth the first time, after a few more years, going back you will get something different out of it as well as approach it differently. I would try to find someone who specializes in personality disorders and have a plan of what you want to accomplish. As you said, the huge part is you putting in the effort. Don't forget the therapist works for you. You are hiring them sort of like a tour guide. You don't know the best route to where you want to go, but you need to know the destination. You need to enter therapy with that mindset as opposed to just hiring a tour guide and asking them where the destinations are. That is how you take ownership of your therapy, and get them to work for you.",MainAction9667,1bmly7f

0,"I was diagnosed 8 years ago from my psychiatrist back in uni. All the therapy and medical expenses are fully covered and I believe the therapies get easier solely because of my psychiatrist. She did talk therapy with me, and referred me to another psychologist and psychiatrist for specific DBT and an experimental Psychodynamic Therapy. DBT is great and all, it provides you with tools to best regulate your everyday emotions and struggle. However, Psychodynamic Therapy was EXTREMELY hard on me. I used to cry before going to PT because I do not want to go, and then cry again after the session because the doctor was picking the scab of my wounds. I would feel exhausted, pained, and angry after each session. And then I would go to my main psychiatrist and report back to her on what we did and how I feel when PT asked about the stuffs that happened or the stuffs that I did. Eventually, the therapies become a ritual and routine for me and I‚Äôve accepted the fact that they were there to help me with my progress. 

For me, in order to avoid dwelling on the things that we discussed in therapies, I would create a positive reinforcement every time I finish my session. Like a little reward. I would go to this one restaurant selling spicy smoked duck stew right after my therapies. Once I‚Äôm done with my treats, I usually won‚Äôt dwell on it the bad part anymore. That‚Äôs what worked for me. I hope therapy gets easier for you mate!",hsrobin,1bjjaeq
1,"I've started and stopped many times when they get to the childhood part for the same reason. There's a reason I don't like to think about such things and why I block out. Although as I learned more I realize that's precisely what my BPD was doing as well and what that monster inside does. The monster doesn't want to face these things even 30 years later and will do anything to stop it --- ruin relationships or talk you out of therapy. You have to push through it.

My advice would be as far as therapy make sure you are setting a clear set of goals on what YOU want to accomplish. You need to take ownership of it. The therapist is a tour guide that you hired. They work for YOU. They may know the best routes, but don't just climb aboard the tour bus and let them take you places. Tell them what your final destination is and ask for the best route there.",MainAction9667,1bjjaeq

6,":) Better. Stick with the first part. The societal use of ""trauma"" and your own BPD not thinking your feelings are warranted is making you not realize that seeing that over time was ""traumatic"" for you. That's what birthed your BPD monster. You need to trace it back to you are trying to avoid having those feelings you did growing up. They could have been had over a prolonged period. That's why it came across as traumatic. For whatever reason, and not even saying anyone did anything wrong,  you held onto those feelings for far too long while your brain was developing to fit into society and they never got addressed properly. Now that inner self is going to view your relationships out of the fear of having them again. Some of us blame others, some test them, seems you blame yourself. Again it's personal. It could be a mix. Find the root cause. Find how it reacts. Use the techniques to accept that they are just emotions and don't let the feelings lead to regrettable behavior.",MainAction9667,1b7pzz7

Professionals are trained to get past that stuff, but have you met anyone with BPD, of course you have, we're rather fucking good at figuring out how to protect ourselves and avoid shit.

Now when you make a breakthru yourself and know exactly what you want to get out of it, don't fear talking about your trauma, can handle criticizing yourself, know what it is that caused you to be this way, know the mistakes you are making, know what you want to fix. That's when therapy may be worth it. To have a professional to guide you. But if you go in without the road map yourself, from experience nothing is going to get fixed. For BPD, you need to find someone who specializes in it and go in Day 1 with that person not wasting time, figuring each other out. You go and say this is my goal, help me get there.

0,"I'm sorry for your breakup and thanks for the advice you offered. As for what helps someone with BPD, the only sure fire solution is them wanting to get help to begin with. And even that can ebb and flow over time. It's a personality disorder. 

You could present the most solid, well-laid out plan that even follows the logic the person with BPD uses themselves every day of their life. But depending on a variety of factors, someone with BPD could simply just reject the entire notion and than bury that idea and any ideas even associated it with for a long time.

It is irrational reaction to our emotions and those emotions can transfer to people, places and things even associated with bringing that out.

What works for someone with BPD is the way you treat a cat. Leave out the food and then stop looking at us. We will eat when we want, we might love a certain food one day and refuse to go eat it for no particular reason we could tell someone else, because we don't even know why we don't want to eat that day. Maybe a different food we never tried will entice us.

The reason the therapy didn't work is because the person didn't want it to work. 

Just like I know others who read this, some will say, ""that's 100 percent how I feel"" while others will say ""that's so dumb, it's not my fault I have this, why does everyone just blame me and say I need help, I obviously want help why else would I be here if I didn't want help, but everyone offers stupid help.""

You know how I know that, because I could respond either way to this, even over the course of a day I could have BOTH reactions to this type of advice.

1,"Finding the right therapist is unfortunately really fucking hard, and can take several tries. When you're in a rural area it gets even more difficult, because clinics are usually more understaffed and underfunded. 

If you're just doing talk therapy, it probably just isn't enough. DBT is ideal for treating BPD, and has effectively saved my life, but it can also be really difficult to access. If you haven't already I would ask your psychiatrist if there is any DBT programs available near you that you might be able to attend.

I've done it twice now, first a 16 week program when I was a teenager and just finished my second 24 week one this May. I've joked a few times about it basically being lessons on how to be a person, but it's not that far off. Instead of just telling you to get a job and make friends, you're taught the skills that will inevitably lead you to getting a job, making friends, then keeping that job and maintaining relationships in a healthy way.

Ultimately, if you have the right kind of therapy, it will help. But you have to let it help too. It's so much hard work, and it pissed me off sometimes and didn't want to do it, but it is worth it. I'm in a much better place than I was last year. I won't lie and say that it's easy, I still have symptoms and split, relapses are a thing that happens- and it's not all therapy either. I also take medication to stabilize my mood. The combination has done wonders though. I'm by no means cured, but this time last year I was miserable, unemployed, living with my parents, empty and dissociated all the time, with constant volatile moodswings and losing my friends as a result of it all and my shit behaviour. I didn't think I would make it out alive, I didn't want to.

I've got a part-time job now working at a non-profit for young folks struggling with mental illness and addictions, and go to school part-time too. The job doesn't pay a whole lot but I really enjoy it, and it was enough to get me my own apartment. I've started to repair some of the damage I did to my relationships, and it's been awhile now since I lashed out or started a fight. It's not all sunshine and daisies but I'm relatively functional.

I was only formally diagnosed recently.  I'm even more out of control without it; very suicidal. I constantly gain and lose jobs, so lose insurance. But someone I worked with is helping me pay for therapy right now and I see them twice a week. I would be dead this month for sure without it. I was the closet to the edge than ever.

I don't use drugs and get high.

You're either not talking to the right person or not really giving it a fair shot, in my opinion. But whatever works for you.

I don't have friends or family who can help my serious mental illness, so paying someone whose a professional is the only choice for me. In fact, telling other friends, family, coworkers, strangers, escorts, dealers (from association, not usage), whoever the hell has only made shit worse.

DBT is one of the best ways to treat BPD because it was made for it, but it's definitely not the only way.

EDMR, Transference-Focused Psychotherapy, Schema-focused therapy, and Mentalized based therapy have all been found to be helpful with BPD, though some of them are newer. In case all these are inaccessible, if you can find a therapist specializing in trauma you click with, that will still help. 

You also don't technically have to do the program to learn some of the skills. It's easier that way for sure, but the workbook is available to buy, and many worksheets are available to download for free if you want.

Tiktoks where the person is ‚Äúgoing into another manic episodeü§™‚Äù or posts that encourage/make light of toxic behavior in relationships. 

It‚Äôs especially hard with BPD because our illness is SO all-consuming. I struggled a lot with envisioning my identity without my BPD behaviors, even though I desperately want to overcome them.

3,"Well, BPD is a defense mechanism. So your brain equates getting better with being unsafe. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, sure there are some pretty devastating consequences, but at least you are ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù Try looking more inward and understanding where your behaviors stem from. For instance we push people away in order to avoid abandonment, and/or have reassurance that the person will care enough to fight for us. That‚Äôs because being abandoned is scary. But if someone abandons you, you are still safe. Sad, heartbroken even, but safe. I try (keyword: try) to remind myself when I‚Äôm having an episode and needing to  calm down and be rational, that I‚Äôm safe, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me. Our brains developed this defense mechanism as children, but we no longer need it as adults. 

Similar to our biological fight or flight reaction. We have that biological response from a long long time ago, when we had to *literally* fight or run for our lives to stay safe. Having a panic attack is just a biological flaw at this point. It‚Äôs a lie! The feelings are absolutely real and valid, but we are not in that life threatening danger anymore, and frankly probably never will be.

declines people with BPD because as he said we essentially ""cannot be fixed through therapy."" i almost reported him to the board for that. even my psychiatrist basically asks me what she should do with my meds regarding upping / lowering / changing them since i've had such a long history with them. we're kinda on our own once we reach a certain point it seems unless we keep advocating for ourselves",youres0lastsummer,15osqih

13,"Great,

Self-awareness is one of the most important first steps. You are now aware of all the things you're doing. Maybe you're even aware of why you're doing them.

Have you stopped doing those things? Are you using the skills and resources you've learned to start living a better life? Are you in remission/do you no longer qualify to meet the criteria of a BPD diagnosis?

If the answer to any of those questions is no then you have not finished working on it yet. The journey to recovery is rarely linear. Find therapy that is specific to what you are diagnosed with. Find resources and work to do and learn from that targets the specific symptoms _you_ still exhibit and suffer from. Keep getting better.

It also gives you the tools to recognize when the feelings you're feeling are those intense feelings.

2,"I would recommend trying to do DBT as well as individual psychotherapy (just regular talk therapy). I don't know anything about your and your particular struggles, but I find DBT handles like the broader level stuff - it gives you practical, applicable skills in specific areas to help strengthen you - but if you are still unstable (for lack of a better word) at your core, none of this is going to have the desired affect. You cannot build strength upon an insecure foundation.

When I started doing both, it started getting through to me. I can work through my individual trauma, anxieties, hang ups, etc - the things that exist in me, not in ""my bpd"" - one on one, and with this can understand myself more, be more gentle, feel I am deserving of mastering my DBT skills and improving myself. Then naturally because of this, the DBT can kind of reach the deeper places and sink into you like it is trying to. I would maybe try this out.

It is great to practice mindfulness and master emotional regulation, of course. These skills are amazing. But how is it supposed to sink in and be impactful if you aren't also addressing just why it is you cannot be mindful? Why is it you have so little emotional regulation? Tackle those things first then try and build the DBT skills on top of that. Best of luck to you, it is a non-linear process and you should just be so proud for even trying.",darlingevaa,111mb5k

It's frustrating and a waste of time and money most of the time. But it was a relief when I did find one who was actually prepared enough to employ the techniques as they should be employed. The same can be true for any intervention and DBT is no exception.

In all likehood you will benefit from DBT ""done correctly"" (grossly speaking) with someone else.

Or, granted, in your particular case benefits can be easier seen with other types of therapies. Schema therapy is a decent option. Unfortunately, in all cases I've seen (for BPD), it only ""works"" for the duration of time the person is into therapy.

In the context of evidence-based practice, when evidence shows that a certain treatment (in this case, DBT) is having the highest chance of generating desirable results within a certain population (ie. Pwbpd), the therapist shouldn't just shelf it right away just cuz their client has mentioned that they have tried it previously. There might be a delivery issue in the previous treatment (eg. Dose, dose frequency, therapist guidance methods etc.) contributing to the current outcome, which contradicts evidence.

In a nut shell, if it's a delivery issue, try it again maybe?

That being said, I did DBT for 18 months ( I wanted to make sure I was solid in my skills before I gave up my spot in my group). DBT is excellent at symptom management and helping you survive episodes. DBT helped me save my life, and I am very grateful for it every day because it still helps me. That being said, I think that because BPD almost always stems from complex trauma, I was not having much success at truly improving until I started trauma work. My trauma therapist has helped me immensely in my recovery. I think that unless we work with trauma survivors ( in this case who meet BPD criteria or have traits), then we aren‚Äôt helping them fully succeed and heal, but with DBT we are giving them skills to keep surviving. I think whenever you have skills or any nature, DBT or otherwise ( though I recommend DBT wholeheartedly), it‚Äôs important to start or continue your trauma work. Then you can validate ‚Äúwhy does this trigger me? I‚Äôm going to use my skills to handle it, but why?‚Äù. I find that at times DBT can be unintentionally invalidating because it doesn‚Äôt ask us to explore our inner child or reach back into those places, that‚Äôs not it‚Äôs design. I think with trauma work, DBT, and medication if that‚Äôs a part of your needs or plan, then you can have medical help from every angle.

And ACT in general is about being okay being uncomfortable.

0,"Not sure what self-awareness has to do with the efficacy of DBT‚Ä¶ I swear some of the posts I see on this sub about comments we get from our therapists are wild.

At my IOP clinic, where maybe five or six of us out of thirty are diagnosed with BPD, we *all* do two hours of DBT on Tuesdays. Most of us have individual DBT coaches too. It‚Äôs one of the main therapeutic modalities employed by the organization. While it was originally engineered for pwBPD it can be useful for pretty much anybody who is suffering.",forgethim1818,1banlv6
1,"I think that depends. Self-awareness in and of itself is actually something that DBT works on building skills in, and so there are many people who are already very self-aware who are able to apply those skills to their lives incredibly effectively. On the other hand, people who are self-aware often over-rely on defense mechanisms such as intellectualization as a way to distance from the emotional experience, which can get in the way of therapy. For this reason, it is fairly common for therapists not to recommend CBT or any of its derivatives (such as DBT) to people who are neurodivergent, ""highly intelligent,"" and/or who have complex trauma. 

I was in an intensive DBT program (residential and then IOP and then outpatient) and it sadly did not do very much for me. The problem that I encountered is that knowing/thinking your feelings is very different from feeling your feelings. DBT has a lot of psychoeducation, and I already knew most of what it taught me. I know what my patterns are, I know why I am doing the things that I do, and I know what the consequences are. I am able to identify cognitive distortions, but I still rationalize them. I can know that something isn't logical, but I still believe it to be true. I was able to identify my core beliefs and emotions, and I was given ways to cope with them, but I was unable to sit with them. Another aspect of DBT that can be hard for someone who is more self-aware is not being able engage with the material. Of course, certain things work better for certain people and certain elements of DBT are known to be a bit cheesy (like the acronyms), but unlike many of my friends, who were still willing to try, my mind would decide for me that something shouldn't work logically, and so I was never able to give it a fair chance. 

That being said, DBT did teach me how to ground and self-regulate, which has ended up helping me significantly now that I am better at being in-touch with my feelings. Also, most DBT therapists are very attuned to when people are intellectualizing and will try to work with you on it. DBT also draws from a number of modalities in a way that is meant to more effectively reach those for whom previous therapy has not helped. Even if you are very self-aware and prone to intellectualizing, I really don't think that you can know if it will help you or not until you try it. But maybe your therapist has seen some kind of pattern or behavior that has led her to think that it wouldn't be a good fit.",Amazing_Duck_8298,1banlv6

the reason those clinics offer infusions of bigger doses at a set and falling frequency, is because of the *afterglow* that ketamine offers, which may last days, weeks or even months depending on the person.

If you experience psychotic symptoms from a puff of weed or 0.5 grams of shrooms definitely 150% stay away from psychedelics and drugs in general. If not, just know your limits are much lower than the average person. Always take a smaller dose than what's recommended.

6,"Yes. I've been in TFP for roughly 1.5 years, and there's no doubt that it's helped me, especially with the ""little things"" that sent me into tailspins historically.

I know where you are, and I've been there myself. Rifled through multiple therapists until I found this one. What I realize in retrospect is that ***I*** was the problem, not the therapists. I was attempting to control the therapy, and bend the therapists into my reality. Why? Because that's the shit we do.

So, my strong advice to you is to stick it out. What I came to learn about these early TFP chit-chat sessions (talking endlessly with no real response from the therapist other than, ""And how does that make you feel"") is that the therapist is trying to get you to split in-front of him or her. They want to frustrate and aggravate you in order to see you rage. Once you do, he/she sort of of freeze-frames the episode, gets you to take inventory of your sensations and thoughts, then works with you to isolate the trigger. The idea is that, once you've done this enough, you can detect triggers outside of therapy, realize that you're on the verge of splitting, and use regulation to stop it dead in its tracks.

That's how they do it in TFP, anyway, and I really wish someone would have told me this going in. During the course of my treatment, I've threatened to quit (to both my therapist and my family) on too many occasions to count. I stuck it out through a desperate desire to heal, and, ultimately, through doubt---second guessing my emotions and eventually realizing that my urge to quit is was rooted in all-consuming desires for control (therapy on *my* terms) and retribution (punishing the therapist for wasting my time).

I'm not you and I don't know you, but I'd say that's what's going on here. Your quitting and ghosting of therapists is an attempt to control. You MUST try to let go of this, even though it will feel like drowning, and every fiber of your being will fight it.

Here's a tip for your next session: Ask your therapist about this. ""Is this what I'm doing? Am I trying to control the process? Am I trying to control *you*?"" There's a good chance this will get you going down a more constructive path.",barney_muffinberg,11gebqb
7,"Look into Schemas therapy. It is highly recommended for BPD patients. It focuses on repetitive schemas we formed usually during childhood for survival / protection that were once useful but become maladaptive / harmful in adulthood.

There is a lot of communication, and as it progresses, the therapist is able to spot the repetitive (conscious or unconscious) schemas that may not be obvious at first sight, and help you put your reality into perspective to replace them by healthy responses and behaviors.

It‚Äôs a really dynamic and quickly effective methodology. I‚Äôve tried basically every other kind of therapy in 12 years, THIS ONE has been the life changer for me. I would have lost several friends and probably attempted suicide if it weren‚Äôt for all the progresses I‚Äôve made since I‚Äôve started 6 months ago.

There were a lot of different issues with the therapist (not great when each session costs $100+, but it felt like the stuff I *needed* was further in I had, like late billing ), the stuff that talks about ""why does this happen to me?"" I got a pretty annoying thought that these people weren't treating people with BPD, but just going through the book in a school-like fashion and it's just like .. does anyone else come here because they have BPD or is this all those other people the book says it can also help managing their emotions? Because it feels like it felt like rush job and I often felt frustrated (doesn't help that I was CONSTANTLY ""forgotten about"" in actual school) just waiting for this stuff to do... Anything for me.

IDK I felt like going through the book by myself with no time restraints because if I spiral in a session, I've wasted that session and have to wait until the next week... Only to do it ALL OVER AGAIN with the spiraling. I often felt like the therapists weren't ""ready"" for me or something. I've gotten two activities in and yeah, it's hard because I cry when I do the work, but it's just different. I almost felt held back by the DBT group. I found just *sooooo* many videos from Dr. Fox on YouTube, finally frlt *seen* and he doesn't even know me. He explained what goes on in the brain, what someone might be feeling in negative emotions. He takes the time to *explain the borderline personality,* something that was severely missing from group therapy. ü§∑

0,"Hey, I‚Äôll tell you my experience and you can take from it what you will:

I‚Äôve had 10 years of therapy, from CBT to psychodynamic, IFS and EMDR attempts. I‚Äôve been hospitalized and in partial hospitalization programs. I resonate with what you‚Äôre saying and feel excessive fear, shame, and boiling rage. Most therapists cannot handle the level at which I feel things. They noticeably get overwhelmed, even though I have never yelled or directed any anger towards them. Until recently, I have been labeled as self aware, but probably also resistant to therapy. I‚Äôve 

I think the answer is different for everyone. But, learning a lot about childhood development, specifically 0-5 and realizing I have some stunted emotional development due to neglect and abuse, has been immensely helpful in alleviating fear and shame. I read a ton. I don‚Äôt journal, but I talk to myself, usually out loud. I‚Äôm in an intensive group therapy program‚Ä¶.but I do a lot of, inner work with my parts (Internal Family Systems), and self reflection. I‚Äôm lucky where I don‚Äôt have to work right now (I don‚Äôt think I could if I tried lol). I think of my BPD more as severe interpersonal ptsd, and that helps me conceptualize how to help myself. I been meaning to read more about polyvagal theory but the science is kinda boring ngl LOL üò≠üò≠üò≠ but I gotta do what I gotta do.

I‚Äôve stopped trying things that work for others, and am finding what works for me. I sit with myself a lot more now. And I think for the first time, I am making real, actual progress. 

I didn‚Äôt tell you what to do, because only you know what works for you, even though you don‚Äôt know right now. For me, curiosity without judgement was the first step, and it took me 28 years to get there. I can list book recommendations and more details if you want.",gtaco777,1ahzyia
1,"I relate. Certainly to the anger/frustration, shame, and fear of failure. I also didn‚Äôt like DBT, and it was not a part of my recovery. 

My question is, what do you want? And why? 

It seems to me that generally, (happy) artists have an intrinsic love for the *act* of art to motivate them- not the potential ‚Äúperfection‚Äù of the outcome. What makes a piece ‚Äúperfect,‚Äù or even ‚Äúgood,‚Äù is not some objective, quantifiable thing, but rather things like how fun it was to create, what it means to you, etc. 

When I do pottery, I‚Äôm motivated by what I think would be the most fun to create in that moment. I enjoy making feminine shapes- curves, squiggles, flowers. I made a whale the other day and I knew the whole time how anatomically incorrect it was, but it didn‚Äôt matter because that wasn‚Äôt **why** I was making it. 

So, what do you want? Do you want to enjoy things or do you want to be perfect?",Td998,1ahzyia
2,"Hi, your relationship to fear and shame is very similar to mine, and I completely understand how it underlines everything to do with treatment and getting better. That stuff will sabotage everything. I also don‚Äôt really find DBT to be very helpful, beyond some stuff in the distress tolerance module. I also had the same problem with the homework and the diary card and that contributed to *more* shame.

I know you mentioned your access to other therapies are limited, but I would highly suggest looking into CPT (cognitive processing therapy) when you can. It‚Äôs what was finally able to put cracks in that glass ceiling of shame for me because it specifically deals with what they call ‚Äústuck points‚Äù that rule your life. All of my stuck points had to do with fear and shame and were deeply ingrained in me from very early childhood (concurrent IFS work helped to figure out the timeline). CPT was useful and also held my interest. Any homework I had to do was easy to complete because I felt it was actually helping me and I didn‚Äôt feel like I was back in high school  scribbling bullshit down 15 minutes before the group just so I didn‚Äôt get in ‚Äútrouble.‚Äù

I know you probably weren‚Äôt looking for more therapeutic advice per se, but your post resonates with me a lot, and this is what finally broke holes in my shame armor. Really wishing the best for you.",forgethim1818,1ahzyia

4,"I can relate a lot to you, as someone who was a perfectionist growing up because there were expectations I had to meet. It's not easy to unlearn those, but I've made some progress as I grew older.

It's different for everyone, but personally I tried to reconnect with my inner child and create a mental space where I didn't judge myself and hold myself to impossible standards. BPD has a tendency to make us feel more than others, but I think this is sort of a double-edged sword when it comes to creativity. I write, so what helps me with that is putting my emotions into it. It's a good outlet, too. I don't let myself turn away from emotions because it makes me eventually explode later on. It doesn't even have to be a journal or anything. It can be creative or just thoughts, based on other fiction or your own. The key was for me not to limit myself. Not showing anyone some of the things I wrote also helped with my need for it to be perfect.

Think of yourself as a little kid just being curious about everything, drawing for the first time, finding joy in creating something and not caring if it was ""good"". Creations are better when they are felt rather than thought of, if that makes sense.",remycchi,1ahzyia

Or rather, engaging with and staying engaged is hard. Once I'm hooked though, I'm there. It's that startup hump that sucks major balls. 

I need an outlet to let this wave out of me. I am open to suggestions because I'm out of options. I know DBT is about STOP and letting go, but trying to disengage strangles me (like pulling a dog's collar as it's running). I need a channel to put that surge into.",beastlydigital,1ahzyia

Your mind is a kind of thing you can train if you want to. I felt like I was manually reprogramming my habitual patterns of thinking until the positive ones became intuitive, instinctual, and automatic. It‚Äôs now *difficult* for me to feel frustrated or angry with myself for things that used to deeply upset me. I have even become grateful for my mistakes and the things I cannot do.

5,"I've heard a lot of good things about Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and also self-compassion therapy/practices which aren't as formal but still VERY important. Both of these therapies involve recognizing that negative emotions and experiences are a part of our lives, and by caring for/validating/seeing the reasons behind these feelings (and further learning about ourselves, through this) we will be able to understand that we may be hurting sometimes, but that doesn't mean we can only identify with that suffering. ACT uses the new understanding of why our emotions exist to commit to changing the negative behaviors associated with these feelings.

Example: When I'm sad, I usually shut myself off from the people I love. It's how I was raised to react to sadness by my family (being shut in my room and told to not come out til I was calm.) These feelings are a valid response because it's what I was taught. However, I want to react in a way that fosters better connections, instead of disappearing and making my friends worry. So, when I'm sad, I will instead ask to talk to someone, watch a show with them, or snuggle for a bit. Through this I will understand that it's OK if other people see me upset, but it's not a reason to isolate myself from others. Just because I didn't know any better, doesn't mean it's healthy or productive. I still appreciate the defense mechanism I developed, as a child, to keep me safe; however, I'm ready to let it go now, and accept a healthier behavior.

Sorry for the essay lol but I hope you explore either of these options, even if you just read about them!

5,"I think each patient is sooo different, and a combination of different parts of different therapies is most helpful. It's hard tho, often I'll go to a therapist and they'll say ""what works for you?"" And I have no idea how to answer¬†",ssprinnkless,1b81b1j
6,Right? Like I want them to help me figure that out because I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on üò≠ i talked with my crisis counselor about an hour ago and she said we can go over all the different kinds of therapies in our next session to see what might be a good fit. She really seems adamant on DBT though.,qhostfvce,1b81b1j
0,"if i were you, i would take the job offer & find another therapy alternative. i do online DBT & i can schedule my appointments after 6pm on work days. im sorry you have to pick one or the other right now but i think it‚Äôs easier to find a different therapist than it is to find a well paying, flexible job. good luck!",tainawave,17w12mo
0,"It helps. But it takes a lot of time to see progress. Therapists give you tools, if you don‚Äôt use them outside of therapy it‚Äôs going to be harder for the therapist to help you.

But if you‚Äôre going into expecting the therapist to make you feel better or tell you how to think, you won‚Äôt be as successful.",,18vy6g4
1,"it depends on what you expect from it. it didn't work for me when I thought that it works as a regular medical therapy - you get a pill and you feel better. it only started to work when I came in simply to talk about my troubles and my worries. or in other words, when I was ready to open up. the progress then showed on its own, it came sort of naturally.

4,"I also wanted to add the hardest part for me personally was just showing up to the appointments and taking my meds daily.

2,BPD has one of the highest remission rates of any mental illness. Living with it can cause quite a number of issues that someone may have to deal with it and could use therapy to help cope with.

Slow and steady...celebrate small wins, maybe start a journal and take it with you to therapy so your thoughts are more coherent. You've got this.

0,"My opinion is that self-awareness and comprehension aren't enough for most people with BPD. I myself had self-awareness for a loooong time, but that didn't stop me from making some awful decisions. It just hurt more because I was aware that I'm producing chaos, but I was unable to stop myself because those maladaptive mechanisms are so deeply ingrained in myself. I need to stick with the therapy and repeat the skills over and over and over again until they become second nature and replace those maladaptive mechanisms. It's already better, but I'm sure if I stopped going, I'd go right back to being dysfunctional despite my self-awareness. 

TLDR: I recommend going back to therapy.",slavette6,18ngqll
0,"I‚Äôve been in groups where it was explicitly against the rules to seek each other out outside of the group. It‚Äôs because if you form relationships with others, be they platonic or romantic, both of you will likely change how honest you are with the group. If there‚Äôs someone listening who has a vested interest in your personal life, it‚Äôs hard to share your experiences and painful feelings as fully and honestly.

It took me some time to come out of being quite horribly depressed where eating and sleeping normal was an achievement but when I felt a little better I started with myself.

Making a daily routine for myself really helps me in my day to day. I have scheduled free time and I set periods to dedicate for things like being on my phone using social media, playing videogames or watching tv to make sure I relax, when to have something to eat and I make sure to do things like have a bath, brush my teeth and do my skincare routine whilst taking medication. Its only a guideline to live by but I found sticking to it helped me feel certain during periods of inner chaos, and I had a sense of achievement for feeling more functional. Knowing what to expect really takes my mind of worrying and when im stressed I dont spin in circles because I always have something to do and engage in. 

I can also attest to making what I call my comfort sheet. When I was feeling good and clear headed I took the time to think of and write down what makes me feel good. On my list I have a mix of things for different levels of distress. For example if I get frustrated and need a quick short break to talk myself down I will go and make a hot drink like a cup of tea. If I need to really take myself away from everything then I will have a quiet lie down in the dark, focus on coloring in a coloring book, or I put myself in the bath and focus on cleaning myself thoroughly from head to toe. Everyone has their own small things, and ways of finding small comfort and their sense of peace in hard times. My boyfriend helped alot with reminding me to do this at first when I was quite emotional but now I feel more confident in taking care of myself on my own with less prompts.

Another thing is that I got into the habit of talking to myself when my anxieties get so out of control you feel physically terrified or sick. I mostly use this to deal with things I'd call stupid fears, the things you have no evidence for happening, like a loved one cheating, people laughing at you for expressing yourself, or imagining scenarios in which everything that could go wrong does go wrong. When I have these crazy fears I ask what evidence and proof I have for these things happening. I then decide what to do as if it had happened already and make a plan. This way I can hold reality close to me and I can say ""no i will be safe because i will do this and be ok"". 

Last is learning to practice trust in order to help with feeling safe. How you build trust is probably hard to explain but its kind of like learning to have faith in people. Me and my boyfriend started small and I began learning to do this by having ""I love you and I am feeling this way"" talks twice a day. Getting the chance to just speak my mind without feeling like it needs to be a conversation about fixing it or needing to go into detail really helped me communicate when I was struggling to verbalise it, since it was such an awful feeling. In turn when my boyfriend goes away from me I think of it as time to practice trusting him back. I tell myself I trust him and remind myself that he doesnt hurt me or betray me, and since he has faith in me I need to put my faith in him. I struggled alot with trust issues so developing trust as a kind of habit and skill makes me feel like a more competent partner in my relationship - something im prone to feeling insecure about.

All of this is premised on you knowing you're going to make mistakes. Sometimes they are big and you need to rethink or dig deep to try again. Other times its the small things you get hung up on and you need to stop yourself, realise no one but you is holding you to those standards and remind yourself that you're just a good person trying your best in the face of adversity. When its going good and you make the changes you want to change you should spoil yourself and tell yourself you've done good. Every time you go back in your head and start picking away at your achievements, big or small, tell yourself that you've done a good thing and done your best and get out your head as soon as you can by focusing on something that requires alot of attention.

These are just some of the things. These are the bits and pieces I've picked up in my last 3 years where Ive put my heart and soul into 'getting better'. Apologies for the long ass comment but I wanted to give you as many real world skills to practice rather than just saying ""oh I do 4 skills thanks"".

5,"What circumstances did your therapists break confidentiality? Mine was clear that they would only do it if I threatened killing myself *or* killing others. I do not find that unreasonable.

There is also the fact that you're young. Most psychologists and psychiatrists don't diagnose patients 18 and under with BPD unless the symptoms have manifested itself extremely for over a year.

7,"Being in my late 20‚Äôs, I would never consider dating anyone seriously who is under 23-and even that‚Äôs cutting it close.

Such a difference in life experience that you won‚Äôt realize until you‚Äôre older. Sometimes older people want to have power and control over their partner which is why they choose people much younger to be in a relationship with. However, this isn‚Äôt the case for everyone. Some people can have different maturity levels than their age reflects and not everyone has bad intentions. Still it‚Äôs important to be aware and look for the signs ‚ù§Ô∏è of course I wouldn‚Äôt want to make any assumptions.

In the past, a lot of people interfered with each other's treatment, even if it was unintentional.

Of course you're always free to do as you wish, but it might be more worthwhile to find friends more organically, such as through your hobbies.

I would also like to stress this: **Venting isn't therapy.** If you're not at least willing to look at how your brain developed growing up (especially in the interaction with its environment, the role modelling of your parents, the society you live in, etc) and the habits it's been wired to do so you can change it, then you're not really doing therapy.

67,"Let this be a lesson to you to only share ages on Reddit when it's absolutely necessary. The commenters here are like vultures when it comes to virtue signaling. To overcompensate for their own mistakes/insecurities no doubt and have completely decided to disregard everything else in your post.  

Not that it should matter but, I've been young like you and dated with age gaps and honestly only had problems if the guy was more than 10 years older. I've noticed that I've had the most success with an age gap of 4-9 years. I, like you, grew up too fast and and all that. I get it. These dudes mature slow af.  

With that out of the way, I've never made a friend with diagnosed BPD but I usually connect with people that also have some type of mental health disorder. For some reason I really click with other anxious people or people that display OCD like tendencies. Or people that are neurodivergent/on the spectrum.

75,"Unfortunately, there are some counsellors who call themselves therapists but they really aren't. Some of them are even just ""life coaches"" ‚Äî meaning they don't have any qualifications at all. It's all self branding that misleads people. 

Being a therapist means gaining the qualifications to practice and renewing that license every year. Some people get there through a bachelor's degree in social work and then specialising in psychology and certain disorders by doing more study. My preference is towards psychologists who specialise. Basically, doctors who specialise in mental health and then further specialise in BPD and other trauma disorders.

FWIW, I do believe you about your relationship with your mum. You'll make a lot more progress once you're financially independent as an adult, living separately from your original family system. Progress is hard when you're still in the invalidating environment that triggered the BPD in the first place. (Emotionally sensitive people who grew up in validating environments don't develop BPD.)

0,"For me I‚Äôve noticed a drastic improvement with the addition of DBT in my life, but I am by no means ANYWHERE close to where I‚Äôd like to be. I still have lots of rage fits and paranoia. 

I definitely still have an FP and don‚Äôt see that ever going away. As for the black and white thinking, I think that has improved a lot. It‚Äôs really helpful for me to CONSTANTLY hear, ‚Äúblah blah blah AND blah blah blah.‚Äù All of my therapists have damn near completely omitted the word ‚Äúbut‚Äù and only use ‚Äúand‚Äù this has lead me to think that way a lot too, kind of like I‚Äôm mimicking them, but also there‚Äôs a kernel of truth to it. (Think half smile/willing hands: it feels really silly and dumb and almost like a joke to do it, *and* it can really help me feel better sometimes.) 

I did DBT once before, with not much improvement. I did what I could to keep my homework assignment for the week present in my head, never ever looked at the book throughout the week, and then would rush to do my homework 10 minutes before group. Every week. You can imagine this lead to me missing a lot of connections that I would have needed in times of crisis. 

I‚Äôm in DBT again currently, with the hope of staring PE (prolonged exposure) trauma therapy soon. I‚Äôm doing DBT again so that I can have a group of people I can lean on for support. And this time around, I‚Äôm trying to do things *very* different.

After each class, I take the time to sit down and read through my homework assignment. Then, I‚Äôll usually copy it down in either my journal (which has also been immensely helpful and I can expand on this if you want) or my laptop. The act of rewriting it down helps me a lot to know exactly what I am to be working on for the week. 

This is leading me to be a lot more mindful of all the skills I have access to in times of crisis.

I kept wanting to change the convo and he kept pushing, it was so bad. This is totally not how to deal with a client, and totally not how you approach this before you establish rapport.

My two cents; one of the reasons I don‚Äôt like DBT is because therapists take this really hard like approach sometimes that people with BPD need accountability and that we‚Äôre all these explosive, reactive people. It‚Äôs really shitty, to say the least. Due to the stigma, a lot of professionals have this idea about BPD and how to treat it that ultimately isn‚Äôt person centered.

When I saw a new psych resident in the er she started to bully me when I told her the same thing and told me she was teaching me distress tolerance. That was when I met her for the first time talked to her for maybe 10 minutes then she disappears for hours with me asking for her.

Those two definitely treated me differently due to the bpd stigma. How terrible. I really lost faith in psych providers after that that I‚Äôm in fake therapy.

2,"DBT is always a solid one for BPD however I haven't been able to access that yet (thanks NHS) but I have found for me, art therapy mixed with talking therapy helped me a LOT to the point where I'm currently not a high risk to myself anymore and I'm managing my symptoms pretty safely. But for me the therapy only worked when I found the right therapist for me and with the right medication. 

The art therapy helped me to keep my hands busy and focus on something whilst also being able to talk more freely with that slight distraction. I'm also horrendous with eye contact (autism) and will fidget non stop which makes talking in therapy more difficult so the art therapy eliminated that issue since I don't feel pressured to make eye contact whilst doing the art and I don't have to fidget because my hands are busy. Also, I'm absolutely awful at art so don't think you have to be Picasso to do that. I literally just spent most of the sessions trying out different things. At one point I spent about 8 weeks making a mask of the character from a singer I liked. Whilst in some other sessions I would try to draw or paint what I was feeling (once I made a visual of what my bedroom looked like when I was hallucnating). You don't always have to make meaningful art, you can just have fun with it sometimes.

I'm also currently waiting for trauma therapy because for me I think the main thing holding me back from making it into remission from BPD is the fact that my trauma is all still very unprocessed and hardly spoken about so I feel like I need to work through that before I can begin to recover fully since my BPD was most likely caused by trauma.",RavenBoyyy,1blvb3d

It sounds like your therapist is providing a safe space to do the first step of therapy - ranting, but not helping you with the next steps - processing, learning, reflecting, ect. 

For example, my therapy sessions often go rant, have something within the rant pointed out I may not have noticed, disect why things happened, reflect and work on coping skills to not blow up as much next time a similar situation comes up. 

Not saying my therapist is the best, but hes the first person I've talked to who has actually been able to help. Ive been to 10+ therapist in the last couple years, and we click pretty well together.

1,"When I read that book, The Body Keeps The Score, I felt like it was making my symptoms worse. It was making me think about a lot of childhood trauma and stuff I didn't enjoy thinking about. I felt raw, and vulnerable. My anxiety got worse.

If being in therapy is prolonging that feeling of heightened sensitivity, you should bring that up to your therapist to see if you can get some closure on some things or maybe press pause on talking about those things for a while.

In the beginning, it can feel a bit unhealthy because you're obsessively thinking about all of the stuff you've been doing wrong and are continuing to do wrong. You become hyper aware of how hard this is going to be to stop doing all of these behaviors. It's a normal part of the process, but it should get better as time goes on.

I‚Äôd look into Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Mentalization-based Therapy (MBT). Both are designed specifically for treating BPD.

Some will say the rest of your life, others will say after a few years it‚Äôs possible that you may not meet the required criteria for an official BPD diagnosis.

Check your state's Medicaid income requirements. If you file taxes as an individual, you can apply on your own, and be accepted based on your individual income. 

If you're eligible, chances are it'll not just cover therapy, but all psychiatric medications.

I have another one you can try.
Someone from work with authority had been telling lies about how I throw cigarette butts on the ground in the smokers area. I knew for a fact that I hadn't been doing it and that she lied about me because she couldn't stand my personality. I felt so angry.
I took a minute or two to think of how to manage my emotions because it'll often ruin my focus for a long time.
I decided to be the better man.
I had made a joke earlier that I knew someone had taken very personally. So I went straight to that person and made a sincere apology to her. Her face lit up like a Christmas tree despite her trying to hide it and not wanting to admit that my joke had hurt her.

The next time I saw the coworker who had lied about me earlier I just gave her a big smile :)

I‚Äôve had 5 assessment appointments so far (I know haha) and now I‚Äôm on a 8-12 month waiting list for CAT and a psychodynamic one and will receive therapy in the first that comes up with a space as I‚Äôve been assessed as suitable for both.

17,Yes. And it‚Äôs getting worse. I‚Äôm wondering how long until the ADA steps in to say this is ableism. You can focus on one specialty mental disorder but it should be ILLEGAL to discriminate care based on one or a few. A lot of therapists won‚Äôt take cluster b personality disorders. And then the ones that do tend to veer away from us (BPD).,,tnhhfq
18,"They will only accept BPD patients for outpatient therapy if they deem therapy is likely to lead to good outcomes.

Being regularly in MH crisis, ironically means that they deem therapy as less likely to be successful for EUPD.

BPD is rather notoriously difficult to treat effectively in therapy. People need to be in a place conducive to receiving therapy. In order for it to be effective.

I had to wait over 4 years after initial assessment, 5 years post diagnosis, for DBT based therapy.

That's 9 years after initial diagnosis. 

I don't think earlier DBT would have helped me all that much. I was simply too far gone for it to work. I know this, because I jumped in and out of other therapy programs for years. I simply wasn't ready.

Therapy isn't magic.

Speak with your GP and have them not only refer you but write a letter as to why you are eligible. My guess is that because you have an 'active diagnosis' of BPD you may only be able to have specific types of therapy (frustratingly).

Saw in another comment that you use medical cannabis? How do you get around the legality aspect? My GP is 420-friendly, but has said there's nothing he can do to defend me if I get caught by the police.

As for therapy... It seems really strange that they're refusing to help you address your anxiety. I can understand some of the low-level interventions not being able to help - they're typically aimed at people who's mental health issues are very mild & straightforward.

Sadly, I'd say that negative experiences of the mental health services are fairly normal. :/ It also depends a lot on where you live. When I lived in East Anglia, I struggled to get any support for my BPD - my GP there didn't want to officially record it as such on my medical file, because of the stigma attached. Was diagnosed two years prior to that, however, at A&E during a crisis - psych waited until the end of the consultation to tell me ""Borderline personality disorder fits your symptoms"", then pissed off.

Haven't required any support since moving to Manchester a few years ago, but in conversations I've had with GPs when I've been for other things, they seem a lot more educated about PDs, & a lot more open to listening to one's lived experience.

My suggestions would be below: disclaimer I am not an expert in anything 
One thing that really helps me when I am having constant negative thoughts is labelling them - I use it when I can't stop thinking and I stop being present, but the thoughts are so loud I can't ignore them or meditate past them 
So each time you have one mark it as either crystal ball gazing (when you are trying to see into the future) mind reading (when you are projecting onto other people) or reminiscing (when you are focusing on the past) 

For Dissociating - maybe you can suggest to the leader each time you noticing you are doing it you can take a break and leave the room to do a quick meditation, listen to some music maybe have some stimulation toys fidget spinner, stress ball, that kind of thing to help you re-engage so you can re-enter and be present 

And then lastly I would suggest making some goals for yourself during the session, especially ones that combat your negative thoughts such as = asking 1 question every session, ask 1 person after the session how they felt during it, making 1 guess or suggestion (doesn't matter if it's right or wrong) and then set yourself rewards if you do them like your favourite meal or chocolate so that it becomes a positive experience again

I worked in digital design for awhile out of undergrad despite not enjoying it because I wanted to make money and be successful by society's standards but I literally hated it so much I switched career paths and started working in public health. I work in LGBTQ social services and am the manager of a low-barrier clinic. I'm applying to grad school currently for that duel master's. 

If you were to look at me, you would assume I'm just some homeless crust punk. I am queer and alternative, have both legs sleeved tattoos and both arms sleeved tattoos and a stretched septum ring and stretched ears to one inch each. I enjoy the way I look (and am attractive to other alternative queer people) but I know that by society's standards I look like a total loser. I try to stand by that I enjoy how I look and that's what should matter, but I still get down on myself because I tell people I'm applying to grad school and literally manage a health department and people just assume I work at a McDonalds or something because I have piercings and tattoos. I know I shouldn't care what others think but it's hard not to. 

The same with being transgender. I was finally a ""pretty girl"" and even got a modeling contract. But I wanted to be my authentic self and pushed through to come out as a trans man and over the years I've pursued social, legal, and medical transition. I've been living as a man for the entirety of my 20s. But I'm not exactly an attractive man. I don't ""pass"", I'm 5 foot 2, can't grow facial hair, and am just not society's expectations of what a man should be. Again, I know I shouldn't care, but it's hard not to internalize that.",,186f1db

Therapy was one of the best things I ever did, you're getting a qualified person to educate you on how your brain works. You don't even have to agree with them, but it's an unbais perspective that only wants the best for you",becominachimichanga,15hghae
1,My coping mechanism i dont see myself as myself i see myself as nagito and when i get a mood swings i start to drink a lot of water and i usually drink like 1-2l in 10-30min. My intrusive thoughts they almost cause me to do suicide or that i should kill someone. My suicidal behavior sometimes they get very intense and there was a time when i ask my friends to choke me to death when they couldnt do it i started doing it myself but it was unsuccesful. My self-esteem i have very low self esteem like i believe that im unloveable and im the worst person ever and etc. My unstable identity its changing a lot like im lesbian no im hetero im demiboy no im a boy no im nothing and my goals are always changing. My splitting i split that hard that i cant even understand it like im obsessed and in the next second im like a girlboss and i hate my fp. My distorted viewing i see things like everybody hates me and they dont care abt me and etc. My zoning outs like i start to zone out in convos or zone out during classes or i feel like the world isnt real at all.

When I mentioned this to my therapist (who I was forced to stop seeing), she used the analogy of ""putting on your oxygen mask on first before helping fellow passengers"". In other words, sometimes you need to look out for yourself first before you can help others.

Even though BPD is rough, one of the amazing things about it is how far we're willing to go for others. You care deeply for your family as well as other people and that's a strength to be celebrated. But you're aware that you need help and you're making a brave first step by seeking it out. Think of it like the oxygen mask. You're putting it on first so you can help others.

11,"It's totally understandable you are afraid but please don't feel you are undeserving of this. By feeling undeserving that already shows there is an issue of unworthiness which can manifest in many problematic ways and could be explored. 
As someone who has engaged with a number of different therapies over the years, I have gained huge insights and learned so much about myself and how I perceive things. It's not easy by any means but once you have that space to freely explore whatever is coming up, it will be something you value and look forward to. 
If you are lucky enough to find a therapist who you connect with, and can build a relationship and rapport where you feel safe, it can open up so much for you. 
It sounds like you have been trying really hard to push things down to be able to function, but this isn't sustainable and the further we push the harder it is to access the root of our issues. 
Depending on how you feel, it might take a while to build the trust where you feel more comfortable. 
In my case it took a long long time to get to the deeper work, years in fact. It wasn't that I was hiding anything or avoiding certain topics, I just wasn't ready to go there. 
It took 7 years before I was and that's when the serious work came in. 
The main thing is to get as much support as you can while you are doing this work, so you might be a bit emotional after a session. It's a brave thing to face our fears so you are doing something that will help you and your family in the long run. 
Sending you the best wishes and good luck!

Edit: I'm not sure what kind of therapy it is, but CAT is absolutely brilliant for BPD if you don't have lots of sessions. It can help with a framework of triggers, patterns and loops where you work with the therapist to break the loops or find get outs. You can get a hell of a lot done in very little time yet open up. It's like a more open CBT that's geared for BPD üôÇ",nedthestaffie,rtpt3c
12,"Re: your point about selfishness, I'm several years into therapy for BPD, and have learned that I have to fully immerse myself in a feeling before I can deal with it. 

E.g. selfishness -- if I spend a bunch of energy trying to tamp down my selfishness, trying not to know the extent of it, not letting myself look at it I will never be able to see where it comes from or be able to do anything with it. When I'm able to inhabit it and really examine it (with the help of my therapist), I can see that it comes from feeling unloved/deprived/not good enough. When I address the roots (feeling bad about myself), the branches (selfishness, among other things), start to fade away. But none of this is possible without getting all up in the selfishness itself, analyzing it from every angle,feeling it in every part of my being.

The process can be fairly agonizing (lots n lots of shame, at least in my experience), but I'm so so so much better now that I was before -- less miserable, a better friend, a better colleague, etc.",orihihc,rtpt3c
13,"Hey OP! Thinking of yourself as worthy doesn't equal being selfish. 

It's all a big chain. If you don't let other people see you suffer not to burden them, that pain is gonna come out in other ways that will end up being burdening to them.

I thought I must be an arrogant piece of shit and my self hatred is a way to keep me from getting too big for my britches etc. Because otherwise I'm gonna think I'm better than everyone else and I'm not. I'm worse etc etc. It's false. It's a false thing your brain is worrying about. What happens is you learn to stop hating yourself so completely. When you learn to cope a little better and forgive yourself, you become happier. When you're happier you treat those around you with more care. It's so so scary to start the process of change. It's down right terrifying. You can do this though. I'm also a mother and a wife. I've been in therapy for almost 2 yrs now. If you work hard and keep at it, change will come and you might be really delighted with some of the things that change brings. Oh and just one more thing.

20,"Hey! First of all I'm so proud of you for taking that first step and getting the appointment. Doing so takes a lot of courage. 

I have been in your position and I completely relate to the worries you've described here. When I first started therapy three years ago, I was terrified. What kind of person would i become if I didn't hate myself so much? I thought that self hatred was the only thing preventing me from turning into a monster.

But I was WRONG. That idea was a lie that was holding me back. I believed it because I hated myself - and so the cycle continued, of self-loathing and not getting better because, deep down, I didn't think I deserved to.

Going to therapy is absolutely, without a doubt, the BEST decision I have ever made in my life. Its effect has been transformative. I still have bad days, but I fundamentally like myself - and like being alive - more than I ever thought possible. And thinking this hasn't made me a monster. It has made me more compassionate, and thoughtful, and present than I ever could have been otherwise. It has made me a better person; by treating myself with more kindness, I have wound up treating everyone around me with more kindness, too.

So I understand how you're feeling. I really do. But you ARE making the right decision. You could we'll have just made the best decision of your life.

0,"A year is only the very beginning. BPD responds best to consistent DBT therapy, and it can take people YEARS to see improvements. It's constantly having to work on your emotional response to everything and everyone. Undoing destructive patterns, possibly addiction or SH, suicidality, interpersonal relationship struggles...it's everything. And being in therapy isn't even a sign that things are progressing, tbh. It took me 6 whole months to even start telling my therapist about my trauma, and I even liked him. It's hard. 

DBT specifically addresses the (typical) inability of people with BPD to self-soothe and regulate intense emotions. It's about rewiring your brain with new patterns of behaviours and breaking old ones. It takes a hella long time, and that's IF you're dedicated, IF you have a good team, and IF you have support externally (thinlk; family and friends). Considering your sister isnt even in DBT yet, I don't think it's fair to expect any rapid changes. All you can do is support her, respect her process, and try not to expect a 180- personality change even in the next few years.",rainbowlavalamp,12sy481
1,"Yes, therapy DOES help, but the environment does play a huge role, especially family, due to old already-established habits/patterns on both the person with Bpd and their family members. 

I'll put myself for illustration. I act so differently around friends, especially new friends bc of learned skills. Things are definitely going better in that front. As soon as I'm around family, (prolly alongside the fact that they don't acknowledge their part in contributing to my bpd and that it's *always* me not *controlling my emotions* when the very fact is I'm a lot more sensitive to stimulation due to nature AND family nurture) I revert back to pre-therapy even I didn't want to.

If you want to witness the change in your sister for yourself, I do think (speaking anecdotally) it is best for you to also acknowledge *for real* that you do play an important part in your sister's recovery. Assist her in making her environment easier for her to reinforce the good habits learned in therapy.",Beach_Chickens,12sy481

In general tho, yeah, many bad therapys focus on how the patient can seem healthier than actually how we feel. Bpd rarely goes away from therapy, and if it fully did, it wasn't bpd imo.
The things that can be done for one with bpd in therapy is
1. Better Impulse controll. 
2. Better emotional regulation (that would be about how you feel, and not how you act)
3. Stabilizing sense of identety/self which often ends up helping with emptiness as well, same as better emotional Regulation does.)

Bpd won't leave bc of done therapy. Bpd only gets better. All you can acheave is bettet controll over thos things up to a point where they dont Interfer much with your plans anymore.
General side note, quite bpd is one of the unoficial sub types that often end up building a hiracy in the comunity and get used similar like functioning lables in autism. 
Additionally, quite bpd doesn't mean less, less bad or more healed bpd. It can be equally, less or worse impactful on the individual. The only diff is that they implode instead of explode. It can screw up relationships equally and equally severe consequences as the outwardly expressed ""types"" of bpd.

In general tho, yeah, many bad therapys focus on how the patient can seem healthier than actually how we feel. Bpd rarely goes away from therapy, and if it fully did, it wasn't bpd imo.
The things that can be done for one with bpd in therapy is
1. Better Impulse controll. 
2. Better emotional regulation (that would be about how you feel, and not how you act)
3. Stabilizing sense of identety/self which often ends up helping with emptiness as well, same as better emotional Regulation does.)
Lol there is more like working through pain and memorys but thats the important part rn.
Bpd won't leave bc of done therapy. Bpd only gets better. All you can acheave is bettet controll over thos things up to a point where they dont Interfer much with your plans anymore.
A therapy that purely focuses on ""look more healthy towards the outside"" ofc sucks tho and isn't how it's supposed to be treated.

General side note, quite bpd is one of the unoficial sub types that often end up building a hiracy in the comunity and get used similar like functioning lables in autism. 
Additionally, quite bpd doesn't mean less, less bad or more healed bpd. It can be equally, less or worse impactful on the individual. The only diff is that they implode instead of explode. It can screw up relationships equally and equally severe consequences as the outwardly expressed ""types"" of bpd.

In saying that you should totally ask!! Weight and health are important long term investments and a doctor should be excited they get a proactive patient. Talk about your mental problems for why you would like to try medication(not sure your specifics), as well as your concern for gaining more weight from them. Ask if you can try some mood meds but is there anything to help you avoid gaining? Ultimately the goal is to be stable and happy. Thats hard to achieve when something is working against you. 

Don't be surprised or set back if they just want to start with one for a short time. The doctor might think focusing on weightloss could bring you back to centre mentally. Or that starting new mood meds needs to be monitored on its own before starting a second medication.

Many of the clients we see inpatient have BPD as a diagnosis. I have been in remission from symptoms and I‚Äôd like to show others how I did it and how they can do it as well.",Turbulent_String6445,1359837
2,"It's incredible your in remission and congrats.   It is a incredible gift.   

But just because you put your bpd in remission does not mean every individual can and that you have the secret recipe.   256 variations of bpd in criteria.  Brainscans clearly show just have much varying degrees of destruction with bpd.   Also has to do with what age someone is dx.   Many of us can do exackly what you did with intensive dbt etc etc and we will at the end of the day still have active bpd.    So to go in thinking because yours is in remission so if every person with bpd does what you did can put it in remission is completely unrealistic and could be actually harmful to them if you put it that way.    

Furthermore again it is awesome that your in remission, but i think you also know  just how many people come out of remission at any given time.   Imo your main job needs to be able to keep your bpd in remission.   

Working with a group of individuals that all have active bpd I think could be quite triggering for you over given time and put you in risk.   I know we can easily trigger each other.   And even though your in remission I'm guessing your still sensitive and emotional to a degree.   This can still be triggering for them.   So I think being in a group of people with active bpd is very different then just seeing a individual.    My opinion someone running a dbt group need to be a none bpd person that is very calm.   And definitely no one should tell the individuals with bpd that because this put one person in remission that they can go in remission as well.    Years of Dbt helped me with certain things but I am still very much bpd.   And for the rest of my life will practice mindfulness and dbt exercise but again I still meet 8 out of 9 criteria.   Its really hard to hear someone say hey i put mine in remission so you can do.   Definitely not the case.  

I apolize for rambling this morning but one more example why I think it could be bad for you as well.   I am a alcoholic that has 8 years sobriety.    Even though I've been 8 years sober I'd never work in a bar with active drinkers because over time thst could put my sobriety at risk.    My sobriety is a gift thst I try to treat like a baby that is very fragile.   

I think you need to treat your bpd in remission the same way be very careful with anything that could put that risk.   And I could be totally wrong about all of this either way it is admirable you wanting to help others.",Ctoffroad,1359837

I was diagnosed 15 years ago and I was actually put in a similar sort of project but it was DBT only. This was in Canada. Unfortunately I was kicked out because I kept missing the group meetings. It was hard for me to get out of bed for anything at that time due to a combination of depression and medication side effects, plus I lived about a 40 minute drive away from the hospital and often ran into random traffic and it was next to impossible to find a place to park once I got there. I understand why they kicked me out, but it was still frustrating. Also I think it was only a six month thing anyway, my home province is not known for having decent mental health care at all, or even decent health care in general to be honest, and I know it's gotten worse since I left.

AA was and is able to help to a certain degree and definitely made getting sober possible for me, but I need more.

BPD is really like those awful relationships people often start getting into when they're in high school. You know the ones where the entire time you know you should break up with the person but for some reason you can't bring yourself to do it? And the longer you wait it just keeps getting harder?

A lot of those actions and behaviours you're afraid of are the ones you've already been doing most of your life. Your brain thinks they're the only way to do things and every time you use one of those maladaptive strategies to get what you want it reinforces the idea to your brain that those are the only ways you know how to solve the problem. That's why it gets harder and harder to get treatment and trying to do things a different way. The brain is going to fight you right from the start.

But once you see the little changes, the little differences. The first few times you apply a healthy, adaptive skill or strategy to a scenario and it doesn't blow up in your face. The first time you express yourself to someone and they actually hear you because you're sharing your feelings with them not throwing them in their face. Your brain will quickly pick up that these new ways seem to be a heck of a lot easier than the others. It just takes time and practice, like most anything else.",DeadWrangler,1advnjv

2,"I'm sure every group and every region is a bit different, and I'm no expert or doctor and as always, your mileage may vary, but here is my opinion if you don't really know what to expect and are anxious:

It's not like therapy where you talk about your childhood and that sort of stuff.

In a lot of ways it will be a lot like a school class - you're sort of there to learn the skills and the system, not go over ""how your week was"" (although there winds up being some of that too). If you do have BPD  you will probably notice you have a lot of similar experiences and feelings as the other people in the group - that alone can be pretty validating. And listening to those people talk about how they are using the skills you're learning can help

But the NUMBER ONE thing is you have to do the work.. You can read about the stuff, and talk about it and watch videos on it , and learn the names of the skills but unless you really jump in and do it, you won't get much from it.

There's nothing to worry about , and you usually start with mindfulness because it's part of everything else - and that's a good practice no matter where you are on that emotional dysregulation spectrum

That's just my quick thoughts after maybe four months of being in a DBT group",loserdirtbag,vfpgpv
3,"You'll be fine. I've not done DBT but you shouldn't be afraid, in fact, just the opposite. You're going into a treatment to help you understand yourself and gain some control of emotional difficulties you might have. It does seem like your psych should be making these things clear to you, but you can read up on DBT and even watch Youtube videos showing how the sessions might look. Also, going to DBT doesn't mean you definitely have BPD, and the skills and insight you get there would be useful to anyone, even if they thought they were totally ""normal"". You're doing the right thing if you're worried about BPD and even if not, it won't harm you.

Because here comes the thing: Feelings can NEVER be proven correct - or wrong - by facts. It‚Äôs impossible. Feelings and facts don‚Äôt even belong to the same universe. And that is exactly it - when you suffer from BPD, or I‚Äôm just gonna speak for myself: I suffer from an extremely low self esteem, I cannot trust because of the experiences I‚Äôve made in the past, due to trauma my emotions are wrecked - I never know whether my fear, anger, sadness is an appropriate reaction or a trauma response.

7,"It's interesting you phrase it that way, because this is actually why I deliberately chose in-depth talk therapy over DBT. Because to me DBT is just like putting a bandaid over a broken leg. In the sense of - staying at the surface & dealing with the symptoms instead of figuring out the cause of it all and 'curing' that.

I chose that sort of therapy, because I didn't just want to be able to deal with triggered rage/fear/etc. better, I wanted to get to the root of it all with the goal of not being triggered anymore, because I've understood the underlying cause/the trauma/etc. I feel like DBT is like taking pain meds while trauma/in-depth talk therapy tries to cure the illness so you won't be in pain and won't need meds anymore.

Then bring that to the therapy session and make sure you talk about everything you wrote down

If you journal on top of this, your process the night before would also involve looking through your journal entries and figuring out what is the most important, if you saw any patterns, etc.

2,"From personal experience:

I had negative views going into group therapy as well however I decided if I REALLY wanted to see change in myself I needed to jump into it with everything I had and I have no regrets doing so. 

Group therapy offers things that one-on-one therapy cannot....I've never felt so seen and understood in my life. It was refreshing to hear stories and emotions that were similar to mine. I didn't feel like I was alone in my struggles anymore and was highly insightful! 

Luckily, drug tests weren't required however....they are there for a reason and if I had to do them, I would. 
DBT skills will teach you how to cope with your needs/wants and how to adapt to ""wise mind"" thinking. 
You won't be the only one there who is going through this so, you'll have each other (scary at first but, I was really sad when our little group ended) and you'll also have the Dr/Psychiatrist there for support as well. 

One extra thing I will mention is don't be afraid to talk about your true feelings...it's so important not to hide behind a facade because you're worried about judgement....you won't learn anything about how to deal with them if you're not honest about them either to yourself or the group. Chances are, someone else feels the exact same way as you or the psychiatrist has heard it before.

I had similar fears to you. I was worried I wouldn't relate to anyone because I believed no one was quite like me, felt things like I did, thought like I do. I was worried I would come off either too privileged or not enough because I had no clue what to expect. But probably, you'll meet a lot of people who have eerily similar thought processes to you.

I imagined group would be a space where everyone had to spill their secrets and talk about sad things all the time. In reality, we started every session with a 5 minute meditation/mindfulness exercise, then did \~1hr ish of DBT skills together, then the last 15-20 mins were reserved for discussion, if anyone had anything happen they needed to share or whatever. 

I wouldn't say I loved group. I was not a very active participant because I have terrible social anxiety and get super red/embarrassed when I have to talk in front of others.

5,Personal therapy has its benefits but so does group. If it's available and not a huge hassle to get into a group try it out. There were people in my group who originally wouldn't speak wouldn't say anything just shelled themselves off but eventually they hit a point where they open up and it's a complete 180. Going from hating group to loving it isn't uncommon it was actually more common for that to happen.,Shredgrl720,17xoowu
6,"Absolutely it was, but again that's the point of these kinds of therapies. Again to reiterate everything I am saying in this comment refers specifically to group DBT and MBT. I cannot speak for other forms of group. 

DBT and MBT are skills based groups, and you are there because you lack this skill. This is not regular therapy. These groups do not have the same goal as a 1-1 therapist session might. They are learning tools. 

The point is not that you are listening to sympathize, the point is that everyone in that room lacks the same skill. You are learning together and you can also learn very well by *empathizing* (not sympathizing) to understand how their lack of skill is effecting them, or on the otherhand how they utilised their learning effectively.

What I'll describe might sound paradoxical, but if you are going into these sessions thinking it won't work because ""this isn't personally about me"" then you need to stop being self-absorbed, and you need to focus on yourself. 

What I mean by that is, if you can't listen to someone else speak without your mind wandering to ""but it's not about me"", then you are not grasping the goal of what you are there for. You will come to learn that empathizing (not sympathizing) with someone else who also lacks the same skills (even if it presents differently, or they are at a different point in their recovery journey than you are) will be beneficial to your own development of those skills and help you reflect on yourself. You should focus on how engaging with the group can support your own treatment, while also bring aware that you are not the only person in that room.

Again this is for DBT and MBT groups. It honestly sounds like any kind of group therapy would be beneficial for you though, because empathising with others will always help your own development, and it's important to understand the different between empathy and sympathy.",,17xoowu
7,"Got you, thanks:)",Very_green_fr0g,17xoowu
8,"Well the thing that I don‚Äôt lack this skills:) I‚Äôve been doing personal CBT for several years at my homeland. Group is just the only option available in the country I‚Äôm working rn. 

Thanks for making wrong assumptions of me not knowing the difference between the empathy and sympathy.

Seems groups didn‚Äôt help you with sitting on a high horse",Very_green_fr0g,17xoowu
9,"This was incredibly rude of you. There is no ""high horse"" or personal attack in what I'm writing. I suggested why something *could* be helpful, based on what you are writing. 

Simple fact is, you keep talking about ""not being able to sympathize"" and how ""others problems won't be personally beneficial"", neither of which should have any relevance to you if you are properly engaging with group therapy where the focus is on empathizing for your own benefit.

Group therapy is not simply a turn-based CBT as I'm sure you know, so your experience with CBT may not translate so well, and actually if you are already quite ""set in stone"" about what you expect from your therapy (which is completely natural) then you might find there'll be quite an adjustment period for you to get through.",,17xoowu
10,"It was not rude, it was something you didn‚Äôt like. 

In my opinion it was more polite than writing a sheet of text with imaginary based assessments of skills and characteristics of another person. 

I was asking about sympathy because that it is the point of my interest. Also I didn‚Äôt text what you put as my quote. So the precious message is more on the side of personal attack rather than just commenting",Very_green_fr0g,17xoowu

0,So I haven't heard of MBT until just now so I was doing some research on it. It sounds pretty interesting. But it does seem like it isn't as common and is a younger methodology when treating BPD. Currently from what I'm reading DBT is still the currently used therapy of choice for directly dealing with BPD. It sounds like they are currently studying using them concurrently and they share a lot of commonalities in how they work but there are some major differences.,Psyren29,15y8759

Ive never done it with therapy since that's not available in my country and would probably be too expensive for me right now.

Personally hasn't helped my depression, however it has helped me accept more, let go more and have higher levels of empathy and connection. It also helps me with my diet afterwards, I tend to naturally eat healthier afterwards. As fory depression, it hasn't gone away after a trip, but I kind of accept that.",LetMeDisconnect,10qfu2u

3,There are ongoing studies checking if Ketamine may help with BPD.  The answer is unknown but if you meet with a psychiatrist and get an evaluation that may be a method worth checking.  Some have speculated that people with BPD have may be helped by Ketamine which can help regulate glutamate which is often out of whack in people suffering from BPD.  I wouldnt do unless with a professional.,realitycheckmate13,10qfu2u
4,"There are trials going on you might qualify for. I think that as long as itms guided by a doctor and you know the potential downfalls and SEs, it might be worth giving it a shot. Another possibility is hypnotherapy which has completely changed my mind and my life.",,10qfu2u
5,"You should not be taking anything potentially addictive such as ketamine. I get very suspicious when you mention hallucinogenic assisted therapy‚Ä¶ I hope you aren‚Äôt taking some random dude with an office space seriously.

I‚Äôve tripped on shrooms and LSD and it can work wonders if you‚Äôre undergoing a severe depressive episode or any issue like that. However, being in such a state also makes you very liable to have a bad/scary trip that might turn you off from psychedelics entirely.

I've never tried DBT because there haven't been any resources for me to try where I lived. And, when I did find a therapist who said they could lead me through it, it felt less about DBT and more about recruiting me into a cult...

I have done other CBT and ACT stuff, and I suppose it helped me up to a point. I can communicate better and my relationships are better for it I guess. I can state my needs and boundaries. I am self aware. I think things through. I can act opposite to what my mind tells me. Most of the time, if I wanted to, I could do stuff. But...nothing really takes away the mess in my head.

1,"It's your brain doing that. He's probably excited because he sees a solution to stay with you. Check your assumptions with your partner, as yours seem to be stacked on top of another, while all your thinking may be in error when your base premises are wrong.",Pelaminoskep,17rl0zb
2,"While I understand your fears I have to ask why you feel that you have to pretend to not get upset during a therapy session? Perhaps you get the impression that your partner wants it to go down that way, but I doubt that a professional therapist is going to discourage you sharing your feelings. The most important thing is to be honest, and if you feel upset by something to share that during the session and try to use i-statements. 

Has your partner indicated that they want to punish you or see you suffer? The way this post is formulated gives me that image, and that does not sound like they are a very nice partner.",bubhoney,17rl0zb

I just took a couple years out of relationships and focused on getting well and now I'm in remission. The relationships I now have have been stable and healthy, my friendships are long lasting and we don't have constant fallings out. 

You don't need to be a gym freak either! Just find a sport or exercise you like do a few times a week. I ride my mountain bike around the woods and go skateboarding, it does wonders for how I feel and it doesn't even feel like exercise because it's enjoyable. 

Therapy will help you understand yourself, start to challenge your unhealthy beliefs and behaviours and make changes around them, work through past trauma and gain peace around it, learn healthy coping mechanisms, learn how to set healthy boundaries etc. 

It's worth doing this stuff, seriously. Life's miserable when you are constantly fucking up friendships, jumping from codependent relationship to relationship, living with low self esteem and depression every day, having absolutely no sense of self etc. 

It seems daunting when you have never made an effort to do any of these things, but like anything good in life - it takes time and effort.

The reality is, if you don't get a grip over this disease, it will take away everything you care about in life. You can't have healthy ""close"" Friendships or relationships when you are mentally unwell. It just doesn't work and every time we mess up, it creates more trauma for us.",,131bt0u
1,"thank uu :) definitely understand ur point. 
it just feels so.. counterintuitive and seemingly impossible to give up what i feel like helps me and stabilizes me and.. abandon it in order to get better. do u think it will be okay without sports.. things? i‚Äôm trans as well.. i‚Äôve always felt incredibly awkward and bad in team sports or just any kind of sports environment in general because it just feel so.. wrong to me.. in many ways.. also due to bad experiences. i‚Äôm completely fine with how my body looks from at athletical standpoint & i just.. walk a lot etc (i live in europe) i dont feel ‚Äòunhealthy‚Äô.. do i necessarily need exercise?
or for example i age regress, i have a pretty separate and detached personality when little and its incredibly hard to get by alone in little space, without a trusted person (kinda resembling an FP..). and i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôll be able to.. rationally ‚Äòexplain‚Äô to ‚Äòlittle me‚Äô why its important to just stay out of it for a couple years and after that it‚Äôll be fine.. i feel like i have so many concerns with these things i‚Äôm really insecure about how effective therapy can be for me? i don‚Äôt know..",lilyvoyanger,131bt0u
2,"Therapy works. It works so much that I'm dedicating my life to it and now studying to become a psychotherapist to help people like you and I. It does however require time and effort.

Of course you are going to feel insecure. You are challenging your unhealthy and maladaptive coping mechanisms that you have been using most of your life
That's scary! The sad reality is though, you have a personality disorder. Unless you do these things, you are never going to live the ""normal life"" that you want. If we could all just live normally, we wouldn't be diagnosed with BPD. 

I feel you with exercise! I'm not into team sports either. I just like riding my bike around in nature. It gets my heart rate up, gets me out with some beautiful trees and leaves me with those happy endorphins for the following couple days afterwards. We as a species aren't designed to sit on our arses all day. It physically makes us depressed - there's extensive scientific research behind this. As I said before, you don't need to be a fitness freak! Just do something a few times a week that gets a sweat on and your heart rate up. Rock climbing could be a fun one!

When you start to feel the benefits of this stuff, you will change the way you look at it! You will start to love doing something active, you will look forward to your therapy session that week and you will enjoy your 10 minute meditation in the morning because of how you feel afterwards. This stuff isn't always a chore! It doesn't have to be boring or mundane.",,131bt0u

1,"Unhealthy Obsessions: Obsessive thoughts or fixations on people or objects that you don't actually like can be distressing and may interfere with your daily life. It could be helpful to explore the root causes of these obsessions and develop coping strategies to manage them.  
  
Self-Sabotage: Engaging in behaviors that undermine your friendships and relationships can be a sign of underlying emotional distress. It may be beneficial to reflect on patterns of behavior and explore healthier ways of relating to others.  
  
Derealization: Feeling disconnected from reality or questioning the authenticity of your experiences can be unsettling. It may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional to explore these feelings further and develop strategies to cope with them.  
  
Attention-Seeking Behaviors: Seeking validation or attention through starting arguments or begging people not to leave you may stem from feelings of insecurity or fear of abandonment. It could be beneficial to work on building self-esteem and finding healthier ways to communicate your needs in relationships.  
  
Intrusive Thoughts: Intrusive thoughts, such as obsessive thinking or unwanted mental images, can be distressing. Learning techniques to challenge and manage intrusive thoughts, such as mindfulness or cognitive-behavioral strategies, may be helpful.  
  
Mood Fluctuations: Mood swings resembling depression can have a significant impact on your well-being. It may be beneficial to explore strategies for managing mood fluctuations, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle, seeking social support, and considering therapy or medication options if appropriate.",,1bae493
2,"These are common issues pwBPD struggle with, but we‚Äôre not the only ones who do. BPD is thought to be caused by childhood emotional neglect and abuse. Children who eventually develop BPD are often invalidated (*‚Äústop overreacting‚Äù and ‚Äústop being dramatic‚Äù are ones I heard a lot*) or punished for their emotions and emotional reactions instead of being taught how to handle and work through them. Parents of pwbpd are often emotionally immature themselves which is part of the problem. If you can spare $20-$30, *the borderline personality disorder workbook* by Dr Daniel Fox is a wonderful resource to start with if you really think you have this disorder.",Dogs_cats_and_plants,1bae493
3,"At the core, it‚Äôs emotional invalidation. ‚ÄòI am in extreme distress (for whatever reason), help me‚Äô but you don‚Äôt receive any help, instead the message you receive through a caregivers action (abuse) or inaction (neglect), is that your reaction to the situation isn‚Äôt valid.

6,"I actually keep asking my psychologist about it, because a BPD + C-PTSD diagnosis validates my experience and life struggles, and I seem to be sabotaging and rejecting any and all feelings of validation, and instead keep clawing to go back to feeling like everything is my fault.
