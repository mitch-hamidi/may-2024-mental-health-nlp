0,Let's talk about untreatable/treatment resistant BPD,"So I feel this topic isnt spoken about enough anywhere. Also I am fed up of peopel constantly saying get DBT get CBT like it will fix all ny problems. 

A percentage of BPD patients are untreatable and jsut have to learn to live with themselves. 

My experience is I do not allow myself to date . I take the highest dose of miratazapine, and a small dose of quetiapine. That makes me ok to be around other people. My only full proof treatment is avoiding any close friendships or relationships. Basically I still suffer everyday,but I do not make too many others suffer with me. There for my doctor doesnt see me as an issue. 

Any other people in this boat, who have tried CBT and DBt multiple times and still as bad as they were to begin with?? I am fed up of only bring offered and recommended DBT. I think they should give bpd people a chance at other therapies. I dont want to be on anti depressants and anti psychotics my whole life.

1,Inpatient treatment,"I am desperately seeking recommendations for inpatient facilities that do well treating bpd. I know residential tends to be more ideal but I only have payment coverage for inpatient treatment, so I’m hoping to find somewhere that 1) Is longer term than inpatient psychiatric admissions typically are in the US and 2) that isn’t horribly stigmatizing or ill-equipped to deal with bpd.

3,Treatment dependence,"I was wondering if anyone could relate to this. I’ve been in and out of the various levels of care (inpatient/residential/php/iop/op) for years for both BPD and an ED. Every time I would have to leave and return to the “real world,” I would freak out because suddenly I would lose the safe and supportive environment I had known in treatment. Going in and out of those places gave me this identity of being “the mental patient” and I played that role to a T in treatment. I felt like I was better at being a patient than an adult. I’ve been out of treatment for a few years now, but I still struggle with even making the most basic adult decisions. I never had to face the challenges of being an independent adult when I was in treatment. I’ve also been on disability income for years and I live with my parents at 31. All of those years while my peers were having these experiences that strengthened their independence as adults, I was going to group therapy all day. 

Please tell me I’m not the only one who struggled with this. ",1712551855.0,False,0,6,existentialdread0,user has bpd,1bypcpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1bypcpd/treatment_dependence/

5,Treatment for Quiet BPD is different than Classic BPD.,"DBT therapy is not an effective treatment for Quiet BPD. There is an alternate type of DBT called RO-DBT. This form of treatment was developed when it was discovered that person's with QBPD were not getting better with traditional DBT. This has to do with persons with BPD being over controlled while others with classic BPD were under controlled. Here is a video describing this type of therapy and why it helps QBPD.

11,What options are available for treatment?,"I'm fairly certain I have BPD, I don't have a formal diagnosis but I fit all the criteria. I spent a lot of my childhood in and out of psychiatric institutions for suicidal depression and I think it's made me pretty good at self reflection (I hope). Once I heard about BPD and looked into it, it was a real light bulb moment for me because everything fit, I finally had a name for this condition that at least 5 other doctors had ascribed to different conditions like ADHD and NPD.

That said I don't like being sick (who does) and I want to do something about it. Idk if I'll ever have normal friends, I'm 26 so it feels pretty late in the game for that but I'd at least like to stop feeling like crap.

What treatments actually exist for BPD, is there targeted medications that have gotten good results? I'm skeptical of traditional anti depressants and therapy as iv tried both and neither worked very well, but that was close to 8 years ago and my brain has changed a lot. I'm also worried about the ramifications for my future employment if I get formally diagnosed, if I go to a doctor is this something I need to disclose to my current/future employers? I don't have any real support in my life, no friends or family who'd help me if that's relevant. If anybody has any guidance or you need more information please leave a comment.

12,Why is “treatment” always so focused on behavior?,"Tw mention of suicide 

I have BPD, but more so Quiet BPD. I’ve also gotten decent with certain coping skills, and don’t really face the relationship instability that’s really common. I don’t often lash out or hurt others. And I realize that is a privilege, no judgment to those here who do struggle with that. But it also means I’m completely on my own when I try to seek help. 

I still have the incredibly intense emotions, to the point where any conflict feels like physical pain. I still have the fear of abandonment, and impulsivity, and self destructive tendencies, and a deep feeling of emptiness. I’m unable to work full time because the stress quickly breaks me and I have intense paranoia and basically mini psychotic episodes. I feel barely contained and held together with scotch tape. 

But whenever I try to go to a psychiatrist I basically get a response of “you seem fine to me” cause they only ever seem to care about my behavior, none of the emotional reality behind that. And my behavior doesn’t look too bad considering I’ve taken steps to protect myself. I haven’t technically attempted suicide for over a year. Think about it plenty tho. 

I’ve noticed it with DBT as well. I already am suspicious of DBT cause of the religious underpinnings, but things like “distress tolerance” while useful, don’t really address the source of stress, or why that stress feels intolerable in the first place, and focuses on your reaction to it. Changing your behavior. It’s even in the name lol 

I also happen to be on the spectrum, and I feel a strange parallel to ABA, another therapy focused on training behavior without bothering to care about the person behind it. Autistic kids are basically taught to mask their autism and are “trained” into the “correct” responses or phrases without a proper understanding of the reason behind that. (A popular example with kids is saying “hello, what is your name?” Without waiting for a response.)

I can only imagine how frustrating this probably is for those of you who do deal with some of the more behavior oriented elements of BPD. Like two sides of a shitty coin, I’m locked out of getting help cause my behavior isn’t “problematic” enough, and you are potentially receiving therapy so focused on changing how you act without ever giving a shit about how you actually feel and the very real fear and pain and anxiety that drives said behavior.",1624533713.0,False,245,103,megameganium1,None,o6yvqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/o6yvqd/why_is_treatment_always_so_focused_on_behavior/

19,Almost was denied treatment because I don't self-harm.,"I recently got assessed for BPD and I qualify for a diagnosis since I have 8 out of the 9 traits of BPD. However, my psychiatrist, who I met for the first time last week, almost did not believe that I have BPD because I told her that I don't self-harm.

It's just not something I feel compelled to do. I definitely have had (and still have) thoughts and idealizations of self-harm and suicide, but I have not acted on those impulses except for once when I did try to end my life years ago. I was able to walk away from my attempt entirely unscathed, but I haven't acted on any of my impulses since then, and I have never self-harmed. 

I could just see the disbelief on her face when I told my psychiatrist this. She was incredibly skeptical of me until I told her that I have experienced a pattern of volatile and unstable relationships, other types of impulsive behavior, and literally all the other traits of BPD. Never mind that I had an assessment from my therapist *earlier* *that week* where she confirmed that I did have BPD. Only then did she hear me out to talk about getting on medication to stabilize my moods.

Has anyone else experienced this when trying to get a diagnosis for BPD? I'm lucky that I was able to strongly and soundly advocate for myself, and I do think that's the reason why my psychiatrist was finally able to entertain my diagnosis, coupled with the fact I'm very cognizant of my own issues. What happens when folks aren't that way, or they can't advocate for themselves? What happens when professionals, who it is literally in their job description to help folks like us, don't take our concerns or problems seriously? 

I have a follow-up with this psychiatrist in a couple of weeks but I'm honestly thinking about switching. I don't want someone helping me who won't believe me.",1682686723.0,False,105,50,hiddeng3ms,None,131r0xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/131r0xe/almost_was_denied_treatment_because_i_dont/
20,Managing Symptoms Without Active Treatment? ,"Hi :) I (18f) was diagnosed with BPD in December of last year. Due to recent events, I’ve moved states twice already this year. I was on medicare in my home state, and was seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist long term. After moving twice I eventually moved back to my home state, however my psychiatrist and therapist discharged me as I was under the impression that me moving was permanent, I had no intention of moving back but alas life happens. As I will no longer have insurance because I’m moving states again to get away from an abusive environment, I am no longer able to receive treatment such as medication, therapy, etc. I’ve already found it really hard for me to regulate my emotions without my medication, and my symptoms are starting to feel like they’re out of my control. I’m going to try to get insurance when I move but it will be a bit since it’s a process. I am definitely seeking treatment though.

I don't quite mean the sensory shut down/trauma response where you physically can NOT talk, I get those from time to time as well with my partner (who is amazing btw, not their fault). I mean ignoring and shutting yourself out from the phone calls, text messages, emails, not leaving the house as much or at all for a while. All friends and family pretty much cease to exist, no matter how much you know it probably worries them, and you can't bring yourself to even say ""Hey, sorry for not getting back to you yesterday!""

Been years that I (25F), have been diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, Anxiety, ADHD and Depression. I have regular psychiatrist and therapy appointments. My psychiatrist is INSISTENT that the only treatment for BPD is DBT and that’s it. She says it might take years, many different rounds of DBT or even retaking it at different locations. This makes absolutely no sense to me and i feel like her repeating “you just have to really put work in it, thats the only treatment, you need to want to make changes” is an excuse for no progress (absolutely no progress) - even had another attempt 3 weeks ago. 

Has DBT ever actually worked for anyone? I’m always on the edge, just a second away from the jump.

A lot of times I feel like I don’t fit the bill for BPD and sometimes it hits the nail. Should I broach this question with a psychiatrist and get a second opinion?

31,To early to ask someone if they are seeking treatment?,"I started talking to this girl about 2 months ago just to have fun with and fuck with.

I do like her so I told her i would love to take her out on a real date once I graduate and can focus more on that. It was understood. 

After spending this weekend with her, she told me she has a lot of mental health diagnoses. I asked which ones and she said BPD along with a couple others. We didn’t go any deeper other than what she has because I didn’t want to ask any triggering questions. I genuinely do see us within a good relationship but after reading up on BPD and seeing what happens if left untreated, I want to ask her if she’s currently seeking treatment. I just don’t want to get my hopes up that something could happen if she’s not trying to get better herself but i am more than willing to understand her and support her thru her healing journey if she is.

Saw that some slight bpd things were creeping in, cause I'm struggling with a friendship loss recently, exhaustion, and he kept replying a lot, so the conversation was a lot. So I told him about my mental health and bpd. He said it had been a rollercoaster and a lot and that I'm cool but he needs time to process it all. It's been over 3 days since I heard from him. I've tried to respect his space and only sent a couple of short messages (I know, I'm a dumpster fire). Last night I cut off my hair. I literally don't know what I'm going to do next but my throat and chest hurt so much and I'm constantly on the verge of tears. I just want to be his friend because he's the nicest coolest person I've met in ages. I don't normally get hung up on people like this much anymore. I'm barely coping. I don't have many friends. I've tried reaching out so I'm talking to others and not focussing on him but no one's replying. I feel ruined. I'm so close to messaging his friend to see he's ok. Or full on splitting on him.

and i kept gaslighting myself this time too. her response to when i told her  i didn't get into the institution that i was so desperate to get into and SHE KNEW more than anyone how stressed out i was about it. she said ""well that's surprising"" and i told her on text so i could've misinterpreted her tone but that's actually obnoxious to say to someone. i cried sm after that cuz i was truly devastated, and she dismissed it all cuz she got in easily.

and okay, i told myself she's busy with exams so she can't be free to waste her time comforting me or smth. but if i was her I'd leave evth to comfort her, cuz ik it means a lot to her. when she got in i was so fucking happy for her and made her a congratulatory card etc. and im so disappointed in her.

even if i did something to make her act this way towards me, fucking communicate about it??? and if she doesn't have time or energy for that, that's understandable too. but then dont act like smth is wrong when u cant invest some time to discuss the wrongs and make it right. like just pretend evth is fine until ur ready to bring it up.

or perhaps she doesn't want to make it right? fine that's fine too. then treat me like a stranger, not like i literally dont exist????

for the unlikely chance that i made this all up in my head cuz im going insane during exams and my period is close, I've built up enough hatred against her to never be able to see her the same again.

is that fair to her? but again, is this silent treatment fair to me?? i didn't even know she's probably my fp until i started being so unreasonably affected by all this

i feel shitty terrible demotivated and nothing makes me feel better. all cold interactions with her make me realize evth that's annoying about her and i wonder if i hated her all along. what if im just trying to come up with reasons to drop her as a friend? 

side note, i have extreme inferiority complex towards her and i believe i need her more than she needs me, in every context. so it pisses me off more that she probably doesn't give two shits abt any of this and is studying her ass off and will get amazing grades while mine plummet because she cant fucking communicate.",1701719340.0,False,0,1,Fair_Security_6418,None,18asiis,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/18asiis/fp_giving_silent_treatment/

38,Undiagnosed and not satisfied with psych treatment,"Hi 

I went through my second catastrophic breakup ever about a year ago. Self harm, threats, property damage, hospitalization, authorities called, the works. I was diagnosed with Dependent personality disorder. I truly think I have BPD due to the more violent and extreme displays I put on. I understand that’s the key difference between DPD and BPD. It was a very quick diagnosis so I assume my psychiatrist was just being cautious. I’ve been in DBT for about a year, because heartbreak me is a person that really can’t function. I cry a lot for so many reasons and I can’t stop when it starts. 

Every time I see a new psych (I mostly go for ADHD, since medicating ADHD is like pulling teeth), they try and treat my “depression”. I was on Welbutrin for a while and was so frustrated (but also not too frustrated, which felt like a problem). I couldn’t feel any emotions, which have always been my GPS. I felt so lost as to who I was or what I wanted. Most psych’s judge me for just wanting to treat myself with DBT instead of medication. I just think I was meant to feel these emotions, and I guess I just got to learn to cope. 

Would it help to request a BPD diagnosis? I’ve been scared to because of stigma, but I think I need someone that understands the difference between what I feel and just standard depression. I also want therapy to be regarded as a valid treatment. Welbutrin did help me, but for what? I wasn’t me anymore.

44,FP and the effect on treatment,"I think it’s clear that if you have a strong, stable, healthy, support system behind you, then it is a good foundation for success when it comes to treatment . Not just with BPD, any mental health disorder. 

But that leaves me questioning those of us sort of in the middle. Or in a complex situation, per say. Considering the complex nature of relationships of those with BPD, it leaves me wondering the impact support (and the type of it) has on engagement with treatment. 

Is it better to enter treatment without a “favourite person”? How can you prevent a member of your support system becoming a FP during the process of treatment? Or does it matter, if the person is active and supportive? Are those without a support system “doomed to fail” treatment? Does treatment feel more or less productive with/without said support? Is it more physical support (i.e funding for treatment ) or emotional (i.e processing therapy afterwards) that was felt needed? 

I also don’t fail to recognise the individual’s need to actively participate in their own treatment. I’m looking for more individual experience, as it’s something I’ve been thinking a lot lately.

I have pretty high expectations and I am very specific about it, but when it comes to applying them in real life, I mess up. 

For example, I in no regards accept cheating as something normal, it’s unforgivable.

But in real life, if my partner were to like other girl’s posts and I wouldn’t like it, I would silently tolerate it. 

And this goes for the rest. I think I’m actually getting decent treatment then look back at it and think how not okay it was.

I think to myself I should be realistic and not be rigid with my expectations ( and they are alot) but somehow end up once again disappointed, no matter what.

50,How much is the chance of saving a relationship with a partner having BPD who doesn't seek treatment?,"I (23M) am in a 4months old relationship with my girl friend (26F). Although she's not diagnosed with BPD, she has most of its symptoms such as impulsivity, quick mood shift, emotional instability and fear of abandonment.

Although the relationship is fairly new and we are still in the honeymoon phase; we've already had 4 conflicts due to disagreements on unimportant issues led to temporary disconnections. She gets irritated and angry quickly and instead of resolving the problem via conversation in a peaceful manner, shuts off abruptly.

The blockings have never lasted more than a day and she refollows and reaches out again as soon as the resentment due to outrage is over. Her quick reconnection and willingness to contact or meet after each round of these short-term break ups give me a feeling that she might have dependency issues.

I know that having arguments almost once per a couple of weeks might be uncommon during honeymoon when people show the best versions of themselves or at least address them in a mature way. Specifically for people having BPD, this should be a period with infatuation and tendency to idealize their partner. But the devaluation (though temporary and at not intense levels) seems to have been started rather early.

She's never taken medication nor is interested in seeking therapy. But I know that it's been years that she's struggling with controlling her anger and her only mechanism to cope with her quick mood shifts is chronic vaping.

53,"Advice for seeking DBT treatment, as a teenager with skeptical caretakers.","As an underage person, it is really hard (if not impossible) to seek any kind of medical treatment when your legal guardians don’t fully support you. Although I’m not formally diagnosed with BPD, my past therapists have all agreed in the fact that I have “BPD tendencies”, but refused to diagnose me given the stigma this disorder has in our society. Regardless of whether I have it or not, I still struggle with said symptoms nearly everyday and they affect many aspects of my life. I‘ve been on CBT therapy for the last 7 months and it has helped me manage *some* symptoms, but for the most part I’m still struggling with the most “detrimental“ ones. 

I’ve been researching about DBT, basically how it works better for individuals struggling with BPD symptoms and i felt compelled on perhaps trying it out. The problem is, my caretakers are really skeptical about the whole mental health thing, and even if my concerns regarding my psychological wellbeing are valid, they will just brush it off and invalidate my feelings. It‘s important to note that I’ve repeatedly reached out to them for help throughout the course of the last few years but ended up with no results. Only reason why I’m on CBT right now is because I used to have really bad anxiety attacks and my school got involved. Point is, they normally would not take my concerns seriously and just call me a hypochondriac.

So, please, if anyone could advise me anything on how to “get better“, manage my symptoms and perhaps seek for treatment, I‘d appreciate it a lot.

There’s a few reasons why i don’t want treatment but the biggest one is that i prefer the emotional highs and lows, to the much more limited range of emotion that i feel healthy (or medicated) people have. I mean the lows are lowww, like contemplating suicide because someone ignored my text, but the highs are comparable to the times i’ve taken stimulants like adderall.

In may 2022 I completed an undergrad thesis (with about a million extensions from the students with disabilities office). It was titled “BPD, not BAD”. I researched the correlation between stigmatizing beliefs about BPD and our access to quality treatment. Tonight I found out that the Sashbear organization may include part of my writing in their next newsletter. 
It led me to paint a cathartic image. 
This painting features me writing, hairy legs, bruised toenail and all, on a scary, swirling black screen which is vanquished with the words: “I’M NOT BAD”. 
It overlays a watercolour image of a recurrent dream. **I’m curious if anyone else has had this dream?** It begins with a black large triangle appearing, which I am afraid of bc it is pure evil. The rest of me, the essence of me melts into geometric shapes that are being pulled into the triangle. I awake terrified with the realization that I may just be bad.

I’ve had anxiety and OCD since I was a young child. 

I’ve taken every SSRI, SNRI, antipsychotic in the book. My current therapist whom I see once a week for DBT skills and trauma work recommended the esketamine nasal route to “take the edge off”. I’m strongly considering it barring issues with insurance coverage but was wondering if anyone else has tried anything in combination with weekly therapy that has proven to be effective for them. I lead a pretty balanced lifestyle, work FT, could probably exercise more but then again so could all of us. I partake in 420 pretty frequently. I don’t drink alcohol or engage in other drug use. 

I’ve seen people take more spiritual routes too with things like meditation, shadow work, etc. I’m just curious to see what people think of these ideas, I’m open to anything that doesn’t involve taking 5 different psych meds at once. I’ve been in treatment for mental health issues for nearly 20 years but haven’t had luck really getting to a point of “remission”, I still have frequent episodes and bouts of severe depression/SI.

70,3 years in treatment and I still sometimes think I don't have BPD,"I entered treatment for BPD with a psychiatrist 3 years ago, and since then I've gotten confirmation from multiple professionals (her included) that I have it. But I invalidate myself all the time because I suggested the possibility and was told pwBPD don't have self-awareness and that I'm too high-functioning (hate that word).

Now despite how much confirmation I get, I still doubt myself and my experience, especially when I'm more stable -- and even though I know BPD is a spectrum and that people have vastly different presentations. I can recheck the symptoms or watch videos about it and either think, ""This is so me"" or ""Am I exaggerating?"".

I think I have the same emotional need for reassurance that I've struggled with in my romantic relationship. Validation that I'm loved or important to others, or validation that I'm sick = proof that I exist and am seen. 

So I feel like I need to hear ""You have BPD"" the same way I need to hear ""I love you"" or ""You did a great job on this"" or for someone to text me back etc. I hear it a million times, but it doesn't stick. 

Also I think my tendency to think in black and white makes me want TOTAL validation in every way -- that I meet every symptom and it's real etc -- that I can't accept anything in between or it being ""mild"" in severity (because I'm not throwing myself in front of a car or some shit).

I (33M) am dating a pwBPD (30F) for about 2 months now, we've only been on one date so far due to her working a lot (2 jobs) and I being busy with birthdays, mine and family and going on Holiday for mine. We have been having great conversations with laughs etc.. we had arranged to meet up last weekend but Tuesday of that week when we were talking, to me she misread my message and thought I was insinuating she was being unfaithful...
Now this never crossed my mind that she would decide to do this to me after being previously in a long term relationship of about 5/6 years and engaged.

For clarity, she liked me to keep her company so to speak while she was working her 2nd job. So I would message etc.. on this Tuesday I had messaged her but she didn't respond till she got home, even though she was online multiple times.
So in a playful way I said she didn't need me to keep her company tonight as she had her friends to instead.
Once she replied, I knew instantly she wasn't happy, I apologised as I was trying to upset her.
So begun the first silent treatment. For nearly a week. It had triggered my anxiety of being abandoned/rejected (I have Anxious attachment) so I was constantly messaging apologising, trying to get her to respond. She did eventually and I explained I wasn't accusing/insinuating anything. She said she will respond and to be patient with her. Now myself feeling down not knowing what was going on whether she was ghosting and would never reply again after that. She did eventually Monday this week, stating she needed some time and that we are still dating.

So as of yesterday morning she responded to my messages but now back to silent treatment? This time I am being calm and am just checking in reassuring that I'm not leaving nor giving up. Trying to be understanding and of course want her to talk to me to help me understand more and learn but in her own time.

I found something on here that I sent her (D.E.A.R.M.A.N), saying I mean no harm by sending it and just want to be helpful. As I don't want her to feel like I'm abandoning her as I believe it is a fear of hers, from previous social media post she's shared etc...

I have seen her online on insta, recently as like an hour ago but again I'm remaining calm to not trigger myself.

So I just want some advice from you guys, especially those of you who are diagnosed with BPD, if I am doing the right thing of checking in and reassuring her or is there anything else I can do? As I'm a little worried if I don't hear from her by mid next week as we have a date planned which she is looking forward to and hasn't cancelled on yet.

81,39yo and just started treatment.,"I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder in my late teen years. And so started taking anti-depresants and trying all manner of bullshit remedies. However slight the chance may be, if someone said something works, I tried it. I was desperate. Nothing did work, and I know now it's because I was treating the wrong diagnosis...

I met a girl who didn't run away at the first signs of my mental illness, as is usually the case. Instead she was very supportive. We had worked issues such as fear of abandoment but it was clear my difficulty regulating emotions wasn't going to change without professional help. 

We had been together several years by this stage and she gifted me the money to see a very expensive psychiatrist at a private hospital. It was the shrink's opinion that I had Bipolar Disorder so he prescribed me Sodium Valproate. That was disastrous..  It made me super irritable all of the time. I needed further assessment but couldn't afford to continue seeing the same shrink. Instead we found a Clinical Psychologist who was much more affordable. Eventually this psych's diagnosis was BPD + Bipolar + PTSD. Apparently a very difficult combination to treat...

I started Dialectical Behavioural Therapy and regrettably didn't see it through to the end. At one point in my DBT sessions the psych wanted me to hug a tree. I said this bit wasn't suited for me and wouldn't be beneficial. He was very insistent and argued the point.  I got angry, snapped, called the sessions ""tree hugging hippie bullshit"" and left never to return. Told myself I wasn't getting much out of the sessions anyway and I'll get by with just the meds. 

A couple of years later I had a... Flair up? Episode? Mental breakdown? Whatever you want to call it, it end with swallowing a stupid amount of Diazepam. My partner found me passed out and called an ambulance. Obviously I survived since I'm able to confess all this to a bunch of randoms on the internet. That was about 12 months ago.

“At our Center, we believe that any psychiatric treatment and psychotherapy in particular, is a unique, intricate and highly personal process of self-examination and self-transformation involving a complex sequence of interactions and interventions between the therapist(s) and the patient(s). It often entails a dialectic between validation and strengthening of what is adaptive in one’s behavior and an effort to change that which is maladaptive and / or self - destructive.  
The CITPD treatment model offers specialized, person-centered, multidimensional / multivariable matrix of interventions where specific dimensions and symptoms of personality disorders are targeted by specialized treatment variables and techniques. CITPD’s integrated, intensive treatment draws extensively from evidence-based theraputic approaches”  
  
Here’s a presentation from the program director Andrew Twardon :[Andrew Twardon, CITPD Lead](https://youtu.be/i5MAwVd2tdU)  
  
For some this program can be **helpful in addressing the emotions beneath hard experiences + difficult personality traits to assist in bettering these traits, for others it can be invalidating, infantilizing distressing** and may be not a good fit exacerbating your negative symptoms and suicidal ideations. For me, it was not a good fit after trying to make it work for seven months. But again, there are people that this process works for. There are positive reviews online if you search for them. I’d recommend you read those as well. Look at all the info and make an educated decision for yourself. don’t knock it till you try it.  
  
**Are you thinking about joining? If so, I think it’s worth checking out.**  It has potential, the ability to live up to that potential is dependent on your commitment in addition to making sure you have the best primary therapist to manage your lived experiences. What’s odd is that you can have the commitment, but with the team itself it really depends on who you get and that’s an enormous variable that you’ll need to figure out when you have an intake with CITPD. Mutliple patients have expressed this to me. If you try this program or thinking of trying it, it’s my hope that you can use my experience to help guide you to get what you need and learn from my experience.  
  
If you look at the CITPD manual or videos online from Dr. Twardon, Director of the **150 patients per year program,** it says a lot about the different types of premium innovative therapies that they utilize + how they specialize and tailor their approach per patient: psycho dynamic, dialectical, metallization therapy ,cognitive, psychopharmacological, mindfulness therapies.  I didn’t experience much tailoring or a single word of support / validation during my 7 month attendance. But again, some people responded positively to this methodology and everyone is different.   
  
I say this because **every time I expressed the need for a change**, no adjustment was made, but rather it was communicated that no patient has had their therapist changed in three years minimum. I’ve seen this happen with multiple other patients as well. Theres also no information on pricing so please see below for a breakdown of the day to day in addition to a variety of details that I wish I had known prior to beginning so that I could make an educated well rounded decision.   
  
1.	Getting a solid relationship with your therapist is priority number 1 and then learning about the ins and outs should come next. Timeline to get used to culture and processes can take anywhere from a month to three months. Total length is typically 6 months to year, for some longer.   
  
2.	The time commitment is a doozy, up to **seven groups across 5 days** depending on the week. 30 mins - 1.5hrs a session  
  
3.	**$200 -$300 a day not adjusting for insurance**. So that makes it about $1500 a week for those without insurance.  If you have some kind of insurance the daily price for you can go down to $40 a day depending, I’m not fully aware on the ins and outs of medical billing. the program makes around $12MM a year at this price point for their 150 patients. There’s additional costs if you end up in the ER psychward cpap as many patients, including myself have from getting disregulated from treatment. This will be additional $$$. If you have any questions, therapists will send you to the billing department and express that any billing questions are not within their job responsibiliites.   
  
4.	3 core groups a week where you talk about your difficult experiences and understanding the emotion beneath them with 5-10 patients **1.5 hrs**  
a.	The conversations can and will be intense, dysregulating, scary and overwhelming. It can also be helpful and cathartic if you have a good group of people/ primary therapist.  Lots of conflict processing, and as someone that struggles with conflict, this was super helpful for me. People can share their feelings and similar experiences and help each other in a mostly kind way. My group was difficult, but it could also be pretty solid because of some of the people that were there. I talked about some heavy stuff and I appreciate the patients that supported me. Another patient once said that this program is like being thrown into conflict over and over again and learning from that, I mostly agree.  
b.	Group can also be empty, harmful,  infantilizing and negatively exacerbate your symptoms if you get a not so good leader.  
  
5.	**Dialectical behavioral therapy,  1x a week,** how good this is depends on your teacher here.   
a.	My teacher was very helpful when I shared my stories and asked questions.  I don’t think she had much sway in the program though. We work through this book  -DBT® Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second Edition.  
b.	**It’s odd that there’s minimal DBT integrated** in the main core groups or therapy 1:1s given that it’s such an industry standard.  I wish I saw more of this.   
  
6.	Another group1x a week that is typically education re bpd, trauma, journaling, schemas + other. It depends on the teacher.  They dive deep across two months, you learn a lot and it’s nice see education that ties to what you’re currently struggling with.  
a.	I think it would be helpful here to also have a class on structural issues around race, class, ableism ( esp with bpd) and larger broken systems that may affect and exacerbate our symptoms and how that ties into our trauma. I feel like that could be an amazing dialogue as it’s something much of america and all of the program patients deal with.   
b.	The citpd intake packet (if you want it I can share it) + the TWarden video I linked earlier speaks to inclusivity and understanding people of different backgrounds, I haven’t experienced this yet within the program as a melanated person. It seems like something that’s just said on paper to check boxes but hasn’t been implemented.  
c.	1:1s weekly/ bi weekly with your psychiatrist. These psychiatrists may be on rotation and you’ll probably only get them for six weeks max, so this is difficult when trying to have a good relationship with a medication provider.  But they basically give you drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, I heard they don’t prescribe benzos for those of you taking them etc) that may or may not help and adjust as needed. I’ve liked my psychiatrists. They try to be kind, they listen, but they are in the rat race of the medical field. Idk if they’re getting paid the $130k that main therapists get paid. They try to be helpful with the little time they have in the micro windowless offices they share. Poor guys. But they do try and I appreciated that.   
\---------  
  
1.	**Psychiatrist are only allowed to give you enough medication for about two weeks,** until your next session. This is difficult if you miss a session and somewhat makes patients feel like drug addicts given that they only have enough to survive for a short time period. These drugs have a lot of side affects if you miss even 1 day. We all know shit happens, and it’s important to feel safe with your medication and medication provider.I’ve always gotten a month supply from my previous psychiatrists and the jump to 14 pills from 30, this amount feels a bit on the controlling side.   
  
2.	While I have had solid experiences with my psychiatrist I definitely think because there’s a **revolving door** and a constant resharing of trauma to new people that causes a form of gaslighting and medical mismanagement. This is second hand, but I’ve heard it from enough people that it seems to be a pattern in the program. Trying new meds, having them not believe you when you’ve communicated that it’s not working. sorry for the caps here, but if you feel unwell and you feel they’re not listening to you, state very CLEARLY that you want what you want noted IN WRITING in your medical files. That’s how you protect yourself in the long run, and if anything does go wrong, you have it in your own words in your files. A lot of people have had to do this throughout history because they feel ignored and gaslit. It’s sad to say that this program for many is no different.   
A.	1:1s with your main therapist 1x a week 45 mins, this is the same person that runs the core group. Honestly having a good main therapist here helps a lot because they’re in charge of EVERYTHING for you, **it can be a hit or a miss.** Some therapists will be supportive and validating with guiding questions, some can be emotionless detached in silence with minimal input and vague responses. I received the latter unfortunately, but I did enjoy learning from the people around me and the other therapists that have classes.  
  
3.	It depends on your therapist, but you may get one utilizing a strategy that presents as emotionally neutral / detached. They may ask you questions about your trauma +  feelings to get to the root of the emotions, but if you happen to get triggered, dysregulated or suicidal there’s little safety in place to de-escalate outside of hospital security and psych ward placement.  Which as a brown person in this day and age, can be scary.   
  
4.	“A full spectrum and continuum of psychiatric care” is what it states on the website, in the program this means that you’ll go to the groups and sessions above, but if you get disregulated, loud or begin self harming (all very common symptoms of the the disorder,) they’ll send you to the emergency psych ward holding where they leave you to new doctors that you’ve never met to handle you. It feels like they’re outsourcing their responsibilities to ER Psych ward because they don’t have the education, capacity or bandwith to properly care for you.  And then they charge you extra for it.  
   
5.	Your primary therapist may also not prefer to answer your questions regarding the treatment itself, which is what happened to me.  I think this is ableist given that everyone learns and understands differently, and i have  learning disability. This might be ego or the modality, but it’s important to be able to have trust + a dialogue with your therapists regarding feedback, what’s working what’s not, if it’s a good fit. if he doesn’t answer questions or responds with “are you recording this?,” it’s not much of a dialogue, but a therapist that’s not able to tailor his treatment to the patient, or chooses not to. What was the reasoning? I don’t know, I asked and received a non answer  
  
6.	Also I just checked, you have the right to record your sessions in New York and you don’t need to communicate it with your therapist. But I’d double check this if you feel you need to do this.  
a.	“New York recording law stipulates that it is a one-party consent state. Therefore, in New York, it is a criminal offense to use any device to record, obtain, share or use communications, whether they are wire, oral or electronic, without the consent of at least one person taking part in the communication”  
b.	It was communicated in the orientation packet that there were team meetings with all patients and staff, I did not experience this during my time there. This would be a forum to ask questions and get answers. many patients feel in the dark from the lack of transparency. But again, I don’t think this program has the objective of being transparent.  
  
**CITPD has a very high expectation on patient behavior and an odd sense of control over it**  
  
1.	If you arrive late to group past 5 minutes you won’t get in and it’ll count as missed and you'll be charged It can be harder for some than others to arrive on time and it’s an uncomfortable feeling seeing various sick patients make the long trip to show up at 1:36 to a 1:30 appointment, to have them kicked out over and over again. But again this is the policy of the organization in place and they enforce it to the second. you get 3 missed a month, on your fourth miss you go on ITM which can lead to dismissal of the program. You can have multiple itms depending your therapist and situation. It’s not a confusing experience at all from a patient perspective.  
  
2.	Must have at least one foot on the floor at all times when you’re sitting in a chair - that’s for those of us that like to sit crisscross applesauce… because adhd   
  
3.	No sitting on the floor, even if you’re in distress. Someone got dysregulated and did this a few times and got kicked out. They even presented an apology for this twice to a group of 10. this is an odd way of implementing program rules when all they asked for was a supportive empathetic environment.  
  
4.	No stressballs or physical anxiety/ adhd tools in group. No drawing or coloring.  
  
5.	You’re only allowed to speak to therapists and psychiatrist in the program, you cannot speak to any previous psychiatrists or therapists even if they want to work with the program to help. It’s VERY siloed and there’s no explanation why. Just the expectation that we’ll follow these rules or get kicked out.  
  
Regarding twardon, the leader and owner of this program, he doesn’t really have time for patients. Or me at least. I don’t think that’s what his job in the program entails with everything he has on his plate, but it was communicated to me that if I had difficulties, he’s the next step in the powerful hierarchy that mount sinai citpd implements. my experience with him was minimal and at times pretty distressing.  
  
Sent multiple emails asking questions about program details and key performance indicators with no response. If this program has been around for a decade, there should be information on drop rates, graduate rates, death rates, patient feedback and growth. Got none of that. His main communication to me when I met him for the first time during a distressing dysregulating experience was that the clinic was closing so I needed to leave or he’ll call security. This is standard, but a strange experience at the same time. I’ve seen and heard about it happening enough times that it’s consistently their procedure.   
  
I think during these distressing times we expect some kind of de-escalating empathetic compassion from the therapists that work at citpd. That’s not the modality/ strategy that twardon/ tim chi executes on, or at least not with my experience. And the longer I take part in this program, the more I realize that this is a deliberate decision.  There also seems to be some staffing issues with doctors dropping like flies. I’ve asked why, no real answer there either.  
  
**Regarding the primary therapist that you see 4x a week (3 group + a 1:1)**  
  
Your primary therapist, from my request and perspective,  should be someone that will call you out on your bullshit and toxic habits,  but should work to understand what you need when you’re speaking through your trauma, pain or dysregulated. I wanted someone who would reassure me when I needed it, and advise me when I was lost. I wanted someone who was trustworthy. I did not receive that, even when I expressed multiple times across months, that I was feeling unsafe with the therapeutic strategy of emotionless neutrality.   
  
In response to my fears, the team gave me the option of leaving a door open when meeting with said therapist, showing a clear breakdown in communication across therapists and their leadership. When I asked for a change in therapist after 5 months of trying to make this work, twardon stated that this had not happened for the past 3 years and Chi stated that this program is made to change parts of your personality, not your therapist. This is invalidating, especially when it’s the same statement to the same question across multiple months.  
  
**CITPD program results and data accuracy**  \- success metrics, people leaving, people graduating, transfers, deaths (the diagnosis has a high suicide rate )  + aren’t available. What is available seems to be filtered to exclude patients that may have left or experienced negative outcomes. This lack of transparency bleeds into the overall program management style.  If you have 150 patients a year, the total within the analytics should include each one of those patient results across all metrics and time periods.  
  
There is a disconnect between the upper level doctors and the patients that take part in the program. There’s a lack of transparency when getting medical notes from sessions, what’s happening in the program from a macro perspective and the success of the program itself. You have to pay to get your medical notes… which is confusing, but also policy. Why aren’t our notes available online? What year is it  
  
This program isn’t for everyone, and I’m realizing that it’s not for me. I’m writing this, because I wish so hard that someone had been transparent with me from the beginning. I have a personality disorder, cptsd, and a learning disability. I’m also one of the few brown people in the program. We are people that are very sick, and yet we aren’t respected like full human beings when we ask for support or questions that any person would ask. All I wanted was transparency in my treatment and a therapeutic relationship that was supportive rather than what I received.  
  
**Diversity and inclusion experience**  
  
The main therapists and doctors are all white or white passing. There’s minimal discussion around the areas systematic oppression,ableism, racism, managing poverty or insurance. It’s overwhelming because many if not all patients are struggling on these difficulties, especially marginalized communities. When I asked twardon about insurance, he stated something along the line of this not being something in the scope of what therapists in the program do.  Given that we need doctors notes and various communications for insurance, this also feels a bit hypocritical, lacking accountability and depth when having empathy for the patient experience.  
  
**But AGAIN this is only my experience.** If you’re interested in the program, look into it, apply and make sure you get a therapist that works for you. I liked parts of the program, it’s the main therapist and broken sense of heirarchy that wasn’t a good fit.   
  
**Tips and tricks:**   
  
When you meet your therapist for intake check their vibe. Do they speak to you respectfully or is it an emotionless mask that’s observing and analyzing your behavior with no feedback? Do they answer questions in detail or is it vague lacking any depth? Is it a dialogue that you can grow from? You’ll know if the therapist that you’re speaking to is right for you. I was dumb, I knew from the beginning that I didn’t vibe with him. I was just so desperate to get better and my doctors told me this was one of the best programs so I incorrectly put my blind faith into it.  I feel like a lot of patients have this experience. Remember if you get accepted into the program but want to wait for a different therapist, you can do this.   
  
**Make a list of questions for them, and go from there. mine wasn’t right for me, but he is for some people that prefer the neutral emotionless method.**   
  
1.	ask for your therapy notes to be available in the app. This is supposed to be the standard. That way you can officially know what’s up easily and quickly in addition to the communications that are occurring on your behalf from your therapist to the larger team and their perspective of the situation.   
  
2.	They’re not going to help you with insurance, so make sure you have all your therapy, psychiatry and group notes for yourself from day 1 of the program.  
  
3.	If you’re feeling some kind of way (stressed, anxious, unsafe anything really)  and it’s not reflected in the notes, state to your therapist that you want this to be noted in your medical files. This is a way to advocate for yourself and make sure your voice is being heard.  They have to note it for you if you communicate it to them.  
  
4.	Set up time with twardon to speak about your treatment. He may or may not reply but it’s worth a shot. When I found time on his schedule he barely gave me 15 minutes and it was clear by his mannerisms that he had to leave.   
  
5.	Create a relationship with other therapists that teach dbt and the self and others classes, there’s a lot that they have to offer. But they are beneath your primary therapist in the hierarchy of power here and have no power in making changes.   
  
6.	You can ask for a break or as ‘pause’ in the program and come back at a later date.  
  
7.	If you’d like to take time off without a pause, you need to take from your future monthly 3 day limit to make that work. Max is one week off I think.   
  
8.	If you’re not getting help from your therapist or twardon, you can call patient advocacy and express your concerns here: 212 659 8990  
  
I’m just one mentally ill person, I have no power here. Treatment for mental illness is so behind in the times. But I hope that you can use my experience to get what you need if you decide to join CITPD.  
  
To the ppl who’ve gotten to the end of this review-   
  
I know you feel like an imposter because you don’t fit in, but remember that these systems and programs were never made for people like us, (female, bipoc, on the sprectrum, LGBTQIA+) so those feelings are normal and valid. You have strength, you have resilience, it’s not your fault healthcare is broken. It’s just what it is. Don’t blame yourself. Do the best you can and advocate for yourself.  If it doesn’t work, there are other programs and forms of assistance where you can hopefully get your needs met. Good luck, you can get through this.

84,Botox being touted as treatment for BPD,"I am extremely concerned for my fellow pwBPDs and their loved ones. Publications as large as The Telegraph and many other popular media outlets are reporting on scientific findings of Botox reducing depression and impulsivity in people with Borderline Personality Disorder. These are very early findings with a small sample size that is female-only. But it’s seemingly being publicized as if it’s an established medical practice found acceptable by the scientific community.

I find it terrifying that this is basically advertising Botox to a group of vulnerable, marginalized persons who often already struggle with body image issues, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, and a low sense of self-worth. It scares the shit out of me that I first saw this on Snapchat of all places. Maybe I’m being too skeptical or small-minded, some may even say paranoid, but I want to open up a conversation about it here before it becomes more blown up by the media.. and hopefully long before it becomes standard medical practice.

I’ve been self isolating for months, I realised that the friends I had weren’t safe people. No contact with family members- alienated after mental breakdown. 

Throughout therapy I have tried to take on new hobbies, make new friends but nothing sticks and seems like meeting people is not a good time. I have nothing to contribute, I’m very lost and feeling too vulnerable. 
 
Reducing my drug use has been my priority, but realised that self control is weak, it’s been far too long using it as a source of comfort. 
Reducing has also caused weight gain which is a major trigger. 
The awareness I’ve gained from CBT is insightful, but heavy. Overwhelming. 

I have not been able to implement the routines I have set, life feels really hard.

**CITPD: Center for Intensive Treatment of Personality Disorders at Mount Sinai, an individual patient experience after 7 months**  
  
Began writing this 3 months into the program, have updated up until seven months when it was clear that it wasn’t a good fit for me. I’ve had about 10 years of cbt,4 years of dbt, 7+ meds  prior to joining.  
  
**Overview/Summary**: highly regarded well known program running for 10+ yrs. Known as one of the best programs for personality disorders in America. A pinnacle for mount Sinai and mental health in the industry from a medical standpoint.

3.	**$200 -$300 a day not adjusting for insurance**. So that makes it about $1500 a week for those without insurance.  If you have some kind of insurance the daily price for you can go down to $40 a day depending, I’m not fully aware on the ins and outs of medical billing. the program makes around $12MM a year at this price point for their 150 patients. There’s additional costs if you end up in the ER psychward cpap as many patients, including myself have from getting disregulated from treatment. This will be additional $$$. If you have any questions, therapists will send you to the billing department and express that any billing questions are not within their job responsibiliites.   
  
4.	3 core groups a week where you talk about your difficult experiences and understanding the emotion beneath them with 5-10 patients **1.5 hrs**  
a.	The conversations can and will be intense, dysregulating, scary and overwhelming. It can also be helpful and cathartic if you have a good group of people/ primary therapist.  Lots of conflict processing, and as someone that struggles with conflict, this was super helpful for me. People can share their feelings and similar experiences and help each other in a mostly kind way. My group was difficult, but it could also be pretty solid because of some of the people that were there. I talked about some heavy stuff and I appreciate the patients that supported me. Another patient once said that this program is like being thrown into conflict over and over again and learning from that, I mostly agree.  
b.	Group can also be empty, harmful,  infantilizing and negatively exacerbate your symptoms if you get a not so good leader.  
  
5.	**Dialectical behavioral therapy,  1x a week,** how good this is depends on your teacher here.   
a.	My teacher was very helpful when I shared my stories and asked questions.  I don’t think she had much sway in the program though. We work through this book  -DBT® Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second Edition.  
b.	**It’s odd that there’s minimal DBT integrated** in the main core groups or therapy 1:1s given that it’s such an industry standard.  I wish I saw more of this.   
  
6.	Another group1x a week that is typically education re bpd, trauma, journaling, schemas + other. It depends on the teacher.  They dive deep across two months, you learn a lot and it’s nice see education that ties to what you’re currently struggling with.  
a.	I think it would be helpful here to also have a class on structural issues around race, class, ableism ( esp with bpd) and larger broken systems that may affect and exacerbate our symptoms and how that ties into our trauma. I feel like that could be an amazing dialogue as it’s something much of america and all of the program patients deal with.   
b.	The citpd intake packet (if you want it I can share it) + the TWarden video I linked earlier speaks to inclusivity and understanding people of different backgrounds, I haven’t experienced this yet within the program as a melanated person. It seems like something that’s just said on paper to check boxes but hasn’t been implemented.  
c.	1:1s weekly/ bi weekly with your psychiatrist. These psychiatrists may be on rotation and you’ll probably only get them for six weeks max, so this is difficult when trying to have a good relationship with a medication provider.  But they basically give you drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, I heard they don’t prescribe benzos for those of you taking them etc) that may or may not help and adjust as needed. I’ve liked my psychiatrists. They try to be kind, they listen, but they are in the rat race of the medical field. Idk if they’re getting paid the $130k that main therapists get paid. They try to be helpful with the little time they have in the micro windowless offices they share. Poor guys. But they do try and I appreciated that.   
\---------  
  
1.	**Psychiatrist are only allowed to give you enough medication for about two weeks,** until your next session. This is difficult if you miss a session and somewhat makes patients feel like drug addicts given that they only have enough to survive for a short time period. These drugs have a lot of side affects if you miss even 1 day. We all know shit happens, and it’s important to feel safe with your medication and medication provider.I’ve always gotten a month supply from my previous psychiatrists and the jump to 14 pills from 30, this amount feels a bit on the controlling side.   
  
2.	While I have had solid experiences with my psychiatrist I definitely think because there’s a **revolving door** and a constant resharing of trauma to new people that causes a form of gaslighting and medical mismanagement. This is second hand, but I’ve heard it from enough people that it seems to be a pattern in the program. Trying new meds, having them not believe you when you’ve communicated that it’s not working. sorry for the caps here, but if you feel unwell and you feel they’re not listening to you, state very CLEARLY that you want what you want noted IN WRITING in your medical files. That’s how you protect yourself in the long run, and if anything does go wrong, you have it in your own words in your files. A lot of people have had to do this throughout history because they feel ignored and gaslit. It’s sad to say that this program for many is no different.   
A.	1:1s with your main therapist 1x a week 45 mins, this is the same person that runs the core group. Honestly having a good main therapist here helps a lot because they’re in charge of EVERYTHING for you, **it can be a hit or a miss.** Some therapists will be supportive and validating with guiding questions, some can be emotionless detached in silence with minimal input and vague responses. I received the latter unfortunately, but I did enjoy learning from the people around me and the other therapists that have classes.  
  
3.	It depends on your therapist, but you may get one utilizing a strategy that presents as emotionally neutral / detached. They may ask you questions about your trauma +  feelings to get to the root of the emotions, but if you happen to get triggered, dysregulated or suicidal there’s little safety in place to de-escalate outside of hospital security and psych ward placement.  Which as a brown person in this day and age, can be scary.   
  
4.	“A full spectrum and continuum of psychiatric care” is what it states on the website, in the program this means that you’ll go to the groups and sessions above, but if you get disregulated, loud or begin self harming (all very common symptoms of the the disorder,) they’ll send you to the emergency psych ward holding where they leave you to new doctors that you’ve never met to handle you. It feels like they’re outsourcing their responsibilities to ER Psych ward because they don’t have the education, capacity or bandwith to properly care for you.  And then they charge you extra for it.  
   
5.	Your primary therapist may also not prefer to answer your questions regarding the treatment itself, which is what happened to me.  I think this is ableist given that everyone learns and understands differently, and i have  learning disability. This might be ego or the modality, but it’s important to be able to have trust + a dialogue with your therapists regarding feedback, what’s working what’s not, if it’s a good fit. if he doesn’t answer questions or responds with “are you recording this?,” it’s not much of a dialogue, but a therapist that’s not able to tailor his treatment to the patient, or chooses not to. What was the reasoning? I don’t know, I asked and received a non answer  
  
6.	Also I just checked, you have the right to record your sessions in New York and you don’t need to communicate it with your therapist. But I’d double check this if you feel you need to do this.  
a.	“New York recording law stipulates that it is a one-party consent state. Therefore, in New York, it is a criminal offense to use any device to record, obtain, share or use communications, whether they are wire, oral or electronic, without the consent of at least one person taking part in the communication”  
b.	It was communicated in the orientation packet that there were team meetings with all patients and staff, I did not experience this during my time there. This would be a forum to ask questions and get answers. many patients feel in the dark from the lack of transparency. But again, I don’t think this program has the objective of being transparent.  
  
**CITPD has a very high expectation on patient behavior and an odd sense of control over it**  
  
1.	If you arrive late to group past 5 minutes you won’t get in and it’ll count as missed and you'll be charged It can be harder for some than others to arrive on time and it’s an uncomfortable feeling seeing various sick patients make the long trip to show up at 1:36 to a 1:30 appointment, to have them kicked out over and over again. But again this is the policy of the organization in place and they enforce it to the second. you get 3 missed a month, on your fourth miss you go on ITM which can lead to dismissal of the program. You can have multiple itms depending your therapist and situation. It’s not a confusing experience at all from a patient perspective.  
  
2.	Must have at least one foot on the floor at all times when you’re sitting in a chair - that’s for those of us that like to sit crisscross applesauce… because adhd   
  
3.	No sitting on the floor, even if you’re in distress. Someone got dysregulated and did this a few times and got kicked out. They even presented an apology for this twice to a group of 10. this is an odd way of implementing program rules when all they asked for was a supportive empathetic environment.  
  
4.	No stressballs or physical anxiety/ adhd tools in group. No drawing or coloring.  
  
5.	You’re only allowed to speak to therapists and psychiatrist in the program, you cannot speak to any previous psychiatrists or therapists even if they want to work with the program to help. It’s VERY siloed and there’s no explanation why. Just the expectation that we’ll follow these rules or get kicked out.  
  
Regarding twardon, the leader and owner of this program, he doesn’t really have time for patients. Or me at least. I don’t think that’s what his job in the program entails with everything he has on his plate, but it was communicated to me that if I had difficulties, he’s the next step in the powerful hierarchy that mount sinai citpd implements. my experience with him was minimal and at times pretty distressing.  
  
Sent multiple emails asking questions about program details and key performance indicators with no response. If this program has been around for a decade, there should be information on drop rates, graduate rates, death rates, patient feedback and growth. Got none of that. His main communication to me when I met him for the first time during a distressing dysregulating experience was that the clinic was closing so I needed to leave or he’ll call security. This is standard, but a strange experience at the same time. I’ve seen and heard about it happening enough times that it’s consistently their procedure.   
  
I think during these distressing times we expect some kind of de-escalating empathetic compassion from the therapists that work at citpd. That’s not the modality/ strategy that twardon/ tim chi executes on, or at least not with my experience. And the longer I take part in this program, the more I realize that this is a deliberate decision.  There also seems to be some staffing issues with doctors dropping like flies. I’ve asked why, no real answer there either.  
  
**Regarding the primary therapist that you see 4x a week (3 group + a 1:1)**  
  
Your primary therapist, from my request and perspective,  should be someone that will call you out on your bullshit and toxic habits,  but should work to understand what you need when you’re speaking through your trauma, pain or dysregulated. I wanted someone who would reassure me when I needed it, and advise me when I was lost. I wanted someone who was trustworthy. I did not receive that, even when I expressed multiple times across months, that I was feeling unsafe with the therapeutic strategy of emotionless neutrality.   
  
In response to my fears, the team gave me the option of leaving a door open when meeting with said therapist, showing a clear breakdown in communication across therapists and their leadership. When I asked for a change in therapist after 5 months of trying to make this work, twardon stated that this had not happened for the past 3 years and Chi stated that this program is made to change parts of your personality, not your therapist. This is invalidating, especially when it’s the same statement to the same question across multiple months.  
  
**CITPD program results and data accuracy**  \- success metrics, people leaving, people graduating, transfers, deaths (the diagnosis has a high suicide rate )  + aren’t available. What is available seems to be filtered to exclude patients that may have left or experienced negative outcomes. This lack of transparency bleeds into the overall program management style.  If you have 150 patients a year, the total within the analytics should include each one of those patient results across all metrics and time periods.  
  
There is a disconnect between the upper level doctors and the patients that take part in the program. There’s a lack of transparency when getting medical notes from sessions, what’s happening in the program from a macro perspective and the success of the program itself. You have to pay to get your medical notes… which is confusing, but also policy. Why aren’t our notes available online? What year is it  
  
This program isn’t for everyone, and I’m realizing that it’s not for me. I’m writing this, because I wish so hard that someone had been transparent with me from the beginning. I have a personality disorder, cptsd, and a learning disability. I’m also one of the few brown people in the program. We are people that are very sick, and yet we aren’t respected like full human beings when we ask for support or questions that any person would ask. All I wanted was transparency in my treatment and a therapeutic relationship that was supportive rather than what I received.  
  
**Diversity and inclusion experience**  
  
The main therapists and doctors are all white or white passing. There’s minimal discussion around the areas systematic oppression,ableism, racism, managing poverty or insurance. It’s overwhelming because many if not all patients are struggling on these difficulties, especially marginalized communities. When I asked twardon about insurance, he stated something along the line of this not being something in the scope of what therapists in the program do.  Given that we need doctors notes and various communications for insurance, this also feels a bit hypocritical, lacking accountability and depth when having empathy for the patient experience.  
  
**But AGAIN this is only my experience.** If you’re interested in the program, look into it, apply and make sure you get a therapist that works for you. I liked parts of the program, it’s the main therapist and broken sense of heirarchy that wasn’t a good fit.   
  
**Tips and tricks:**   
  
When you meet your therapist for intake check their vibe. Do they speak to you respectfully or is it an emotionless mask that’s observing and analyzing your behavior with no feedback? Do they answer questions in detail or is it vague lacking any depth? Is it a dialogue that you can grow from? You’ll know if the therapist that you’re speaking to is right for you. I was dumb, I knew from the beginning that I didn’t vibe with him. I was just so desperate to get better and my doctors told me this was one of the best programs so I incorrectly put my blind faith into it.  I feel like a lot of patients have this experience. Remember if you get accepted into the program but want to wait for a different therapist, you can do this.   
  
**Make a list of questions for them, and go from there. mine wasn’t right for me, but he is for some people that prefer the neutral emotionless method.**   
  
1.	ask for your therapy notes to be available in the app. This is supposed to be the standard. That way you can officially know what’s up easily and quickly in addition to the communications that are occurring on your behalf from your therapist to the larger team and their perspective of the situation.   
  
2.	They’re not going to help you with insurance, so make sure you have all your therapy, psychiatry and group notes for yourself from day 1 of the program.  
  
3.	If you’re feeling some kind of way (stressed, anxious, unsafe anything really)  and it’s not reflected in the notes, state to your therapist that you want this to be noted in your medical files. This is a way to advocate for yourself and make sure your voice is being heard.  They have to note it for you if you communicate it to them.  
  
4.	Set up time with twardon to speak about your treatment. He may or may not reply but it’s worth a shot. When I found time on his schedule he barely gave me 15 minutes and it was clear by his mannerisms that he had to leave.   
  
5.	Create a relationship with other therapists that teach dbt and the self and others classes, there’s a lot that they have to offer. But they are beneath your primary therapist in the hierarchy of power here and have no power in making changes.   
  
6.	You can ask for a break or as ‘pause’ in the program and come back at a later date.  
  
7.	If you’d like to take time off without a pause, you need to take from your future monthly 3 day limit to make that work. Max is one week off I think.   
  
8.	If you’re not getting help from your therapist or twardon, you can call patient advocacy and express your concerns here: 212 659 8990  
  
I’m just one mentally ill person, I have no power here. Treatment for mental illness is so behind in the times. But I hope that you can use my experience to get what you need if you decide to join CITPD.  
  
To the ppl who’ve gotten to the end of this review-   
  
I know you feel like an imposter because you don’t fit in, but remember that these systems and programs were never made for people like us, (female, bipoc, on the sprectrum, LGBTQIA+) so those feelings are normal and valid. You have strength, you have resilience, it’s not your fault healthcare is broken. It’s just what it is. Don’t blame yourself. Do the best you can and advocate for yourself.  If it doesn’t work, there are other programs and forms of assistance where you can hopefully get your needs met. Good luck, you can get through this.

89,Why even seek treatment?,"I was diagnosed with bipolar at the VA right before I turned 40. I took medicine religiously with only slight relief. I started having conflict with one of my kids about 10 years later and she did some research and mentioned BPD my fp/spouse concurred.

I immediately sought therapy and began DBT. Laid back liberal therapist. She was a hippie chic. 90% of our sessions revolved around the relationship with my wife. I felt she was done and couldn't say so. I begged for couples counseling. She went twice. I begged her to see a therapist. She agreed to see mine because they're was some familiarity.

I have never been so triggered since I felt she was done. It ended badly, of course. Oddly enough, my anxiety is almost totally gone. I ruminate about her finding relationship success before me and I get elevated but I honestly don't want her anymore. It's not get fault but we outgrew each other. I know my BPD was a big part but she found out she had autism. Undiagnosed officially but we have a child with an official diagnosis. I agree that she is. She's snidely avoidant attachment and I'm anxious, obviously.

It took 2 years for me to prepare for the end but I wasn't prepared for all the accusations of abuse. My therapist dropped me and kept her. I'm narcissistic apparently, among other things.

I guess I'm basically wondering why the hell I should try to change. I'm already labeled. Accept it and live it. It's the guilt of not being normal that keeps me from surrendering to they urge.

96,Advice on seeking the right treatment plan with a doctor?,"\*I want to preface this by saying I am not officially diagnosed and am not seeking a diagnosis from this post, but looking to get information from those who have been and how the process of getting help was.

I'm 22f. My mother had severe BPD (diagnosed). To be honest I am really scared of doctors so I haven't seen a professional about my issues for maybe 5-7 years, so i've resorted to doing bad things to myself at times. I think I will go see one soon because I am about to have my own health insurance from starting a new job. I've avoided doctors/therapists/social workers in the past because I was forced to see them from a very young age until I was a teenager due to court orders.

Regardless, I wanted to know if anyone has received a treatment plan that solely includes medication? Can you tell me how that experience went? I'm aware that it wouldn't be as effective as seeking therapy+coping strategies, but I unfortunately cannot jump into that right away due to severe social issues and distrust. Would it be possible for me to see someone where I can just be prescribed meds? I wanted to know if anyone's gotten a treatment plan where they started on meds for BPD and then eventually worked their way into potential therapy.

104,Diagnosis / Treatment experience in the UK?,"Hey guys - I hope everyone is keeping well. I guess I’m looking to see if anyone has had a similar experience to me.

I’ve been back & forth to my GP for almost a year now with reference to my mental health. I thought I’d finally had a breakthrough when a lady from IAPT suggested she felt it was “down the Personality Disorder route”. My counsellor at the time also advised she felt the same that that I would benefit from a diagnosis / treatment pathway.

From there, I was referred to the Personality Disorder Clinic and have been on a waiting list for group therapy. In the mean time, the clinic prescribed me Promethazine to help with my episodes. I’ve been waiting since last September and appreciate that it’s a long wait. I’ve suffered in the mean time, and been back to the Docs to see if I can be referred to a Psychiatrist / Therapist for a proper assessment and diagnosis. 

I don’t mean to seem desperate for diagnosis - trust me, I don’t want to have BPD. I just want to know that I’m going down the right treatment pathway. After all, both people who told me that it *might* be down this route closely followed up with “but I’m not qualified so take it with a pinch of salt” or so to speak. For all I know, I could be going down completely the wrong route. In addition to this, I want to tell my family what is going on with me but without something concrete to tell them - I barely know where to start. My employer has been breathing down my neck too because I keep having to adjust my hours for appointments / counselling etc but have no official diagnosis to give them. I’ve been keeping them at bay by saying it is a “complex mental health issue” but they’re starting to wear thin. 

I guess I’m just reaching out for any advice / personal experiences that might be similar? I’m sorry if this is the wrong thing to ask. Thank you for taking your time to read this.

105,How far would you go for treatment?,"TL; DR - I’m considering leaving my husband and kids behind to temporarily move to another state for treatment with a doctor I’ve known for 15 years. I cannot find quality local care and cannot afford residential self-pay programs. I feel the alternative is suicide. Is this absurd?

*The Long Version*

A bit of backstory:

I was diagnosed with BPD at the ripe age of 16 and entered an adolescent treatment program at McLean right after turning 18. 

I met the most amazing doctor there, and decided to enroll in college and move to Boston after graduating so I could continue in treatment with him. I ended up having to drop out of college, and only stayed in Boston for about 6 months before moving back home. 

I’m now almost 33, with 3 kids and a husband, but have largely been untreated since 2008. I’ve searched relentlessly for a local provider, have been hospitalized over a dozen times, tried other PHP programs, etc. I can’t find anyone that I both “click” with AND is knowledgeable enough to help me. 

Luckily, I’ve remained in contact with my doctor in Boston all these years. He really is amazing. Because of COVID, telehealth  across state lines became an option, and I was able to continue treatment with him via Zoom. Now, though, they’ve put a stop to the relaxed telehealth rules, and I’m forced to stop seeing him. Simultaneously, I am dealing with some pretty severe depression and suicidal ideation. 

I’ve been looking at various treatment programs all over the country, but they’re all a massive financial commitment that would require draining every dollar we have PLUS borrowing. These places are asking for $60k+ up front, and there’s absolutely no guarantee it’s going to be the right fit for me. 

The question:

My doctor mentioned that temporarily moving back to Boston (solo) might be an option to consider. I’m looking at potentially doing an outpatient program while simultaneously continuing my treatment with him. The outpatient program is a minimum 6 month commitment, and $8k up front. I would then need a short-term apartment rental, furnishings, living costs, etc. So there is definitely still a huge financial sacrifice there, but still not as much as a 1 month residential program. And it’s with a provider that I KNOW will get me closer to recovery, so I don’t have fear of the money being wasted. 

The biggest problem, of course, is leaving my children and husband. They’re 12, 10, and 6 - so a bit more independent - but it’s still a lot for one parent to manage by themselves. I am their primary caretaker while my husband works, so leaving would be incredibly difficult on them. All of them. We do have some friends and family that may be able to help here and there, but my husband will mostly be a single parent. I would of course fly home frequently to see them, but that doesn’t change the difficulties my husband faces.

If I don’t get proper treatment soon, though, I know I will end my life. I can’t help but feel selfish for not just settling for some local knob to try to treat me and muddle through life like I have been. I feel terrible that I’m even thinking of leaving them for 6 months. And I wonder if I’m being absolutely ridiculous with this plan. It’s one thing to make a financial sacrifice, but I’m also now majorly disrupting my children’s lives.

I’m not sure how many others there are lurking around here with kids and a spouse, but I’m hoping for some honest feedback. When does the search for quality and somewhat affordable treatment cross over into being outrageously burdensome?",1631416031.0,False,4,15,sure_to_fade,None,pmkxdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/pmkxdo/how_far_would_you_go_for_treatment/
106,Trouble sticking to treatment,"Hi everyone, 

I was diagnosed in August of 2021 and have been doing various treatments on and off since then, such as DBT, individual therapy, and medication. 

I have found that I have trouble committing to these treatments and, even though I think I am getting marginally better, I never truly believe that my improvements are “real”. I almost feel like my situation has gotten better, with fewer triggers, so that I’m not having the intense mood swings, anger, and impulsivity as before. I keep going through cycles of feeling like I’m making some improvement, but then reflecting that I’ve been lazy and actually haven’t made any progress at all — and then being extra hard on myself for mistakes or slip ups. 

For example, I used to be really bad at taking things personally/splitting. If my boyfriend would make on offhand comment about something I was doing, I would have a meltdown because I was hurt and thought he had negative intentions (like do demean me, or something similar). I had convinced myself that this had improved, but then we were watching a movie and I was making a comment about something when he politely asked me to be a bit quieter as he couldn’t hear the film. I was immediately hurt and stayed silent for the next 5-10 minutes. He picked up on this pretty quickly and got a little frustrated at me for taking it to heart. I just pretended I was fine and that I was just trying to be “respectful”. Looking back, I was very obviously hurt, and was acting immaturely to… punish him? I’m not quite sure, but it definitely wasn’t to be “respectful”.

Does anybody have any advice for this situation? On how to commit to treatment and actually improve instead of just pretending I am?",1651031168.0,False,1,0,djravi,None,ucuj2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ucuj2g/trouble_sticking_to_treatment/

108,Need insight: What would you do if a person with BPD is giving you the silent treatment? (Context in the post),"EDIT: clarification.

Hi! Firstly, that's for taking the time to read this. And I apologize in advance if I'm doing something wrong. 

To explain, there's this person with BPD that I was friends with but we had an altercation when an attempt to communicate my feelings went south. I apologized but they didn't accept it and it's been over a year by now have been avoiding me like the plague since then.

I accepted her decision to stop contact and left her alone, but that doesn't seems to be what she wanted, actually. My husband told me she told him she wanted me to apologize in person, but at the time I didn't because she didn't communicate directly to me (and didn't ask him to, so I'm not even supposed to know this. 

I should clarify that there's a huge probability that I'm autistic, so I'm already bad at getting social cues as well as communicating my own thoughts. So, if I am being clueless, that's possibly why. Same for being too scared to approach someone who could be angry at me.

That said, I left it at that but now it's been really awkward because she's my next door neighbor again. I had moved out but came back and she gets visibly mad everytime she sees me. I don't take any issue with it as is her will, but it's getting uncomfortable and I wish I could help the situation.

It's been going like: we bump into each other, I say hi, she ignores me and promptly leaves, even if she has to go on the opposite direction she's been coming from. 

My question is, how should I handle this? I could and would walk to her and apologize again, but I'm too anxious to approach her and talk about this, because I don't know how she'll react. I'd like to do that, but I'm too scared to, as I'm sensitive about the possibility of someone lashing out or saying anything bad to me in person. I don't know if texting is appropriate in this situation, either.

I'm asking on this sub for ideas because maybe other BPD's can shed a more understanding light, because if I asked elsewhere, people might not be so considerate about her disorder.

Again, sorry if I'm being bad, I don't have any ill intentions. And I get you guys can't read minds, I just don't know any better places to ask this.

Any insight is greatly appreciated.",1704691321.0,False,0,2,Flowy_Aerie_77,None,191dgtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/191dgtu/need_insight_what_would_you_do_if_a_person_with/
109,Residential treatment for my 14 year old,"My son (who doesn't have an official bpd diagnosis but ticks all the boxes in the dsm and relates to the community as if its home), has the opportunity to potentially go into residential treatment. I feel like this would be a great opportunity for him to be immersed in an environment where he can learn and practice the skills he needs to be successful in life. Once a week therapy isn't sufficient. He is open to the idea (although sad to potentially have to leave his friends, but accepts it). However, I just read that Paris Hilton was all up in arms about protesting to close down one of the therapeutic boarding schools that are an option for my son. She went there in the 90s and alleges that they beat them and kept them in solitary and were unable to write home to parents about what was happening to them. So now I'm nervous. I would assume these things aren't still happening, but its weighing on my mind. Medicaid will call any day with their decision and I want to feel confident in accepting their approval in placing him in one of these facilities. The clinician I spoke to said they are typically between 6 and 8 month stays, but I have power to pull him out at any time if I feel that is best. We talked about just having a code sentence that would be undetectable that he could write home with if it gets dangerous, but I hate that its even a thing I have to worry about.

I didn’t believe progress could possibly be real. I didn’t truly believe that I could ever stop trying to outrun the force that propels me to react so intensely to almost everything.

1. Thoughts are not facts. Just bc I think them does not make them the absolute truth about a given situation. They may just be fueled by my own patterns, emotions, traumas, etc. 

2. Therapy, esp group therapy where I started, can feel silly. It feels awkward. It feels stupid and childish sometimes. that’s a defense mechanism. You have to be willing to let that go and give things a try. Suspend your judgement and embarrassment and whatever else someone else taught you to feel.

129,Leaving Treatment,"Hi everyone im leaving the mental health system after 15 years. Im 29 and been getting support in some form (mental health team, inpatient, specialist personality disorder team) since I was about 14 years old.

My original diagnosis was complex personality disorder with BPD, antisocial PD, paranoid PD, and avoidant PD as well as depression and anxiety. Over the years I dropped some of those diagnoses and I found out at my final review a couple of weeks ago that I have also dropped the last ones so I am now officially diagnosis free and 'recovered'. 

I was told that I may have lapses in the future. 

I have my final therapy session this Friday where I will say goodbye to my therapist of 3.5 years who almost feels like a surrogate mum to me, which is going to be very difficult.

I  must have cost the NHS hundreds of thousands of pounds over the years with inpatient stays, therapy provided, and crisis team, ambulance and police call outs. But it is now finished and they wont be spending any more money on me.

I am really scared as I walk into my new life, but I am also incredibly grateful for all the support I have been given and I have worked my arse off to get where I am today.

It's been two years since I ever felt anything and it's just wow. I rarely ever fall in love. Nothing like that ever happens. But once it does I feel like I shower them with attention and shit. I'm pretty much very broken myself and my life situation isn't the best one either, but I'm trying to give her as much attention as I can. 

Anyway, not until like two weeks ago. The conversation moods rapidly dropped. I was told out of a sudden that this relationship is suddenly going too fast (I think it was the complete opposite). She doesn't really know why and I get that, it's an integral part of her personality. She needs space. I'm actually very empathetic and rather forgiving so I'm not trying to make a big fuss about it. 

We haven't seen each other for 2 weeks though and I'm worried about the upcoming events. She doesn't want to see me, rarely talks and it hurts me so bad to see her suffer. I miss her so much and I do realize that she might not see it. I really do care about her. But there's nothing I can do if she won't even let me have the conversation or just be there to support her in any way. I don't even need sex or kisses, or actually anything. I just want her to be okay.

So I'm pretty clueless right now. I fear she might leave me for some reason and that I did something wrong. I'm feeling helpless and unwelcome. I don't even know how long to wait, yet the silence makes me sad. What do I do? I don't want to enter some dangerous areas while she's in a bad mood and ask wrong questions at this point.

136,"Those who have had inpatient treatment, a question.","First off, I am not in danger and neither is anyone else around me. 

I have been treated for depression for at least 20 years, probably closer to 25. Have not been doing great with it the last couple years. But treading water. 

Diagnosed with ADHD about 1.5 years ago. Didn’t really know what to expect from the medication, so spent a long time on a medication that was just causing side effects and not improving my ADHD symptoms. 

I’m in the medical field and at my last psych appointment I said I had been depressed a lot lately- mostly about my relationships with my husband and son- and that seems to be what triggered it. My psych said her assistant was “just going to ask (me) some questions we’ve never had you answer before.” like it was some kind of routine thing. I immediately recognized them as DSM-V criteria for BPD.  Which I started to get suspicious of when researching attachment types. 

I should add I moved to a new town in November (after 10 years in the previous one) I have a minimal support structure here. I also started my MSN in January- that has led to all kinds of ADHD med changes because I’ve withdrawn from two courses in two separate terms before I could fail them or end up in a dark place. We’re trying to get accomodations now, but I don’t feel that great about it. 

My question is, without being in 100% crisis, how do you know it’s time for inpatient treatment voluntarily? I see my psych every 2 weeks and my therapist every 1-2 weeks.  I have only passive suicidal ideations (I don’t want to be here anymore, it would be better for everyone if I was gone), but no plans or desire to carry out. I have self harmed very very occasionally, recently was pretty bad. I was having a meltdown over school and scratched my arms up with my own fingernails.  At that point it was a desperate action to get me out of my spiral. 

My husband would like/need as much advanced notice as possible since he works in an upper management position. 

I’m just lost and hurting. Not sure if I should try to work through it or if it’s better to be isolated from my family for a bit.  I will admit, I have never invested the energy needed into my mental or physical health. It comes after everyone else. 

***ETA: I think what I am referring to is actually residential treatment. Which would give me needed structure and routine while I worked intensively on myself without being able to use my family/school/house/etc to avoid addressing my own needs. Thank you to the poster who helped me distinguish!

137,Is there a treatment that actually works for BPD?,"What treatment actually works for borderline personality disorder? 

I understand every circumstance is different, and many mental health types of issues usually overlap and need a combination of treatments, but I just wanna know what would be a good approach to treat someone who experiences the most common symptoms of BPD ? Did you manage to get into more stable relationships? Stopped being afraid to be abandoned? Stopped hating someone because of a small inconvenience they've done to you? Found a sense of purpose and identity? Stopped having strong infatuations over someone you've just met and become highly dysfunctional when they won't give you much attention? Stopped acting or reacting on the assumption you're always being ghosted, or left out and resenting people for this?

CBT did not help in the slightest. It was more of a way of distracting me from my inner struggles,  accepting the negatives in life and just keep on following a series of tasks to keep me busy and give me a sense of control. Needless to say it doesn't have a long lasting effect.

Counselling: basically venting to someone who just nods tells you there's nothing wrong with you and everything you experience is normal and not giving any real advice.

Medication: made me emotionally numb and physically exhausted. I felt less depressed, but still unfulfilled and I was okay with it. 

I'm thinking if would be more helpful for a therapist to analyse patterns of behaviour in triggering situations breaking them down, helping to recognise harmful feelings and how to overcome them replacing them with positive?

139,Silent treatment from BPD Gf,"I would like to get a different perspective on this. I posted this in a different subreddit and gotten advice from people who had dealt with this from someone with BPD.

My pwbpd move back to her home state and everything was good until she just randomly start being distant and asked for space to isolate her because she’s “going through shit”. She giving me silent treatment going on almost two weeks now. She set her messages delivered. I just sent this text to her today.

“Hey, I know I said I’ll give you space but there’s a lot that I need to say.

I don’t have a problem patiently waiting for you to cope with everything going on with you right now, that gives me to think about a lot, time out to read a lot about being in a relationship with someone with bpd and take time out for myself. 

Like I said before that it doesn’t really feel like we’re in a relationship because of this whole silent treatment thing that you’re giving me, which is shitty because that doesn’t make me feel like any of my feelings are validated by you. You’re the first person I want to turn to with my problems and I expect you to the only person that really matters.

I got to hang out with me brother who gotten out of jail and his now in a halfway house trying to turn his life around. I showed him pictures of you and told him “this is the person I want to marry and spend the rest of my life with.” I told him that we talked about having a baby together.

I want to be with you and I’m preparing myself to make sure that happens. If any reason that this doesn’t work out than cool, big bet on that. At least I would know because I know what I want and that’s to be with you but if we’re not together than I’m not going to halt my life. Weather I’m with you or not I’m going to pursue welding, not for the money or to have life a little bit more easier but isn’t that why people work hard? That’s my dream and that’s what I want with you. If not than that’s cool too.

I was just thinking today that we’re both adults and just a few years away from being 30. We should be able to communicate with each other, especially if we’re in a relationship together. I just want to know if you really want this? Do you really want to be with me? If yes than let’s work on it. Tell me what’s wrong and let’s fix it together. If not than I should have every right to know that. I know you’re scared about losing me again and it sucks to think about. Either way I’ll be happy or is this a way of making me choose as a test? To see if I’ll really stick it out. When it comes down to it silent treatment really doesn’t help solve anything because the problem is gonna be there unless you express what the problem is so we can both change it. 

All in all, Is it something I did to upset you? Is it something you did but don’t know how to say it? What’s wrong? I’m here as your boyfriend or at least I think I am. 
Just let me know what’s up. I’m not trying to force this relationship on you because I thought this is something we both wanted. I’m willing to work on anything and everything to make it work but I need to know what’s wrong.

So think about what you need to say and think about it 20 more times to make sure. I love you”

141,Got denied treatment for my confirmed borderline because their rule is that you cant be on any substances and i smoke weed daily for my mental health it makes me more mellow and just capable of existing. And i need to not smoke for 4 month before they can treat me.,"Cuz that makes fucking sense. 50% of people with borderline struggle with substance abuse because of their borderline but lets refuse to treat them because of the weed they smoke because they feel their emotions too strongly. WHY BECAUSE IM BORDERLINE. They give out retalin like candy but im not allowed to smoke a joint i love it here. So now i have to not smoke for 4 months and bw more fucked in the head before i can get treatment.

Edit:

I didnt think this would blow up. So ill just add a few things so people dont ask the same things.

 I dont know what treatment it was going to be i just went to the hospital and they have a personality department.

Im not in america im in denmark. And i cant pay for therapy so this is the way i get it for free.
 
I dont think i have substance abuse problems with weed i just put it under substance abuse since i mentioned the statistics neither did the psychiatrist who diagnosed me thats why i got the referral. I can take breaks and i do. Im not stoned out of my mind 24/7  but when i do have bad days  it helps me move on quicker.

My biggest problem with this is the fact that i have to wait 4 months on top of the wait i already had. If i knew i had to stop smoking for 4 months before hand i wouldve stopped 4 months ago.


And also a lot of the comments are pretty judgmental. I never said i was perfect but this is how i cope given the fact that i had no other resources  until 2 months ago.

145,My experiences searching for DBT treatment,"Hello lovely people <3

I need some help. I want to start DBT therapy but in order to do that I need to get an official diagnosis.

So I have been seeing an awesome psychologist for 1.5yr because I knew something was wrong with me. At the beginning I had no clue why I was feeling or behaving like I was, but after a lot of work I learned how to identify my feelings and my behavior patterns.

I self diagnosed myself with BPD and I shared it with my psychologist. After a test and some sessions she agreed with me, but she tells me she cannot officially diagnose me and that she doesn't feel prepared enough to do DBT (we are doing CBT).

She's helping me to find someone to treat me but it's being difficult.

At the the same time I'm in an autism diagnosis process with [Dr. Natalie Engelbrecht](https://embrace-autism.com/). I'm about to start the second part of the screening.

&#x200B;

So I'm trying to find a BPD expert in Spain and this is how it is going so far:

I'm contacting them by sending an email asking information about the diagnosis process and prices.

* TLP Tratamientos (TLP is BPD in Spanish): [https://tlptratamientos.com/](https://tlptratamientos.com/) (Barcelona)

They took a MONTH to reply. The reply: share your phone number and we'll send the information you required via whatsapp. I shared my number. They didn't send me any msg, they directly called me (surprise!). The person calling me is the secretary of the center and she tries to screen me with questions such as (and I'm not kidding) do you self-harm? You read well, a person I don't know and with no psychology degree asking this! I got triggered, I closed the call and start crying and feeling like shit.

* AMAI TLP: [https://www.amaitlp.org/](https://www.amaitlp.org/) (Madrid)

They replied in 4 days. The reply: call this number to get the information (a number you can see in the website.. I don't understand the purpose of having a contact email..).  I called and they tell me they cannot give the information I ask (WTF) and I have to set an appointment with them for that, and this appointment must be in person or via video call.  So I asked her with whom was I'm supposed to have the appointment and she tells me with a secretary, so I ask her: so like you? and she agrees. So I ask her: so can you answer my questions please? You can imagine the level of the conversation at this point.. I have an appointment next week.. Again, I got triggered by this interaction.. crying.. feeling like shit.. you know..

* Intra TLP: [https://www.intra-tp.com/](https://www.intra-tp.com/) (Galicia)

They replied the day after or the next. They answered me my questions and I started directly emailing with the psychiatrist that would treat me if I was ok. I told them it has to be online. Today I had my first appointment with the psychiatrist. I paid for an hour session but we only had 30mins session. He tells me he thinks I might have BPD but he cannot make a proper diagnosis remotely. I repeat this: I told them it has to be online. So we finished the session earlier because there was no point in continuing.

&#x200B;

Can you recommend me any specialist that does DBT and it's ok with online diagnosis? (I don't care if it's outside Spain)

Living with BPD is okay, thought I do split and my reactions and emotions are bigger than most people lol. 

How do you guys deal with your BPD? Has anyone done anything differently than I have? Was it worth it? Any tips?

155,BPD and no treatment. I have no idea where to go from here.,"Hi all. Bit of a long one but I’m really hoping someone can offer some advice or help. Any words are greatly appreciated. 

Some background;
I am 24 (f) and live in Wales, UK. 

I have been under a psychiatrist twice to receive my two diagnosis. 
EUBPD and ASD.

When I was 19 I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with EUBPD. I have always suffered from ill mental health, even as a child, but I’ll touch more on that later. On leaving this appointment I was given a printed sheet from the Internet just describing my condition. Whilst I was with the psychiatrist I asked about treatments for this EUBPD. He proceeded to tell me that the usual treatment is something called DBT, however, that there are no NHS therapists in Wales for it. I was literally like “oh. Okay.” Wtaf?

Once diagnosed I was simply discharged. I called up to ask why and they told me that “people are only under psychiatrists to be diagnosed, then it’s up to the community mental health teams,” which I can’t seem to be put under either. 
I’ve been referred to the LMHSS or some shit who called me to talk to a nurse to explain my problems and struggles. Once I finished talking to this nurse, she told me that my illnesses were “too advanced and too serious” for them to help me with and explained that there are two avenues to help with mental health care under the NHS. The LMHSS service, which is like talking therapies ect, and the community mental health team which deals with more severe illnesses. 
She explained that I should be under the latter and told me to go back to my GP and explain this. 
I have done so and have three times since, again been referred to the LMHSS service only to be told over and over that I need to be under the other type of support. I’ve been told over and over by different GPs that I will be referred to this service and to “wait for a letter” and still, nothing comes. I’ve changed GP surgeries I couldn’t tell you how many times. Honestly you wouldn’t believe how much I have pursued this. 

I have an extensive back history of ill mental health, and STILL no one seems to take me seriously. Intensive care when I was 13 from a cocodamol overdose, and several more between the ages of 13-18. Severe self harming. I was under CAMHS (Child & Adolescent Mental Health Serive) from the age of 12, saw a psychiatrist weekly and did CBT when I was with them and was diagnosed with Autism when I was 16. 

I was was discharged on my 18th birthday. My psychiatrist that I was under at the time gave me a letter with details on how to call the adult mental health services explaining that I should just be transferred over as I was currently on some section something and a care & treatment plan? When I called up to do this, some arsey nurse told me that they “didn’t do this, she’d never heard of this transferring business” and I had to “go through my GP just like everyone else.” 
I did, and then at 19 after waiting a year, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.

I’m now 24 and I’ve had no help or treatment since getting that diagnosis, except the few Valiums/ benzos that the crisis team have given me when I’ve been sent there or brought there by the police in recent years. GPS have tried me on different antidepressants, but nothing else. 
I have never been taken as in inpatient since being an adult. I’ve been turned away from A&E with ‘self care’ leaflets when I’m in hysterics and ripping out my hair screaming that I’m going to kill myself. Doctors patting me on the shoulder and telling me “best of luck with it.” 
It’s actually fucking unbelievable.

My family have looked into me getting private healthcare as I would not be able to afford it, but there seems to be a lot of struggle around me having “pre-existing conditions.” As many private healthcare insurance won’t cover these which seems a bit dumb to me?? Idk, my family looked into it. 

So yeah, I’m pretty stuck and hopeless. I’ve just awoken - well, I say awoken, but it I was wide awake just lying in bed waiting for my alarm to go off, at 9am this morning and I’m so dizzy and shitty from lack of sleep, I’m considering if it’s a good idea to cancel my driving lesson that I have in an hour. 
This lack of sleep and lack of ability to switch off is ruining my life, truly. I feel like i permanently have a swarm of wasps in my head that just won’t quit. 

I’m constantly angry and irritable and paranoid and sad sad sad sad and I just don’t want to do anything anymore because I’m usually so sleep deprived and down. My relationship is suffering because my boyfriend is sick of hearing me cry every night when we lie down to go to sleep. He’s sick of me constantly asking him for reassurance. I never have the motivation or energy to do anything. 

I pretty much just want to die at this point if I’m never going to get any help or get any better. 
I saw my GP two days ago about a problem with my periods, I was examined and I’m being sent for a biopsy thing because something is wrong with my insides so I’m terrified about that too which is adding to my stress. I tried to discuss my mental health in this appointment too only for the GP to tell me that they didn’t really have time to go over it right now, but that the surgery has a mental health nurse that they’d pass my number over to and they’d give me a call the next day to properly discuss my problems with me. Of course I have had no phonecall. 

It’s fucking abysmal. I’m at the point where I’m considering seeking out benzodiazepines or sleeping medication illegally online because from what I remember when I was given just 3 tablets when I’ve seen the crisis team, they seemed to do the trick to quiet my mind and help me get atleast a night’s decent sleep. 
I so don’t want to do this though as obviously I’m terrified of what could be in something I buy illegally. 

I don’t even know what other medications or treatments are available to me because I’ve never been offered them nor has my doctor ever discussed them with me despite my constant begging of them to help me. 

Honestly I don’t know where to go from here, does anyone have any advice for a very sad, crazy girl?

158,"Treatment - I'm adverse to it, okay?","Hi everyone, 

So I don't have a diagnosis yet. It's in the works. I've reached out to see a psychiatrist, because I know there is something wrong with me, and BPD seems to fit the bill. This is going through public health channels, so it's taking a bit of time and I have to jump through a few hoops first. 

Anyways, I've been looking at treatment options online for BPD and read about CBT and DBT. That just seems like it's... the worst? Like, I don't want to do that at all? I'm suffering pretty badly, but I just feel the whole mindset is contemptuous, dismissive of the patient's experiences and overall shitty, and I think I would probably prefer to stick with the suffering I know than constantly telling myself, and being told by others, that I'm wrong for having the feelings I have?   

It seems like every treatment for BPD out there is focused on trying to show the patient (lucky me) that they're just wrong about their whole worldview because they have ""cognitive distortion"", whereas, of course, the therapist doesn't and just knows the truth about life (sure). The patient then has to change completely who they are in order to be even remotely acceptable to society. What trauma they might have gone through doesn't matter, because what's important is that they get SKILLZ to be ""normal"". 

Actually, being normal seems like it's really important in those therapies, somehow, whereas I don't really care about being ""normal"", whatever that means. I care about suffering less and not being an asshole to others. 

Just for context, I'm almost functional. I'm freaking out most of the time, but I'm in a long term relationship (8 years and counting), I can hold a job, I went back to college where I'm pretty much getting straight A's and I'm about to graduate...  I can't seem to stop smoking, but many people struggle with that. I don't think it means that I have such ""maladaptive behavior"" that I need to change who I am. 

When I first went through the Wikipedia article for CBT, I was mad for two days straight. DBT just seems like it's everything that irks me about CBT, but more. It just looks the same to me as saying to a depressed person ""have you tried being happy instead?"", or to an anxious person ""You have nothing to worry about"". Gee, thanks, my mental health problems are fixed forever! Except that on top of it, if you don't believe the therapist, then it's because you're a bad bad person that has BPD, and as we all know, people with BPD are evil. /s  

And what about that whole ""tolerating distress"" bullshit? Like, I thought the whole point of therapy was that I'm not in distress 100% of the time? But no, it looks like I just have to accept that life sucks and that's the therapy? WTF? How is saying that to people not resulting in more suicides? 

So I'm super adverse to it. And I don't feel like that spells success for me, you know? 

I heard that those things help. I just can't seem to see how. Actually, I'm worried that trying to go through with that is just going to trigger the worst out of me. If I feel angry just reading about it online, how am I going to react when the therapist, that I have no reason to trust, will tell me that I should just take a deep breath when I'm panicked about something that's legitimately scary, or sad about something that really sucks, or angry about something that's unacceptable? 

I'm questioning even getting a diagnosis at this point. Why would I do that if the next step is being labelled, marginalized and ""reprogrammed"" with bullshit positivism rooted in denial? I wonder if I'm just better off never going back. 

I know it might be the BPD talking. But still, I think my concerns are valid. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has them.

That is a sign that deep down, there is a form of self-worth. You wanted to know what was making you think and behave this way and you found out: it was BPD.

160,Thoughts on treatment.,"I’m new to reddit/this subreddit. 

Last fall, the counselor and psychiatrist I was seeing at my exchange school told me I have BPD.  The symptoms fit, and a test I had taken at sixteen diagnosed me as likely. At the time, I didn’t understand what BPD was and mistook it for multiple personality disorder. Obviously that didn’t help my treatment any. 

Last fall was the first time I had routinely undergone treatment in years. I was 22. I didn’t love going to counseling every week. The therapist was nice and meant well. She really tried. I just hate counseling, and the 8 or so sessions we had all felt like intake. It took that long just to cover background on my mountain of problems. 

At 19 I saw someone for about a month, and she told me to just give into my feelings. Don’t want to go to school? Then don’t. Hate my job? Then quit it. Want to sleep all day? Go ahead. That’s not what I needed to hear, so I stopped. If I wanted someone to encourage my bad behavior, I could call a toxic “friend.” I didn’t need to pay for that bullsh*t. 

When I started college, I tried my school’s counseling center. Upon completing intake, the grad student told me that it sounded like I needed to work through the “trauma” of my rape 3 years prior and that I’d be placed in a victims of sexual assault group session, rather than the self-harm/eating disorder one I requested. When my objections were ignored, I never showed up again. 

At 17 I enrolled in a residential high school. Upon learning about my mental health issues, the school required that I go to weekly (sometimes twice a week) counseling sessions with the school therapist and take my medicine in front of the school nurse. I hated that counselor. I didn’t trust her. She wasn’t my friend. She wasn’t helpful. She just made me angry. I don’t even remember why I distrusted her to begin with. Obviously she couldn’t have always been that bad. But all I remember is anger and hatred. Upon telling my mom this, she sought out an off-campus counselor for my senior year, when I was eighteen. That woman was worse. She told me she couldn’t help me if I didn’t talk and get over my trust issues (okay yes but this isn’t how you address a high schooler opposed to counseling in the first place). I think I saw her 3 times.

At 16, I saw a counselor I really liked. It took some time, but we made it work. I trusted her. I saw her once a week for over six months, even though my parents wanted to cut the counseling down because it was expensive. Talking wasn’t easy, but she tried to give me all the information she thought I could process at a time. She didn’t hide things from me, and she made me feel like my therapy was a partnership. She asked for my tumblr, and I gave it to her. She saw a post about rape. She inferred. She called the police. Child services. Left my mom a voicemail. From there on out, every other session was to include both my parents. My mom spent half the time crying. I rarely spoke anymore. It wasn’t about me anymore.  



I know I’m telling this story backwards, but I do so to show that I’ve tried. I feel like all I do is try, and I’m still not better. I know part of the problem is taking so long to receive an accurate diagnosis (I began “acting out” and cutting at 14, which now feels like a lifetime ago) and being medicated for most of high school as doctors tried to treat illnesses that don’t plague me. But now I’m here, a 23 year old woman who can barely go to bed at night without crying and questions whether grad school or a psych ward is a more fitting place. 

Logic tells me I need to try therapy again. I need to learn to trust the system and let it help me. But it’s just so hard when I feel like the system has never been on my side. I’m introverted and angry and asocial. Talking isn’t my thing. Trusting isn’t my thing. Being emotional /definitely/ isn’t my thing. But does it need to be?

I’m relaying a sob story in a plea for help. Should I give therapy another chance? Is it really the solution? What are your experiences? Good and bad, I want to know. I’m just so tired of feeling alone, and I really like the idea of finally having a community here.

I  I already live a completely functional life, I know how to behave normally and control myself, but I just don't want to do this and suffer my whole life. I have learned how to do that because I am afraid of more hospitalizations, I have very bad ptsd because of them.

 I need to find a way to be able to live my life and the only thing I can think about is killing myself because I will always be me and I cannot live like that. I have tried every single therapy and medication there is and sometimes I think the only thing that will cure me is having a loving mother and growing up from the begginiing all over again. I can't do that so what can I do? I'm desperate... I think I should find a movie-like hippie community or even join a f\*cking cult just for the sake of feeling loved and having a purpose even if it's just all fake.

I have been told by the very first therapist that has ever treated me like a person that she can not help me anymore. I just feel completely hopeless and I am completely alone, I have nobody to talk to or to ask for help. I don't really want to kill myself I just need to suffer like normal people do. I don't want to go to another therapist, i need to do something new and different as to not get de same results and suffer more.

I’ve been having a really hard time lately and sometimes need to see her in an emergency session. She thinks I need something more intensive (at first that was a weekly DBT group, which I am now enrolled in). Or I need to find a new job, because I am perpetually stressed over finances to the point where it’s destroying me. She wants me to consider intensive outpatient or partial inpatient. I did an intensive outpatient once and found it to be of no help. I’m not opposed to either of these ideas but I am not on speaking terms with my parents who financially help me, and I am a single mom with extremely limited help with caring for my daughter, so I don’t have a lot of restrictions when it comes to either of these choice. I also feel someone coerced and like this is an ultimatum, which while my higher self recognizes my emotional regulation skills are pretty much non existent and my finances are dire, and something immediate needs to change. I just cried the whole session, because I am trying so hard and I’m just so sick of my life and poverty and feeling blamed for everything and hating myself. I also don’t want to talk to my parents and I especially feel like doing some hospitalization is proving them right, that I’m just a crazy unstable mess and that my  issues have no relation to the constant stress of trying to do it all on my own (raise my daughter, work full time, stay healthy physically, keep my house clean, have a stable sense of self and emotional regulation) and failing. I’m mostly upset with myself that no matter how hard I try to solve my problems I can’t seem to fix them. And I feel very alone.

The rage, impulsivity, abuse are unbearable at this point…","My (31f) sister(23f) is refusing treatment. Do you have any stories on how you managed to convinced your person with BPD to commit?

For context, she has a psychologist and a psychiatrist. My mom and I asked for a second opinion with another psychiatrist as she seemed more and more manic (spend the day organizing a suitcase, changing all furniture of an Airbnb, screaming at my mother and being very abusive overall, then saying it is our fault because we are abusive (we are not, if anything we are always walking on eggshells), breaking and throwing things etc). 

She did accept going to this appointment. This new psychiatrist is extremely knowledgeable and she is a specialist on this field. She told us that my sister seemed really eager to participate and seemed to have enjoyed the conversation, even. 

The new psychiatrist also told us that she believes my sister might have bpd with something else (bipolar, IDI, or under the autism spectrum), but she needs to continue to see my sister to find  out what the correct diagnosis really is.

To our surprise, especially after the psychiatrist’s feedback about my sister engagement, my sister tells me she HATED “that woman” and that on top of everything “she (the doctor) was ugly”. I didn’t even respond, I was dumbfounded!

At the same time, my sister did forward the request to the exams that the psychiatrist felt it was necessary- neurological etc.So, we don’t know what to make of that.

183,How to deal with a roommate who is refusing to get treatment for their BPD,"I would like to preface this with some background. The apartment we live in has four roommates to an apartment. Every month we have a cleaning check, for which we can be fined if deemed not good enough, up to $45. This roommate has been here for about a year now. We cannot kick anyone out because the apartments are rented by the room

Now for the roommate. They are a great person to be around casually, but not so much to live with. The main overlying issue is that she doesn't take responsibility or really try with anything. Some examples of these are as follows:

- In past cleaning checks, she has left the house the day before and day of without cleaning up her room, her items in the kitchen, her and another roommates shared bathroom, anything. Each time she conveniently had a friend have a mental breakdown in which she had to wrangle them up from running away.
- In cleaning checks now, she makes one of her other friends do it for her.
- She constantly plays her music and sings. This would be fine but she does so Very, Very loudly. She uses it as a coping mechanism which i understand, but not at the volume she is doing it at.
- She cant clean dishes. at all. We have tried to explain to her that she needs to use soap and scrub, but she continues to just run the dishes under water and call it good. We have had mold grow in our sink because of the food she leaves in her dishes.
- She doesn't understand what it means to put her stuff away in a literal sense almost. She doesnt get that when you get something out, it is your responsibility to put it away.
- She has stolen our food items without asking, and then lied about it when asked
- She only really seems to be concerned for our comfort when her actions make us visibly uncomfortable 
- She lost her therapist because she missed four appointments that she scheduled, and we know from her actions that she was likely out with friends when she was supposed to.
- She said that CBT doesn't work with BPD, which is untrue, as it is one of the main forms of treatment for BPD. Because of her missing four appointments our theory is that it didn't work because she didn't put in any effort to get better.
- She refuses to take medication for her BPD or like. any of her other mental issues

The three of us other roommates have no clue what to do, because when we address issues we have with her, she usually only changes to a minimal degree. We all hate confrontation, and I have been the main person to address issues (over text because that is where i am best articulated). This has made her at least a little more willing to act kindly around me, as i have heard from the other two roommates many experiences of her acting rudely towards them while im not around, when that sort of precaution was not taken before i addressed some of the issues. I know we can't force her into treatment or force her to get help, but her actions also arent conducive to a healthy living space. 

If I said anything offensive or inaccurate, please please tell me, because I do want to treat her as humanely as possible while still trying to fix issues that arise.

193,I need to go back to treatment but I'm too scared to go back to treatment.,"**TW: Sexual assault, eating disorders, suicide attempt**

From April to July I was in residential treatment for BPD and anorexia relapse (the place I went to was dual-diagnosis/co-occuring). While I was there I was sexually assaulted/molested by a young female nurse. I had a GREAT therapist at the treatment facility but I never told her or anyone else about the assault until weeks after it happened. I loved my therapist, she helped me manage my BPD so much. The day I told my therapist ended up being 2 days before my insurance cut me and I had to abruptly leave. My therapist was good friends with the nurse who assaulted me when I told her what happened she invalidated me, was extremely cold, and overall I did not feel as though I got the support I needed. When I told my mom about the assault, she told me to tell my therapist to call her. My mom said that my therapist basically straight out told her that she didn’t believe me. 

In September I had a suicide attempt because of the trauma I experienced in residential. The suicide attempt prompted my parents to move me back home with them, half way across the country. On Monday I saw a new psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with PTSD. Since I was discharged from treatment in July I’ve been struggling with purging really, really badly. I’ve also been restricting this week and I feel like I need to go back to treatment for my eating disorder and PTSD/trauma processing. I keep having these dreams/nightmares that I’m going back to treatment but I’m being sent to the same treatment place where I was assaulted. 

My biggest problem is that I don’t feel like I can trust anyone if I were to go back to treatment again. I’m skeptical to go anywhere because of what the nurse did to me and the fact my therapist didn’t believe me. I don’t feel like I can trust any professionals anymore, which is also why I haven’t found a new therapist in the new state I live in, despite being here for over a month. A friend of mine at the residential treatment place I was at was also preyed on by her male therapist during my time there, which makes me even more scared to seek out a new treatment place, let alone a new outpatient therapist. 

Any advice? I really don’t know what to do. I'm so upset and hurt and in so much pain.

I've tried lots of books on BPD, and have found the learnings helpful for starting to break down the negative, maladaptive behaviours of my borderline self, and figure out a more mindful, sane life; but I can't help but feel like I'm spinning my wheels and **not getting better** because for the two years since I was diagnosed with BPD, I've never been able to have the lengthy, detailed DBT sessions you need to actually get better. 

I find that books like [The BPD Survival Guide](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572245077/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or [Mindfulness for BPD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608825655/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) really helpful. I found [I Hate You - Don't Leave Me](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399536213/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) helpful for understanding the classical or standard psychological understanding of BPD, but not very helpful for explaining my diagnosis or how to go forward (I think this is mainly because the authors of I Hate You seem to be biased towards the formative trauma being caused by absent or violent mothers, not fathers, and the reverse is true in my case!) 

I got [this workbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572245131/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to try and go through DBT on my own but... I find I just can't do the exercises. And I've had the same issue with radical acceptance when I was seeing my psychologist - I completely get the theory, conceptually I'm totally on board with it.... but when emotional, I can't apply it. I can apply it to theoretical examples, or abstract ones, but I can't apply it when I need to do so. 

So I feel... shitty. Stuck in a diagnosis with no ability to afford treatment. And I'm stuck in this fucked up cycle: 

* can't afford treatment, so I don't get better, so I can't work (full time) BUT

* I need to work (either full or part time) in order to be able to afford therapy to get better! 

So I've not been in a good head space for a long time, and don't know how to get out of this funk.

Their traits are too toxic and harmful to others, I don't care what anyone else thinks.""

I can understand that argument a little, I personally had an extremely abusive parent growing up, which did lead to the start of the disorder developing, but the comments also made me burst out crying, thinking back at how I felt like I shouldn't even try and get treated because it would be of no use anyways, and that everyone was always going to loon at me, or get to know me and think, ""Wow, she's fucking crazy"".

&#x200B;

Hi Everyone,

I am new to reddit and new to thinking of myself as BPD. I am looking for some help in what to do and how to think about myself and my life. I feel very stuck and confused. Here is some background information:

I was diagnosed with BPD one year ago after two visits from a new psychiatrist that were less than an hour long. I really don't trust doctors because of my own experience in having some doctors who were the opposite of therapeutic, and I especially didn't think that it made sense that anyone could accurately diagnose someone with a complex psychological disorder after knowing them for less than two hours. Because I never trusted my doctor, I didn't give myself proper treatment. Instead I relied on meditation and broke up with my then emotionally unstable and seemingly abusive partner. I met a new partner right away and felt like my skies were suddenly clear. My sister supported me a lot and told me that she didn't think I had BPD, and encouraged me to keep meditating instead of thinking of myself as having BPD.

This worked for me until I started experiencing the stress of my current relationship with this new partner. I saw him as completely perfect, and we talked about the future we saw with each other in it with marriage and children. I really believed he was the one for me, and part of me still does even after the roller coaster we went through. I completely neglected myself and turned totally unhealthy in the relationship, making him the center of my entire universe. 

I cheated on him early on in the relationship as a test to see if he actually loved me. It's crazy because I am actually incredibly loyal. I stay in relationships even if I am unhappy in them because I am determined to fix problems always instead of just giving up. I did cheat on an ex once before in a long distance relationship because I couldn't handle the stress of the distance, but this time the cheating was done specifically, almost deliberately, as a test to see if our love was real. To see if he loved me as much as he said he did. It wasn't until afterwards that I felt horrible for what I did, and I know like I know the sun will rise tomorrow that I will never do this ever again. As a test or for any other reason. 

He did stay with me, but it has been very difficult for him. I then started a lot of arguments mainly also as a test to see if he would put up with me and the drama I was trying to clear from my mind, and he was very drained from this. It ended up just making him feel awful, criticizing me quite a bit, needing a lot of space from me, and not committing to us. This only made me feel completely unloved, unwanted, and totally worthless. These feelings stayed with me until I was going to fly across the country to visit him (we have an international long distance relationship) that we had previously talked about. I had finally let everything go and decided I would stop with the tests and was ready to trust him, when he told me not to come anymore two weeks prior to my trip. I literally thought I would die when I asked if he wanted me to come and his response was ""I feel like you would have to change in order for me to be with you, and that wouldn't be fair to you."" 

I snapped. I completely blacked out and had absolutely no control over my actions and I self harmed more than I ever had in my past. 

It has been two weeks and my arms still have scars on them and I'm worried they will be permanent scars. All I wanted from him was a hug but what I received was more and more talk on him not liking me or not being sure about me, and I just couldn't take it. What I realized then that everything sort of started coming together and making sense in my life. 

My last partner who I self harmed in front of was emotionally unstable and I thought he was the reason I self harmed. But I also did this in front of another ex who treated me like a princess. My current boyfriend was really good to me before I cheated. I just hate how reckless I can be sometimes, doing things without feeling like I have control over it. Subconsciously. Doing things without even realizing their consequences until afterwards. I realized then that the issue was never the people that I was with, despite the fact that I never self harmed alone. The issue is the way my mind relates to the people who I am in a relationship with. I realized there is some issue I have within my own mind as it relates to romantic partners that I need to fix. I am now on a mission to do whatever it takes to fix this issue in my mind. I just don't know the best way to go about that.

I have spent the last two weeks doing nothing but being mindful and writing my feelings down. My seasonal position ended for work but I haven't even thought about finding a job. I'm not concerned about anything else in my life except for my mental health and my own self-care. I have always neglected myself every single time I take on a new job or new partner, and I cannot live like this anymore. I have been doing really well these past two weeks by writing every day, taking care of my body through healthy eating and a bit of yoga, attending meditation classes, and above all else checking in with my mind and being mindful of every moment that passes. But I feel I will reach a point where I'll need to do more in my life write and take care of myself all day, and I feel like I could use extra help in reprogramming my mind so it relates to my romantic partners in a better way.

I want to finally try DBT in addition to the mindfulness and meditation I am doing now. I don't know if anyone else has ever heard of a concept in Buddhism called emptiness but learning about this in my classes and attending a meditation festival on emptiness has been the only time I was ever able to stop myself from blacking out and self harming. I love these teachings and feel  should keep going to as many festivals as I can but I also feel I should try DBT and other methods for managing BPD.

Does anyone know of any alternative treatments for healing BPD? I know the popular DBT and MBT therapy. I know there are tons of therapy methods that exist...yoga, music therapy, art therapy, acupuncture, holistic health, etc. I am just wondering if anyone out there has a unique method of managing their BPD, as I want to look at different methods before choosing one. 

Really this is difficult to accept. That I have a serious and permanent mental disorder. But I feel like we ourselves know BPD better than any doctor knows BPD, and to me it does not feel like I have a serious mental illness. No disrespect to doctors, but I feel it is difficult for me personally to find someone who can actually help me. It does feel like I need help integrating my life though, because I feel like I only have enough energy/stress tolerance for one major area of my life. Like I cannot manage a stressful job, relationship, and my own self care all at once when I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. Maybe in time once I master my self care, I can work my life around this priority and then find an external life that makes sense to me. 

I am looking for hope and refusal to accept living a less- than- fulfilling life. I do not want to live an abnormal life just because a doctor told me I was abnormal. I want to rise above the stereotypical expectations many people have of a person with BPD or any mental illness for that matter. I refuse to believe that this is something I will have to live with for the rest of my entire life, and I refuse to believe that I can't have a happy job, marriage, kids, family, or anything else I want because of it. I refuse. 

As a side note, I was wondering if someone can explain the difference between dissociating and zoning out. I have always spent a lot of my time spacing out, staring at walls just thinking. Thinking of memories from my past and imagining what my life might be like in the future. Is this the same thing as dissociating? If it is the same thing, how is this symptom relative specifically to those with BPD? I feel like this is a normal trait that all humans possess. Most people who are bored will get spacey and zone out from time to time. I am having difficulty knowing what dissociating actually is, and I would like to know whether or not this is something I have done my entire life or if it is something I have never done and cannot relate to.

I know this is something I would really need to talk to a therapist about, but I am just curious to know what peoples' ideas are of dissociating. 

I can definitely relate to the inability to manage strong emotions and self harming for attention seeking, along with the severity of symptoms worsening before and during menses. I really think that this is something I might have, and I would like to look into it. I just don't want to think of myself as incapable because of it. 

Are there any stories of people having successful marriages or having children with BPD? I am sad and looking for hope.

My boyfriend doesn't seem to have any sympathy or understanding for this. He just seems fed up at this point. It's sad because I don't even think he read any articles I gave him explaining BPD. All I want is for him to have patience with me and understand that I am often times hurting. I just want him to see what I am going through and applaud me just for getting out of bed in the morning. Because it really isn't easy living with this.  I want him to love me even though I make mistakes like venting and causing arguments sometimes, and to forgive me and believe me that I would never trust him in a drastic way by cheating again. I know I have had moments in my life where I felt out of control but I will never again allow myself to cheat on him ever again. And I have been doing a really good job of noticing my own emotions and regulating them on my own without the help of a doctor or anyone else for the past two weeks. I am really proud of myself and I just want him to be proud of me too, but I don't think he understands what this work is like. I don't think he can fully appreciate me without knowing what it is I am really working through every single day. This is a difficult and extremely courageous thing to work through, and I just want people to be proud of me. I guess I don't need this though. I guess really all I need is to just be proud of myself. After all, the only person I am doing all of this work for is me. 

Thank you all for reading all the way down to this, and for reading through my disorganized writing. I really applaud you all for all your persistence in managing your BPD too.

206,I’m receiving my first ketamine treatment Tuesday.,"It’s been a long road, but I have scheduled Ketamine infusions for this Tuesday, Thursday, and next Tuesday and Thursday. 
Very very nervous and equally as excited. 
Just wanted to post here and I’ll try and update once I’ve started. 

Have anyone else had experiences with ketamine incurious? What were your experiences??


.





Update - morning before procedure. 5/14

 because I’m SO nervous. My appointment is at 10:30am ECT so I will try and be on here a few hours after that.  I can’t eat, and should only sip water or use it for my daily meds. I’ve also been told I can take a klonopin before to help my nerves. (It’s already prescribed to use as needed)
I received the “new patient” packet and it really seems like a nice place. It feels like they’re trying to facilitate the best experience possible. Pillows, blankets, movies/tv, lights and, music will all be up to me. 
Getting ketamine treatments is weird. At least for me. I’ve taken acid before and found it very enjoyable. I’m now paying $500 a session to trip on ketamine and hopefully not want to die every day after it’s over. 
Anyway! Hope this isn’t a pointless update. I couldn’t sleep.






.


Update - 5/14


just finished the first infusion. Still coming out of it. Much less intense than i thought it would be.  More to come.



Update: 5/14
Feeling fine. It was calming but not at all overwhelming or consuming. I apologize I don’t have better things to say. 
If you have any questions about my experience please feel free to ask.



Update: 5/15
Today was rough. Like, really rough. I don’t think I’ve ever been so restless and anxious. I left work for a few hours just so I could walk about and not focus on anything. I had urges to self harm because I was crawling out of my skin. This may just be because my first infusion wasn’t exactly what I expected and dropping $500 for a light trip sesh just freaks me out. But it felt so intense. 
Second infusion tomorrow. I’ll be sure to let them know about today.






Some updates. Sorry for delay. Things have been a little crazy. 

5/20.  
I get my 3rd Infusion of ketamine tomorrow. It’s been kind of rough. I wanted it to be a walk in the park. It’s not. 
Apparently your brain can resist the changes you’re trying to make with ketamine. I’ve been bouncing off the walls, unable to sleep, or focus on anything. I’ve left work multiple times just because I couldn’t handle sitting at my desk. 
It was much worse after the first infusion and lessened after the second. However it’s still awful and hasn’t let up at all since my last infusion on Thursday. 
I’m hopeful that it will get better after my next couple infusions. 




5/23
So! 4th infusion down and I truly feel there has been a large difference/shift in thought patterns. 
My therapist and ketamine doctor both believe that since relieving my depression/cptsd etc, my ADHD has a stage to shine on. 
This has been communicated with my psychiatrist, who I’ve been told was very receptive. I see him in June. 
I’m guessing the next steps will be tapering off some meds and possibly adding one to mitigate the more problematic ADHD symptoms. Maybe I can get by without though. I’d like to try. 
The important thing is, I haven’t wanted to die. I want to live. I feel a weight has been lifted, even if momentarily, and there is room to operate and heal. 

It’s early. But I think ketamine has saved my life.....

214,Treatment to bookmark,"I hope this gets circulated here in comments, so this sub can be more healing and not so much wallowing in the symptoms of the disorder, this is pretty much the gold standard treatment that sorts out most of the disorder:  

1. Medication should be the first step, find something, Zoloft, Abilify, Wellbutin whatever works best for you and just commit to it even just a low dose, even when you feel you don't need it anymore or temporarily, just keep taking it. This is to stabalize your mood and help you better react to triggers and stressful events, therapy and meditation alone won't ever do this, medication is simply neccesary especially due to the genetic and ingrained aspect of this disorder.

2. Get [The DBT workbook](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/The_Dialectical_Behavior_Therapy_Skills.html?id=iyBdbJMQBdMC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y). Getting in to impatient DBT is hard, just settle for the book which is much better than nothing.

3. Begin listening to classical music, [Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JmprpRIsEY) seems best, this step is in the book, classical is meant to boost focus and creativity. Don't listen to binaural beats or anything artificially produced though as these experimental tracks are spammed on YouTube, (I don't mean techno that's fine).

4. Get the app [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/blog/2015/11/24/welcome-to-the-stress-pack/) mainly for the stress pack but other guided meditation packs in it are also useful. Work your way up to 40minutes each day and also include walking meditation to your practice which isn't on the app but still important although very simple.

5. Get some therapy sessions with perhaps a follow up every 6-12 months.

217,"Medication, is there an end line? Can holistic treatments work?","I was just curious to see if anyone else taking meds has successfully gotten off of them and can successfully live a “normal” life regarding mood temperament. 

I’ve always struggled with medications being extremely sensitive to them. For a time, I even refused to take them. But last year I was forced back on meds considering my life became unmanageable and my BPD was worse than ever in my life. I was having a lot of suicidal ideation and crippling anxiety/depression/mania where I sort of had no choice. 

I’ve been in CBT and DBT therapy for years and they have helped me immensely. More than most meds tbh. I’m just at a point where the side effects of the medication I’m on just aren’t weighing out to the good they should be doing. I’ve taken SSRI’s most of my life but now I’m on an SNRI (seems to bode better with me) but because I’m so sensitive to medications I can only take a lower dose and not the clinically recommended without having extreme side effects, seizures, etc. 

My psychiatrist wanted to add an antipsychotic med to see if it will help since I can’t go up on my dose but I’m sort of just over everything. It’s been almost two years cycling through medications and adjusting them and I feel like shit still tbh. I don’t have suicidal ideation anymore but the medication I’m on makes me a *different* kind of depressed…. Lazy, unenthusiastic, zombie-like. This really bothers me and makes it difficult to get even daily tasks done at times. 

I’m just at a loss. Therapy has always been my go to treatment and I wanted to see there were any other holistic routes combined with therapy that may have helped anyone else. I’ve been reading up on microdosing psilocybin, CBD oils and other natural methods of psychiatric treatments that seem very successful. 

I wanted to make it known that I do not use drugs or alcohol although I used to as a teen but found this very interesting. I’ve done psychedelics when I was young and if I’m being transparent here, they scare the shit out of me now. But in such small doses they seem harmless. 

I’m just at a point where I’ll do anything to get off pharmaceuticals and can’t stand being in this fog anymore. But I’m torn as I’m scared to be me I guess. I don’t want my blow ups and anger to come back and extreme mood swings to ruin my relationships and if anything medication does help that. I just feel like a blob of nothing anymore.

TL;DR I’m sensitive to pharmaceutical medications and they make me feel like shit. Do other methods work combined with therapy? I’m scared to go off my meds and have others deal with my extreme mood swings and the repercussions that come with but the side effects are becoming too much for me now.",1628872086.0,False,1,1,beatrixkivo,None,p3ol72,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/p3ol72/medication_is_there_an_end_line_can_holistic/
218,Why do others with BPD get in relationships before/without treatment?,"I dunno it just seems to be a recipe for disaster. This isn’t something I will ever embrace as in just “get on with”. Because otherwise it’s a lose lose situation; for example, if you don’t heal properly, you’re vulnerable, and your life is in their hands. 

Also, what about if you are so emotional that you become abusive? Boom, someone else is distraught. It doesn’t feel like it has a positive outcome. Anyone willing to challenge my view and help me change my mind?",1565192869.0,False,4,16,Tazbio,None,cn7hab,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/cn7hab/why_do_others_with_bpd_get_in_relationships/
219,I have to take an IQ test to see if I can get DBT treatment.,"So they are finally considering DBT treatment, after years of on and of individual treatment. But I have to take an IQ test that lasts for an hour, to see I can get the treatment. Is this usual? Or do they suspect I am to stupid to understand the treatment, or is it a normal thing everyone has to do? What if I fail the test? Does that mean they can't help me? 😩 I am freaking, I thought I would finally get some real help.",1629810761.0,False,2,9,LunaDea69420,None,pan232,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/pan232/i_have_to_take_an_iq_test_to_see_if_i_can_get_dbt/
220,I got into the treatment program!!,"Since recieving my diagnosis 3 months ago, I was told at the start that I was likely not a severe enough case to fit the criteria for the intensive treatment program in my area, I was told there were not many other options and have felt defeated, especially after reading many success stories following treatment.  Since then I have been seeing a case manager and have been awaiting further psych assessment, all along thinking I was never going to get treatment as surfacely I am ""functional."" 
Well after a few assessment sessions with the psychologists that specialize in BPD asking the right questions, here I am officially in the program!  Not only that but I am recieving bridging psychology until the next intake commences. I finally (at 26) feel like all my suffering is validated. I am nervous and I know it is going to be a massive uphill climb from here, but when u get to the point that you are just about ready to give up and then you are given this opportunity, it is like a there is a little spark of light at the end of the tunnel. I may not have to live my whole life in this constant hell in my head. I am willing to put everything into it to save my life, as for me this could literally save my life. I am so relieved to be getting help. It almost feels surreal.",1575071319.0,False,15,2,caledon13,None,e3nbay,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/e3nbay/i_got_into_the_treatment_program/
