0,"it can depend on how your symptoms manifest. some BPD people have psychosis, or their symptoms might be exacerbated by a disconnect from reality. or maybe they have a dopamine excess that causes other symptoms and antipsychotics address that imbalance. (some BPD people may take medications for anxiety or depression, instead, if that's how their symptoms manifest the most.)

but BPD isn't directly caused by a chemical imbalance. that's one difference between personality disorders and other disorders, like bipolar. (having a chemical imbalance or a mood disorder may make someone predisposed to BPD, but they're not quite the same thing.) there isn't a ""BPD medication"" that you can take, just like how there isn't a pill for PTSD or trauma in general.",paraffinburns,172cqod
1,"I'm taking Quetiapin too for the night. It helps me against panic attacks, anxiety and delusional thoughts. The first time I took it + Risperidone. 
This medication gave me a huge improvement, because I'm finally able to sleep without waking up in pure panic.",PraiseArtoria,172cqod
2,"As another has said, BPD can come with psychotic features, the psychosis needs to be treated.

We‚Äôre not treating the BPD directly (that‚Äôs what psychotherapy/DBT are for) we‚Äôre treating comorbid symptoms that come along with, or comorbid disorders - commonly depression/anxiety, for example.",jessikill,172cqod
3,"For quetiapine and bpd, it's more often than not prescribed as a dampener - it dampens emotions and makes you pretty out of it, so less likely to act out or harm yourself (the days-long sleeps also add to that). It makes you drowsy so helps you sleep, too. I think they often use it as an alternative to benzos, despite the side effects being pretty horrendous in comparison imo.
ETA: ofc its also prescribed for actual psychosis",IAmMeIGuess93,172cqod
4,"Omg you get sleeping all day long from that med too? ? My doctor literally gave it me for ""emotional flooding"" on my prescription and to take one or two. I told her when I take it I sleep for about 20 hours. She went huh.......but still says i should take it.

I didn't want to be knocked out for 20 hours. I just wanted to be able to not be in mental anguish and not in animal crazy emotional mind unable to use skillfull thinking.",knotnotme83,172cqod

11,"Im prescribed flupentixol and I get it because I self harm quite bad, have very intense low moods. I also have quite bad pyschotic episodes that often occur in very public places. It makes me more relaxed and helps me put some distance between me and my feelings. Unfortunately it also makes me really tired and sometimes I need 2 naps a day. 

From what I understand its quite uncommon for people with BPD to be prescribed antispychotic medication and I've never met or heard of anyone else taking what I take. For what it's worth if the flupentixol doesnt work the next medication I am being offered to try is quetiapine however I have met other people who have been prescribed that, unlike flupentixol. 

Some doctors decide that there simply isnt enough concrete evidence to prescribe and so offering prescriptions aren't all that common. Others are more comfortable prescribing medication in order to treat specific symptoms. Myself I am prescribed my flupentixol because I have BPD and PTSD and since they make eachother worse my psychiatrist is keen on offering me as much reprieve as is possible which I am greatly thankful for. Sometimes people need extra help and medication can be a helpful way forward when you need immediate results that therapy alone can't give you here and now.",Huntrinity,172cqod
12,"Fuck... That hits home. They gave me Quitiapine as a regular med, even though it's only for crisis. The last time I took it it triggered epilepsy. I only took it for a crisis too, I had been off it for a good while by then. 

It's horrible, it's zombie meds. Like, you have the same feelings but they are 100 miles away, along with all your other emotions.

22,"Well BPD isn't like other personalty disorders.
It may not be a personality disorder at all. At least that's what some research might suggest. It's up for discussion atm in the field.
That's why in the upcoming ICD 11 all personality disorders are mirged into one diagnosis. All besides borderline which gets an extra indicator.

So yeah taking meds like antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizer, neuroleptika is a thing with borderline though none of them work against borderline directly but only against certain symptoms and are prescribed on a case by case basis according to which sympomts haunt the patients most.

Edit: all the other personalty disorders are mostly abnormalities in behavior and so prescribing meds isn't a valid solution since patients aren't really able to work on their behavior if said behavior is suppressed by meds.",staackie,172cqod

25-50mg knocked me out at the beginning but you get used to the sedation if you take it everyday. after around 8 weeks on it, it stopped making me so tired. four years later and i now take 150mg daily, i can't sleep without it. i sleep around 8hrs a night and it really helps with my anger/paranoia.

Think of it as making your highs less high and your lows less low. I'm personally taking another  type of antispychotic called Flupentixol - however if this doesn't work for me (which it is working thankfully) then I've been told the next medication to try is quetiapine. My psychiatrist isn't fond of just trying anything and will only prescribe medication with some proof of working. Quetiapine does have some evidence for working in patients with BPD and has the potential to affect and reduce all symptoms of the disorder.

1,"I was on 7 different anti psychotics and quetiapine was the only one that helped me. Stopped working eventually, around 15mg. It didn't make me into a zombie, although it didn't exactly do what the doctor told me it would. My intentions were to get medication and have it magically fix my BPD symptoms, I wanted the meds to do all of the work lol.

The best thing you can do is try to work with a therapist and work with your doctor. Document your changes on the medication slowly, (I used my notes app but even notebooks can be useful), make sure to tell your doctor about the negatives and the positives.. communication is what is going to help you figure out if this medication is for you. Quetiapine made me extremely hungry, but it also calmed down some of my rapid thinking. If it is making things harder, GO BACK TO THE DOCTOR ASAP!!! There are so many different medications, it's all trial and error! Don't give up if quetiapine isn't giving you results, and we all wish you the best of luck!

More of my minor symptoms from using quetiapine:
Extremely hard for me to shit. Not joking lol. The first month was a nightmare and I almost quit. Eat lots of fiber.
Nightmares about fp, my family, and my abuser. Scary.
Occasionally my heart felt like it was pounding a bit too fast.. only happened twice after fighting with my fp. Calmed down pretty quick once I calmed myself.

1,"Hey you,

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this immense difficulty. Did you know BPD is the most _successfully treated_ personality disorder? It's so unfair that you're trying to do just that and you're facing these kinds of challenges.

I hope you find the strength to keep trying. Remember, there is no medication to treat Borderline Personality Disorder. It is a **learned** disorder and in order for it to go away, for us to go into ""remission,"" we need to unlearn all those maladaptive skills, behaviours and attitudes we've learned to survive. Then we have to learn the right ways and practice them again and again until they feel normal just like the bad ways used to. It's a lot of work, hey? Medicine only helps us temporarily forget or lessen certain symptoms that can be triggered _by_ BPD (like depression for example, or a mood stabilizer if someone is very prone to those fluctuations). But sometimes these medications are also **necessary** because also remember: it is very uncommon for BPD to be diagnosed by itself! The majority of us have a co-morbitity of BPD with another disorder or illness. Sometimes the medication is to alleviate symptoms from _that_ illness so that they lessen their impact (because you bet they impact) on your BPD. In all of this, the BPD remains. It still needs to unlearned. It can be done. For now, if available to you start looking for a therapist who is trained in DBT, CBT, maybe addiction counselling, a Social Worker can be amazing in these circumstances if they specialize in BPD! You're already doing so great at trying to get help. Keep trying! We just need to adjust your aim.

Admittedly, and in my opinion of course, this was maybe a shitty way of your current provider telling you they were ill-equipped in knowledge or fortitude (or both) to commit to the challenge of treating someone with BPD. It takes a lot of work from both therapist and pwBPD. I'm sorry this one has invalidated you in such a way that she doesn't think you're willing to put in that effort. Or maybe she is setting a hard boundary right away because of the nature of pwBPD to create intense attachments and emotional dependency on people who **care** for us. You mentioned you, ""thought she cared."" I doubt you were wrong. If you were in good standing, or neutral even, could you not see them or reach out and ask? Bring it up. ""I feel as though since my change in diagnosis your attitude toward me has changed significantly. I want to continue working toward getting better regardless of what it is I have. Are you as committed to helping me do that as I am to working on it?"" Ha! Sorry, maybe I got carried away. Just ask. If you're comfortable. If not, start to look elsewhere but most importantly keep looking. [Here](https://youtu.be/k7tICsQMdDI?si=8yjCW_Q4xN9yDenI) is a good resource and exercise you can do privately and for yourself to get a good idea of where you are with BPD and how much it is affecting your life.

Remember the journey to recovery is rarely linear. We go up, down, sideways to get there. Don't look at this as a step back. It is just a side-step, a realignment.

And then I listened to about 700 hours of YouTube, while working hard on increasing selfawareness, consciousness, mindfulness, so that I could detect these concepts in my normal actions so they could become events and truths about me that my mind could work on.

It's very early in the morning I'll give you a full recipe later but here's my journey, not everything will apply to you, but that's how I saved me https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQun1ee6u9NZWO71azTBeRzSl3yGxlnF1

I listened while gardening, and now I have a beautiful garden!

Best ones for me are Marshall Rosenberg for emotional and needs literacy, Gabor Mat√© for addiction and compassionate inquiry, Thich Naht Han for mindfulness, breathing, dealing with suffering, compassion, r√©conciliation, Alan Watts for the nature of my reality and separation of self, emotions and thoughts, Doc Snipes for coping strategies in times of difficulty. Betel Skater for straight up surviving abuse. Dr Ramani for understanding how narcissistic abuse cut me off from my inner world and how to recover the real me. Thais Gibson for attachment styles and secure attachment.

Once I knew these things well, I quit cannabis alcohol caffeine cocaine and all others, spent a week in bed cursing the universe, and now 15 days later I have focus, I have self confidence, I went on two dates sober, I've been around people who drank and felt zero urge, I have a yearning for life, I am mindful 25% of the time which is huge for a scatterminded dude like me, I cleaned my house, I made MORAL choices, I set boundaries, I connected with people including my brother (going to be a Godfather!!!).

It's fucking amazing everything moment is a gift.

For six months though there was a lot of crying in the shower, being super high to touch these painful topics and unknotting knot after knot after knot after knot after knot, finding the root causes, ACCEPTING.

The plan was Self awareness followed by
Self acceptance followed by
Self trust followed by 
Self efficacy and that's what
We call SELF LOVEEEEEE

Good LUCK! I believe it's possible because we all have a golden healing light inside of us.

1,"What were you expecting from them? Because it sounds like the admission wasn‚Äôt therapeutic for you. It sounds like you were not getting better in a hospital environment. For most people with bpd, containment makes them regress, a longer hospital stay does them more harm. If you had particular treatment goals for the admission, did you communicate them?¬†

Psychology is definitely the way to go. Where I live, they don‚Äôt like to put people with bpd on holds. If you had absconded, you would have been discharged. If you snuck in shards of glass, you would have been discharged (because you‚Äôd be impacting the safety of other patients). I understand the trauma response but I‚Äôm struggling to understand what your expectations were on the ward. A psych ward never fixes bpd. It can offer containment, and a safe place - but you left twice and then tried to bring unsafe items on the ward. You also suggest that you weren‚Äôt really engaging with the doctors.

Use this as a learning opportunity. Resources are out there for you to help yourself, but no one will be able to fix your condition for you, remember your behaviour is no one else‚Äôs responsibility but yours. I can see you are intelligence because you have shown the capacity to self reflect on what might have gone wrong in that admission. This insight will put you in good stead for the future. Sometimes it‚Äôs uncomfortable acknowledging our faults, but it will help you grow and learn :)

Abilify is an odd medication to recommend. It is an antipsychotic, but there is no solid evidence for bpd. Abilify for bpd is an off label use. Did they know initially your diagnosis was bpd? Or were you unknown to them when you first came in? Quetiapine is a better choice for bpd if you need a medication for symptomatic relief, and could be worth exploring with a general practitioner/primary care physician.",throw4w4y4y,1ctk4ye
2,"Hi I never got a notification for your comment

and for clarification, technically I'm not diagnosed BPD (or EUPD in the UK) but I had expressed my suspicions and symptoms to the crisis team (who work directly with the ward doctors so whether they informed the doctors of the possible BPD, I have no idea, I'd assume so based on them discharging me). in the past I had just been diagnosed with seasonal depression and aspergers. and maybe unofficially a private hospital during my first section gave me schizoid personality disorder (before the ASD) but idk if the doctors agree with it. I do mask heavily though even in crisis.

>What were you expecting from them?

It's a good question. One I haven't been able to answer. So no to answer your other question, I didn't communicate my goals within the ward since I didn't particularly have any. I had been spiralling since January and felt community treatment wouldn't work and needed only admission which I waited moths for. I thought because admission solved my previous crisis years ago I figured it would solve my problems again but admittedly the circumstances are pretty different this time. Before, it was just seasonal depression and being suicidal. This time was more like moodswings, impulsive risky behaviour and dipping in and out of being suicidal.

During my time on the ward some of the nurses just told me they were flat out confused by my actions because they were so contradictory, because I wanted to come to the ward since I was voluntary and yet I spent my whole time there trying to leave and hurting myself. Idk. in a very crazy way I wanted them to section me. (involuntary) but they want to push for community treatment which I feel extremely reluctant about. I guess that's the avoidant part of me speaking.

About what you said re meds, the crisis doctor 2 months ago offered quetiapine but I only took it once and got concerning sharp chest pain (anxiety?) so I stopped taking it. But yeah I'm aware of the pattern that I seem to make my recovery almost impossible because I didn't engage on the ward and don't engage with taking my medication consistently. I hate it. I think I'm afraid of getting better.",erraticplaything,1ctk4ye
3,"Do you have any idea why you‚Äôre afraid of getting better? Recovery is wonderful, but takes effort and hard work to get there.¬†

You may very well have depression and aspbergers as well as bpd, I can‚Äôt diagnose you but your behaviours sound very typical for someone with bpd admitted to an inpatient ward.¬†

Sometimes we want social interaction and attachment and seeking an admission and absconding are ways of seeking engagement. I‚Äôve known patients who didn‚Äôt know how to express their need for social connection in a healthy way, and did dramatic things on the ward instead. Be careful to follow the rules of the ward, because you could end up with a note in your history that says admissions are not helpful for you. Then one day when an admission might be warranted (eg for containment), you might sadly find yourself denied that opportunity based on past behaviours. I‚Äôve seen it happen so much. Some people with bpd regress instead of getting better on the ward, and that defeats the point of an admission!! Hopefully this experience taught you some things about yourself that you can take going forwards :)",throw4w4y4y,1ctk4ye
4,">Do you have any idea why you‚Äôre afraid of getting better? Recovery is wonderful

I have lived the way I live for so long and I'm familiar with that and the unknown scares me? maybe its as simple as that. It sounds like a very weak excuse in my opinion. I've been telling myself for over a decade that I am not a normal human being, that what is the point of trying to have a normal life when I don't have any friends or desire to half the time. I can't have relationships since they always become dysfunctional. Even the only therapist I saw 2020 abandoned me. I don't even talk to the family I live with. I just feel spectacularly broken as a human being and I don't even know if its this schizoid thing, a borderline thing, aspergers or just all of it and I never got support for the last thing since they said I was ""too complex"". Since this november I haven't verbally said one word to family and the crisis team were the only ones I talked to for the last 4 months but they discharged me onto the community team after I left the ward 3 days ago so I feel like I'm back to being alone. and that's just it. I feel so alone. Not even technically lonely. I just feel so chronically alone and empty.

Just to add a bit of background...

I've isolated since I was barely 13 (now 29 so 16 years). Like stopped going to school. Didn't leave the house once for 6 years until I had a mental breakdown and got sectioned at 19, and then got sectioned like 5 more times once a year with seasonal depression and finally I stopped being suicidal at 24 but this year a loss triggered me and I guess I regressed to previous behaviours and since I developed a sense of safety in hospital from my sections I wanted to recreate those circumstances. Which is why I was also so adamant to the crisis team saying I only wanted to be in hospital. 

But I had a small realization after leaving the ward, that me wanting to be sectioned (having my freedom taken away from me and being taken care of) and also since I got in trouble with year with police going to the bridge a lot and still have to go to court I've been contemplating just intentionally trying to get sent to prison and again I think it revolves back around to going back to what I'm familiar with -- being locked up not having to make choices. I keep getting urges to hurt myself, partially because I don't want to be here but also just because I want to send myself back to hospital.",erraticplaything,1ctk4ye

6,"yes, I was on it during a period when I was breaking down + selfharming all the time, they put me on it after about a week on benzos. i was in my last year of high school. it knocked me out but i still had to wake early every morning; i would slip away and fall asleep at my desk and even standing up all morning (which especially sucked because my first class was a chemistry class where we had to stand up and do labs with dangerous chemicals) -- but I probably needed it at the time. it didn't really do all it was supposed to do but I don't think it was the wrong thing for me to take.",raskolnikova,aoev9s
7,"I have been on it for years. I used to take up to 500mg and at that dose I got diabetes. (I was already overweight prior to starting, but the quetiapine made it worse).

Eventually I tapered down and the diabetes went away. I am no longer diabetic, despite not losing any weight. One of the side effects states ""may cause type 2 diabetes"", so for me it was that my dose was too much. 

Now I take 100-200mg.

It helps with my mood and can be very helpful for sleeping. 

I want to come off it one day, as I know my metabolism is a mess because of it, but for now, it's allowing me to live a relatively stable life. 

>But it also comes with a multitude of potential side effects, experts say, including an odd sensation of tension and restlessness (akathisia), Parkinson‚Äôs-like tremors and movement abnormalities, weight-gain, high blood sugar, new or worsening diabetes and, in rare cases, heart arrhythmia that can cause sudden cardiac death. A recent Health Canada review linked quetiapine and other so-called ‚Äúatypical‚Äù antipsychotics to an increased risk of sleep apnea ‚Äîbreaks in breathing during sleep.

18,"When you take a medication daily for an extended period (this can vary from a few weeks to a few months), then it's best not to stop cold turkey. Sudden stopping can cause rebound effects like insomnia, mood destabilization, etc but it's very person/dose-dependent.  I came off my regular dose very quickly without issue but I know patients that have taken months of titration.  When ""taking as needed"" once in a while I don't have enough in my system on a continuous basis (a therapeutic level) to cause withdrawal or rebound.   For yourself, I recommend talking to your doctor/health care professional and follow their guidance.  Every body is different.  :)",girlplusjeep,aoev9s

3,"Abilify arapiprasole is a fine and dandy neuroleptic for anxiety and its upshots. But it is not a cure. It is just a reliever of symptoms. 

BPD is almost always co-morbid with [C-PTSD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=C-PTSD) because BPD is a set of coping behaviors for C-PTSD. BPD over C-PTSD is very often (and probably in this case because of the described shame issue with a perceived authority figure) the upshot of having been ignored, abandoned, discounted, disclaimed, rejected, invalidated, insulted, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, victimized, demonized, persecuted, picked on, bullied, [scapegoated](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=scapegoating+in+families), and/or otherwise abused by others upon whom they depended for survival in early life. If that was the case, you may have formed compensatory beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how one should / must / ought / have to be seen by others, as well as some pretty nasty anxiety, rage and/or [learned helpless](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=learned+helplessness) depression... all of which are expectable symptoms of BPD. If you're looking for a way out, here's a map:

1) Medications, but *only if really needed* to get one stabilized enough to do the next six things on this list: After wasting a lot of time with people who didn't know what they were doing, I found a board certified psychopharmacologist in my area by using the clinician locator on the *Psychology Today* website. I learned the hard way that getting psych meds from a GP or primary care doc can be useless or even risky. Psych diagnoses, meds and med interactions are just too complex now for most GPs and primary care docs.

2) Support Groups: I got into [AA](http://www.aa.org/), [MA](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/) and/or [NA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=narcotics+anonymous) because I was using intoxicants to try to cope with my emotional pain; and [ACA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=adult+children+of+alcoholics), [EA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=emotions+anonymous) and [CoDA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=coda.org)... where I found others in similar boats who had found explanations, answers and solutions.

3) Books and academic, *professional* websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). Strongly recommended: Alexander Chapman & Kimberly Gratz's [*The Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living with BPD*](https://www.newharbinger.com/borderline-personality-disorder-survival-guide), and because they all understand the upshots of having been [stressed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=fight%20flight%20freeze) for too long, including underlying [complex PTSD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=complex+post-traumatic+stress+disorder) which is what I (and most people with BPD) have: Bessel van der Kolk, Peter Levine, Patricia Ogden, Ronald Kurtz, Laurence Heller, Bruce McEwen, Sonya Lupien and Robert Sapolsky. [*Accurate* information](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/treat-autonomic-and-cognitive.html) is power.

4) Psychotherapy: I still use Ogden's [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) as the [interoceptive](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=interoception+meditation) 9th of the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to manage any ""time bombs"" that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [CPT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy), and [schema therapy]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), as well as [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [HBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), [SEPt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), and [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html). 

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, I looked [here]( https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/), and [here]( http://doctor.webmd.com/find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry), and [here](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/), and (for DBT specialists in particular) [here]( http://behavioraltech.org/resources/crd.cfm). If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most MD / psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often -- though not always -- excellent sources of referral. 

5) Mindfulness Meditation: After trying several methods, I found the [Vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81)-style. (For a *lot* of people with anxiety, this stuff handles anxiety chop chop. Not sure about depression. Many of the modern psychotherapies for anxiety are actually based on it now.)

6) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=DBT+therapy+workbooks).

7) Moderate exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to ""massage"" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.",not-moses,5n889k

1,"I didn't have good luck with it. 

This was the first medication I was put on while I was hospitalized, and it was an absolute nightmare. 

I have pretty severe anxiety as it is, so when the medication finally kicked in, it amped up my anxiety to the point that I felt like I was seriously losing my mind. 

The feeling of dread was *immense*, and all I wanted to do was get out of my skin, the building, away from everyone there, and I didn't even want to go home. I just wanted to run far, far away from where I was. 

It was bad enough that when it came time for us to go outside (smoking, fresh air, etc., I don't smoke but I vape so I need nictotine often and never missed my chance to get it), I felt like I couldn't even walk properly for some reason because everything I was seeing and feeling was so distorted and wonky, I didn't feel stable and I started freaking out even more when I was mobile and around other people. 

I ended up secluding myself in the room I was assigned in the bed, and I sat there for hours waiting for it to pass just staring at the walls and ceiling. Tried forcing myself to sleep and it didn't come easy. I was finally able to fall asleep after it started wearing off, but it was already early morning close to breakfast time (7am was our breakfast time there). 

It was so awful. When I told the nurse (we saw a nurse everyday to check on how we are feeling and how medications are working and would put us on new meds) what had happened, she was pretty confused, and said that was really odd but was glad that I didn't try to leave. 

It was pretty paralyzing but also interesting how I had such a bad reaction to it. 

Edit: forgot to add, of course it will work differently for everyone but this is just my personal experience with it and don't let that scare you. ",kaylabebe151,8t5qj9

6,"Unfortunately, I have not. 

I have tried a slew of different ones but have had no luck with them. From what I can tell, I'm some kind of really difficult case (as if treating this stuff wasn't hard enough as it is!). 

When I would try a new medicine, one of two things would happen: I would have a very bad initial reaction (happening within the first week of taking it) or nothing at all would happen, even if I were on one for a month or longer. 

In general I seem to be resistant to a lot of medications and it makes me hopeless along with making me question myself as to if I even have any problems. I know better but I can't help but think that sometimes. 

I've stopped seeing doctors for now and I've been trying something on my own terms to see if it helps. I've been taking some CBD oil in capsule form, and I've been trying this for a couple weeks now. So far, I have noticed a small change in my anxiety, my heart isn't thumping as hard, fast and loud constantly, my headspace feels calmer, I'm having less intrusive thoughts and just in general feeling a bit of relief. Not saying that it has made a huge difference, but I definitely see some improvement. 

As far as my depression, I can't tell that it's helped in that regard. I plan to test this out long term to see if I can get even more relief from it. But seeing as it actually has made some difference in me that I can feel at all is a victory in itself, as I never had that experience with what my doctors were prescribing me. 

I know that I'm still very much irritable when people try to talk to me in person (I'm irritable 24/7 and it only takes one small thing to send me into full blown rage and hate) and still avoiding people as much as I can. 

Time will tell with this to see if it really can help, and I really hope that it does.

I'd suggest you write a full list of all of the symptoms and behaviours that concern you. You can either show that to them, or use it to remind you of things he might not cover in his questions.

You'll be fine. You haven't done this before but the psych has had a million first time patients. They know how to get as much out of you as they can, they're trained to do that. They know what they need to know and they'll ask you to tell them. And they'll offer you an opportunity to say more, so if you think something important has been missed you can still get it heard.

Personally I can't remember any physical side effects (hunger, dry mouth, etc.) I did have tiredness for the first two days, pretty sure I snored through a lot of the first day! 

These are most probably unrelated but we're unusual for me and occurred at the same time as taking the Abilify so I'd love to know if anybody else experienced something similar:

I was having anxiety issues with driving, even as a passenger I felt myself bracing for impact as we would come to a perfectly safe and controlled stop. 
My sense of direction was screwed, totally. This was really obvious (and commented on by others) because for over two weeks I was on holiday. I just have a nose for direction, even a general 'that-a-way' with much arm waving... once I have a direction I find my way, if I've been somewhere I remember orientation, shops, a door, rock, window...a dog in a garden. 
I had no idea where I was, where I was going. I couldn't remember being places (as in ""we were on this road yesterday, you bought x in that shop..."" I remember the shop but was it this road?!). It was horrible!

I'm so sorry if this comment sounds dramatic or negative, but I wanted to share this view, too.

I think the issue for me is that I probably don't have ADHD for reals, as in, I don't have any dopamine deficiency(which is what is relieved through stimulants). I have the behaviours but I don't have it on a chemical level. 

What this does is that you're basically adding *a fuck tonne of dopamine* to a brain that already has the proper amount of it. For a person with ADHD, this wouldn't happen because they lack dopamine; they would just feel calm and kind of content and focused.

But when you add dopamine on a ""normal"" brain, you get **XXL DOPAMINE ON STEROIDS**. You just feel fuzzy and great doing jack shit. You can be extremely focused on anything. And you don't need to eat, like, ever! Woo!

They give energy much quicker than they ease the mind, though, so you might get suicidal in which case you should contact your doctor.  

No judgement, but the worst thing to do is not take meds daily. They need to build up in your system before they get to easing your mind. You probably won't see results (sans placebo results which happen) for a few weeks.

No SSRI will come anywhere close to the positive effects of mindfulness / DBT, if you haven't tried either of those first?

Not trying to discount medications as I know some people need them, but with BPD I have found that anxiety is 99% unfelt or misunderstood emotions. So they jumble together into a big scary mess of fear. That type of anxiety cannot be helped by meds, only by dedicating ourselves to daily non-judgmental mindfulness practice, using language to identify and experience those difficult emotions.

With BPD, people may act super emotional or dramatic, but the truth is the real emotions are usually completely numbed out by emptiness. Think about when someone rejects you, or when you're ashamed of an impulsive decision, etc - those awful feelings cause intense discomfort, but suddenly woosh they're gone and we're totally fine! Except we're not, because those feelings still live in our body even if we're not experiencing them. Emptiness is a powerful numbing technique from the brain, but eventually the body's truth bubbles over, hence panic attacks and anxiety.  

I get depression sucks, but with BPD it can actually be an essential step from the body toward slowing us down and forcing us to experience what's happening inside the body. Basically killing our old protective / grandiose mechanisms, which cause far more harm than good in the long run.

I just use buspirone and/or propanolol for my anxiety and overthinking. Anxiety seems to be my biggest issue.

Strangely though, ever since that one use of lamotrigine for the impulsivity. I havent had another impulsive episode as bad as that. Yet before that medication, the episodes were quite regular. I dont know if that is due to me understanding myself better(probable), or if the meds actually had a lasting effect (possible). I'd give them a 7/10 for curbing impulsivity.",,dl7lze

Everyone is different, but there's a chance that medication could help you even if you don't have bipolar disorder!

I know I took Vraylar for a bit and was having issues with the drowsiness so it was a no-go for me. I recommend giving it a little while to see if those symptoms improve. Try taking it with food if you haven't and see if that helps the nausea. If those symptoms don't get better and you're not okay with that symptom set (totally valid), talk to your doctor again.

For some people it may work because their genetics dont interact negatively with the pathway the medication takes, and for others it wouldn't work and could have side effects because of their genetics. 

Genesight is a really cool tool that I personally think everybody who needs (mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihypnotics, etc.) medication should utilize, because with a simple swab of your saliva it helps you see what medications your genetics will interact with positively or negatively.

0,"I've been on lamotrigine for almost a year now.

It has given me the pause that most people innately have, allowing me to process events rather than simply react. I had horrific PTSD when I first started taking lamotrigine to the point where I told people they could not ""come up behind me"". Anytime my mind registered a threat, I screamed. I jumped. I cried.

With the medication, I noticed myself actually examining whatever would trigger PTSD. As an example, a long time ago, a roommate tried to ""scare"" me by putting a large cardboard Kylo Ren cutout outside of my door. Upon opening the door, old me would have screamed and hyperventilated in the corner upon seeing it. Lamotrigine me observed and processed. ""Hmmmmm...there is something outside of my door. What is it?""

I suppose the same is true for my moods. I'm having a bit of a ""day"", so I won't elaborate too much.

When I first started, I had a couple of side effects. The first (and most obvious) was a loss of motor skills in my hands. I dropped/broke a few things at work. It was embarrassing. It was also temporary, gradually let up after the first couple of weeks.

The other side effect took a little but longer to figure out, but for whatever reason, the manufacturer mattered. I was taking Zydus lamotrigine initially and experienced significant cognitive impairment. I couldn't focus, couldn't process, couldn't remember any of the material I was learning in school. Initially, I chalked it up to being part of the adjustment period, but when I told my psychiatrist, they told me that another patient had the same issues with the same generic. I now only take Taro lamotrigine and have no complaints.

I take 300 mg every evening. Is my life perfect now? Absolutely not. Manageable? Definitely.

I met a new Dr, she investigated, we stopped gradually until I was on Vyvanse only and we realized it did nothing but send me to the roof for hours, for nothing. I wouldnt sleep, I would spend 2 to 3 days without needing to sleep, it was crazy/scary. 

We finally decided to stop Vyvanse too. That was on a lapse of 5 months. 
Then she told me about Bupropion (Wellbutrin). I took it for about 3 months, but it wasnt enough to keep me stable. At the same time I started therapy for the first time, and also she gave me the new diagnostic (BPD). It took me a while to really accept the whole new scenario, but I realized also that Buproprion pushed my tinnitus x 1000!!! I started to hear those REAL LOUD, meaning no good nights of sleep, and also I felt way too much on the ''blas√©e'' line of things. I wouldnt enjoy anything, not in a sad way, but more that I did not have any emotions AT ALL. The tinnitus scared me, I looked online and I saw many people talking about it too, how they had many problems.

I asked my Dr what we could do about it. 
She then asked me if I was ok with starting on the amphetamine road again, meaning Adderall.  So, we stopped Bupropion and not long after I started Adderall and I've been on it for a year now. 

Everyone is different, that is my story with both of these meds.
To be fair, I do not see much ''difference'' on Adderall but it keeps me somewhat stable on a daily basis. I'm starting a new therapy group sessions this week so I can't wait to start to deal with the grumps again.

4,"I currently take both and have been for about 3ish years now(?) the adderall makes me jittery af still but that's just the nature of it. 

Take adderall with food and it usually makes you poop. Fair warning. And it'll make you feel like death for a day or so while your body is adjusting. 

PLEASE take all of your meds RELIGIOUSLY.  If you're feeling better, it's working- you still need it. So don't stop because you think you don't need it anymore. Be consistent with it, also. You feel like a zombie and just off once it is in full effect because you'll be so used to it working and making you feel like an actual person, unlike what we're used to. So if you skip a dose or forget to take it you'll feel off for days. 

You might crash off your adderall mid afternoon, that's normal, so talk to your doctor about that. They'll give you options to avoid it. 

Be patient, this might not be the perfect mix of drugs for you, each person's experience is different because everyone's body chemistry is different. Finding the best treatment for each person is not an exact science. So be open and 10000000% honest with your doctors. If you use recreational drugs, tell them too. They legally can't say anything to anyone so you won't get into trouble- but it can react differently to various prescriptions. If you use any form of HTC products, don't do it any sooner than 4 hours after you take your adderall. It'll usually give you spins and crippling amounts of anxiety. 

That's pretty much the best advice I can offer. If you have any questions on my personal experience you can always PM me.

Exercise in general is amazing for mental health, something like 5-6 times more effective according to the Hamilton scale if i recall correctly, which ranks the effectiveness of treatments based on how much they move someone towards/away from depression/bliss.

But exercise for the *mind* is almost obvious for something like depression. People in our society love the idea of a pill. It requires no effort, and that's why people love it, and why it's profitable to produce. The problem is, it doesn't seem to really solve the problem, just subtly mask it. Exercise for the mind is actually capable of *solving* the problem in the same way that physical therapy helps solve physical problems. Just sit back, truly relax yourself, close your eyes, and watch the breath. Notice whatever comes into your mind. ""I'm doing this so badly... ""/""I'm trying too hard to force my breathing""/""Wow ... my jaw is clenched right now, for no reason at all... let me relax it""

Just how *stressed* and neurotic and *constantly thinking* you are, will become obvious to you and shock you, if you simply do this exercise for a few weeks daily.

Just examine these thoughts rather than being caught up in them. No judgements or reactions, just **watch** the mind. If you get distracted, that's fine. Are you a little frustrated that you got distracted? **Notice** that as a sensation that occurs rather than being **absorbed** in that sensation, and start again by watching the breath go in, and watching the breath go out. 15 minutes a day, best decision most people could possibly make regarding mental health from my experience.",Compassionate_Cat,chvx4m

So I stopped taking them and never returned to my GP, because how I felt before starting them was better to how I felt during. Also it completely killed my ability to orgasm, which fucking sucked.


But that's one personal encounter with them. I've had a couple of friends prescribed it and it's done wonders for them, so you won't know how it's going to effect you until you try it! And there's also loads of other anti depressants you can switch to if they're not the ones for you.

I wasn‚Äôt rude or anything but my anxiety has always caused me to try very hard and I just started to stop doing that. My obsessive thoughts stopped, suicidal thoughts stopped, and I just felt like things rolled off a lot easier.

I have tried adderall and vyvanse, both work really well for control of psychotic symptoms by keeping your brain busy with more serotonin, however I found frustration tolerance especially when repeated problems repeat themselves is significantly reduced.

I also became an addict, took quite a while before I lost track of pacing myself and not needing more to be just me.

I take Vyvanse for treatment-resistant depression.  I put off going on stimulants for years because I was afraid they'd exacerbate anxiety and BPD symptoms.  It definitely does the job for depression and keeps me from feeling miserable for the few hours it's active in my system, but honestly it probably has made the BPD worse.  All the symptoms come rushing back even more intensely when it wears off, and I recently realized that the recent week I felt the most miserable ever was the week I was taking off of lisdex for a tolerance break.

Unfortunately, once I've taken it daily or 4-5 times/week for a long period, I begin to get pure side effects, which include irritability.  Honestly overall it's probably decreasing my already-low tolerance for other people.  The irritability and reactivity isn't *nearly* as bad as other meds I've been on, though, and nowhere near as bad as I'd expected, so I should've started this a long time ago.

It's interesting that you think the serotonergic properties of Desoxyn might be leading to what you're experiencing with the emotional effects.  I'm very envious of that.  Also Vyvanse is quickly losing effectiveness for me overall and higher and booster doses aren't helping much.  :(  Hopefully I can squeeze everything I need out of it in the next few years.",ObsidianIris,7uwix5

I have more patience and hear what people say more reasonably and don't feel super triggered by tiny comments and can shift moods slightly easier than before and get on with my day.

My therapist is a lovely person but she filters everything through the lens of depression and always goes back to depression and I have mentioned BPD trying to get her to focus on that more.

16,"I feel like with Adderall it wasn't so black and white whether it helped or hurt me. You see, while it helped enormously with a ton of my symptoms such as my desire to isolate (I actually started going out regularly and developing friends and meeting girls again), and obviously helping me focus, it also made me ""tense"" and ""rigid"". It was kinda like anxiety, but different. I still felt super confident due to the drug, but all my thoughts seemed robotic and devoid of emotion. I couldn't enjoy simple things like a good movie anymore. 

Also, when I'd have what we all probably call a ""bpd meltdown"", it amped those feelings up tenfold. Instead of ""this is the worst day ever"" it was ""I want to kill someone or myself and the world is ending"" type extreme. And the longer I took the drug the more frequent these meltdowns were occurring, I even had to be placed in a psychiatric ward (ironically which is where I got my bpd diagnosis).

I remember to a certain degree after being on my normal meds as prescribed for maybe 8+ months I was going to bed daily with panic attacks and paranoid thoughts. It made my behavior very erratic. When I'd take it in the morning, I'd feel like the king, on top of the world and yeah, just blatantly manic. When it wore off, well, different story.

The positives were there too though, which is why I miss the drug still. I was going out again developing friends, meeting and dating people, going to parties, and my social anxiety was nonexistent. That's pretty much all it did for me, albeit, that's a lot though, considering most of my days now, being off the drug, are spent in solitude and I rarely go out anymore.

Crazy how much a drug can change you.

Sorry for the super in depth rant, I just have so much history with this drug that I feel I can maybe help someone out if they need it. Point is though, it gave me as much as it took from me, and I feel happier off it now, to be honest.

Either way though I still fell into the ""prone to addiction"" category after a year of use as prescribed, started abusing them and now it's hard to use them normally so I don't touchem. I'm still going to NA meetings for my bad binge habit I still have yet to completely kick.

Ignore the labels and focus on working on your symptoms. In the long run it does not matter what it's called as adhd/anxiety expresses itself differently in every one. Having mood swings is just as much part of that. As you work on improving your mood stability, your coping methods, etc you will still progress and your therapist will help you narrow it down, if at all necessary. 

I was diagnosed with bpd at 19 and diagnosed adhdc at 24. I take dexamfetamines for it. Ritalin did what it needed to do, but it gave me all the side effects except for seizures.

I was diagnosed with BPD and ADHD several months ago, and though I'm on vyvanse, BPD has still had a good hold on my behaviors. I had to withdraw from college just yesterday because I was being really avoidant of completing classwork. I'm 31 and still haven't finished college because of constant self-sabotage and avoidance. My sense of self is also incredibly unstable due to BPD and gender dysphoria (transitioning gender to female). It constantly feels like I have no idea who the hell I am.

I'm taking Wellbutrin XL alongside the Vyvanse. Wellbutrin helped my anxiety at first and helped me focus a little more, but I think it's leveled out now. I had a bad relapse with self-harm five weeks ago and wound up in the hospital, so I'm really struggling to re-evaluate what I need medicine-wise.

4,"Ah, that sounds unpleasant to put it mildly. I hope it hasn't negatively affected your job/school etc.

I would say it's certainly worth trying the other class drug as 2/3rds of people respond significantly better to one class than the other. Concerta is methylphenidate class along with ritalin. You'll want to try an amphetamine class, which is adderall and vyvanse. There are others of course but those are the big 4 names.

Coming from concerta, a pretty long lasting drug, you'll probably want to try adderall xr or vyvanse. Those two are quite different tho, as adderall is a mixed salt (MAS), 70% dextroapmhetamine 30% levoamphetamine (they're just isomers but they really do somehow work differently) and vyvanse is 100% dextro, though technically lisdextro as it's a prodrug. Which is why I'd recommend trying it first as its release is extremelyyyyyyyy smooth (it's metabolized ENTIRELY differently despite being the same thing by the time it gets to your brain, but that difference is HUGE). Even compared to the month that I tried concerta, which wasn't as bad as your're describing, the difference for me with stuff like sudden irritability for a couple hours at the med's peak along with jittery energy, then more sudden irritability with a crash at the end, was stark. If that doesn't work keep adderall xr in mind tho, as for some folks that 30% levo is a total gamechanger affecting motivation, so if vyvanse works better but you're still hyperfocusing on the wrong thing and can't task transition to what you actually want to be doing, adderall could be promising.

Orrrrr you may need to do what I did in that exact scenario which is add another drug. I'm 2 days away from 4 weeks on wellbutrin and my god the last week I have gotten the best sleep since at least when I was a 10 year old child almost 2 decades ago. The motivation and energy throughout the day is lifechanging and the evenness of  all the symptom improvement vs having to rely on the peak couple hours of just the stim, it's game changing man.

Anyway I should also note I think generally any amphetamine is likely to have a stronger effect on appetite but honestly all of that stuff varies so much I wouldn't worry about it until you try it.

One last thing, with appetite but also everything else in general, I *highly* recommend sticking it out for as long as you can (2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months whatever) if you are on the borderline (heh) of wondering if it's working or not, or if the side effects are worth the benefit or not, because even though stims don't need to build up in your system over weeks the same way as some other drugs do, there is absolutely still that kind of element going on as far as your body and you as a person adjusting to it. And the stupid cliche ""pills don't teach skills"" is completely true. Eg I needed to crank out 16 hours of work today on the computer, so I cranked out 16 hours straight without a break. Was it healthy? Well, no, hyperfocusing and embracing the appetite suppression in order to get more work done isn't healthy especially long-term, but the fact is that I still have a couple physiological side effects like appetite (although compared to the first couple weeks, far far less-if you thought there was a dropoff after the first day or 2 and now this is normal, just know there may be another, subtler dropoff after a couple weeks too). Anyway now after a couple months tho I am better at putting skills to use. Combined with the increased will to live and thus motivation to do anything at all for myself from the antidepressant, as well as being in the habbit from dbt cards of logging things daily, I now track my food intake daily in a notebook. I've never been able to do something like that for longer than a few days before in my life no matter how hard I've tried, but with the right mix of meds and help from therapy and stuff I've done it for a couple weeks now and it's made a huge difference in making sure I eat enough (and don't overeat, which can definitely happen, like if you go a whole day (16 hours + 8ish hours sleep + a few hours since dinner before that), after your stim wears off, if you ever have binge impulses like me you're gonna want to overeat üòÖ Anyway just tracking is enough for me but it took me a while to find that out, for others it may be tracking plus goal setting/rewards, or something else entirely. That all sounds cheesy afffff and friend, I usually roll my eyes at people who say ""this sounds chesy af but it actually works""..... but it actually works!

It is 100% worth trying and failing and trying again to find the combination of pills and skills. Trust me, just a month ago I was real freaking close to killing myself because of the hopelessness that I would ever get this stuff figured out, and a ridiculous feeling that I didn't even want to get better. I know how hard it is to talk yourself out of that kind of stuff cause I was just there, so I'll shut up now except to say that even if you aren't feeling optimistic about it, I know that if you've made it this far with these ridiculous disorders in life, you will make it through this process and you will find the combination that works for you.

I felt dizzy and I was clenching my jaw/grinding SO bad at night. I just went back down to 50 and I‚Äôm feeling better. It‚Äôs stabilized my mood so much.

Either mosquitos or chiggers or something because my friend and I both got little tiny itchy bumps on our skin. Hers went away the next day after we left, and mine got really bad and spread all over my arm from my wrist to my shoulder over the next week. I sent a picture to my doctor, and she told me to stop this medication. I said all that to say that any mild skin irritation caused by anything can trigger the lamictal rash in some people!

I did like the mental impact of lamictal. I did fix a lot of my relationships. It didn‚Äôt necessarily help my OCD but it helped my BPD tons. I felt saner on it for sure and if you don‚Äôt get the rash or awful side effects it‚Äôs worth it. Miss it every day :(",No-Ad-930,1blwroa

32,I was on it and it made quite a big difference. I got a pretty severe rash when I increased my dose from 25-50mg. I had to stop and it‚Äôs been hell coming off it.

It‚Äôs supposed to stop my nightmares but it doesn‚Äôt. The Wellbutrin has yet to make a difference (7 weeks).,Old_Ad5598,1blwroa
33,"It works as a mood stabiliser for me and is the only treatment I have since fsr where I live the waiting list to get therapy is insane smh. Though lamotrigine helps stabilise my mood swings a lot, it doesn't help with my seasonal depression, anxiety or episodes of triggers attacks (my emotions still get overwhelming, there's splitting and ""end of the world thinking"" etc.). My guessing is that it works better combined with therapy since then you get to learn how to handle the dips/lows. Right now I'm relying on medication and still don't know how to handle or combat my feelings/thought processes when my bpd gets more prominent. All to say I think it's a good medication and although not feeling the best I feel like there's hope for me versus how I've been feeling before on lamortrigine, so that's how it's been working for me. It plays a huge part of how I can get on with my daily life, so that's a milestone for me.

Side note: Since I also have agoraphobia, anxiety and seasonal depression I was thinking of also asking my doctor for sertraline (been taking it before so know that it's kinda working on me).",Traditional_Arm5169,1blwroa
34,"I was on it for a few years. I got off of it because it can affect dreams and was giving me nightmares. That's a rare side effect, but not unheard of: I think 5-10%. It took me a while to figure out that lamotrigine was the cause, so it's something to be aware of.",NotreJardin59,1blwroa

There is no medication that can help or treat BPD. They must be prescribing these meds for a different, diagnosed condition. The treatment for BPD is talk therapy and skills development.",Actually_zoohiggle,1blwroa

34,"I understand your upset at being told this by your psychiatrist.  I assume that the label has become a part of your identity and being told it doesn't exist is like being told that YOU don't exist or, perhaps, that your pain and suffering isn't real.  A psychiatrist should know that - should be sensitive to the hurt they could cause by their throwaway comments.  Many psychiatrists I've met have terrible social skills and can be quite blunt and hurtful, without meaning to be.  

Psychiatric disorders as laid out in the DSM and ICD are not at all like physical illnesses.  They change with every edition, some added, some removed, some changed beyond all relationship to how they were previously described.  They are, at best, useful descriptors of a collection of human thoughts\\emotions\\behaviours and really shouldn't be conflated with physical medical conditions.  The DSM is a more of a ready reckoner than a scientific calculator and the disorders described therein are subject to change and even complete disbelief.

It's probably important to consider that this doctor's disbelief in the label almost certainly does not equate to a dismissal of your thoughts\\feelings\\behaviours nor a dismissal of the pain caused by these. It is the label she's dismissing, not the pain and not the person.  That could, if you wanted, be a source of hope.  Perhaps, she can see past the label to the YOU behind it.  Perhaps that is her way of preventing her judgement from being cloulded by a label that is, admittedly, widely misunderstood and against which many are biased.

If I were you, I would try to ascertain exactly what she meant before dismissing her entirely.",colmwhelan,oymc6m

64,"Mmm... I would just be cautious with that mindset.

If you don't have the right diagnosis, you can't get the right treatment.

I know that labels change a lot but I don‚Äôt think that means  they shouldn‚Äôt be conflated with physical illness. Other illnesses change labels too as new knowledge is acquired through research. I might be misunderstanding what you mean by labels. Here‚Äôs my understanding: For instance, ‚Äúneurasthenia‚Äù used to be an umbrella label for a collection of symptoms and now people with those symptoms could be diagnosed with a number of different treatable physical disorders. I believe mental illnesses can definitely developed  through ‚Äúnurture‚Äù but the same can be said for other physical illnesses too. I‚Äôve had anxiety my whole life, even as a child.

84,"The psychiatrist didn‚Äôt ‚Äúinterview‚Äù me, didn‚Äôt review any of my intake forms, and diagnosed me with ‚Äúa little bipolar‚Äù from one question. You‚Äôre saying I should pay heed to that? I can see why you‚Äôd say diagnoses are subjective to a certain degree as far as what constitutes a positive indicator, but once the indicators are reviewed, it‚Äôs my understanding that that‚Äôs how they make a diagnosis at this point. Hopefully in the future there will be some sort of biological indicator or any more accurate form of testing. But for now, after they decide which indicators a person has at that point it would be objective just because it‚Äôs based on numerical data. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter to me personally whether I have the diagnosis or not. I know that mental illnesses are collections of symptoms just like certain physical illnesses. I‚Äôm striving for a proper diagnosis because It changes what medications and therapy are provided to me based on my symptoms. ‚ÄúProfessionals‚Äù seem to take me more seriously when there‚Äôs a label given to symptoms, in my experience. For example, if I show that I‚Äôve been diagnosed with bpd, CPTSD, (whatever the label may be ) by a professional, I‚Äôm more likely to get DBT than if I just say ‚ÄúI struggle with emotional instability‚Äù (or any of the other symptoms of bpd)",Badash1992,oymc6m

The thing is, in my right state of mind, I already know what is and isn‚Äôt rational, but in the heat of emotion, that knowledge does no good.

He also scolded me/complained repeatedly about my preferred method of going about therapy, which he had agreed to (going through short pieces I‚Äôd written that explain my trains of thought and talking through them). I understand that he could‚Äôve denied this means of therapy, but he made me feel like I was inconveniencing him while he did it.

0,"first my darling, you cannot think of BPD as a disease that has a cure. it is a lifelong disorder caused by truama and is managed by therapy, environment, support system, and medication (if necessary).

secondly, you can try therapy alone and if that's enough then you're good to go. for me, however, the meds help so much to allow me to manage myself. I am on lamictal which has an uncommon (like I'm the only one at my facility that got it) side effect to cause stuttering and speech impediment and i unfortunately got it, but the good it does me in managing my BPD is worth the price and i adjusted to try to avoid the stutter like speaking more slowly, calmly, and in shorter sentences.

i understand the fear, truly i do, just ask yourself if it worth the chance and remember if you do get the undesirable side effects you can stop the meds as soon as its noticed then the effects should go away too. everytjing we do in life has a chance of something negative we just have to decide if it's worth the risk.",FuzzySquish_123,1c3apwh

Went I was in the hospital the nurses kept asking me why I wanted to die or why I drank that much. I told them everything. I told them about the 3 men that sexually abused me while I was a kid for a long time. What I didn‚Äôt know, because I was so drunk, that my mom was right next to me. She heard everything. Not because I was ashamed or whatever. I didn‚Äôt want to put her through the pain of knowing her child was abused sexually‚Ä¶‚Ä¶not only once but many times‚Ä¶.by three separate men.

I obviously ended up in the mental hospital for the first time. There, I was prescribed Xanax. Obviously there, they controlled my doses. When I got home I started dating a drug dealing who was 18. He told me Xanax was a FUN drug. My mom, not realizing I would abuse them, let me be in control of my own meds at 15. I took sooo many of them (and gave them to my bf and his friends, that lead to him searching  for more  Xanax on the dark webs bc he had connects) He would get SOOO many at once and sold them like crazy. We made dirty sprites all the time. I always felt like I was in control while fucked up on Xanax. Truth is. I was never in control. I was a different person. I wasn‚Äôt really aware of what I was doing. I never felt ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or fucked up on them until I was coming down off them and I was like damn holy shit. 

At 16 I broke up with him. I calmed down on the Xanax recreationally. I was still prescribed them. I started dating a 19yr old. We had a pretty toxic relationship to make it short. After we broke up. I decided I was going to off myself. I said goodbye to my two best friends. (At this time I had two full bottles of Xanax bc I was saving my prescription for a day like this) I took all my meds and laid there. 3 minutes later my mom comes bursting in my room. ‚Äú WHAT DID YOU DO‚Äù she said ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwhat are talking about??‚Äù I replied‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYOUR FRIENDS CALLED ME, THE AMBULANCE IS ON THIER WAY‚Äù At that point I was more mad than anything. I threw my med bottles at her. The ambulance took me away. I was in the hospital. The doctor came up to me and and said, ‚Äú How many of me do you see?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I said 4 and the next thing you know I‚Äôm in a different city in a mental hospital. 

While in the mental hospital, I was coming down off the drugs. I wouldn‚Äôt eat because I was so fucked up. They thought I was anorexic so they put me on calorie count. I didn‚Äôt talk. This was when my psychiatrist in the hospital decided to take me off Xanax due to my reckless behavior. 

I didn‚Äôt touch Xanax for a while. 2018 rolls around. A guy my, current bf was friends with, got a hold of a LOT of Xanax and gave us about 200 pills? We went through all of them in a week? I had a better tolerance than my bf. He ended up punching holes in our bedroom door. Well, he actually split the entire door in half. Then he broke up with me. So I left the house crying. When I came back to the house to pack my shit, he asked me what I was doing. I told him. He said that he never broke up with me. Then, as I tried to calm him down, he punched out out walll in our closet which hit a support beam and he actually broke it. Since that day he has never touched it again. 

Unfortunately for me, I couldn‚Äôt sleep one day at my moms house 2022 February. I asked my mom if I could have one of her Xanax to sleep. She gave me one. I fell asleep. I guess when I woke up, she was down stairs. I grabbed her meds and took maybe 5 or 6 more idk? Then she (her words not my memory) woke me up and I was slurring and clearly not okay. She was questioning me and I got moody. I then tried to take her entire bottle of Xanax. I literally fought her for the meds. I have no memory of this. I punched. Kicked. Bruised her. I hurt my mom really bad. I took all of her meds. One minute I was in my moms bed and the next I knew I was in the mental hospital.

OKAY, I know my story is pretty extreme because I have an addictive personality but my mom has been prescribed them for about 20 or more years. The major thing I can say about my mom is, her memory is SHIT. I‚Äôm her youngest child. She can‚Äôt remember any of her children‚Äôs baby years and if she does it‚Äôs the tiniest shit. Xanax affects your memory in the long run like crazy. 

Don‚Äôt mean to scare lol, I‚Äôm pretty intense 

I‚Äôm okay now! Maybe if you‚Äôre scared about Xanax, try and see if your doctor will do a non addictive substance for an anxiety med because there‚Äôs sooooo many other options out there.",lookingtobefound,y2jobx

I took Xanax on a plane to stay calm and then had a drink with friends once I landed. That caused a several hour blackout where I severely embarrassed myself but could have easily had much worse happen in a strange city. Xanax plus alcohol has been involved in a lot of accidental overdose deaths. Also if you develop a dependency on Xanax you will not be able to safely stop taking it without entering a detox center. You can have seizures or even die. After a few years of using Xanax I was able to come off it but I experienced a side effect from withdrawal called ""benzo belly"" which is a huge bloated stomach with a lot of digestive problems.

Only TWO things you can die WITHDRAWING from, Benzodiazepines and Alcohol. Both are very dangerous so please listen to the warning on your bottle. It is OKAY to have Xanax. I felt very ashamed at first, but talking with my doctor about a game plan and alternative coping methods helped ease my shame. Xanax has helped me get through a time I needed when I needed it, now not so much. I take it maybe once or twice a week? You can ask your doctor about the difference between as needed Xanax and time-released, I find that the time released didn‚Äôt hit me as hard as the regular ones, and can talk about the dosage.

They work and are good for your health.  if you drink whilst on xanax you could very easily ruin your life.  At this stage you will black tf out and it will not be pretty.

At 3 months mark, I started experiencing terrible withdrawal symptoms which would incapacitate me on the spot, I would need to lie down and wait for several painful hours for spasms, muscle aches and shivering to end.

When I would use Xanax recreationally ~2mg, I would have extreme cravings and desire to repeat it again the first thing in the morning. It subsides as you go on about your day but I wanted to point out a great potential of psychological dependance as well.

As others have suggested, keep it on you in case of panic attacks but I wouldn't recommend using it on daily basis.

112,"I would say if you‚Äôre worried about the future and having anxiety about it that‚Äôs a very normal thing so don‚Äôt worry! Here are some techniques you may find helpful

- the box breathing I mentioned when you start feeling anxious- Take a deep breath in through your nose to a count of four. Hold it for four, and then let the breath out through your nose or mouth to a count of four. Do that four times.

- Grounding techniques - Some of them involve physical items, like snapping a rubber band against your wrist, holding ice in your hand, washing your face with very cold water 

- getting good sleep + regular exercise 

Another grounding technique when you start to feel anxious - Think about five things you see, four things you feel, three things you hear, two things you smell and one thing you taste.

Also consider looking into cognitive distortions and challenging them:

Alcohol and ‚Ä¶ benzos (heroin withdrawals might make you feel like you gonna die but you actually won‚Äôt die from if quit cold turkey)

It‚Äôs a great drug. It help with anxiety tremendously but please only use them for absolutely horrendous panic attacks. For physical symptoms of anxiety, beta blockers might be a good start as they slow down your heart rate as they don‚Äôt trigger dependency.",marsupialsi,y2jobx

I haven't had any self harm urges or attempts since being on it, I don't have anymore anger/irritation outbursts, and I cry for a much shorter time compared to hours like it was before. 

The only side effect is that it could cause a rash which needs to be reported to a doctor immediately. That's very rare though. Other than that there's no side effects and it doesn't mess with you in any other way. 

That's not to say that it will be the EXACT same for you, but I know someone else with bipolar + BPD who takes it as well. My roommate is also on it for anger issues. It's helped all of us. I'm sure it would help you too!",,17tyea6

1,"I took lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer (had to stop bc it would have cancelled out my new birth control) and take duloxetine as an antidepressant/anti-anxiety med.

Antidepressants are my best friends though, they help a lot to this day",kaprisunny_,xgg8t8
2,"Be very cautious with lithium. While it can treat mood swings, it's also toxic for your body.  I would be concerned if they even considered lithium as you are fairly young. I had a friend who passed away due to chronic lithium use. The doctors were supposed to monitor her blood levels but things were forgotten and one day she just never woke up. I'm in UK btw. 

Most psychiatrists are very reluctant to prescribe strong antipsychotics or mood stabilisers because 1. there's no evidence that they even work on us, and 2. most are detrimental to the body and have horrendous side affects (such as weight gain, drug-induced diabetes, renal damage etc)

I definitely would recommend switching up meds though. Just because one antidepressant didn't work for you, it doesn't mean the others won't. Sometimes it can take a lot of trial and error to find the right medication... For example, SSRI's make me more unwell, the last two times they put me on an ssri (sertraline and venaflaxine) I ended up inpatient. Now I take trazodone, and I'm still fucked in the head but somehow I'm actually about to graduate, and I haven't self harmed for over a year.



And remember you need to take the medicine continuously for up to a month to start feeling the antidepressive effects. I used to skip doses and not realise that can actually make you feel WORSE. Because your body cannot get used to the different levels of drug in your body.

It still isn't great but I noticed that I'm able to handle crises more easily now. I also have Neurol (similar to Xanax) to use when I'm in a serious crisis and nothing else helps. However, it's only a temporary solution. 

However, only taking meds won't do the trick. Meds keep us above the water enough so that we can learn how to swim. And we need a therapy for that, usually DBT or at least the CBT. I attend the latter and it's been helping a lot. However, I know I need both meds and therapy to function, at least for now.

So yes, you can definitely take the meds for the BPD. Talk to your psychiatrist about this option. However, also remember to attend the therapy which can teach you how to function better in your life. Good luck!",SmallRoot,xgg8t8

In that regard, though, I do take meds to help me out. Lamictal is an anti-seizure medication that does something about the electrical impulses in your brain, which typically spike during an episode. It doesn't work for everyone, but it works tremendously well for me. Seeing as bpd isn't a mood disorder, it makes sense that a non-chemical corrective (serotonin and stuff) works better for patients like me.

37,"Common misconception! Licensed clinical therapists (a protected term that is often misappropriated) in the US do diagnose. However, for purposes of things like academic accommodation, FMLA, etc, often therapists aren‚Äôt trusted. Which in my opinion is sad and challenging. 

For things like formal adhd/asd assessment, this is best done by a psychiatrist or post doc psychologist. 

In the US, providing therapy, especially when it‚Äôs billed to insurance, REQUIRES a diagnosis. When we aren‚Äôt sure yet what the client‚Äôs best fitting diagnosis is, especially with BPD because we need a thorough assessment period of at least 3 months (this isn‚Äôt a hard and fast rule, it‚Äôs just best practice), we have some diagnoses, like adjustment disorder which can serve as a placeholder while we narrow it down. 

Licensed clinical social workers and counselors have gone through extensive testing and supervision requirements to become licensed and privileged to do this work. For a non-independently licensed clinician (one who is working in the field but does not have full licensure) is supervised by a fully licensed supervisor who basically oversees (no physically in the therapy sessions tho) and signs off on all their work. That supervisor is clinically licensed (also called independently licensed) and guides that clinician while they get all their hours (in my state 3600 hrs) and then tests. The supervisor has also gone through training to become a supervisor and typically has been clinically licensed for at least 2 yrs. I personally am a licensed clinical social worker, so I‚Äôve completed all my hours and testing and practice independently. We have to gain continuing education consistently to renew our licenses every 2 years.

But the skill set needed to work with BPD or any diagnosis, the things that create the least opportunity for harm and the highest for safety, are highly attainable by solid education, field work, and supervision. There are many clinicians who may not meet your standards but truly are amazing at what they do. There are many ways to learn and accessibility is an issue. Personally I‚Äôm gaining a lot of education through books by experts in trauma therapy and that wouldn‚Äôt be on my CV. Most people deem DBT at the most effective treatment for bpd and that in my opinion is a bit hyperbolic.

All I asked is that you remember that training is expensive! And time consuming. It‚Äôs not the only pathway to specialization. We are required 30 hours of continuing Ed between license renewals. That means we are receiving training on a regular basis. But consider the less privileged clinicians out there who are learning and applying evidence based practices very systematically very effectively. You might not like how they learned but they doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt highly skilled. 

My point on your blogging is Im here to share facts about clinicians, our requirements and privileges and how we practice. Your experiences are not nearly as widely applicable. I told you, I‚Äôve had many bad therapists. I‚Äôm not going into it here because it doesn‚Äôt describe therapists country-wide. It just serves as anecdotal evidence that bad therapy exists.

I remember being so anxious before- so fucking anxious before‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs the quick story. Met these people at college one night, they asked me to attend picnic the next day. Literally woke up that morning, frantic, showered, clothed myself, fucking sweat through that shirt, missed the deadline to meet them, couldn‚Äôt eat anything, went to in personal hospitalization the same week cuz I was so bent out of shape about not attending. Lol",,138457z
2,"Ah yes. Benzos. Apart from BPD, I also have chronic anxiety since age 4 (I'm 44 now), from trauma that I also have CPTSD from, OCD and Avoidant Personality Disorder since age 7, and depression with severe anhedonia.

8 antidepressants over 10 years have not helped me. A mood stabiliser, an antipsychotic and a stimulant didn't help me.

I feel like anxiety and BPD are the 2 direct causes of all of my problems. The BPD makes me feel constantly empty and bored / unsatisfactory, and the anxiety causes everything else. And due to that, benzos are the ONLY thing that have helped me because they actually target anxiety.

I've been on them nightly for 6.5 years. Thanks to the annoying tolerance that develops quickly (for me anyway), they don't work much anymore but they still do something thankfully.",Footsie_Galore,138457z

4,"Okay with your possible tendency to addiction defenitely use them wisely. Tavor is extremely helpful and fast in their actions. As the other person said seriously just take it as thelast way out. Its not for a small or medium panicattack. I only take it when i feel like i would faint, when my body hyperventilates but on an extreme or when i realise i cant get out of the anxiety on my own. Id say benzos are a good medication for people that are deep into dbt and knowing how to control their panic attacks. Because in the first moment id say u tend to take them as soon as you feel uncomfortable because you are anxious it could get worse and u loose control of your body. But when u learn more about dbt you will also develop strategies that give you security or savety. You know til a specific stage that you can handle it without meds. But you need to find out when that stage is. Id say i have panicattacks by now around 50 a year, it was much worse. Maybe (!) twice i take tavor for it because i learned to minimize them and how to act when having them. And from these 50 times its not always a 10/10 attack. Thats what i wanna tell you. Tavor is not there for the panic attacks from 1 to 9 id say in my personal experience. I only take it when its a 10. Hope that helped.",Ok_Yard3242,rqe3ke

To OP- do your research. Benzodiazopines are not meant to be a long term solution. In fact, it actually makes BPD worse long term.

‚ÄúAlprazolam and other benzodiazepines are strongly discouraged in treating BPD, due to risks of worsening impulsivity and suicidality.78‚Äù [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3811092/)

‚ÄúBZD use for anxiety disorders can be problematic because anxiety, panic attacks, phobias and social avoidance are among the adverse effects of BZDs. While BZDs may provide short-term relief for anxiety, there is often a paradoxical long-term worsening of anxiety. ‚Äú [Source 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/)

I had the same cyclic anxiety as you that would culminate in massive breakdowns and eventually led to uncontrollable panic attacks which would even wake me in the night (I was on disability for almost a year). Finding the right medication has allowed me to live a ""normal"" (sans constant panic and dread) life without my anxious symptoms! I'm still trying to manage my depressive symptoms but I'm so grateful I have a tool like this in my arsenal to allow me to better cope!

You will feel like you are in your own personal hell because you *are*.  I was there too I understood. If you need anyone to just chat to while enduring it, I‚Äôm here. I went through it alone for MONTHS. I cried and felt so awful. Nothing compares. I had this indescribable ‚Äúbuzzing‚Äù in my body. So much PAIN too. And my nerves were so sat even someone‚Äôs sudden voice poppinp up could send me into anxiety attacks. I lay on the floor just tossing and turning. Rubbed my skon off my neck from so much massaging. Insane times.

But eventually thankfully after s few months I felt mostly ok. 

I‚Äôm currently on gabapentin for just anxiety and it hardly touches it.
I miss how normal Klonopin made me feel. I never felt high. Just feelings of calmness. My brain‚Äôs rapid thoughts disappeared and I had confidence in myself again. That‚Äôs what I miss.

Its fine if you wanna share perceived facts that you agree with.  But there is no need to bring others down because you disagree with medication.  Your splitting is showing.,DumpsterWizard,rqe3ke
84,"thank you so very much for ur sweet comment!! Thats so cool that your GP has sources like that available!!
That sounds really rough tbh : / I used to have night terrors but never connected that to my anxiety altho now im thinking it might have been related too?
Its so crazy what the mind can do to the body. Im glad u dont have that anymore at least.
I havent really read up on Effexor i believe but I just now started my first trial with antidepressants ever! I am on 150 bupropion rn. : ) they also gave me benzos but im gonna try to not take them for now.
Honestly the second you kinda get out of that ""no meds"" stage it seems like such a simple solution??... why suffer like that if there is help available haha.

Sometimes it really helps me to get outside and *move.* I don't really do the gym so usually I'll just put on earphones and go walk or run. It can be nice to release the tension and energy that builds up in a way that doesn't hurt you. Sometimes if I don't have a ""nice"" place to walk I'll go to like a Barnes & Noble or a Walmart or something just as a safe place to wander around, although my favorite spots are places with nice scenery or animals.


I also try to force myself to wait (esp with suicidal ideation if I have a plan) and distract myself somehow. I know if I wait it out, often the feeling passes. So I might create something, talk to a friend, play a game or rewatch a comfort show - really anything that takes up some of my cognitive bandwidth until I'm in a better headspace.

The fear of being lost to such activities and mental spiraling scares the bejesus out of me. That fear has driven me to give myself better coping. Places to go sit with myself, places that inspire and push me to have social needs, activities that I can do alone and that I can do with others, by building a competitive mindset.

I have built not just boundaries for other people, but I have instilled these boundaries into myself to the point where if I genuinely consider it, my brain legit shuts down and is just fried. It cannot exist in my mind and I basically reset.

I think going for a drive could be good as long as you don't feel any urges to drive recklessly or anything! Maybe the right music and scenery would help calm you or get your mind on something else.


I get what you mean with suicidal ideation. I think with chronic stuff I just keep trying to force myself to make commitments and connect with people where I have *something* to make me feel like there's at least something keeping me here when I'm low.

I really did not use appropriate words to express what I was really trying to get through. It was my poor analogy logic brain speaking.

Ultimately, I am telling myself that I can't go backwards. If I do start going backwards and my mental health starts declining and I am unstable and disfunctional, I couldn't live with myself in that state. I was there and I hated it so much I fear going back to it. So as long as I can say fuck my life and it can be in a joking manner or just a stupid response to the random little annoying things that happened, then I'm golden.

Sorry about the lack of proper explanation. My brain has just been in shut down mode for several days. And like, 6 days ago my brain hit a state of explosion where I total shit down.

That‚Äôs why I kinda feel proud and can see I‚Äôve progressed. I‚Äôve already reached out for help before I‚Äôve broken skin or gotten hospitalised, which is progress in my eyes. Had a little benzodiazepine binge recently which is old behaviour but never mind, I‚Äôve still progressed.

I‚Äôm doing EMDR therapy now including intensive therapy too -  I‚Äôm on meds (Zoloft and vyvanse for adhd) but I don‚Äôt think the Zoloft helps a lot. The adhd and executive functioning (which I have a separate therapist/coach for) was sooo CRUCIAL !!! To me getting better.

The hot yoga has made me feel a huge sense of purpose I have gotten in the past from FP‚Äôs without the toxicity!

I think I will continue to not date/celibacy until i have figured out more things in my trauma therapy. Also in 2 twelve step programs AA and SLAA. Doing both programs 12 steps and have sponsors in both programs. 

Not to mention I have been on an extended cycle birth control pill and I skip my period continuously because having PMDD will be insanely dysregulating for me !!

1,Blanket statement for drugs first of all. Not everyone with BPD is gonna fall into the throes of addiction. people without any mental health conditions develop substance abuse.

Example: Sometimes I'm in a depression phase and really want to go out to the club with my partner because I know getting out and socializing and dancing will be good for me. But I'm so exhausted (despite sleeping almost constantly) and socially anxious that it feels impossible, and if I can force myself to go I'll be miserable, look miserable, and bring the mood down.

Second, there are no validated pharmacological solutions/interventions for BPD as such. As some of the other posters have noted, BPD has myriad presentations and co-morbidities ‚Äî a fact that often compels symptom management. But due to the diversity in symptoms, no medication ‚Äúworks‚Äù for BPD how, say, Dexedrine works for ADHD. 

Third, and last, DBT remains the only empirically-validated treatment modality developed for BPD specifically (which is not to say that it is the only therapy that positively affects BPD). Particularly if your girlfriend has co-morbid PTSD/cPTSD and a history of trauma, it may be worthwhile to investigate CRM and EDMR. Regardless of the specific therapy, a collaborative relationship with a trauma-informed therapist is critical.

20,"Unfortunately, there is no proven drug that temporarily cures or reduces the effects of BPD - most drugs only assist in one or two symptoms of BPD (like depression or anger). My psychiatrist told me that therapy is the best thing to help manage symptoms of BPD because the more you understand it - the less it can take over your life. 
With that being said - I‚Äôve been on 900mg of Oxcarbazepine and it helped manage the mood swings in general so I‚Äôm not going to one extreme emotion and I‚Äôm more calm. I don‚Äôt feel so chaotic and can actually focus on my tasks rather than how I‚Äôm coming off to others.

21,"I took Wellbutrin after a stint in the mental hospital at 13, for about two years. I found it made me feel very foggy and subdued, and I cold turkeyed it.

I took Zoloft for three years starting at 16, and I felt generally more positive, but it did very little to help me curb my negative thoughts/emotions/outbursts and I quit it as a result. 

I haven‚Äôt taken any pharmaceuticals since. I use cannabis daily (very specific dosing of amounts, not random) and take a huge quantity of omega3 fish oil and a multivitamin, in addition to eating a VERY routine and relatively balanced diet, and exercising for an hour and a half per day in addition to my very physical job (horseshoeing) This DEFINITELY isn‚Äôt for everyone, but I was absolutely sick of taking medication that did nothing to help me manage the negative side effects of my BPD, even after only taking a couple meds. Cannabis can pull me out of an episode almost instantly if I use the right amount of the right strain, and if I dose regularly in small amounts throughout the day my mood swings are much less consequential, and I am more socially adept. The other stuff helps me keep all the chemicals in my body at a nice consistent baseline, so that if I pay attention to myself I can catch imbalances in body and mind more quickly.

Antidepressants with no mood stabilizers made my BPD worse and that‚Äôs usually the outcome of it for borderlines. My psychiatrist explained that because I go from extreme high to extreme low we have to target both, antidepressants help with the low and stabilizers help with the high so I don‚Äôt have the awful effect of falling from it when it eventually passes.
You can imagine it as basically flattening the mood as much as possible. I still ofc feel bad and good emotions but they‚Äôre very easily manageable and nowhere as intense as they used to be.",eatratshitt,17fvi7t

It is my understanding that if you only have BPD and not depression or anxiety, the medications won't really work for you, because technically your brain chemistry is ""fine."" Turns out that giving Prozac (or any SSRI) to someone who doesn't have depression fucks up their brain chemistry...

I was also diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD before I was diagnosed with BPD. That's why I was given the medications.

33,"I've found a LOT of medications that haven't worked for me. I've been on and off different psych meds for close to 15 years. It's difficult because most of them take weeks if not months to see if they're truly working, and with BPD we can go from fine to crisis mode within seconds.

Like many others have said and like you recognize, it's going to be different for everyone, and unfortunately there's no magic pill. I desperately wish there could be! No medication treats BPD specifically, but doctors can treat the symptoms of it. What's been most effective for me is an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer. In the past I've also taken anxiolytic and/or antipsychotics, but I found the side effects to those difficult to deal with.

At the moment I take Wellbutrin and Topamax. I still struggle, but GENERALLY speaking, I'm able to self-regulate. The combination of these two medications managed my symptoms enough for me to be able to really focus on the work I was doing in therapy. Prior to finding that proper fit with meds, DBT wasn't too beneficial for me because I was so incredibly dysregulated that everything I learned went in one ear and right out the other. Now I have the ability to learn information as well as use it, and I'm actually an addiction counselor now, and I incorporate DBT techniques into my work with my own clients.

I take Valium for anxiety symptoms (usually twice daily, used to be thrice daily until I started working from home) and Trazodone at night for depression and insomnia.

It's like night and day in contrast how I used to feel.

I've taken citalopram (SSRI) for 5 years and while it helps, it doesn't have the ""oumph"" impact like quetiapine (antipsychotic) and elvanse (dextroamphetamine which is essentially pure amphetamine)

I got ADHD, autism and PTSD added to my records a year ago.
The elvanse helps me plow through the day with more ease than ever. By being able to actually focus properly, I tend to follow through with my tasks, hobbies, interests and projects, which gives emotional fulfillment that solidifies my confidence in general. 
It's so much easier to hold on to what you have managed to build up, and that build is strong enough to handle unforeseen feelings and mouthful situations. 
I still hear the void and all its friends ""screaming"" in the background, but it's so much easier to ignore. 
The bad feelings seldomly gets a hold on you, at least not the extent they used to. And if they do, it's not as devastating as it used to be.
I still experiences plenty aspects of borderline, but I've also cut out 85% of my friends that came with plenty of toxicity and unhinged drug use. And my last FP nuked me, so it was either: let go and succumb or make these changes.
So my triggers is basically non-existent nowadays.
Am I more lonely? Sure. But I feel so much more liberated. Quality friends over quantity friends.
And, since I'm able to do pull through with stuff, I feel a lot more independent, which I always been. But this is next level.
The quetiapine helps so much as well. 
I take 2-4 25mg/day mostly for my sleep. It totally dampens the hypervigilance from PTSD, although funky dreams, it's a small price to pay for proper sleep.
But also whenever I feel an anxiety attack brewing, I'll take one. 
It has the same effect as benzos but without the ""intoxication"", which is wonderful since I've never had a good relationship with those.


If you're on prozac (fluoxetine) and feel that it doesn't work and/or it makes feel soggy, slow and off: ask for citalopram. It works so much better than prozac in my experience.
I started with prozac when I got my BPD diagnosis some ~11 years ago and it felt like sludge was running through my system and minus 20 IQ lol. Switching to citalopram was crucial for me.

It's such a stark contrast that if these meds were to be taken away from my. I would literally die of existential stagnation. 
I can't fathom a life with them now. 
It sounds corny, but life is actually quite alright to live right now. Will I ever love myself? I don't think so.
But am I at peace with myself? Yup. I'm content with life. Something I would never allow myself to seek before.
I was destined to indirect self-annihilation.

So I did a lot of research about how different medications work and settled on Hydroxyzine - and it WORKS! It stops the intrusive bad thoughts, or at least, reduces their frequency significantly and makes it much easier to swat them away.

Hydroxyzine works on the part of the brain responsible for transmitting stress hormones. I had some success combining it with Buspar, but Buspar caused weight gain so I eventually stopped taking it and the Hydroxyzine seems to work well on its own.

Abilify and Lamictal made me psychotic. I stay away from ""mood stabilizer"" medications like that now. All I'm interested in is something that will make me calmer. Took me until my 30s to figure that out.

Not OP, but I like this post a lot. I hope OP listens to this. It is nice that people are sharing their own experiences with a drug at least, but ""there is no proven drug"" is the most important answer.

Regarding your 3rd point though, about DBT, you might be interested in some recent research, as we are becoming more confident with non-empirical data for treating BPD. Here's a really well written review article on the evidence for DBT and MBT for example, which are the best researched therapies for BPD: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9624210/

TL;DR: DBT is very good at what it aims to do, such as increasing ability of self-soothing and better emotional regulation. MBT is also effective in it's aims, teaching better mentalization skills. As a result both show benefit for BPD patients in areas such as reducing self-harm, depression, suicidality, etc. DBT tends to be useful overall, while MBT doesn't show increased benefit in adolescents over 'treatment as usual' (based on 2 studies, personal experience may of course vary).

I am a woman who lost sexual function while taking propranolol, and when I got my report back, propranolol was listed as one of the medications that I cannot metabolize well. That‚Äôs why it gave me such negative side effects.

Being weary of meds myself, my psychiatrist prescribed me a ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù med. I currently take Buspar for anxiety symptoms of BPD. It‚Äôs not an SSRI - it has a much much weaker and more localized effect on serotonin. It only increases desire for intimacy - it‚Äôs often prescribed to counter the sexual side effects of other medications! Not all meds are the same!!

No. Why? Because you have a problem and those medications help your body function as it should.

Medications for mental health are correcting something your body isn't doing as it should. There is no difference except the social stigma attached to it.

I freely talk about how I took an anti-depressant when I hit a horrible time in my life and I needed it to help get my life back in order. I was going to a very dark place and I know it saved my life.

There's no shame in taking meds to improve your mental health. It takes courage to reach out and ask for help and it's a sign that you want to feel better and are taking active steps to address your needs and improve your life. That's not weakness, that's awesome.

I see this only as a band-aid solution until I'm stable enough to not need these meds. For now, the combination of Mirtazapine with Pipamperone kind of works to stabilize my mood, if I'm attentive enough to notice the tension spiraling up and then take Pipamperone.

Keep in mind, *having traits* of something doesn't mean you have ""the thing"" it's usually the amount of traits, how prevalent, and how persistent. Many different *traits* of disorders or mere neurodivergency can be reflected in a lot of people for one reason or another. Are you already doing some sort of behavior therapy? Because that's probably a clearer sign of what you're being treated for. What was prescribed for you could be temporary to treat the symptoms while they gather more info.

0,"There are no medications for BPD. There are medications to treat its symptoms. It sounds like you haven't had good prescribers, unfortunately.

Finding the right medications takes time and patience, and in my experience it depends on comorbid conditions, the expertise and commitment of the prescriber, and the willingness of the patient to keep detailed notes. I've known several people who've had success with that sort of approach, including me.

Have you been able to work with a psychopharmacologist with expertise in polypharmacy? I'd start there if I could.

As far as your experience with individual medications is concerned, that depends not only in your individual symptoms but on how your system reacts to them. Your diabetes would certainly complicate things, but (a) I know someone who also has diabetes 1 who had success, and (b) even if a particular med works on one person's symptoms, it may not work for another's. Venlafaxine and mood stabilizers have worked very well for me. SSRIs haven't had bad effects on me. Atypical antipsychotics haven't had much effect on me one way or another. 

You might want to consider using a mood tracking app. That may help you and your prescriber identify in some detail what conditions have what effects on your mood. You can keep track on the meds and dosages you take (including all meds you take), sleep, activities, mood etc. My psychopharmacologist would look closely at the data and make changes as appropriate. Even so, it took about 18 months to create the right cocktail. After that, it's required occasional tweaking over the past 15 years... Changes in dosages, a few changes in meds themselves.

One more suggestion: I've tried hard to be an informed patient/consumer. It sounds like you've been doing research on meds, which is great, but you might want to look at different and multiple sources of information (perhaps you already do this, in which case I apologize). I'm quite surprised that you have read that SSRIs shouldn't be used in patients with BPD. That seems like someone with an ax to grind or something to sell. Not only do lots of people with BPD have success with SSRIs, psychiatric researchers would almost certainly not make any blanket statement like that. If you've had problems with it, it's more likely to be because of your diabetes and psychological symptoms, or it may be that you get serotonin syndrome from SSRIs. That can be very dangerous, but it's uncommon.

I hope you have better success in the future, because there are ways to let you suffer less and feel well enough to work on yourself in talk therapy and other treatments. Again, that's been my experience and I wish the same for you. 

Good luck, and keep fighting. ‚úåÔ∏è",,yoeufr

None of us can give you that answer, only you know your relationship and why you‚Äôve stayed so far. I think the fact she‚Äôs beginning intensive treatment is a good sign. If you‚Äôre not, I would actually get a therapist yourself to help you navigate this and see if it‚Äôs worth it or not.",gtaco777,1ayggxc

I was exactly in the same sense of being skeptical that anything would help tame and control my intensity. But how I think about it is the therapy helps create a whole new understanding of your emotions and how to control/ work with/ reproach situations in your day to day life. 

Meds are also very helpful. I took 100mg Lamotrigine which is a mood stabler and I feel it helped put a cap on the physical reactions (like anxiety attacks the heat beating like I‚Äôm heaving a heart attack and the hyperventilating ). And with me not having those physical factors allows me to get more mental work accomplished.

if it's helpful at all, the subreddit r/leaves is dedicated to folks working on quitting thc in any of its forms, and the community is very supportive and understanding of how mental health plays into addiction. even just lurking and reading others' stories helps me feel less alone.

if you do decide to pursue sobriety, my recommendation is to revisit some hobbies, or find something new to do with your hands! I've taken up weaving, and I may not be very good at it (yet), but there's something so rewarding about a rhythmic activity with a tangible product. maybe for you that could be writing, drawing, cooking, reading, animal documentaries, a long video game you've been meaning to play... as long as it's something for you, y'know?

Look at the real evidence in front of you, you even clearly state it right here. They have a disorder that causes them to sleep a lot, therefore they are sleeping. Worry about something bad *when* you get proof of something bad. Worry about it when they're gone for an entire week without a word. You have to reassure yourself a little bit and respect their struggles here too.

You are free to leave the relationship if it is not a dynamic you enjoy. A relationship can end without either person doing something wrong, and in this case it sounds like that's what it is.

0,"Hiya,

So, first let's remember that there is no medication to treat BPD.  

BPD is a _learned_ disorder. With therapy we can unlearn the behaviours that have developed through our journey with the disorder and begin to re-learn the ""correct"" ways in order to start living a healthier life!

Medications don't really help us _unlearn_ anything. They can help us to block or interrupt other symptoms and behaviours that make dealing with the challenges of BPD difficult. Whether it's dealing with recurring bouts of depression as the result of a depressive disorder or symptomatic presentation of BPD, or maybe it's a co-morbid disorder or illness such as ADHD or Bipolar and medications are prescribed for those. The reason this can help is because many of the symptoms of these co-morbitities can and do interact with the triggers and symptoms that come with BPD and vice versa; BPD can often trigger the symptoms of our co-morbitities. By having a medication that can effectively lessen a symptom or behaviour that _triggers_ our BPD it is one roadblock removed from getting in the way of _treating_ our BPD which still needs to be done even though we've started taking medication.

Good luck with finding something that works for you. It can be a huge help and aid in your journey to recovery.

7,"I've heard very mixed results. I personally choose to stay away from medication targeted at depression, anxiety, and mood swings. The one thing I've tried in the past was an ADHD medication but I stopped taking it because of cost. The research around BPD (and other personality disorders) and medications isn't great so most of the evidence suggesting it can be good seems to be anecdotal. That doesn't mean it couldn't help you though. The one thing i'd recommend would be taking it slow when it comes to medication. I've had several friends who get put on 2-4 medications at once (most of them before they're even 18) and it makes it very hard to tell what's working, what isn't and where side effects might be coming from. For a disorder like BPD where emotions are all over the place to begin with it's even harder to gauge the effect of a medication you're taking. So yeah, just talk it over with your psychiatrist and if you both agree to try it, make sure you give it a good testing period and don't take many medications at once. 

I'd also say that BPD can absolutely be ""cured,"" or rather go into *full remission* as the hip therapists like to say haha, without the need for medication and if you do take medication you also need the therapy/self-work component otherwise you won't make progress and will just dig yourself a deeper pit.

4,"Keep in mind that disorders in the DSM are really just convenient categorizations of common co-occurring symptoms.  Aside from with more clearly neurodivergent disorders like ASD, there is no object that can be pointed to in the body or brain that IS the disorder. And even with ASD, the presentation varies widely, thus the ""spectrum"" descriptor.  We can't say anything like ""oh you have this specific thing in your brain we can pick out that is the ASD bit, so you must have ASD. 

If you find it important or helpful to have the label, by all means, seek diagnosis. Some people find relief in the concept that they aren't just weird or shitty, it's because of the disorder that they can put a name to. It can also help direct your research and form social and community connections around the diagnosis. 

That said, the label doesn't mean much. You have a combination of symptoms, that's the only bit you actually experience.  And your symptoms can be fairly different from another person with the same disorder. 

BPD is notoriously difficult to diagnose, and chances are it won't make it into the next revision of the DSM.  It has a lot of overlap with other disorders. Most likely if you see 3 different doctors or other mental health practitioners, they will all diagnose you differently. It's really not a perfect science, not even close. 

I'm a mental health practitioner in Canada and only psychiatrists can diagnose here.  I take into consideration any diagnosis a client identifies with when working with them, but honestly, all that matters is their personal experience with symptoms, which, while certainly sharing common threads between people, is unique for each individual. 

Diagnoses can also sometimes make you feel trapped or stuck with an objective sickness that can't change. That's not the case. If you alleviate the symptoms, then you no longer have the disorder. The disorder just is the symptoms.",philthy_phil_alt,19e6uvv

6,"Please keep the faith. I am 41...diagnosed at 33 and it's been a huge challenge. The biggest challenge was probably the one you're facing now.... that is, the feeling of hopelessness. Will the suffering ever end? It does, but you first have to recognize (at least) 3 things:

1. You are not the disorder. You don't HAVE borderline, you've been diagnosed with it. In other words, do not commiserate with others who seem to *embody* the disorder. Detach yourself from the diagnosis. It's not your personality. It only affects it. Your personality and behaviors can change. (Read Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself by Dr. Joe Dispenza).

2. The diagnosis is a gift. It comes about because of childhood wounds. And because there's SO much study on this disorder, through your own research, you can discover all the ways your disorder plays out in your life (including the ways you already listed). How can you address those behavioral patterns? How can you heal those childhood wounds that produced the BPD in the first place? How can you HEAL your inner child and, therefore, yourself? How can you establish a baseline of self-love, self-respect, self-care, self-valididation and emotional regulation?

3. BPD is NOT a life sentence. It can go into remission with therapy CBT AND DBT and if those options are not available to you, you can buy thr Dialectical And Behaviorial Skills Workbook by McKay, Wood and Brantley... I think there's a free pdf online.

0,"I am not a doctor, counselor, or otherwise educated/qualified individual to offer psychiatric guidance. This is input given by a stranger over the internet.

Assuming everything you say is true and accurate and assuming your boyfriend is who he says he is, and you've given no reason to doubt either in this post, I think it's POSSIBLE he has been misdiagnosed. BPD almost always presents with some form of emotional disfunction, typically feeling heightened emotions. This often looks like mood swings but really isn't. Also, the fact that his personal relationships are stable and long-term is uncharacteristic. The last reason I'd suspect they got the diagnosis wrong is you mentioned he's very passionate about life, has a good career and hobbies, and what not. A lot of people with BPD have intense feelings of emptiness, like we are without an emotional core or true personality, which doesn't seem to line up with who your boyfriend is based on this post. 

I don't want to create mistrust between your boyfriend and his doctors, but something isn't adding up. It sounds like the majority of his problems are under control and stable, if he does have BPD he's done a great job of dealing with it.",Responsible_Bonus766,1csxkls
1,"Thank you for your response. He voiced the same things you are saying, but I was a little concerned it was just denial. 

He does feel emptiness during before and after dissociating which makes social interactions hard for him. Often times he has trouble interacting with people the day after an episode as they feel 'like aliens.' Outside of this he does seem to have a strong sense of self though, which is in alignment with what you were staying. 

This is actually the second time he has been diagnosed with bpd. I don't really know the specifics but I know when he was in high school psychiatrists thought he had bipolar and bpd at various points. I think this is part of the reason he is resistant to treatment, like they just keep throwing words at him. He also used to have more issues with emotional regulation (again I don't really know specifics but he has mentioned it), but he seems to have sorted that. Though it seems kind of crazy to think he figured out how to deal with the heightened emotions/emptiness you described on his own as a teenager. But I am fully just speculating at this point.",Kindly-Daikon7637,1csxkls
2,"The emptiness is typically persistent. If he's only experiencing it immediately before and after a disassociative episode, I don't think that's a clue, just a part of the episode. Same with his resistance to treatments because if he IS somebody with BPD or any of the cluster B disorders, then it's entirely possible he's just resistant to treatment. Cluster B disorders are very hit or miss. We don't understand how they work or what causes them very well at all, let alone how to treat them effectively. But it'd also make sense if he's being misdiagnosed that treatment wouldn't be working. So, there's not much of a clue there either, unfortunately. 

The fact he's been diagnosed with BPD twice is very odd, it's often misdiagnosed, but still, to have the same mistake happen twice seems unlikely. I feel like at this point we are missing information, either from your boyfriend of from the doctors, but it's not my place to pry. I hope everything goes well for you and your boyfriend, but it sounds like you'd need to talk to his doctors and find out more completly their reason for sticking to this diagnosis so firmly, assuming of course there is reason to press the issue. If he is making progress on his issues and is otherwise happy and going in a good direction, I'd let it be. A correct answer is still correct even if you landed on it by accident.",Responsible_Bonus766,1csxkls

Was on it for about 6 months, and it literally done nothing for me. I also struggled with sleep, so they tired me on an antihistamine, which was promethazine this didn't really help either. As none of this helped, they said to stop all the medication and to try coping without it. Unfortunately, this didn't work either. I ended up in a downward spiral and in a really bad place. I was constantly so restless and agitated, so they gave me some diazepam to help calm me down a bit. Unfortunately, they gave me 3 2mg tablets and told me to take 1 a day. The 2mg tablets didn't have much of an effect as it was such a small dose that it probably wouldn't even touch a 80 year old. I carried on spiralling, and they then agreed to put me on quetiapine, which is an antipsycotic. This really helped me to start with it made me more stable and helped with sleep. After a couple of weeks of being on it, I didn't have the same effect, so I asked them to up the dose, which they agreed on, but I kept on having to up the dose. Unfortunately, it got to the point where they refused to up it again. In the end I stopped taking it as I didn't see the point. Unfortunately, in the UK, the NHS has no clue how to treat people with bpd, but I do wish you the best.",,12hen7t

2,"Thanks sm for sharing üíõ

I forgot that I was actually given quetiepine about 8 years ago and the same seemed to happen to me and I came off it. I used to also get given diazepam 2ml, but as you say these don't touch the sides and only work if you eat the whole packet in 1 and they don't like that. I used to buy 10mls myself years before the Dr gave me any, so the 2mls really are a joke. I did get rather addicted to them for around 4 months but noticed what was going on and pulled myself off them. I've had a few self medicated additions when I was younger between 16-23, the likes of K, C and green. I pulled myself out of K and C (addicted at separate times), as I realised what I was doing to myself. I've battled with binge drinking and would drink to dissappear and eventually black out and really hurt myself and others around me. Last year I quit drinking and was sober for 10 months and have only had a couple of social drinks since Xmas. I feel great for not using drink as something to dissapear but it was just so easily available.and seemed more socially acceptable than other routes I've tried before. I smoke green daily and still enjoy it so it's not a chore and I still get something out of it. 

I was given zopiclone (a whole 5 of them) when I last had an episode that I told the treatment about. And tbh they help a teeeeny bit when in a fit of rage or cannot stop crying....but the 5 lasted a whole week üëÄ

I've tried 10mg before that I bought myself and after a couple of days I felt so much better. I think there a great medication as long as it's used in moderation. I've also had drug issues like cocaine and weed. Weirdly enough weed was the worst one for me. It made me so paranoid. It's something now that I don't touch as the positives of it have worn off. I've also tried zopiclone before. The most they have ever given me is a weeks worth of 7.5mg. They lasted me quite well as I would only take them when I was working early the next day otherwise I wouldn't sleep. So I've been diagnosed for about 6 years now, so quite a while. In some respects, I'm much better off than I was to start with, but I still have really bad days. Yeah, I totally agree, I feel like I know more than what they do now.

Taking medications for sleep can help in the short term, but unfortunately, this is not a long-term solution. Sleeping meds can interfere with sleep quality and bring along a lot of undesired side effects with them.   
  
The best thing to do is to start with proper sleep hygiene. This means going to bed and waking up at the same time, avoiding caffeine for 12 hours before bedtime, alcohol, and any harder-to-digest foods at least 4 hours prior.   
  
Sleeping in a cool, dark room with supportive pillows and even a weighted blanket can be excellent conventional therapy for sleep.  
  
The gold standard for insomnia treatment is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Unlike sleeping pills, it is a lifelong solution to sleep disorders as it focuses on the psychological root causes.   
  
Programs are using CBT-I available online or you can consult with your doctor about this approach.  
  
I hope this helps. Best of luck to you.

Edit: wtf is wrong with people downvoting the truth? 

You shoot down every suggestion and make excuses . Did you want advice or were you just venting? Could you try the meditations at least? You didn‚Äôt even comment on that? 

I also recommend journaling and a place to write down your thoughts. Keep a gratefulness journal. Do more physical activity during the day to wear you out.

I had to leave therapy because the person that worked with me tended to always either diminish my accomplishments, treat me like a child, or feed into my anxiety. I also have a history of failed therapies, so I wasn't very inclined to stay in the first place. That was a while ago, and I've been... sort of managing since. Mostly thanks to the fact that I'm very self-aware and that I researched BPD a lot before trying to get a diagnosis. So I have communities like this one to fall back onto when I need advice, I try to apply DBT tips I find online, and I work on myself constantly. Still being in school and under the care of my parents may limit a lot of my symptoms, I think, because I can't really give into all of my impulses.",4thesuns,uujon5

42,"uhh what lol I never said i stay in bed all day and i never asked for input?

I've gotten and tried dozens of sleep hygiene recommendations. I've tried meditating, including taking entire classes, on and off since 2010. I've talked to multiple therapists and doctors about sleep and sleep habits. I've tried getting up and reading a book for a while. I don't generally have the attention span for videos, and even if i did i absolutely hate youtube. I'm currently seeing a therapist (the 12th one) to deal with anxiety/SH/SI/intrusive thoughts, so I doubt some pop psych article will magically solve what I've been working on for over a decade. I've talked to my psychiatrist and tried some kind of sleep medication that didn't really work and we eventually decided medicine wasn't a good idea. When possible I do take some time before bed to slow down, but quite frequently I have to stay up late doing homework or work. I really don't think reading some boring ass wikipedia page till i fall asleep is such a bad solution lol

Every single evidence based sleep hygiene recommendation is based on studies involving large numbers of people where the measurable effect is often barely statistically significant, because humans are complicated. Almost every one of these studies also categorically excludes people with any kind of ""uncontrolled"" mental illness, because not doing so would obscure most measurable effects.

I can only speak for myself, but it's a bit offensive to be told by someone who knows nothing about me that i'm doing it wrong, and I'm guessing I'm not the only one who feels this way. To get on a sub meant for people struggling with BPD of all things and, without knowing anything else about them or their lives, scold them for not following recommendations meant for healthy, stable, neurotypical people is really quite unnecessary.",twythisbich,uujon5

1,"If you have ever taken any antidepressants is very, very, highly important your family or the people that care about you, a friend or FP or even a close school teacher to know this and to be aware of you.

The first 2 weeks are rough, specially because it's the time that takes for the antidepressant to kick in (if you start feeling better from the beginning is a placebo effect and I prefer you to know that even though you might feel disappointed.

During this first 2 weeks suicidal people is more probable to commit suicide so please be aware of yourself, your thoughts and feelings.

After the 2 weeks you'll be ""stable"". Antidepressants don't make anyone happy, that comes from the misconception that depression is being sad. As some people say you'll fill numb about some feelings in your surroundings... They won't make you feel happy or good about yourself but they will you the chance to have more lineal feelings and thoughts rather than suddenly ups and downs, with that you'll be able to create, with the help of therapy, mechanism to cope with your emotions.

Some people carve for a specific type of food. Many say chocolates, cakes or sweets, in my case was ""tacos"" to an extent I was getting tired of tacos but couldn't stop my carving for them (not that it was bad at all), perhaps people looks for the food they love the most.

Libido will be down, sorry for that...

It's the most I can remember of it, it's been a long time since I take it for the first time. I've been through 6 antidepressants so far (but my case wasn't wrongly managed so don't worry, not everyone goes into the antidepressants pilgrimage)...

2,"just started taking it about...2 weeks ago? they wanted me to take it in inpatient for my panic attacks/anxiety issues, so i decided why the hell not. big disagree with what someone else posted here, though. libido doesn't always go down; for some people it goes up. for some it doesn't change at all. just monitor YOURSELF and don't feel the need to force symptoms on yourself because someone on the internet said it happens. (i struggle with this and you might as well. took me ages to realize i was just acting out side effects and symptoms other people had.)

as for me--the first week was rough. not even mentally, though i did have several outrageous panic attacks. i was already at the height of terror with panic so they were just an average, 'i am so afraid of life' day to me. what knocked me around was this flu-like sensation. i thought i had covid. didn't help that i was in the mental hospital exposed to other people; so mayyyybee watch out for that? it might've just been me, though. 

here at the 2 week mark, my anxiety has been leveled so, so, SO much better. i can actually think about things that aren't immediate death or how stressed i am. it's a slow process, but i hope i'll be able to think more and more again since my head got really hijacked by my mental health and all i could ever think of was how afraid i was of dying but how i wanted to die because i was panicking several times a day.

the cons for me right now (aside from potential weight gain that we're monitoring) is this odd little..feeling i get in my chest? it's not physical; but it's like..i'm really happy, like super happy, but also want to die at the same time? i've always gotten this with these kinds of meds, but feeling it again is a little scary, almost. i feel like it's a weird 'happy-depressed' and i keep wanting to deny feeling it.",giyuuo,rxq624

1,"Interesting. Lots of folks talking about TIPP. I've never heard of it before. What it looks like TIPP does for you is ground/distract. Grounding and distraction are great ways to get out of a panic attack/BPD flare.

The most common grounding technique I know is the ""name 5 things"" exercise. It focuses you on the present moment and your surroundings. It takes the focus off the subject you were thinking of that became upsetting or panic inducing.

When you feel your emotional volcano erupting, look around you. Name 5 street signs, look for 5 white houses, name 5 different types of birds around you, 5 different types of office supplies, etc.

Something extremely easy and basic you can do is to carry around a heavily knotted shoelace in your pocket. Again, when you feel the panic rising, pull out the shoelace and start trying to untie the knots. It **will** distract you.

9,"Usually when I notice symptoms I IMMEDIATELY do everything I can to talk myself down and recognize what‚Äôs going on. Figuring out what triggered it will help in that it will help you make sense of how that would cause a panic attack. Also, I have yet to read the book, but I highly suggest ‚ÄúDARE‚Äù. There‚Äôs an app and it‚Äôs specifically for panic. One of his audios basically taunts the pain by saying it has 30 seconds for it to reach its peak and when the 30 seconds is up, it missed its chance. I think this could be the self-fulfilling prophecy or even the concept of suggestion they talk about with hypnosis. It may not work for everyone, but it definitely has been a useful tool in terms of health anxiety. Basically my body has a certain amount of time to do it‚Äôs worse and when time‚Äôs up it‚Äôs missed it‚Äôs chance. 

It‚Äôs important to remember to take deep breaths. I know, I know, it‚Äôs annoying. And I know that‚Äôs also really hard to do in a state of panic. But you have to give it a shot and trying as hard as you can to focus on your breath, especially since the feeling of your legs being jello and like you‚Äôre going to pass out is due to hyperventilate. This decreases the amount of oxygen to you brain and increases CO2, so taking deep breaths will give that oxygen back to your brain.

Lamictal is really a bipolar medication, but I've found it helps with my depressive episodes. Other than that, get some real good therapy, because that is where the real help is.

5,"There's no one medication for bpd because it can be very nuanced, especially concerning the other illnesses that different peole have with it. 
Most doctors try to treat the other conditions first, then see what else they can do with things such as mood stabilizers. 
I take Seroquel at night to help me sleep, reduce anxiety. And as an antipsychotic, and I didn't take any other medication for a long time. I also have a mood tracker, so Seroquel with talk therapy has helped my mood charts go from zig zagging like crazy to calm plateaus within two and a half months.
I recently started on prozac this week, which was the first and one of the most reliable antidepressants,  but so far I can't say much because it takes a month to start making real changes. 
I was on a benzodiazepine, so I know what its like to suddenly find out how dangerous that drug can be. What specific symptom was is prescribed to take care of?
(Edit) I had a safety plan with my psyhiatrist where he only prescribed me refills of three days worth of medication at once until I was stable enough that I could handle depressive spirals without losing control of my suicidal thoughts, so maybe that could help? I also have a safety plan where I check in with a friend every day by texting them a few times a day and I have emergency numbers just in case. I found the safety plan helpful because it showed someone really cared and that people aren't going to take my suicide lightly. Are steps like these a possibility in your life?",Cobalt-Royal,5igy8h
6,"Hi! I have been diagnosed for BPD by a psychiatrist here in Canada! She had told me that there is no drug to treat BPD however there are some to help relieve symptoms (as you already know!).

I have been prescribed Pristiq for my depression an anxiety, however ever since I have been on these pills, I tend to care less about everything, and I just don't really have any emotions (anger or love, etc) I do still get irritated but I don't know honestly.. it's hard to tell if they are doing me any good, because I am sure if I go off the pills I'll probably be worse than I am right now.

I self medicate with Marijuana on a daily basis, and that helps more than anything else has ever !

7,"The clinic I go to is mostly of the opinion that drugs can't do much for BPD and can end up being a crutch to avoid learning to deal with difficult emotions. Sometimes drugs are necessary, like if your depression gets so bad you can't leave the house, but that's not BPD-specific. I was on Wellbutrin before going there but it wasn't helping much and it made my anxiety really bad, so right now my psychiatrist and I are seeing how I do without meds. For antidepressants, he recommends SSRIs when needed.",iheartgiraffe,5igy8h
8,"There are currently no medications licensed to treat BPD.


There are however, medicines used 'off label' to help ease co-morbid conditions, such as antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds and mood stabilisers.


The gold standard for treating BPD is dialectic behavioral therapy and mentalization based therapy, usually one after the other if there is self harm and impulsive behaviour.

It is expensive and time consuming, usually run as a group concurrently with one-to-one therapy. 


I would be very wary of being put on medication for BPD as a long term solution.

I am currently half way through MBT (mentalization based therapy) after nearly two years as a zombie on antidepressants (zoloft) and I am doing great.
I am learning how to manage my life, emotions, triggers, boundaries and everything in-between.


To give some perspective on where I was at before MBT: I was on a very high dose of antidepressants, unable to care about anything, nearly flunked out of uni and didn't give a shit about even existing.

Now I am on my way to a first class degree, looking at an internship at my university after I graduate, I have a wonderful, caring, loving relationship with someone I am able to communicate with and I am feeling very positive and empowered for my future and my ability to have a happy, healthy life.

Also for anxiety, I take propranolol. It's a beta blocker I think and it's a take when you need it thing. If you have a stressful event coming up, like a job interview (or for me, going to the supermarket), you take it a short while beforehand and it stops you getting very anxious.

6,"No, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs just female hysteria. BPD is certainly a real defense mechanism that affects a lot of people. In fact, some research suggests it affects men nearly equally, they just don‚Äôt seek help or get misdiagnosed. 

The idea that women are emotional likely contributes to men and women being misdiagnosed (men as something else and women as having BPD) at some capacity, but even if that‚Äôs the case, BPD is still a very real disorder. 

There‚Äôs definitely a problem in our society where we consider women‚Äôs emotions to be invalid due to hysteria (women are emotional, men are logical kind of arguments). Women definitely get dismissed as being crazy and emotional. But BPD is still real and it isn‚Äôt just a result of that. 

Also, I‚Äôm going to point this out, but please don‚Äôt take it as me attacking you, try to refrain from using your personal experience as evidence. When you state you know many women with BPD (and a ‚Äúfem‚Äù gay guy, which is you trying to fit him into a category he doesn‚Äôt belong in), that‚Äôs anecdotal evidence rather than using research articles that suggest BPD may occur at similar rates between genders. Also, I‚Äôd wonder how you know someone is misdiagnosed with something assuming she hasn‚Äôt met with a different psychologist?

8,"BPD is the resulting behavior to clearcut emotional,mental and often physical abuse

I have found when we think the world is not built for us we rebuild it with the understanding of other people. Rather than wasting time looking at some material which focuses on characteristics which are changeable, if you place your focus on understanding men and women, multiple cultures and people if all backgrounds, giving yourself live goals, you will often find that the concept of BPD was created to describe the resulting behaviors for a person afflicted with traumatic adaptations to psychological abuse. It is the resulting behaviors the person resorts to when grievously harmed.
There are merits and detriments to every century. And some individuals are dead set stuck onto ego syntonic portions to preserve false ego constructs. They won't control their own lives so they try to use old tactics (such as 1920s ideology) to try to regain control. This is an illusion. BPD is the result of clear cut emotional/mental and often physical abuse. It is NOT hysteria. Because there exist individuals in the world who refuse to get comfortable with the fact humans should live harmoniously with each other and use hatred and manipulative tactics to get what they want in this world at the cost of others lives.

I absolutely see your points, but I would take it further and say that there's no diagnosis that's 'real.' 

Everybody's brain and body and way of being in the world is different. Some of us have divergent experiences that don't match the dominant idea of what's normal. Understandably, we feel distressed about this and show it in a number of ways. Then we're pathologised and labelled and medicated and incarcerated. 

Although I utilise the BPD/cluster B label as shorthand for finding people with similar lived experience, I know that I don't 'have' BPD in the same way I could 'have' a broken leg.

Because to me it still seems like you have a slightly shallow view of what it means to have BPD. Men most definitely can be diagnosed with BPD just like women can. Also getting an official diagnosis for BPD is hard for men, women and our non binary pals. 

Saying its ‚Äúmodern day hysteria‚Äù is out of touch because you‚Äôre unknowingly adding more stigma to this disorder. It makes it sound like doctors go around diagnosis (from your posts argument) women and fem‚Äôs with BPD when they show a little emotion.

 If you want to talk about how sexist doctors exist or if there‚Äôs sexism in the psychiatric field, that‚Äôs completely valid because that can and does exist. But getting a BPD diagnosis isn‚Äôt an act of sexism. 

Alsooo if you‚Äôre curious, why don‚Äôt you educate yourself a little more? Look up more instances of what ‚Äúfemale hysteria‚Äù was back then (and some of the examples are considered very mundane today) and then look up the process of diagnosing BPD. Try to find some research papers if you can or study‚Äôs if you can.",Equivalent_Ad_4364,11dwfkc
12,"BPD is the result of an uncontrolled and chaotic, prideful ego lashing at the seams because the way it sees the world is different from the way things actually are and this is caused by childhood trauma that locks the developing ego into place so it doesnt have a chance to mature with the rest of the body.

I'm pretty sure men and women are just as likely to develop it",LengthUnusual8234,11dwfkc

Perhaps instead of feeling the need to slap a label on everyone they see, they should treat the symptoms and struggles of the person.

Men are less likely to seek help for mental health issues due to societal stigma, and when they do they‚Äôre often written off as aggressive or psychotic. Men are more typically misdiagnosed with ASPD or NPD (other cluster B personality disorders) or Bipolar I/II.

0,"Hello OP!
I struggled with similar situation where my triggers would ruin relationship that is so important to me. I thought the meds would help. I got mood stabilizer (lamotrigine). It kinda calmed me down generally - the thoughts are more quiet, im not as anxious as before. But it never stopped the triggering, acting out. I also struggle with SH. It didnt stop that either.

I think meds are not the key to make yourself more ""normal"". The key is understanding your trigger AND learning the techniques to stop them from obsessing over. Because the borderline is a personality disorder, not illness, its more important to change your way of thinking and percieving reality and yourself thank to take meds.

Im not saying you shouldnt take meds, it will calm u down ofc, its helping to stabilize you but the crucial thing is being on therapy.

The best option for borderline is DBT therapy. It helps learning techniques that help with many borderline difficulties. Its not the only option tho but i highly recommend it.

Be warned, your moods won't stabilise, you'll just be a zombified version of yourself.  
Akin to downing xanax or getting stoned, will mellow you out. But, that also means that you won't feel as happy, angry, sad or, any emotion. Every emotion just becomes this grey blur.

2,"Just wanted to say I've been there (and will likely 'go there' again) and I know how scary and disorienting depersonalization can be. Hope at some point, if not now, you can recognize how brave it is to show up every day and live in the face of symptoms like these!! But ofc 'brave' is cold comfort when we feel disconnected from reality itself.

I don't know if it will help but I wanted to share some of the things I've tried to/my experiences with similar typs of symptoms.

 i've been waiting to see a psychiatrist for ages and only got diagnosed with bpd recently.  I was prescribed a low dose of antipsychostics (on top of a new SSRI)  to help with my severe depersonalization/dissociation/derealization. I haven't even started them yet, it's so recent-- up until now I've been relying on a patchwork of coping mechanisms. 

\-I used to roll my eyes at ""mindfulness"" but eventually I got desperate enough to put aside my ego and and actually try because it was basically life or death. Focusing on your senses, to the best of your ability  -- and I know even your senses can seem like someone else's, far away, dulled, unreal, etc --  but still, trying to anchor myself however I could into the present moment, mainly DBT mindfulness skills. if possible, try to find little things that anchor you, even a little -- a hot shower, a familiar favourite show, the smell of coffee, the feeling of a pet's fur, the feeling of breath, whatever. 

\- I marked down or took random photos during good moments so I remember they really happened, even if I forgot, or feel like it happened to someone else. 

\-I tried to limit my stress in any way I could because my symptoms are exacerbated by stress (find out your triggers!). 

\-when experiencing depersonalization, I tried accepting my current experience, no matter how scary, while remembering that it will pass and I will feel eventually different, that I have survived difficult moments before, that I am safe,

\- weird but i've found it helpful  saying to myself that ""I notice I'm am experiencing a symptom of mental illness right now,"" or ""I notice that my body feels like a mannequin, I'm very depersonalized right now."" it gives you a framework to understand and tolerate your raw experience through kinda?? 

\- Accepting that sometimes it will be very difficult to function, and not beating yourself up for this. being kind to yourself and caring for your needs as as you would your most beloved longest friend, even if you can't access love for yourself then.

\-Don't isolate yourself!!! i know how tempting it is, how it can feel like the only option. but please, even if it's awkward, or anxiety inducting, or you're totally dissociated the whole time, I really recommend seeing people you feel safe with. anything makes a difference, even a short visit once a week. participating in 'real life' is such an important component of mental health, even if you feel separate from it and that is really distressing for understandable reasons. It is okay to 'just go through the motions'--- at least you're moving! and it is okay to want more than that , and be upset by that at the same time. 

\-Remember recovery is possible. 

\-Remember there are hotlines to call if you feel you might resort to harming yourself or others. (Honestly it isn't usually the talking that helps, but the keeping myself occupied until the urge subsides that is useful.)

\-Of course try to access psychiatric and pharmaceutical care as well as counselling. There is medicine for this. I know it's really hard to access these service for many if not most though and I wish it was different.

1,"Holy shit... I can relate to some degree... I'm not diagnosed either, professionals say i have traits, no one believes me when i tell them I'm suffering so i have to show them by getting worse. At this point I don't want to get better, i want people to acknowledge I'm mentally ill; if i get better now, I'll never get the validation i crave. I want to prove I've always been having a really hard time, because i truly have, and yet i showed no one so now no one knows lol... For me also this is a competition of who's the most fucked up - like, give me some credits, i need the attention i always repelled. 

But that's about it. I don't fake suicide attempts, nor do i fake diagnoses to get prescribed meds i don't need. That makes you more toxic to yourself than me. In the competition of you and me, you win. You know, the fact that you get to the point to fake attempts and diagnoses shows how unwell you actually are. This fucked up mentality is a sign that you need help. And i really hope you can get it. Not wanting to get better is a trap. I wish we both get out of it.",lin_svo,y5ay6h
2,"Hi. Probably an unsolicited advice but I recommend actually getting the proper help you need. Talk to your psychiatrist about this because from what you said, at this point, it might be hard for you to extricate lies from reality. Please stop (if u haven't yet) taking meds that were prescribed for the illnesses/symptoms you faked. I get that you came from a harsh and unaccepting environment where a mental burden should be eminently deteriorating for it to be seen and heard. I understand where you're coming from and I'm sorry if some people under this post can't read your vent at a deeper sense (but u also can't blame them for being offended), but doing so (taking meds u dont need) will do u more harm than good. If you're having a hard time knowing what mental illness u actually have or what's been weighing down your mind, tell that to your psychiatrist or psychologist and have yourself examined again. From now, you have to be self-aware of what's real and what's not. Let's say you get attention for being mentally ill. Then they listen to you and put you in an institution & prescribe you meds; but nothing will work because some symptoms are not even there in the first place and only made to seek validation for something else. Remind yourself why you have to tell lies. It's to be heard and be validated that there's something wrong with you. And why do you want validation? MAYBE because you want them to know what's going on inside your mind and maybe even help you get through it. Yes you want them to believe you but aside from that, what's the point of faking other symptoms when you wanted YOUR struggles to be seen? I'm sorry but you're not helping yourself. And I'm sorry if ever this reply came out rude, but to exude a harsh tone isn't my intention.",BlitzkriegofAsgard,y5ay6h
3,"I used to lie a lot before being diagnosed too. I think I just had so many needs that were unmet (and I couldn't even identify them) that I subconsciously hoped others could fulfill. At some point, my web of lies was uncovered and it was the biggest shit show ever. I have emotionally hurt so many people and it took me a long time to learn to deal with the guilt, better myself, make amends and move on. 

I understand how you feel about lying, I have been there too. It is great that you recognize that this is an unhealthy and very harmful behavior and I urge you to find a way out of it. Be assured, it may feel like you can keep this up, but people will find out that you are lying. 

I wish I could take back all the harm I have caused and learn how to actually handle my emotions at an earlier point in life. I know right now it feels like you need to be sicker and sicker to get attention from others, but life is so much better on the other side. It feels 100% better to have people love and care for you because they want to, instead of having them care for you because they pity you.",RemoveAltruistic7458,y5ay6h
4,"hey, im 23 now and i felt the same way as a teenager. i hate to say it but for me these ‚Äútraits‚Äùhave only gotten more pronounced as ive gotten older (plus substance abuse which hasnt helped). i dont have an official diagnosis but ive had therapists tell me that they suspect bpd in the past. idk. at the end of the day here is my advice

it doesnt really matter if u get the diagnosis or not. if ur having these issues that are affecting ur day to day life then id just try to stay in therapy and practice using the tools u learn there. focus on taking care of urself, doing things u enjoy, practicing self awareness and active listening. 

try not to focus so much on trying to have it all figured out. nobody does really, and especially not when they are young. you wear urself out going thru the cycle of thinking you know all the answers, only to realize you don‚Äôt know much at all. 

and most importantly dont forget that at the end of the day you can‚Äôt be perfect. nobody can. people make mistakes but it‚Äôs how you learn from those mistakes that matters- the fact that you are being honest with urself about toxic behavior is definitely a good sign. dont stop being honest with yourself. it‚Äôs painful to admit that you‚Äôve hurt others but you CAN recognize it and choose to be more cognizant of the way you‚Äôre treating people in the future. 

best of luck to you",meanietemp,y5ay6h
5,"yo in the same situation. I mean, I‚Äôve never faked a suicide attempt or faked schizophrenia, but sometimes it feels like everything I do is just my brain being dramatic & wanting someone to care. sometimes this shit is genuinely not on purpose, but it‚Äôs good that u recognize ur intentions. ppl w this disorder are fr just hurting, and ik it feels like shit to feel like a pos, but u deserve help fr",Remote_Value_2523,y5ay6h

13,"You sound like me when I was 15 and still sound like me even now at 23. Use to fake suicide attempts then they started turning into real ones. Got better and made myself worse again. Had tons of psych wards trips as a teen and now as an adult. It‚Äôs not linear at all. I remember not crying for an entire year or so one year and now I cry every single day. Have gained and lost tons of friends over the years. Have had tons of failed relationships because I‚Äôm too toxic and I find people that are just as toxic or even worse. I relate to the needing to feel the most mentally ill. Sadly that was the only way my family would even pretend to care about me at all. 

I really don‚Äôt know what to say I wish I could be one of those adults that could comment ‚Äú don‚Äôt worry it gets better!‚Äù But it hasn‚Äôt for me and that‚Äôs just me being honest to you.

0,"Yup. I was prescribed Quetiapine about a year and a half ago. It takes a long time to smooth out in your system, for me it was months. It helped with my hallucinations, but overall it has not worked for me because a huge side effect has been tiredness. It helped taking it at night time to battle insomnia and I generally slept through the night, but getting up in the mornings was so difficult no matter how long before bed I took it. I was always tired throughout the day, and it was not ideal for my job and my studies. When I was taking quetiapine I felt so numb to my emotions and the tiredness exacerbated this a lot. A family member of mine is also on Quetiapine for BPD, and she has dealt with the same issues so I assume the tiredness is a fairly common side effect. She has been taking it on and off for 4 years and the tiredness has gone completely for her. 

I think every treatment is worth trying, including Quetiapine. You never know how you will respond to it, so its better to try and it not work out than to not try at all. For me personally, if I had been in a situation where I could have solely focused on my mental health and getting my medication balanced out, I think i would have still been taking it.

2,"The first few days of Effexor were rough for me. But after that it worked really well I had a weird reaction to it though, intense bruising all over my body. So I had to stop it and switch to Pristiq. If it wasn‚Äôt for that reaction I would have stayed on Effexor.",,w559zh
3,"I'm taking it you mean venlafaxine.  


Venlafaxine actually led me to a Bipolar II diagnosis, which did eventually lead to a BPD diagnosis as well. I was very euphoric at first when taking it, like, way too much, I remember thinking about how awesome and superior I am to everybody else, very grandiose thoughts, and my impulses were stronger. Then, all of a sudden weeks into taking it I had SEVERE breakdowns, with psychotic thoughts, such as, ""My friends want to kill me, why would anybody love me???"" and yeah, ended up going to urgent care in the middle of one of these, freaking the fuck out in the public lobby, then screaming in the exam room, and then got told by my doctor ""We really think you have a mood disorder, we need to get you to see a psychiatrist immediately."" Then yep, got diagnosed Bipolar at first, but months later, BPD was added to the list.  


I've heard of it working great on other people who are Bipolar, regardless of type, and I can assume the same case for BPD.",SheppinDoggo,w559zh
4,"Yeah I also had terrible terrible experience from taking this medication and I don't think I'll ever recover from it. It lost me almost 2 years of my life, so much brain fog, no emotion, no memories and long-term memory fogginess.",frizzybunny,w559zh
5,"thank you very much! my doctor made sure i come back frequently to discuss the effects, side effects and dosages. he told me as well, that at the beginning side effects are higher than the actual wished effect, but if it doesn‚Äôt help he‚Äòll try to find a solution. usually i‚Äòm not a fan of meds but at this point psychotherapy is not enough anymore. it‚Äòs getting really out of control again‚Ä¶",reo_blackcat,w559zh
6,yeah i heard about the bad withdrawal symptoms when getting off of it,reo_blackcat,w559zh

0,"I've been experiencing this for a few weeks now. My friend group is starting to drift apart and it caused me to completely unravel. I had a really strong personality maybe like 1.5 months ago, and now I have no idea who I am. I struggle to find meaning in my life and don't know what my values are. It's pretty tough right now. I'd be happy to talk more about this if you'd like. Currently, it's been really difficult watching my friends soar and become the people they want to be while I'm back to square 1 of knowing myself.",1hz997,16ac461
1,this was just a huge problem for me for the past couple of weeks,kondon0350,16ac461
0,"I'm straight ass sober too. Occasionally I'll eat a little nibble of an edible to help me stay awake, but thats like once a month. I'm able to regulate better and more often if I'm not chemically altering my brain otherwise. 


I do not want to depend on any sort of substance either but that is more due to a persistent ""what if the world ends"" paranoid ideation that I've had for like at least 10 years now.",trikkiirl,14u5d3q
0,"I've tried many different medications. I'm now on effexor. I was on your other medication before too. It's hard to say since you're looking to solve psychosis symptoms while I was trying to solve depression symptoms. I dont quite remember why I stopped taking seroquel.. but here's the thing. As I've told someone else earlier on this subreddit.. no one can really tell you if this medication will work for you. Each person is different. What works for one person may be detrimental and worsen someone else. It's really a gambling game when it comes to medications. Definitely keep an eye out for side effects and keep track of them. If you start getting suicidal thoughts or worsened thoughts, contact your doctor immediately. 

Also.. be very careful with effexor. I have a hate love relationship with it. It finally solved my depression and I've been in full remission for almost half a year... but, it's withdrawal symptoms are horrendous. It has a extremely short half life of somewhere between 4 to 5 hours (how long it takes for a medication in your body to reduce by half). Being just one hour late on your dose results in withdrawal symptoms. This is not a medication you want to be on super long term. There are horror stories online of people still with withdrawals years later off this medication. At the very least it's very obvious to you when you forget to take your dose.. as you'll start feeling super nauseous, get flu like symptoms, etc. This is the medication you want to make sure you always have enough supply. You don't want to run out. I once ran out and forgot to get a resupply. I had to wait a few days as they were out. I was getting vertigo, wanted to throw up all the time, felt sick, and started getting these brain zaps (basically you feel like you can feel your neurons shooting in your brain- it is so weird!). It became dangerous for me to go around by myself because everything was just spinning and I couldn't think at all. 

There's always hope! Be patient. Medications take time to work. Take it on time everyday without alcohol/drugs. If you find it's not doing anything for you or you're getting worse, it's time to switch!",sehwakim45,10enyg3
