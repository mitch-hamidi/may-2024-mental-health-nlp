0,Relationship with drugs?,"Hello my beautiful BPD fellas,  
I'm occasionally smoking weed and that's the only drug I've ever done. I'm planning to try ecstasy very soon, and LSD some time later.  
I occasionally have manic-like episodes, where I feel free of any negative emotionality, I'm truly present, hyperactive, impulsive, and over the moon happy for no reason. Smoking weed increases the frequency of that kind of episode, which is the motivation for my use. However, it makes me very paranoid, and I can barely sleep at night on the days I smoke, so I make sure to regulate my frequency of smoking.  
I'm curious about your relationship with drugs- do you use anything regularly, what have you tried so far and what symptoms did it trigger/ relieve you of, and maybe even share an experience that changed your life (for better or worse) with us!",1711837360.0,False,47,52,Own-Draft-324,None,1bru59s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1bru59s/relationship_with_drugs/
1,Why music feels like drugs,"Hi,

Does anyone have any interesting science info on why we feel the power of music more deeply than others? 

When I listen to music that I find absolutely beautiful, I literally feel as though I‚Äôve come up from a pill (just the chest feeling without the physical effects, but it‚Äôs exactly the same feeling). I understand certain parts of our brains responsible for emotional regulation are affected and diminished in size by the condition, is that why we also feel bliss more intensely?

Would be really interested in knowing, or being corrected if I‚Äôm wrong in the assumption that this is true to bpd.

Thanks

Edit: Absolutely love ALL the comments, sorry I don‚Äôt have time to respond to all. 
Love hearing everyone‚Äôs experience and knowing we‚Äôre a community out here and that it‚Äôs not just me that feels these things, and that there are some positives to such a chaotic condition that more mentally healthy people may never experience.
It seems a majority do agree (I‚Äôd say 90%?) that it is a BPD thing.
Funniest thing is all the people that have never thought about this ü§£ I‚Äôve been there too, for 20 odd yrs just plodding along thinking everyone was feeling the same ways I did. Ig it‚Äôs like the thought experiment where two people see the ocean a different colour but call it by the same name without ever finding out they‚Äôre different colours (or beetle in the box iykyk).

2,dating a drug dealer??,"hey um the title explains itself. my BPD is on the tamer side of the spectrum, ive never tried drugs but ive had a past with promiscuity and overspending and just recklessness in general. ive been seeing this guy and he‚Äôs perfect in every way for me. i dont know what ticks it but he calms my symptoms for some reason. maybe cause he‚Äôs neurodivergent too? he notices my symptoms and talks to me in dismissive way that makes me realize when im mad and angry that its the bpd its not me (he addresses my feelings when im actually mad though) i feel so seen with him and hes so affectionate and good to me even when he‚Äôs struggling with his own mental health but the only bad thing is that hes a dealer‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs not addicted but he gets high from time to time and i worry that i might get sucked into that world. he sometimes offers but i always say no cause i know bpd and drugs is a horrible idea. sometimes i think im better off alone cause our relationship wont end in a positive way but at the same time ive never felt this way towards a guy before, hes so easy to talk to. i dont have to mask or pretend to be someone im not. he reminds me of my best friend.

3,Just realized bpd makes me similar to hard drugs. ,"29M Lemme preface by saying I‚Äôve been in countless serious relationships (20 or more) and 5x that number in sexual/romantic endeavors and in all those experiences I notice a trend. I feel like I‚Äôm like the person of their dreams at the beginning, I say all the right things. I make them feel heard and really special (mind you I do actually mean it and care I.e. genuine) Get them hooked with tons of positive emotion and experience. There‚Äôs Intense romance and attraction. And then the second I have you hooked and I start getting attached myself that‚Äôs when I start splitting on my partner and overthinking things and questioning my partner about everything EVERY SINGLE DAY until it drains them and drains them and drains them and they‚Äôll get to a point where they sacrifice their own identity, and emotions and happiness because they just will do anything to try to fix me and the relationship and to be enough to reassure me and then theres no focus on what they feel anymore so they end up losing their personality and if it goes on for long enough then their personality will become whoever they need to be to make me feel better in that moment and that‚Äôs pretty much exactly the SAME SHIT THAT WAS DONE TO ME THAT CAUSED THIS BPD. So you pretty much drain them of themself, like HARD DRUGS. And thing is they know that I am toxic af for them and hurting them bad but they keep coming back cause they‚Äôre hooked. It‚Äôs really effed up. Like watching someone you love go down a spiral abusing drugs except YOU‚ÄôRE THE DRUGü•≤ then either they finally muster up the courage to kick you and stay clean or you nearly destroy them completely by taking all their energy and when they have none left to give you leave them.  I hate this :/ I hate hurting the people I love and myself. Why have I not gotten it right yet? I consistently tell myself to be better. That I‚Äôm not enough so I feel like I have a growth mindset, I‚Äôm really trying, but then the whispers say, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not really trying, if you were you‚Äôd be better already‚Äù BPD SUCKS. love you guys chin up we‚Äôre all gonna be ok <3",1715450908.0,False,139,32,dogg_wood,None,1cpnfz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cpnfz3/just_realized_bpd_makes_me_similar_to_hard_drugs/

6,Bpd and drug use,"Hey guys! 

I‚Äôm curious about people‚Äôs experiences with drug use, specifically coke, ket and weed. 

I find that I get addicted to things really easily but I still choose to do drugs.

A bit of context; 
First time I did any drug was on a trip to Amsterdam last December, this was planned, I had an edible and enjoyed the experience, but told myself I‚Äôd never do anything else.
But then on New Year‚Äôs Day, I did coke with random girls in the club bathroom. Got mad at myself the next day but moved on as I had no access to anymore, so I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be an issue. 
Then in march I did ket with random guys I met outside the club. Again was upset as I know I have an addictive personality but I forgave myself.
Three weeks ago, I smoked weed with my friends. Again weed was a good experience, I didn‚Äôt feel guilty, it kinda was normalised to me growing up so it doesn‚Äôt seem a big deal. 

But then I decided I wanted more weed, so I found myself a dealer. Bought the weed, then a few days later while drunk I impulsively asked the guy if he had coke, he did, I didn‚Äôt take it the week I purchased it.
The following week I‚Äôm out with my cousin, after our night out we go to a car park near her house and do some coke. It was BRILLIANT. I felt the energised, alert and care free for the first time in weeks. 
This was Friday just passed. I next planned to do coke this upcoming Friday. But I couldn‚Äôt wait, I couldn‚Äôt control the urge. I finished off the bag. 

And it felt amazing at first, but now I‚Äôm disappointed in myself.

I told myself I‚Äôd never fall down the path of doing drugs, that I‚Äôd never turn out like my parents. To taking them with randoms. To buying my own. To doing it alone.

And now I‚Äôm worried, it made me feel so good and I haven‚Äôt felt that way ever. I don‚Äôt want to fall down this path but at the same time I just want to feel normal? It made me feel normal. I want to be normal. And if this is how I can feel normal then I need to learn how to do it safer. But I don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôm always fully in something or I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs all or nothing with me you know?

Anyways, what‚Äôs your experience with using drugs? And have you found a way to do it safely?

Sorry for the vent, I don‚Äôt have non judgmental friends to talk to about this.",1715059753.0,False,1,6,venustheplanet101,None,1cm4d1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cm4d1w/bpd_and_drug_use/

9,Today marks 6 months I am drug free!!,"Needless to say I am very proud of myself and ecstatic I got here!

For the past 11 years, since I was 20yo I have been an every day marijuana smoker more often than not. I've been into detox facilities before and have had time off it but it was only ever a few weeks before I was back on it, apart from 9 months off it in 2018. I did well in 2018 and quit cigarettes for the last 3 of those 9 months but eventually fell to both again after struggling a bit and being around friends who are every day smokers.

The past 6 months have been the best 6 months of my life though! It is very different this time compared to quitting previously as I was diagnosed with BPD 2 weeks after quitting marijuana and I've changed so much of my life since. Just the fact of getting off weed and finding suitable full time work has changed my brain chemistry astronomically! Then add regular and healthy eating, regular exercise, finding my hobbies and my happiness, and finding the right therapy, and it's safe to say I feel and AM a completely different person to who I've ever been!

I dont reply when im upset because i dont wanna lash out on him and say something i dont mean. After 30 minutes, he texted me again but this time instead of his usual ""im sorry"" texts, he texted me that me ignoring him is abuse. That triggered me so badly and i ended up splitting on him and telling him im breaking up and blocked him. I took my time to breathe but he already relapsed (he's an addict but he was almost 6 months sober on feb 7) i unblocked him and i apologized and we made up. he only told me yesterday that he relapsed and hasnt touched it for 3 days now.

14,Tw.: mention of drugs,"I (21f) had to realize I have drug problems. I started to do speed at 19 to do better at exams. I started to realize I am kinda addicted to it so I quit doing it. After this I didn‚Äôt touch any kinda drugs. Also my therapist warned me on several occasions that I need to keep myself away from drugs because of my bpd. I mostly stayed away from them till she was my therapist but she gave birth so she quit being a therapist so I did what I thought the best for me

At the age of 21 I became part of a friend group where we did drugs every once in a month. Then I suddenly caught myself doing ecstasy every single weekend. Exam period at Uni came and I started to do speed again every single day. I ended up being violently sick. My kidneys enlarged and got inflamed and I fully fucked up my bladder. I‚Äôm currently under treatment for it. 
Plus I realized I have a damaged memory. I forget everything and I need to be reminded in order to remember.

I know I have to quit doing drugs because I‚Äôm destroying my body but Ngl it hurts like hell that I have to quit it. Nothing and no one ever made me feel that peaceful and happy than xtc did. I‚Äôm kinda devastated facing the fact that I have to quit it and I hate myself for being upset over this. 

How can I ease this for myself? Do I really have to fully quit it or can I still do it like once in a month?

i very rarely feel any sort of happy and it‚Äôs either dull or short lived. it‚Äôs just empty. i‚Äôve been trying to take better care of myself but it‚Äôs going to take a lot of time and effort every single day.

whether i‚Äôm able to get it or not based off my drug use (did coke within the last month) is one problem yeah, but my bigger worry is how hard it‚Äôll be to stop. absolutely nothing feels good without being inebriated. i‚Äôve accomplished so much this year and i feel nothing about it. i constantly remind myself to be grateful and mindful but still, no drive, no excitement. maybe my mental instability will prevent me from getting it too. but i have to try

20,A random drug I‚Äôm on for PCOS somehow helps my mood,"Hi, everyone! I want to share with you this experience I had in the hopes it might help others manage their symptoms. For context, I come from a medical background, work as a paramedic, and suffer from a lot of chronic physical illnesses like Hypothyroid, Hashimoto‚Äôs, and PCOS. I am also AuADHD and have BPD and CPTSD. Early in 2018, I asked my PCP to run relevant bloodwork for diagnostic markers for PCOS as I‚Äôve been dealing with the telltale symptoms since my menstrual cycles began; I‚Äôm lucky that I‚Äôve found someone who listens to me and doesn‚Äôt dismiss my medical and lived experience, and was formally diagnosed. One of the medications I was placed on to manage excess fluid retention was Aldactone, which is an anti-androgen medication, which is a precursor for testosterone to be created by your body. Anywho, about a few weeks into taking this medication, I was noticing a weird sense of chill, like a calm I never experienced before. My emotions felt like there was now a ceiling; a high ceiling still, but still a limit as to how high they could go (or low). I found a study that showed that Aldactone had mood stabilizing effects for a sample size of bipolar patients; the study is too small to base anything off of however, and would need to be repeated on a massive scale and tracking outcomes over time to see substantial results to translate into becoming a normal part of care. But I realized that one of the potential reasons why it was making my moods a bit more manageable was because I was always experiencing a hormone imbalance as a baseline. So it was like experiencing life with PMS AND BPD, and in place of PMS, I experienced PMDD before and during my menstrual cycles. Inhibiting excess testosterone production allowed me enough relief from my symptoms to be able to more manageably work through my thought processes. I say this in the event any of you have existing hormonal imbalances to get it checked out, because, and I say this as a healthcare worker and as a patient, we often are overlooked for medical causes or exacerbating causes, for our symptoms if we have pre-existing mental health diagnoses, or if our actions can be explained away with MH diagnoses. I‚Äôm not saying we don‚Äôt have BPD; I‚Äôm saying that there can be other reasons, medical reasons, that make your symptoms even more severe than they otherwise could be. 

Another treatment I highly recommend is the STELLA procedure that is now being utilized to treat CPTSD and it works with borderline symptoms as well. It essentially ‚Äúimpairs‚Äù the connection between the stellate ganglion and your amygdala, which doesn‚Äôt work correctly if you‚Äôve existed with untreated CPTSD‚Äîby ‚Äúimpairing‚Äù this now hyperactive connection, you end up with having a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range and severity of emotions as opposed to emotional ranges that break the sound barrier lol. That was where I was at after working through all of 2020 in one of the hardest hit metropolitan areas in the country during the initial surges of the COVID-19 pandemic. I was an absolute wreck and was actively suicidal by early 2021. I went to Chicago to get the procedure at the STELLA clinic and I noticed a change like immediately. The results can last anywhere between a few months to years and people often get repeat procedures. It‚Äôs a bit cost prohibitive but it saved my life; my results unfortunately lasted three months but it was enough time to get relief from crushing despair and misanthropy and I realized that I was standing in my own way with my emotional responses. During this time, I was not on Aldactone, I was just raw dogging my hormonal imbalance, BPD, a LOT of new trauma and an abusive relationship. Im on Aldactone now and I‚Äôm back to feeling a baseline calm . I still have symptoms of BPD and I‚Äôm not in remission, but HOLY FUCK, guys, has it made a difference. I‚Äôm saying all of this for the folks who are not able to be consistent in recovery because of the severity of their symptoms and feel like they‚Äôve tried everything. This is not for the folks where regular DBT is working for and they‚Äôre managing just fine without any additional changes or treatments. I don‚Äôt want to gatekeep this information because it literally saved my life and the trajectory of my future; if there‚Äôs a chance it can help anyone else, I want to share it.

I was so angry and disappointed, i ended up blocking him. At the end, he couldn‚Äôt get his hands on the drug, and then he told me how sorry he was for all of that.

24,My FP found my drugs,"I havent been very ‚Äúcheery‚Äù these days. My friends who know me have told me im their perky friend whos always ready to lend a helping hand. Thats just for background i guess. More background incoming, for months i been doing coke coz i rationalized that drinking was too sloppy and always got my bf (THE fp) upset. Hes very kind tho and understanding, but after 5 years together and me still having alcohol as my maladaptive coping mechanism‚Ä¶ it does get tiring, even for him. For more background i used to cut and steal, binge and purge even n shit and have way more threats of suicide, since then i‚Äôve been told by family to ‚Äúfess up‚Äù and ‚Äúsimply DO better‚Äù. For anyone in this sub, the cliche holds water. It IS easier said than done. So here we are at present day and i‚Äôve been doing coke very sneakily for the past few months. At work, at home alone, out socializing w friends and family. It just doesnt get me aggressive like alcohol. I dont do much coke anyways it just takes the edge off but still satisfies the impulsivity im prone to, as well as yknow thinking that in the long run, this will prolly kill me or give me a heart attack one day. Also its so damn numbing. I dont tweak on it im just so calm and numb. I can mask longer and idgaf but im not hostile and spiteful like how i normally am, alcohol or not

This morning, FP wakes up and does his round of morning chores while i go feed the cat and just then my cute lil coke holder/container falls out of my pants pocket while hes arranging my mess from coming home from work yesterday. He didnt even explode. At first i guess coz of shock he laughed and said ‚Äúi found your coke!‚Äù And i just stare at him. It was a very good talk but wow do i suck and wow is he great, i dont deserve this kindness. 

Im very lost and confused. I cant drink, i cant cut, i cant overspend and steal, and i cant unalive.

When I got my wisdom teeth removed, I explained my situation and they allowed me to have what they essentially called 'the pill form of morphine' and although I didnt feel much pain. I wasn't tired or incoherent at all like many others would be. It's the same with most other heavy meds: oxys, xannax, gabapentin, ativan, and a few others that people claim to feel ""high from"" I havent taken any of them often enough for that to be the reason, many of them were prescribed to me previously for assumed ptsd and a spinal surgery I had. Which makes me wonder if this high tolerance is from my nerves being damaged, being prescribed medications so young (15-17 I am now 20), or the high stress and tension someone feels with BPD. 

This is a personal question, but also open for discussion. I know someone could easily answer with a ""yes"" or ""no"", but I'm also curious as to what substances may have affected others differently compared to their peers who don't have this disorder.",1672284381.0,False,2,3,lillie-the-lillith,None,zxubgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/zxubgl/drug_tolerances/
28,My fear of being forgotten **CW FOR DRUG ABUSE**,"        When I was younger, around 10, my mom would go into her bathroom/garage and just sit there for hours getting loaded.

I always beg people (specifically my boyfriend) to not forget me when they‚Äôre doing something as simple as playing a game. I just feel like they‚Äôre gonna never come back, and I‚Äôll just be alone.

     Is there anyway to combat this fear?  The only thing I can think of is checking in with people a lot. I say hi to my mom and siblings and text and call when they‚Äôre gone for awhile.

31,me being a drug addict causes serious identity issues,"Sometimes when I take it too far, I‚Äôll look at myself from an outsiders perspective and panic at the fact that they‚Äôd see me as a junkie.

Ironically people who don‚Äôt know me well generally seem shocked, and i mean like in disbelief when they find out I‚Äôm experienced with drugs at all. I‚Äôve been called innocent too many times to count (at times in an almost creepy way lol). I don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôm perceived and find innocent an oddly comforting trait to associate with myself as compared to how I see myself.

Anyways to the point, I feel there is a very thin line between drug use being perceived as either desirable or pathetic. A part of me has always been drawn to the lifestyle of a ‚Äútragic but beautiful‚Äù drug addict yet when reality hits I become overwhelmed with guilt and fear. 

One of my issues is that I will forget that people see it negatively. I would never judge someone for the drugs they‚Äôve done and am honestly intrigued by people who have done a lot of drugs so I forget to be ashamed. 

Well on the other hand I can only feel shame and disgust. In the moment it‚Äôs like a montage of every drugged out fiend like thing i‚Äôve done. It‚Äôs even worse when I‚Äôm actively on some sort of bender. There‚Äôs no in between. I either do drugs without a care or become disturbed that anyone knows i‚Äôve ever touched a drug.

Getting diagnosed made it so much easier for me to understand what‚Äôs going on inside my head everyday.

34,fp feels like a drug,"my fp and i are in a long distance relationship as he finishes his last year of college. he came home for winter break for over a month and it was pure bliss. we spent as much time together as we could - sleeping over at each others places, going out on dates, celebrating new years together, spending time with each others families, endless cuddling and movie marathons, etc etc etc. 

he left today to return to school and i have so many emotions. saying goodbye is so hard, it truly feels like death by 1000 cuts. i always cry saying goodbye, which i feel embarrassed about. this whole weekend, i knew he would be leaving so i had lots of crying episodes just thinking about how much i‚Äôd miss him. i still struggled with my fear of abandonment, but it was easier to control those thoughts with him here in person. 

now that he‚Äôs gone, i feel this intense dread and depression returning to my life. it honestly feels like withdrawals and crashing from a drug. i loved every minute of him being here, we didn‚Äôt argue at all, had mature and meaningful conversations, and shared so much quality time together. watching him drive away felt like a piece of my heart being ripped out. 

i feel so silly, considering that i know i‚Äôll see him in a month or two - but i start tearing up thinking about all the time without him. 

i love him so much but i hate living like this. i want to be happy and stable without him, and have things to look forward to besides him. i don‚Äôt want him to be the best thing in my life, because it absolutely guts me when he has to leave. i want him to be an extra sprinkle of happiness on my life, not the only joy i experience.

40,I think I use people like a drug,"It's like I'm always distressed and so uncomfortable that I obsess over anything that can give relief from that. I compare it to always drowning and trying to keep my head above water. I'll discover something that can distract from pain and sadness and anger, and give the feeling of being able to breathe easy for a little while. So I overindulge in it like a drug. Validation and intimacy from another person can feel like that too. I'm so preoccupied with not drowning that a person can only be really useful to me if they're helping with that. No one should waste their energy always trying to lift me above water because it's no ones problem but mine. But it makes me lack interest in relationships when they don't meet that unquenchable need.

 I think that's why I dive into the honeymoon phase with people so strongly. Like I'm feeding off all the dopamine from the excitement and newness, getting lost in all the idealization and infatuation with someone and getting to feel relief from how horrible I normally feel all the time. I feel like I'm literally feeding off the good feelings from the person like a drug. Because it feels like I'm not drowning and struggling and gasping for air when things are good with that person. I guess that's why as soon as it becomes less about fun and more about work, I cant keep up. Because then I'm no longer getting that same amount of dopamine. Theres less idealization as I get to know the person, less infatuation, and less distractions from my own distress. I go back to feeling like I'm drowning and being preoccupied with doing whatever I can for air. 

It's like no matter how much I love someone, my need for air ends up taking priority. My need to feel relief from constant distress. It's like almost everything I do is centered around that need. If they cant meet that need then it's like I have no choice but to seek it elsewhere.

I'm starting to believe this is the reason a long term relationship will never work for me. Because how can I be there for my partner if they start to drown when I'm always drowning? And if they aren't helping to distract from my pain then I get agitated or upset or even angry because its like going back to drowning and being vulnerable all over again. Sometimes those negative feelings will be misdirected towards them because it feels like they're the cause of the pain coming back, when really it's just the initial fun and excitement and novelty fading, no longer acting as a shield against the constant distress. It was like being lifted above the surface and breathing easily, and naturally overtime things get serious and that person cant keep holding me above water. So I just go back to drowning. It's not that person's fault. It's a problem from within.

Maybe the best thing for me is to stay noncommittal. I'm the most stable when single because I'm trying to find healthy ways of staying above water instead of obsessively climbing all over another person for air. I feel like all I could really do is casually date, enjoy the first fun moments, then move on before things get weird. Of course being honest with the person about intentions beforehand.

54,I think my Fp was only nice to me when he was on drugs,"Im struggling badly with trying to unattach from my Fp. Im really taking time to sit and reflect about certain things. One thing that I remember happening a few months ago is that he was extremely nice to me this one day, like nicer than usual. I found it odd. Later on in the night he told me that he took ecstasy earlier in the day. I‚Äôm not familiar with drugs so I had to google the effects of that and then everything made sense. He was extremely euphoric and loving. Now thinking about this has started to make me think that he may have taken this every time he was extremely ‚Äúloving‚Äù like this. His normal mood is kinda irritated/ easily explosive because he has a lot of paranoia and some other mental health issues. But there was specific days where he was like over the moon and euphoric. 

This made me start to think even further back. There was a few other very specific days I remember him acting like this. One of the days he told me he had only drank earlier in the day. I‚Äôve seen drunk people because I literally grew up around tons of them, he didn‚Äôt really seem drunk now that I think about it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs making me think he took something else that day. He kinda was acting how he did when he took the ecstasy a few months ago. He was extremely loving and clinging to me and giving me tons of kisses and hugs obsessively. There was also multiple times throughout knowing him where he would constantly be in and out of rehabs and he would lie and say it was just for weed. He told me about how he use to do Xanax and percocets and basically every damn drug in the book a couple years back but I feel like he was lying and was STILL doing these. 

This is all just making me so sad. I guess I thought I knew him when I really didn‚Äôt. I guess every nice thing he said to me was fake. Im trying to reflect and see the REAL him because there‚Äôs obviously some reason I‚Äôm not unattaching and still hanging on. I just want it to stop. I‚Äôve seen how mean he can be and we aren‚Äôt on talking terms right now. We‚Äôve had these huge arguments in the past and sometimes he‚Äôs the most emotionally abusive person I‚Äôve ever met. I also am thinking about all the times he only talked to me when he needed money for drugs. Why couldn‚Äôt he just treat me nicely?  Our relationship was so weird‚Ä¶ hot and cold‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs someone I want in my life in the future. He has issues that I‚Äôm just not able to help him with even though I really badly wanted to and I don‚Äôt see anything improving between us.

56,Boundaries around medication/drugs,"Hi mates, I (34M) love my pwBPD (33F) very much. She has come so far in our 11 years together and has worked harder on herself than anyone know.  I love her big emotions, her honesty, her openness. I have always been pretty good at keeping boundaries in place for how we treat each other, which helps her to feel safe with me.

One area where I‚Äôm starting to struggle with though, is her use of weed/alcohol/prescription meds. Her use of each has slowly escalated over the past 12 months, to the point where when I finish work, I go to talk to her each day and her voice is audibly slurred/affected. She is waking up tired every day, and her mood can be quite affected (especially on days after alcohol use). She is pretty careful not to overdo it on one drug, but seemingly is affected by a different mix of all three each night at the moment.

Because I have always tried to have boundaries around this kinda stuff before, I have unfortunately nagged her a bit about her usage, so now it‚Äôs very difficult for me to bring up with her without it instantly becoming a bit heated. She used to ask me to help her with this but I might‚Äôve overstepped into controlling territory I feel (I had done things like hide prescription meds and dispensed them to her when needed at her request), so i wound it back but now it feels as if it‚Äôs slowly snowballing.

She‚Äôs had a pretty rough time of it recently with work/health matters, so she explains this is why she‚Äôs used a bit more recently. but I‚Äôm worried for both her long term health and our relationship because I find it very hard to communicate with her genuinely when she‚Äôs visibly affected by something so often, and also the hangovers lead to bad moods a lot essentially.

I‚Äôm no saint either - I‚Äôm sober these days but had my own issues with alcohol a few years back. Does anyone have any advice? Do I I just ride this out until she‚Äôs had enough?

63,Good coping strategies for extreme paranoia without drugs?,"Hi guys!
I have BPD and a major symptom I experience is paranoia which has resulted in psychotic episodes before. My mood swings and anger issues are atrocious and unfortunately I started using codeine to regulate my moods as a young teen (my mum was an addict and she didn‚Äôt realise the severity of codeine dependency, she was extremely depressed and struggled to deal with my outbursts so would give me codeine to calm me down). This lasted years until I unfortunately decided to try Xanax and I thought I was invincible and immune to addiction despite the fact I already had a problem with codeine I was in complete denial about for years. Although I only use over the counter codeine now after my mum passed from her addiction, I have taken Xanax for years. I am not prescribed Xanax, I am in the UK where it is not available here. I have been on an array of anti depressants and nothing regulates my moods and paranoia like Xanax. After a near fatal overdose in May after progressing to harder drugs like oxys, I went cold turkey, dealt with the withdrawals etc but one thing I noticed is that I have extreme anxiety to the point the thought of something as simple as showering made me have a panic attack and paranoia, something I was told was part of the withdrawal process however it never went away so I started using Xanax again in smaller doses. I am currently sober due to difficulty in sourcing and the paranoia is so bad I‚Äôve had to use Valium as a substitute. I don‚Äôt want to live a life dependent on Xanax just to get through the day. I‚Äôve discussed mood stabilisers with my doctors which they reluctantly agreed to let me try if I do several drug tests that all come back clean, as they are aware I have a problem with drugs. The problem is my appointments are 8-16 weeks apart and as a university student in my third year I can‚Äôt afford to deal with this sort of anxiety and paranoia during a vital year for me if I came off the drugs so I told them straight I‚Äôd be unable to do that and they outright dropped me from the service, so I‚Äôm currently unmediated and without therapy for my untreated BPD. I can‚Äôt be prescribed anti anxiety drugs for obvious reasons either. I‚Äôm sorry this is a long post but I‚Äôm absolutely sick of being known as a ‚Äúpillhead‚Äù, being out of it 24/7 and unable to remember milestones due to the Xanax. If anyone who‚Äôs had a similar experience to me I‚Äôd be so grateful if you could give me some advice, I don‚Äôt want to end up like my poor mother and I want to be able to get through the day sober without the constant emotional turmoil.

Throughout my life, I've had some physical health issues, and surgeries, that have privileged me to some of the most addictive painkillers prescribable.

I have watched some of these painkillers destroy, of hurt, people that I cared a great deal about.

But I never got addicted. When it was time to taper off, I had no problem. When it was time to stop, I had no issue besides lingering pain. Occasionally, I still need to request a bottle of some of these medicines, but they last me well past multiples of the prescribed term.

I have even tried illicit drugs (I'm a sucker for peer pressure, lmao) and tbh, never even really felt a high. I never felt a draw to go back. 

Whereas, I am extremely addicted to praise and attention. I used to play online games because I was good at them, and the praise that group after group gave me was ridiculous. I'd join failing groups and people knew my name and would be relieved.

74,Anti psychotic drug helps,"CW: Self-Harm

So, about a year ago, I was desperate. I was self harming every day and I was ready to die. I had nowhere to turn. During a random search, I found a website which dealt with BPD. One of the things it suggested was that anti-depressant medication can actually make BPD *worse*. It said that there had been at least one trial which had positive results swapping antidepressants for anti-psychotics.

So, I approached my doctor and raised the question ""could we please try this medication swap?""

I was put onto Quetiapine 100mg and the change has been huge. While I still think about suicide and self harm, I am now better able to fight the urges. I'm more stable emotionally too.",1600642783.0,False,14,2,IrrevocablyDamaged,None,iwocmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/iwocmt/anti_psychotic_drug_helps/

86,Drugs and BPD?,"Over the past year or so I have come to face the reality of having BPD.

Last year I went through a lot of anxiety and depression, but went to therapy for a couple months and since have been doing slightly better, at least when it comes to anger and depression. I still have bouts of rage or episodes, but I have better control of their outcomes.

Recently though I went to a rave (edc), and have come back with the worst depression, anxiety and over all wanting to end it all. Before I left I was completely fine mentally and doing well. I do always have difficulty with my emotions no matter, whether it be expressing them or shutting down and dissociating. But after this weekend, I've been raging, yelling, and even cussing/insulting my boyfriend of 2 months.

He's the love of my life and I've known him since I was 16. We have finally started dating and this was the first time he's seen me like this. I felt absolutely horrible and only after did I think of my BPD again. In the moment I truly thought he was making me feel that way or it was his fault. Afterwards I was like holy crap why did I overreact like that. I can't believe he's even forgiven me but I feel horrible and heart broken that I treated him this way and let myself not have control over how I spoke to him (which is what therapy helped me with). Although obviously because I stopped going, the therapy I had last year for a short time can't help me forever.

This isn't the first time I've rolled (mdma) and every time it has effected me this way. I get very depressed after and lose sense of my identity completely. I don't even feel like the same person. Eventually my temperament does settle down and I go back to normal, but has anyone else experienced this? Because edc is 3 days and altogether I took about 3 pills, I'm a complete mess. I've been fine before just raving for a night taking one pill, but I feel hopeless and suicidal right now after taking 3 over the past few days. 

I've made a promise to myself and my boyfriend that I will never do this again. It's not worth it and I never want to lose my temper at him again. I feel like I'm in a haze and can't think clearly. My head has felt constantly foggy and although I'm still very much in love with him, I feel very distant even though I don't want to be. I almost feel like I'm in a state of constant dissociation this week...except I'm not trying to be.

Can anyone help me through this?

98,Drug use that coincides w/ BPD?,"Hey, this will probably sound terrible but here goes\~

I just learned of my BPD yesterday, as a guy who matches with a 9/9.  And this comes off as both of a relief as I now know what the problem actually is, as this has been the primary driving force behind much of my heavy drug use.  Personally, the substances I've done up until now have (embarrassingly) been: nicotine, booze, pot, MDMA, Barbs, Ice, ketamine, cocaine, acid, shrooms, speed, and opioids.  I'm not proud but just appalled that I've done all of this... as I would do so to help me survive without having FP in my life.  But I wonder how common this is for those with BPD.

Is this something any of you can relate to?  Be it actual drugs/alcohol or something else that is similarly addictive?  

I imagine that success with a FP would help alleviate engagement with drugs, or similarly addictive habits moreso than anything else.  It could sound like a far-fetched fantasy, but I do sincerely believe that the love of a cherished human being will virtually kill the need for drugs, or any other similar coping mechanism altogether.

Here I am at 26 living with my parents, who hate me, and I equally hate them more. I tried getting on social media as ""therapy"" but I've only made a fool of myself for the last two months, which annoys me a lot. I'm starting a new job on friday, I got fired last friday. I am 26, I've been working since 18. I've had 9 fucking jobs. I've been fired most of the time. It's the thing in my head that makes me snap and other people get scared or simply don't give a fuck because money is more important to them, and apparently I'm an obstacle to their money and promotions. Which makes me consider, I hate my career. I simply studied the same thing as my dad and my dad has a failing career himself, living off my mom which doesn't earn much.

I'm ""living like a king"". Mom won't let me wash my clothes, or dishes, or cook in her kitchen. She threatens to kick me out of I do, or call police. My mom is crazy, legit crazy, but coherent. Just like me. Unemployment due to mental health over the years is what depresses me the most. Not being able to sustain myself.

And what do I sustain myself for? Therapy and meds? Let's be honest, that doesn't work, there's no cure. Hundreds of years ago they were giving insulin induced comas to people like us. And shit hasn't improved much. Then what do I have left? Friends, women, partners? Everyone hates me for good reason. **Pleasure** it is.

I have been high for most days this past year on all kinds of drugs and since quarantine hit and i've been employed and very alone. i can feel my body getting more and more fucked being unable to cope with the constant high, but then the second im sober, my entire mental health comes crashing down in the worst way and i cant deal with that. I have no motivation to get out of this state but i start my third year again in october (after deferring this past year due to mental heath) and now i just have no idea how tf to get back to normal functioning. 

i just dont know why im so fucking in love with self-destruction.

i have no motivation to get my life together when im high, but when im not high my mental health is shitty and just instantly breakdown.

105,Really mad about drugs???,"I really don't know where else to post this or if this is even related to my bpd.. IDK but It's bothering me a lot so I'd like some input from others that may understand aha.

I have a lot of people in my life that are drug positive and actively do drugs like smoke weed, do coke, take hallucinogens and what not. I'm pretty drug positive too like I'm whatever about it, it's their life they find it fun whatever u know. I've also tried some stuff before myself and I had fun but everything messes with my brain so easily so I don't really do much of anything because I'm scared of completely losing it aha. 

Besides that though, despite the fact that I genuinely don't care what other people do (not in a ""If they wanna fuck up, its their choice"" kinda way, I don't think anyone is less than for doing drugs and I never will because it sounds fun and why would I hate fun??), I find myself constantly getting horribly angry and upset and sad when people I love (my boyfriend, brother, sister, close friends) always talk about how much they love smoking week or dropping acid or whatever. No matter how much I know I don't care about the act of it, I can't help but get really irrationally angry???


It's like my own genuine thoughts are drug positive and happy for others when they do something they think is fun and interesting, I am fine with the people I love doing that because they enjoy it, but my shit brain gets so fucking mad and upset that I end up getting upset and I start freaking out on them and I can't explain why because I really don't mind it??? 

I personally really don't do anything of the drug sort because I'm scared of my brain getting more fucked up than it is, smoking weed makes me feel the worst anxiety and I feel like I lose my grip on reality way more than I already do when I'm sober so I choose not to do drugs but I'm not straight edge or against usage in anyway. I have a lot of trauma around drugs as well so that always kept me away from trying anything. My mom ditched us for 12 years because she started partying with friends that got her into drugs and accidentally drugged me when i was 13 when she came back into my life, at 17 i was taken advantage of while stoned out of my mind, my older sister that i looked up to would leave all time growing up because she too was into partying and doing drugs, and my little brother who I used to call my best friend is dependent on weed now and really doesn't go out much anymore which is sad to see because he used to be so full of life and loved hanging out with me. I don't doubt that all that contributes to me staying away from drugs but I don't care what other people do so why do I still flip out when someone I know talks about doing or trying drugs???


It's really frustrating because I'd love to listen to their experiences because they find it fun but I cant because I just get mad and upset and it ruins their funs and makes me feel like a jerk. 

Like me seeing people do drugs and knowing that my boyfriend and friends like getting high or whatever does not bother me but if they talk about it I get soooo mad and I can't help it.

This probably made no sense I really dont know how else to put anything of this. I'm just tired of being mad all the time for stuff that doesn't really bother me. Literally my boyfriend talking to me about how much he loves to smoke weed freaks me out and I get so mad and sad that I'll start crying and feel like he's gonna lose himself which is fucking stupid.

116,"I miss drugs, despite the horrible withdrawals","Sometimes I really fucking miss drugs. Granted, crystal and BPD is deffinitely not a good combination, and I remember the absolute insanity I fell into, but to be quite honest, when I got high, for those few upcoming hours I felt amazing. 

My mind wasn't scattered all over the place, I had energy to pursue my passion (art), and I loved everything. 

Painting for almost two days without a break, not bothered by anything. Tattooing volunteers, getting paid for it, sewing a hand bag from my old faux leather jacket just because I had an idea. 
Doing all these things without getting bored, anxious, tired, not giving up halfway through. 

I miss it. I miss it soo fucking much. 

I try to remember those days when I overdosed due to never knowing when to fucking stop. Or the two weeks every other month when I've hit the bottom, and couldn't get out of bed (which was literally a pile of clothes I couldn't be bothered to put into my closet. My real bed was somewhere under a mountain of clutter). 

I try to remember the holes I've dug into my skin. Bleeding, burning, itching. My nails, purple and numb. My acid sweats. Everything hurt. 

Maybe it's the BPD, maybe it's just a regural post-addiction mindset, but even though I remember the bad, I miss the good even more. 

Sorry if this doesn't really belong here. I just... can't talk about this kind of shit with anyone.

117,What is your experiences using drugs with BPD?,"I'm a 21 year old Male,  and just got diagnosed with BPD a week ago.  

I started to get symptoms all the way back in 3rd grade,  but it really started to kick into gear around when I was 12 and my mom got cancer and died. I attempted suicide and ended up in the ER and was put on an antidepressant for a while. 

I always thought I was just really irritable and over emotional.  Neither I or my family thought much about it beyond that.  

Anyways

When I was 11 or so,  i got really fascinated reading about people's experience using drugs.  I would spend hours reading into all the different ones out there. Mostly psychedelics. 

When I was 13, someone offered me a dab (marijuana concentrate) and I got beyond high and immediately fell in love with it. 

It wasn't until i was 14 and figured out where to get my own.  I almost immediately became a daily smoker. It really helped level out my emotions and make me not hate myself so much.  I still smoke it almost daily.  

Then after a year of daily smoking,  I got my hands on some LSD. Holy fuck did I fall in love with it,  and eventually shrooms too. I would trip every week or 2, usually at a moderately high dosage.  This continued on until I was about 17, where i toned my use way down. I've tripped over 100 times and I just turned 21.

Tripping seemed to help me a lot. It made me much happier,  less emotional,  and my outlook on life and myself improved dramatically.  But this didn't last very long.  

I also used MDMA once in a while and it was fun.  It didn't help me much though,  it was just enjoyable as I could have 6 hours of pure happiness.  I actually abused MDMA a couple months ago because I gave no fucks and was in a really dark place in my life.  I took it like 3 times in a week.  It made my BPD a lot worse,  and it still isn't back to where it was before. 

Now the biggest ones I notice I have issues with are alcohol and xanax.  Especially xanax though.  I always took enough to get blacked out. It made me extremely irritable,  angry,  sad,  and I pushed my 70 year old dad into a wall.  Kicked holes into walls.  Broke keyboards. I could go on and on.  It led up to me overdosing on 40mg in school,  causing a massive scene and I dropped out at the end of senior year of high school.  I went home and later that night,  while still incredibly intoxicated,  took LSD and drove to my friend's house (yeah surprised no one died that night)  because he texted me if I wanted to trip and come chill.  Told me everything that happened. 

Alcohol isn't nearly as bad for me though.  But I drink an insane amount whenever I can.  I drink almost 2 handles of vodka a week. It really helps me feel happier and puts me in a good mood,  but then I'll start an argument with my (very supportive) gf over the smallest stupidest thing and it'll turn into a huge fight about everything. This last year I've been very drunk and almost killed myself at least 10 times. 


Also got really into adderall and even meth. I'd go on benders for days.  It really fucked me in the long term,  and I'm never touching it again.

Vaping nicotine helps a lot when I get panic attacks

121,BPD & drug abuse in early teens,"hi. so this is my first post, and i'm basically gonna tell you my story along with asking some questions i really need answered, and maybe see if anyone else has experienced this. i'm currently 16, my 17th birthday is a week from now. recently i received a diagnosis of emerging BPD - i'm not 18 so it is labelled as an emerging disorder. i also have ADHD, which combined with BPD makes me extremely volatile and scarily impulsive at times - i've had issues with self harm since the age of 9, and abused drugs since around my 14th birthday, so for three years.

on new year's eve 2017 (going into 2018) i thought it would be a real clever idea to take 500ug of LSD - this was my first ever trip. long story short, i tried to kill myself and multiple other people, had the most intense ego death experience i think i've ever heard of, and get the police called on me. i ended up in the resuscitation ward in hospital and i was there for the night, it was insane. i have no idea what really happened but i was stuck in a 36 hour trip.

since then, i've not really had any negative mental health issues besides ones that were already present, however recently i've been experiencing weird hallucinations. i'll see things like people or animals in my peripheral vision and theyll be moving around but when i go to look, they aren't there. the thing is, this isn't just a normal ""oh, i thought there was something over there"" kind of thing, because when it happens i'm convinced that it was real. the other day i was sat at my desk and i saw my cat come into my room and walk to my bed, but then i looked up because i could swear the door was shut so i don't know how he could've got in, and there was no cat - i searched the whole room but nope, nothing. there's other things too, like thinking everything is twinkling or much brighter than usual. man idk what's going on.

that's not the only thing though, i've been really fucking paranoid too. its as if i know something bad will happen to me and there's no way to change that thought, so i'm suspicious of everything all the time.

thing is, i'm struggling to see why this is happening, is it because of LSD, or something else? it just hasn't happened before. i've also been getting migraines on and off recently. the obvious answer is stress but i don't know why i'd be stressed...

i've struggled with substance abuse recently too, i've been doing shitloads of ketamine just to feel numb and forget things, and even though it makes me dissociate i much prefer it to being aware and feeling alive because that shit just hurts too much. i think the worst thing ive been having recently is intrusive thoughts. i'll be cooking food and my brain will just stop for a second and go ""chop off your arm."" there isn't even a ""what if"" side to it anymore, its just a straight, imperative statement. fighting the physical and mental urges to act on them is close to impossible too, and i don't know why that is because i don't wanna chop off my fucking arm but apparently some alter presence in my head and body does. jesus this barely makes sense i'm sorry.

122,Anyone with a drug habit here who has used drugs to dig for inner pain & self exploration?,"A few years ago when I started taking party drugs I quickly noticed that I seemed to be drawn to an aspect of it that most others wanted to avoid. When the effects of amphetamines, MDMA etc  start to wear off, naturally most people try to delay the comedown by taking more, but not me. Often when I got back home from partying I would sit down on my couch and use my state of mind to focus on myself and my inner world. I started writing things down a lot. Apparently something inside me had realized that the trip and especially the ‚Äúcomedown blues‚Äù helped me see and feel things, that usually were protected by thick inner walls, and now it wanted more of it. Sleep deprivation further helped break down those walls.

For a year or so I did this a lot. I digged deeper and deeper, I wanted to find and feel those nasty things that were inside me, and hell I did. I felt a lot of pain, fundamental pain, pain that I thought was going to kill me, pain that made me black out. It still was addictive (the process, not the drugs) and I‚Äôve learned a lot about my condition and my inner world. I must‚Äôve written hundreds pages of notes and texts.

Was it healthy? I have no idea. Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid that maybe those things I‚Äôve felt weren‚Äôt real. That I believed to find out things about myself but actually only found out things about drug induced psychosis or something.

These days I only do it once every few months, just to get a little taste of that ‚Äúbeing able to see‚Äù. But I think I‚Äôve actually dug out everything there is to dig out for me right now. I know there‚Äôs still much more and that I have only slightly touched the edges of what I believe are the roots of all trauma and pain inside me, but that‚Äôs something that has to wait for the right time and right place in a therapy.

I‚Äôve never heard of anyone doing this, at least not with those kind of drugs. LSD and mushrooms are much more common for self exploration but I‚Äôm scared of psychedelics because I think they could expose me to things I am not yet ready to see.

Or it¬¥s a virtual middle finger to my spiritual, idealistic self and wanting to self destruct/be numb via drugs like weed, alcohol and basically see how far I can push myself in a double life. appearing like a responsible person who has their shit together and shock people by how reckless I am actually. Let my life spin out of control and alternate between not caring and being hyper from stimulation. 

Or third option. The rational way. Getting better via therapy, taking meds responsibly if needed and sit it out. be patient and reasonable. Accept that bad things happen in this world and in life and i will not always be happy or get what I want. 

&#x200B;

I used to strive for the first two alternating. The reasonable option seems so boring, bland, average and depressing. I don¬¥t know. 

I think I crave the drama and intensity of the first too. And if I can¬¥t reach nirvana or whatever i¬¥d rather self-destrcut and feel alive through  short lasting somewhat superficial highs than settle for mediocrity. idek",1591264914.0,False,1,2,charlieintothewild,None,gwejeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/gwejeh/purity_mindset_meds_spirituality_drugs/
129,Drug Abuse Problems (Advice?),"So just to start off, I was diagnosed with BPD about a year ago. And i‚Äôve had problems with drug abuse for 8 years now. Mainly just weed, and alcohol for the earlier years, but in the last two years as my mental state has taken a turn for the worst, I have found myself struggling with benzo and opiate addictions on and off and it is slowly killing my soul. Every time I use drugs or pills I know it will make things worse, but it feels like the only escape at the time being, it is my go to reaction to stress and anxiety.

Here‚Äôs my current situation, In the past few months, I‚Äôve cleaned my act up a lot. I‚Äôve been on medication for about six months, SSRI‚Äôs and anti psychotics. And i‚Äôve admittedly felt substantially stable. I had barely been smoking weed, maybe once a week or every few weeks. Which is good compared to when I was getting so high everyday that i wouldn‚Äôt get out of bed. I might have been drinking a bit much here and there but it wasn‚Äôt too bad and didn‚Äôt seem to trigger that mental urge to escape reality.
 
However, in the past two weeks, I‚Äôve returned to my old habits. I find myself unable to cope with day to day stresses and anxiety‚Äôs, so that BPD part of me immediately urges me to rely on substance abuse to relieve the pains, I have been smoking weed a lot more than i should be, and drinking a bit too much, as well as benzos again which is my worst enemy. 

And then there‚Äôs the relationship aspect, which some of you may know is very difficult when you suffer from borderline. My girlfriend is understanding of my mental disorders and she does her best to support me and be there for me even tho she has her own issues. In the last two weeks she was diagnosed with Bi-polar disorder. The process of her having freakouts and breakdowns put a lot of stress on me but i knew i had to be there for her. 

The other day, I was so worried about her mental state that i bought 4 Xanax off the street incase she gets into a suicidal state where i can‚Äôt get through to her. In my borderline stupidness I took her xanax and ate 3 of them while i was with her. I don‚Äôt remember much of the night but apparently i said some hurtful things. Two days ago, she was prescribed valium for her anxieties and is just beginning treatment. 

In the last two hours. I was laying next to her in bed, and I knew she had a full box of valium in her kitchen. I fought so hard internally and was about to wake her up and say ‚Äúplease help me I can‚Äôt escape these feelings‚Äù but instead i decided to go take 10 of her valium and eat 4. IM  SO FUCKING ANGRY AT MYSELF. I feel like i can‚Äôt escape these habits and addictions and it will soon destroy everything good in my life. I don‚Äôt know if i should tell her that i took the valiums because i‚Äôm just fucked in the head and i‚Äôm not stronger than the impulsivity that comes with my mental disorder. I just need to escape reality, it‚Äôs either drugs or i might just kill my self at this point, i feel like this internal struggle is too much for my consciousness to carry. 

CAN ANYONE RELATE OR HELP ME OR SHARE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES? I am so FUCKING lost in my head right now and I feel like I am going to fuck up everything good in my life soon if i don‚Äôt make changes, i just don‚Äôt know how. I AM ADDICTED, thanks for reading guys. i promise i‚Äôll be safe for now and no harm will be done

Hope all is good :)  


Just got a quick one here, bit of background info... Have been using a mix of Benzo's (Xanax & Valium) & weed as a way of 'balancing' me out for the past year or so, the whole time I've always known this is a bad idea in the long run... new it would become a crutch etc. Has become my way of escaping all the shit that comes with BPD, short term is perfect and gives me that headsapce I need but has started to get a bit out of control recently (not helped with the current world situation) and have decided to try and deal with everything sober and clear headed. Am 2 days sober now and my head & mood are all over the place (more than normal), is horrible and feel like im loosing it a bit each hour.   


So was just wondering has anybody got any tips for getting through this? or any ideas of more healthy things I can replace for the drugs? (certain exercises/foods/activities etc)

One is somethings gone off in their life and im immediately like millions of questions trying to do everything for them when theyve already discussed eith me they dont like feeling pressured or having to over discuss something thatll make them feel even more shit,sometimes throw in me feeling rejected and hurt and unable to help because of that and emotionally going south
Another is we'll be talking about something maybe there'll be a little banter about something anything and in my head im thinking about how i like them how i wsnt them to be with me and im unable to cope with that or process it so i just end up picking on them like making jokes about them which leads into a fight and them telling me how many times have they asked me not to sit there and put more shit on them just because i feel something or whatever.
This person ive known for like two and a half years and throughout ive felt like ""wow,emotionally theyre so perfect and great and i adore everything about them and who they are"" with a dash of ""this persons so perfect and im this nothing alone and id give up everything just to be üé∂ part of their world üé∂, to feel connected to life and the universe and be rescued""
This person liked me before before id ruin and fuck everything up,but always maintained it like ""i cant even handle or take care of myself and i struggle to survive each day im trying my best just to do that"", which brings me to another way i fuck up and cause problems,i try to flirt with him and be sexual to get his attention and to get him to like me which usually causes him to feel likd ""i feel like youre trying to force me to want to date you no"" and so ill be off in my replies and acting because i feel rejected like im nothing which then leads to shit again,and when we argue and fight its intense its me like being emotionally intense and a lot by being angry, explosive, feeling insanely anxious, and it always comes to a point where he blocks me on social media and tells me how he doesnt want to know me, and then it gets even worse because ill then be email arguing with him sending email and email and email,usually a lot the same way people type fb messages broken up into parts instead of a huge one, which over whelms him more,especially when hesctold me ""you dont even wait for a response maybe if you waited"", not to mention his timezone is six hours ahead of me and itll be night with him trying to lay down then. Anyway all this to say i completely fuck everything up,someone whos liked me and let it be known they liked me,the way theyve said how good of a caring friend i am,but that my intense ways of being and horribleness killed them liking me,to just drop it all and be their friend normally without doing any of my weird shit without reacting when i think my egos bruised,that they couldnt be with anyone like me who doesnt listen or hear their boundaries,he thinks i dont even care for how he feels but i do i care for that so much to the point where ill stop what im doing and do anything for him, now this fight hes to the point where he doesnt want to know me and is physically pained by the shit going on that hes tired of forgiving me because i wont change and its like every other week or every week,i didnt want to lose him i didnt want to ruin and fuck up everything,i didnt want to end up where im a drain on him constantly and doing everything wrong and being someone hes hating,i dont know what to do to where im not hurting another person whos got their own mental illnesses, i dont know what to do if hes going to be gone and leave me forever,i just wanted to be good enough for him and i tried so hard and i tried like holding onto sand to have him just like me
I cant not think about how if he loved me id be ok, that him whos someone whos lived a fun life experimenting with certain materials where i havent because im so afraid of not having control, or him whos had romantic close relationships living with his partners where i avoid getting that kind of closeness due to being so afraid and having so much trauma i didnt go out and date around, where hes made love to his partners like people do and the most ive done is give guys oral just so theyd like me for another date but never let myself sleep with someone because ive been taken advantage of a couple of times in my life not to mention just always seeing cheating in married family members it put so much fear into me,i romanticize this guy knowing full well the badness of the relationships hes had and the abuse and struggles hes had and just think. ""Hes experienced life and the world and i havent and i just want that and want to be loved"", or the reality of his sexual history being not wide and not anything huge or really considered ""sexually experienced"" and think ""i want that closeness.

I've been experimenting with drugs since I was about 16, 'mainly' because I'm very interested in their effects on a persons mind. But there are also times that I binge on a certain substance for a while because ie I'm bored or I convince myself they make me feel better when I'm down (or even keep me from suicidal thoughts/actions). It used to be weed on a semidaily basis and until a few weeks ago ketamine until my tolerance became too high.. 

After a while I always lose interest in my temporary addicitons like drugs, alcohol, smoking and gambling (and sadly relationships too in a way..) so that's why I never worry too much about it.

It's gotten so bad I have drank 2 bottles of liquor in a day sometimes :( 

I am getting used to the withdrawals now. To the fear of getting seizures, to the twitching, shivering, throwing up... 

I messaged one of my exes even I don't really want contact with again and fucked things up and now they want contact to me again despite having made a shit show. Now I feel obliged to keep it up because of some guilt tripping they did. I am disappointing and letting down and lying to everyone. I met a nice person that I am just friends with - with some casual sex we had that really tries to help me but I just can't control myself anymore.

My doctor doesn't have time for me. The next appointment is in march. I don't want to go stationary. I have quite a lot of money so that isn't the problem but I made really bad experiences with other patients, nurses, doctors and all of it.

I don't know what to do anymore. I am just out of control. I do things I don't want to do.  I am just drinking and having sex and I know this is super bad with Covid but it's like my body/brain is doing things and I can just watch. Some of it freaks me out. You know how it goes. It's been 4 months now of just being crazy.

I have done drugs in the past and my mind already had the idea of starting again.

159,Drugs that work for you? Comorbid bullimia. Tried prozac-->extreme fatigue,"Hey guys,

Wondering if any medications have worked successfully for you?  
I'm proposing some new ones to my GP.  
Prozac has not worked for me, tried it for 2 years but because of extreme fatigue to the point falling asleep at desk I had to stop.  
Zoloft did not work for me either, I started binge eating enormously.

I have used phentermine, which is not an SSRI or anything like that, its something I got from my mum as a weightloss drug and that works exceptionally well for some reason?. But it is considered speed lol. I haven't mentioned this to the doctor though.  


Anyway, I'm thinking of suggesting pristique and wellbutrin. Opinions? I haven't thrown up in a while and have some control over this so I could get the clear for wellbutrin.

What else is out there?

My main is issues it that I have emotional dysregulation and I am hypersensitive to others.  
For instance, I will freak out if someone rolls their eyes at me, it will completely ruin my day without medication.  
With Prozac, I was different but I am a med student and I could not focus or anything. I could not stay awake. I was sleeping most of the day and it destroyed my grades.

168,CW: Drugs/Abuse/Sex Being obsessed with ur toxic ex...,"Hi, everyone! I was just recently diagnosed with BPD and Bipolar (even though I already sort of knew), anyways, I'm trying to sort out some of the dumb shit I went through in my past, and I was wondering if anyone could just tell me I'm not insane! 

(Most of this is just the story, but my main points are towards the bottom)

Ok, so I met this guy last year on Tinder (you can already tell where this is headed), and he was really sweet at first but then some red flags popped up. For one, he was really concerned with his appearance, and whenever we'd go out, he was more preoccupied with how people saw him than paying any attention to me. (I struggled with dysmorphia a few years back though, so I was sympathetic) 

Then as our relationship continued, he got really possessive and was so scared that I was going out to hoe around if I didn't respond to his texts fast enough. I'd always try to reassure him though, when he was feeling insecure, but it never clicked with him and he'd say ""You're toxic, you don't mean what you say, etc..."" and would spiral until I calmed him down. I never even thought of turning the other way though because I kind of understood how he was feeling and I tried my best to be empathetic.

As time goes on, I lost my virginity to this man too, (yay...), and I let him persuade me into giving him head on our first date. (For context, I was like 16 and never tried anything with another guy) and I thought that was what love was because thats what he wanted. So every date past that, we'd fight about something ridiculous and I'd give him make-up head.     :D

Then, after I actually lost my virginity, he told me he loved me. I was terrified when he said that, because it had only been a couple months of knowing eachother. I had only seen him in person maybe 3-4 times since we lived 30 mins away from eachother. So, when he saw my reaction, he started saying things like ""Oh, well if you don't love me we shouldn't be together..."" so I caved and said ""I love you too"" even though at the time I didn't even know what ""love"" was. 

As time went on, I slowly started losing my identity. Every conversation was centered around him and I was just the empathetic therapist on the other end of the line. I had long conversations with him about his aspirations, his home life, his troubles at school, but by the time it was my turn to talk, he tuned me out and played smash bros. When I tried to say how that made me feel, he said it was my fault for not speaking up and got angry with *me,* and then made an excuse that ""Smash bros just made him too upset."" and then I had to talk HIM down because HE was the one feeling hurt, somehow! 

So, around 3 months past, and he starts texting me less, starts pointing out more of my flaws such as

\-not stroking his ego 24/7

\-not being emotionally available

\-my physical appearance (which is strange bc he wanted me, first...)

\-my friends are all trash

And at the time I thought he had a point, so I tried SO HARD, more than anything in my life to be open and loving and supportive around him. But he was growing unresponsive and distant. Then, he goes on a vacation to Florida, and he doesnt text me for an entire day which is strange considering how obsessive he is. So, naturally, I had to see if he was back on Tinder. So, I redownload it and of course, his profile is updated with pictures he took while on vacation and his bio says ""Idk I'd like to think I'm pretty alright..."" (Sorry, but I thought I was the one who was supposedly going to cheat. Wth man!)

So, I text him on Tinder ""wtf r u doing"" and he flips everything back on me, saying ""You're on it too, I was only looking for a plug, etc..."" (YOU DON'T NEED SHIRTLESS PICTURES TO FIND A GUY TO SELL YOU GAS) and I told him that I didn't believe him. And he continues to gaslight me, blames everything on me, but says he doesn't want to break up. Then a week later, right before I go to work, he breaks up with me unexpectedly over the phone.

I've reached out to him twice now, to apologize for being so ""cold."" I even let him sleep in my bed 2 months ago because he was upset and on acid and tripping about his friend faking a suicide. Anyways, after that he facetimed me for about a week, almost like we were dating again. Now, he's even more self-centered and even more oblivious. But then just like that, he's gone again. 

Storys over now yay! :D

So, for basically my entire senior year, I was in HELL trying to justify how I acted. I felt like I had just killed my soulmate, and I had to live through his death over and over. Every week I thought I moved on, and then I'd just spiral and start back where I was. Months passed and it would feel like we had just broken up. I started to misremember events, forget who I was, until I was literally living for this person who wanted nothing to do with me. I would sleep around because the thought of sleeping alone kept me up all night, so I'd try to do anything to feel something again. 

Now, a whole year later, I'm just coming to terms with what happened. I don't feel attached to this person anymore, at least not how I used to. But I can't shake the feeling of shame, guilt, betrayal, and hopelessness. I feel dumb even writing this, because what happened wasn't that traumatic. At least, not compared to others' experiences. But I have so many questions

&#x200B;

Why'd he cheat on me?

Why did I apologize for the things he did?

Why did I blame myself for him cheating?

Why couldn't I love him when he said he loved me?

Why was I the ""cheater"" when I was the most loyal?

&#x200B;

The list goes on and on. But my main question is, why was I so obsessed with him? I had other options, people who were seemingly more sincere, kind, or attractive, but I always held space for him. I literally changed everything about me to fit his image of me, but it wasn't enough. And honestly, if he texted me again, I probably would text him back as if nothing happened. Has anyone else gone through something like this before? and if you did, how the hell did you get over them? Because, objectively, I hate this man. Hes an emotionally manipulative narcissist. But being objective doesn't convince me or my emotions.

I got diagnosed with BPD 6 years ago, but i don't relate to other people with BPD very much usually. I'm not emotional at all, and i just don't really see a lot of myself in the more emotional FP stuff. That being said, i am super wreckless, and i'm a drug addict, so i definitely have a lot of the qualities as far as impulsivity and stuff goes. So, my question is, does anyone deal with doing things in excess (specifically drugs)? How can i calm down a bit with my drug habit?

I'm not trying to quit drugs, so please don't give me advice about that. I just simply want advice about how to stop taking all my drugs at once, because i keep doing dumb shit.

I really don't fucking care about my mother, I tried to help her for over 10 years and she shit in my head so I gave up on her, but my boyfriend is different, I love him more than anything in the world , I want to build a life with him.

I Iocked myself in my room for like 2 hours crying and screaming so badly and my heart and my chest was hurting so much that I could hardly breathe. I can't handle it, I can't stop having that image in my head and it's killing me.

We sort of act like an old married couple and I feel fairly secure when I'm around him. We've been on two dates (third on Tuesday) but have talked for about a month online (he was in Japan for a while) and in a very soul-baring way. 

He's not the greatest at messaging/snapchatting/etc. He'll be active maybe once a day for an hour or so and will reply immediately and carry on a conversation if he's online (like a spurt of messaging), but otherwise it's like he doesn't check his phone at all. 

But when we do have that brief conversation, no matter how silly it is, it's like a hit. I feel like a drug addict. And when he's gone, I feel empty and like that whole connection is lost, and maybe I imagined it all? I sit here waiting and thinking about him. Trying to do schoolwork. Even texting other guys. But nothing works. 

How do I get rid of this feeling? I'm pretty sure it isn't normal. I really do feel like a coke addict waiting for my next hit.

Then I start using 24/7 to mellow the mood swings. Then comes attempting to OD only to pussy out and still end up in ER by myself because a stranger found me in the street or similar shit.

I also use big time the 5% of the time that I feel elated. Which leads to external violence and problems with authority.

We're not entirely to blame for this: When the combination of genetic predispositions for hyper-sensitivity and impulsivity encounter regular dosage of the sexual & romantic stimulations relentlessly delivered by the popular media -- along with the usually unconscious but nevertheless common and potent belief that one will finally get their needs met by another person and feel truly secure -- addiction to an SO or FP seems at least likely. 

I fell into the traps of the ""[consensus trance](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+for+Recovery+from+the+Consensus+Trance)"" as a teenager and stayed in it for years. (The stuff at the link at the end of this dug me out of it.) I was just *sure* that The Magic One would fix me up and make life ""great,"" ""worth living"" or ""at least tolerable."" Looking back, I can see that such was never the case.

I seduced, fixed, addicted, and even sort of temporarily enslaved my romantic hostages just to distract me from my BPD anxiety and self-loathing. Not surprisingly, most of my hostages bolted, or I got disgusted with them for being such wimps. I gave it up a while back, and I feel *soooo* much better. Here's how I came to understand what I had been doing, and what I had to do about it:

1) Pia Mellody's *Facing Love Addiction*,

2) Anne Wilson Schaef's book, *Escape from Intimacy*, 

3) Barry & Jane Weinhold's *Flight from Intimacy*, 

4) Susan Forward's *Emotional Blackmail*.

181,Do you have weird reactions to drugs too?,"Due to black and white thinking I was straight edge until January 2017, when i decided to give medication a try. In chronological order.

>Lexapro. world's most okay drug. No bad side effects but nothing to write home about. Stopped taking after 3 months due to ineffectiveness.

>Ativan. The first time i tried it was actually really nice, but it was certainly a case of diminishing returns. My last dose was at a party where i wanted to be more social, but i still got depressed and hid. Ended up giving the rest of my script to a friend.

>Zoloft. Only on it 1 week and it sent me into a depressed psychosis the cost me 2(!) jobs.

>Buspar. Made me really dumb and incoherent. And depressed. Almost to the point of psychosis. I remember dark hallucinations.

>Remeron. Give me cool dreams, and a modest mood lift at the cost of making everything delicious, haha. Went off then on it again now and it's working great. Its antihistamine action helps my indoor allergies too.

>Ambien. This is my god drug. Nothing, and i mean nothing has made me feel as good as this little sleeping pill does. I'm apparently in the minority that experience euphoria and hallucinations at low doses while being mostly free of sedation, impairment, and amnesia. I haven't had any in a month and a half. Haven't had a legitimate script since July, and it's all i can think about sometimes. I get mad when Drs won't give me any, because it's exactly what i need. It feels like being kissed by an angel. I've never had insomnia.

Klonopin: makes me more depressed and angry, but is an excellent muscle relaxant.

>Effexor. My coworker thought i was on MDMA. the first day i took it, and the 1st 2 weeks were magical, but then i sunk into severe depression, but now I'm back to normal it seems. Always a winner in my book.

>THC. Crazy visual hallucinations and distortions but zero effect on my mood except making me feel shitty and putting my body on high alert mode. I have no idea why so many people risk their future for this stuff.

>Alcohol. Okay i only tried this recently out of desperation and let's just say i can understand why it's legal. I have to choke down this nasty shit only to get impared and shitty feeling with zero euphoria and a hangovers? Yeah count me out.

I tell doctors about this and they're just confused, lol. Anyone else have similar experiences?

183,Am I destroying myself or just escaping? (tw drugs),"Hello. I think I introduced myself here a long while ago. I just wanted to give you an update and maybe get some input, though last time I was downvoted to hell and I know I don't belong into this community.

I started therapy and psychiatrist on September (a sorta team for people 18-23). While another psychiatrist had diagnosed me with BPD and proposed CBT, it was too expensive. So I manipulated the psychiatrist of the ""team"" to make them believe I have crippling anxiety and got a Rx for my once first DOC - benzodiazepines.

Relapse. After my mom found my stash of benzos and other downers stolen from my dad, worth hundreds of $$, I had no drugs besides stupid weed. I became a bit of an alcoholic - how else was I supposed to love my abusive boyfriend?

Back to September - the bromazepam was weak but got me going thru class, making time go faster. Yet I just wanted to find a stupid connect for heroin. But I couldn't - not yet.

Then I broke up with my ex. Massive doses of GHB were taken; I missed family gatherings or lunches with my grandparents countless times because I was passed out - which sucked, because I loved showing up high as fuck on benzos and stealing some more from them, and then get 20‚Ç¨ as a reward for being such a good student.

Breaking up with my ex meant one thing - I could have cocaine back. But I wasn't stupid and I knew of better, cheaper drugs: cathinones. a-PHP was my thing: you crush it up, and it's better than cocaine. Partying nearly everyday became my lifestyle, but I hated it.

That's when I started doing it alone, to escape. Snorting away, beecoming obsessed with several famous junkies. Needless to say, I didn't go to class; and if I did show up to an exam (with no idea what it was about), I'd be snorting lines before and after in the bathroom, drinking Gatorade with GHB.

I blamed it on my debilitating anxiety. Yes, I'm a shitty person, you can tell me more about it and I'll appreciate it. Really.

**You can skip here. This is more the topic!**

Then I found heroin. Dear God, my life saver! Well, not for long - too fucking expensive for me, I only get high every now and then, the rest I do only to get well. So, fuck my life, not even fucking heroin made my life worth living. I mix it with benzos all the time, which I know is not dangerous to me because of my tolerances,bummer.

So I started smoking a-PHP - esentially, it's better, cheaper crack; more potent than meth and with a short (but not crack-short) duration. X-mas was me smoking it + dope in bathrooms I don't remember because I was completely blacked out as I gave up on trying to appear normal to my family: I HAVE BAD BAD ANXIETY!

Buuut as with all addictions it gets nasty: I was doing it just to feel bad, and needed heroin to feel good; but kept doing it. Eventually I decided downers are my thing so I quit aPHP and became a full-time heroin junkie. Great, now I have an even worse dependence and sickness scares me.

But I realised that dissociatives were the drugs I really liked - more than heroin. Cheaper, too. So I've decided I'll be buying 6g of a-PHP (that can last months) and some ketamine, and fuck dope. I'll taper down til I get  the ket, and then k-hole during the worst parts of withdrawal. And I'll go back to my real vice: smoking aPHP. I'm a fucking crackhead; even if the effects get nasty, I got an army of downers that'll help.

And if it all fails, I have something very very bad in a small baggie, that can take me far far away.

I'm sorry because this post doesn't have much... thing to it. But I'd appreciate your opinions. I haven't been sober since October, not even a day - and I can't afford weed. What do you think I should do? Do you think there's still hope for me, or should I just stock up with my drugs and wait until I go insane or something?

Again sorry for the horrible post, I'm not on uppers tho, just a kpin and a metric shit ton of dope.

186,Another BPD person/former drug user/AMA,"Hi. I wanted to share another point of view from [M24] who was diagnosted with BPD 4 years ago.
I red many articles about BPD and other personality disorders. When I was tested for the first time, my doctor announced me that I have almost every personality disorder. She later came to conclusion it's BPD. I hope. I hope it's only BPD :D
Anyways I never was at hospital 'cause of my mental issues, everytime I somehow managed it.
I was on Abilify 10mg, Olanzain 5mg and Venlafaxin Mylan 150mg and last halfyear on 15mg Ab and 150mg VenM. 3 weeks ago I stopped taking Abilify and I feel better.
In the country I live are drugs common. Last two years I was using meth, MDMA, weed, poppers and I tested some shrooms, LSD, and some unknown drugs. LSD and shrooms didn't worked because of Abilify or/and Olanzapin.
I've never had hallucinations, only hearing things.
I was manipulative, liar and promiscuite.
I had some therapy for 9 months.

In this moment I have great relationship (4 months yet, but for last 4 years it's some advance!)
This girl [F19] is perfect. She care, she doesn't lie and we talk about everything. She's really helping me out.
I had long-term relationships before and I almost destroyed that girl but somehow lately she became one of my closest friends.
I'm always trying to see things from better perspective. And I fight. Every day.

I'm off drugs over month (except weed) and in 4 months me and my gf are moving to England/Finland.

I‚Äôve discovered what bpd was about 6 months ago and have decided to try going to a psy to get some professional advice, since it seemed to really really fit with how I had been feeling for a long time.

So i went, started talking to her, and it was horrible.

I asked her about bpd at some point, and she told me right away it couldn‚Äôt be that, because she had known people with bpd and that they all usually were heavy drug and/or alcohol users, which i am not (for reasons related to my problems).
She also kept trying to minimize every problem i could describe, saying that i was only a little lost because im 18, or saying other people had it worse...

So, given that she pronounced it no more than 5 minutes after I had asked her, I‚Äôm kinda doubting her diagnostic (to say the least), but the question still lingers:

Im not asking for a diagnosis, which is why I wont talk about why I think I do have bpd. What I want to know is if there is any truth to what she told me.
Is age and drug/alcohol use such an important factor when it comes to bpd ?
Does it mean I should give up on that ?

Tonight, I went out with a friend from an art class, a big step for me after a summer of the worst depression of my life. I was with her friends, who had smoked pot a bit before we got there. At one point, she took a cigarette from her friend's carton and started smoking it. She invited me to take a puff, which is something I haven't done in five years. I took two puffs. It tasted like nicotine. But then, I started immediately freaking out.

What if someone who was smoking it touched these cigarettes and there is pot residue on the cigarettes and it gets into my system? What if I fail a drug test from two puffs of a cigarette?

195,"CW: self harm, alcohol and drug abuse - questions about relationships with other bpd person","Hello, 
I'm usually just reading not commenting, but I have few questions about 2 people who have BPD seeing eachother. 

Backstory:
So I met this guy online. We arrange  meeting irl the day we first talked, we went to the pub, got drunk, told each other loads of things like personal, completely open up to each other like traumas and dark things (well mostly lol). He told me he has BPD, and I just commented that I know people with it (I never told him I have it too I know it is stupid but well I just couldn't say it, and later just sounded like I lied to him so I just never did it). 

So we know each other for almost a year now. We did slept together, and we are in contact everyday, but because of lockdown we didnt see each other since March. He is a bit flirty with people and he has this up and downs with being with me, I do too, to be honest but I always come back to him, we talked about this and decided to just be honest when other party ask. 
The problem is that I'm a quiet borderline, and I have it for years now (did the therapy and i think I'm doing great like life, job, bills adult stuff), all I ever was doing was always punishing myself with alcohol abuse and drugs abuse, breakdowns and eating disorder, isolation form everyone (that I do not do anymore, I do drink but responsible), he was into self harm not anymore but he still drinks and does drugs from time to time, he was hospitalized and went to therapy, but he thinks that therapy is not for him. 
I keep stuff inside, act cool like I can handle everything. Sometimes it is very bad because he doesn't know about my BPD. He knows that there is something ""wrong"" with me but he never asked me to elaborate so I didn't. 

So he added this person girl on his fb and I just can't stop obsessing that he is not talking to me sometimes because he is in contact with her. 
Just to say that we are not officially together, but we are not seeing other people, to my knowledge. I did try but I just had him on my mind. So I stopped trying. 
I generally do not have problems him talking to others even like in flirty way, because BPD makes you do stuff for validation and support and he did it before but he never act to it (we talked about this in past and I didn't have problem with it) except now somehow I do. I have this stupid theory that if we see each other he will stop or I will stop or all of this butchering of myself inside will stop. I want to see him, with this rules of lockdown eased down, but I'm afraid that he will reject me and he would not meet me and that he will go and meet this person. I just can't stop thinking how he is going to leave me, and it makes me want to leave him first. 
I did kind of told him this, and he was like everything is fine I still like you. I never mentioned this girl, just general feeling that he is not present like before. He was all sweet and nice but I can't stop. My brain is spiraling, and my BPD makes me feel so unwanted and lonely. 

My question is: should I ask him to meet me or not? Or should I just leave? If leave should I tell him why? And if I stay and do not ask him to meet how to deal with this feelings?

I hate this, and me being dependent on his reactions. I just want this to stop.

196,I am so sick of mental illness and drug nonsense.,"It all is just so tiresome you know?. I am 37, with autism, chronic PTSD, pretty strong quiet borderline traits and depression. I have a 21 year old sister with full blown, not at all quiet BPD, who came over last evening and spent several hours trying to talk/guilt me into going to an uncles house to find her grass. I quit two weeks ago and did not want to, but finally agreed to go over with her. The uncle has schizophrenia and a pretty bad meth addiction. We socialized for twenty minutes in a friendly way, but the discussion turned to politics and degenerated, no argument started, but clear small disagreements and just a bad vibe became clear. 

Trying to end the conversation I simply stated ""politics has become ugly and contentious these days"". My uncle snapped off on me with no explanation, ""so are you"", shouting. My sister called him rude and began arguing. I got up and left, but he has an extensive criminal history, and I returned when she did not follow me 5 minutes later to make sure she was safe. I was pretty sure she was, he has been violent, but never with girls. They were still arguing, but it seemed to be calming down. 

But she used the term threatening at some point and he snapped again and threw us out. I got up to leave and kept telling her to come with me. He started it and was a dick, but if someone throws you out the appropriate response is not ""what are you gonna fuckin do?, maybe I should steal something"", which was her response. I tried to get her to follow me out, but she snapped at me and they kept arguing and I decided young or not she was grown, and left. It turned out okay, they argued for an hour, but though he has badly injured other male con type guys in the past, I was right about his lack of danger to woman, and she eventually returned to my apartment. 

I am just so tired of all of it. The autism that makes every opinion I have analytical, divorced from others reactions, and puts me inside myself. The PTSD that makes me so triggered and scared of everything. The schizophrenia that makes him so paranoid, scared, and scary. The BPD that makes her so willing to pick up the other end of a fight, that escalates everything. And the dope, pot, meth, all of it.

Fast forward to what has happened in between April and now: went back to my binge drinking ways, broke up with my boyfriend who had been nothing much loving/supportive to me for years, dabbled into using way too much MDMA and coke, got involved with a co-worker who also has BPD and have plenty of insane fights/nights doing drugs and partying, and just plain old feel like I've lost my mind. 
I work somewhere where the job is crazy flexible, so I actually haven't been showing up to work because I ultimately get to choose when I work. But I've been throwing my money away like crazy and staying in bed all day when I'm not out getting sloshed/high. 

I'm at such a dark point right now where I feel extremely trapped. I feel so stuck. I made an appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time since last November. I seriously hope I muster up the motivation to get well and stay sober, but part of me still wants to crash and burn?! Like, I dislike who I am so much that drinking myself silly or doing drugs just seems like an appealing thing in order to slowly deteriorate myself. 
I keep thinking about all the people I've hurt and get overwhelmed with thinking I'm some evil person. It's hard to choose sides for myself. Try to love myself or just say ""fuck it"" and go down in flames...makes no sense to a lot of people. 

Thank you for reading this. I wasn't really going anywhere with it, but I wonder if others get what I mean about wanting to get better but also deep down wondering if they have it in them to abstain from drinking/drugs/self sabotaging....
And oh god I totally don't want to even re-read the messages I sent to people while drunk. I think I'll die of embarrassment and shame. :/",1531213707.0,False,17,4,brendanfraserislove,None,8xn8on,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8xn8on/feeling_chained_down_to_boozedrugs_and_self/
198,"I know I'm not an addict, I just wanted to feel better (Warning: Drug Use Mentioned)"," I do not need any advice for this post. Feel free however, to explain your coping mechanisms for the ones who may come across this, though.

I am expecting a visit to a psychiatrist sometime this week. I've always had a dependency issue ever since I began feeling like an outsider compared to everyone around me. I am different, and half the time in my mind it's not a good thing. 

Ever since before I graduated high school I've experimented with different things aka drugs and alcohol (never tried meth or heroin)  but none have ever stuck out to where I HAD to have it. If I don't have it, whatever. If I do, cool, takes my mind off my problems. I know this is not a good way to go, so I took it upon myself to SEEK HELP because I'm already aware that is better than relying on something that's just going to bring me down even further.

So does anyone else ever feel like the reason why you experimented was just to find something that would work for even just one night? One day? A week? And just stop cold turkey because you know it's not good for you, but you know for certain you need help that's both beneficial to you, the ones you love, that's not going to suck you down into this hole even further?

As a good example, I had my teeth pulled and became reliant on hydrocodone for 2 weeks. When I ran out, it wasn't a big deal. Yeah it made me feel good, but it wasn't worth going out of my way to get more. So I started spending $60 every 2 days on marijuana for almost a year. Obviously that didn't help too much so I began buying xanax from a trusted friend I know and that continued for 2 months. I stopped that, no problem.

But when my mentality and issues progressed even further, and I realized none of these things helped but made it even WORSE, that is when I decided I needed real professional help. I've been sober for several months now, but it just took me until last week to make the appointment.

199,"How do you experience dissociation? E.g. amnesia, feeling drugged","Last week my partner and I discussed the future of our relationship.  As you can imagine, the possibility of being abandoned freaked me out and I was very emotional. 

Afterwards I mentioned to a friend that it felt like I had been on a drug, the emotions were so powerful. She mentioned that this sounded like dissociation. Can anyone relate? Does dissociation sound right?

At other times I have had dissociative amnesia.

203,"Those who use/have used hard drugs, how has it affected your symptoms?","I‚Äôm talking about stuff like speed (methamphetamine or street amphetamines), cocaine, strong painkillers, let‚Äôs say mdma too if the use has been abuse instead of a few times use.

Has it changed your personality or BPD symptoms in any way? I personally have noticed that my emotions have become way less intense after abusing speed, I think it‚Äôs a good thing lol but I‚Äôm way more impulsive and I‚Äôve began to spot some antisocial traits in myself.

Addiction is anyway linked to antisocial behaviour (stealing, lying, etc). But I find myself that I don‚Äôt feel guilty anymore or give a shit about anything really like I used to. I‚Äôm still obviously disordered, my emotions change really fast but they‚Äôre less intense (like I get over it really fast, like I never even felt at all, they feel kind of shallow now except anger) and I don‚Äôt really fear abandonment anymore

209,[CW: Drug abuse / suicidal behaviour] Need coping advice / Cutting out favourite person,"First of all, I'm not diagnosed with BPD. I've got bipolar disorder (type 2), but I've got some of the BPD traits, which makes me being kinda ""on the edge"", and since my problem seems to be more common among those with BPD, I guess that this sub is the right place to ask for advice.

I'd like to say a big THANK YOU to u/SickSadWorld_7 for their [thread about normalizing having a favourite person](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/e7zw34/we_need_to_stop_normalizing_having_an_fp/). Even if I had some of the same thoughts during the last year, it was kinda eye-opening and a good reminder.

Now, the last weeks I've really been in a bad place. A bit more than two years ago I met the person I consider to be ""favourite person"". In the beginning and through the first year it was a pretty close friendship. They live about 5 hours away, but we were talking a lot and hanging out whenever we could - and both were pretty hyped, staying in contact, texting a lot etc. It was the perfect friendship, and then I didn't recognize that things could be kinda ""wrong"" and unhealthy as there was nothing to worry about. 

About a year ago, new things were happening in their life, they got a lot more stuff to do and it was mostly me trying to keep up the talk and staying in contact. As they're living quite far away, I couldn't see what's been going on in their life, so I was quite stuck in my head, pretty bad at mentalizing and just felt pretty rejected. I started overthinking, believing they hated me, didn't want to be friends anymore - and it became pretty obvious that my whole world was circulating around them. I guess I became ""too much"" for them, constantly craving attention, and everything went really bad when I was drinking a lot, taking a lot of benzos and texting them something like ""I love you, thanks for being a really good friend, but now I guess I'm gonna die"". I didn't remember anything of that when I woke up, and they got really concerned. After that we weren't talking for some days, but ""sorted things out"" and talked about everything I felt, what they felt - and I really worked a lot with getting better, changing my thought patterns, being more aware and trying to calm down when feeling overwhelmed, not texting them every time I felt the urge and just trying to trust that they want to be my friend.

I also went to therapy, which helped in some ways - and things got better. I stopped drinking, and I told my doc to never ever give me benzos again - and that also helped a lot, but I guess it was not enough. I kept ""relapsing"" when it comes to the thought patterns, the urge to text them, not having control when I felt overwhelmed and I felt they were blocking me out more and more (which I guess wasn't just a feeling, but an - understandable - fact). 

So now they haven't talked to me or answered for about two months. I think (or know) that I've become too much to handle. The worst thing is not talking it out. I would've accepted if they told me that we can't be friends anymore, or at least not having any contact for quite a long time. It's just not having a chance to ""say goodbye"" that really keeps me feeling constantly overwhelmed. Even if we can't stay friends, I'd like to say sorry and goodbye. Multiple people that where important parts of my life have died in accidents before, and right now it feels pretty much the same.

Now I blocked them on social media because seeing them popping up in my feed while they're ignoring me made things worse. I also think it could be a good thing not staying friends or at least take a really really long break. I realize that this has been a quite toxic relation that hasn't been good for anyone of us.

Though, even if I realize that's a good thing, I'm in a pretty bad place right now. I'm overthinking constantly, and I'm getting overwhelmed by all feelings at once. I feel sadness, shame, anger, anxiety and depression all at once, and I really don't know how to cope. I feel that I've totally failed at life, pushing away my best friend and making one of the persons I love the most feeling bad about themselves and pushing them to a point where they really had to cut me out to get on with their own life. Mindfulness helps a little bit when I'm not too overwhelmed to begin with, but still, maybe it lasts an hour or something, but I feel it doesn't change anything. It doesn't make the feelings go away, and the thoughts pop up again and again - and I can't concentrate on anything, which also has consequences when it comes to work and studies. I feel I'm in the same situation where I started popping pills and drinking a lot before, so I'm kinda happy I stopped with that - but right now I feel it makes thing so much harder to handle, because I don't have a good substitute either.

So, yeah, I'd be pretty happy if anyone has some good advices, techniques, other perspectives and thoughts or whatever. Thank you SO much if you really read this whole wall of text! That means pretty much to me!",1576513203.0,False,2,0,emotional-wreck03,None,ebh7gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ebh7gm/cw_drug_abuse_suicidal_behaviour_need_coping/
210,"Just diagnosed yesterday, wanting some clarity about drugs and expectations of those closest to me.","CW: Substance Abuse and Suicide

I'm 24M, will be seeing a psychologist again and also seeing a drug counsellor as I quit severe alcohol addiction a month ago.

So with drug abuse that's something I've engaged in a fairly heavy amount of over late teens/adulthood, I am currently abstinent to help conquer the alcohol. Over the years I've been engaged in about 6 different drug addictions as well as a background of frequent drinking plus 5 separate bouts of heavy drinking coupled with withdrawal afterwards.

However outside of those my pattern of use resembled a roster, I was intoxicated by something quite regularly but I shifted between several different kinds of drugs and in more recent years diving into experimenting with combining various things for something new.

My question about this is outside of professional help and anti craving medications what steps could I take to resist the desire to abuse multiple drugs regularly?

Also I am wondering specifically if there's any significance to 2 particular drugs, Ketamine and DXM. They are both dissociatives and a couple days ago I had a realization that the underlying reason why I enjoy and find interest in those drugs more than anything else may relate to them causing a kind of emotional neutrality. Not like a numbness from alcohol. DXM specifically is seriously dangerous to me and I was addicted to it briefly so I intend to abstain forever but Ketamine has never come close to frequent use and seems to sometimes improve my mood for a few days after aiming for a K-hole.

Honestly just wondering if my unusual love of these drugs over all others could relate to BPD or it's just chance. 

So with setting expectations with friends and family, what advice could someone have on how to keep them from treating me too differently, like if I'm mad about something or complaining I don't want to be patronised and dismissed cause of the diagnosis but also leave enough room for when it's probably appropriate. The main one I don't mind being called on is expressing suicidal ideation because when I get suicidal, an attempt can happen quite quickly. I should note I don't have a problem with violence at all, just I'm quick to raise my voice and self-harming plus breaking stuff if I get angry enough.",1600983360.0,False,3,3,Snickerwakadoodled,None,iz6e7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/iz6e7g/just_diagnosed_yesterday_wanting_some_clarity/
