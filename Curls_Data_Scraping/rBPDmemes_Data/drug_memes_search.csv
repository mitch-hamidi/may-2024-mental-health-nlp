TW: drug use","him(18M)and i(19F) aren't as close as we used to be. i had moved out for a couple weeks and then moved back in with him and he hadn't been the same since. he's done drugs the whole time i've known him and i have too but he's getting into pills and im getting concerned because he's doing stuff he tried to drill so hard into my head for me to not do. i'm not sure but i think he might have BPD also. idk what to do, should i let him do what he wants and be there for him if it turns out bad or should i discourage it or? i don't know if him being different is because of the drugs or if it's because of the argument we had or if he's just in a bad place mentally. i don't care if he does stuff for fun but im worried he's doing it to feel numb and that he's gonna get hurt. also, in the US if somebody needs medical attention for an OD, will they get in legal trouble?
