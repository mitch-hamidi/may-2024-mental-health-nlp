This recovery sucks and I’ve more or less convinced myself I won’t actually get there. I just hate myself too much, am way too self-destructive because that’s all I’ve ever known. I should probably be back in-patient but who gives a shit? lol. 

Anywho, I’d try to find a friend online at least who you can send a quick message to everyday to check up on them and they do the same to you, if you don’t have that person, then I’d be happy to, just shoot a dm to me if you’d like.",WanderingLittle,1b4vsei

Two concussions, gonna be homeless in february. and that's when it all hit, no amount of begging for help will make anybody come to my aide because the reality is most people don't care.

It's hard when you're fallen off in the deep end begging yourself not to drown but it doesn't mean you can't find the bravery to swim up and stay afloat.

0,"I wish I could attend an in-person support group too. Aside from outright substance abuse, my go to coping strategy is simple distraction. I want to turn that more into mindfulness, but constructive distractions like arts and crafts, organizing my sock drawer, or trying to find a YouTube rabbit hole are more mindful and helpful than obsessing and ruminating and stuff.

A lot of my experiences are very physical and have a lot of somatic symptoms, so doing things with my hands or causing myself to feel different sensations brings me back to Earth when I start spiraling.

In our formative years our development has been disturbed in such a way that our personality (which is your core fundament) has been profoundly damaged. It's something that can be made manageable, but impossible to do with meds. There are some regulatory medicine for emotions, but nothing as sophisticated as is required for personality disorder. Generally, antidepressants still work for the depression that might co-exist with your pd, but it will be less effective because some pd's will keep a depression going, basically fueling it.

I was a brief hold only about 24 hrs. I left the hospital with a script for a couple meds. Two were medical (HBP and a uti)but I had a 7 day script for trazodone. I do miss that one. I have mild insomnia but sometimes I feel like OTC sleep aids make me crazy drowsy. I have a hard time functioning the next day. But the trazodone? I slept great. 

I was seeing a psychiatrist for about a year. He was quite nice but was a touch too religious for me. I know that sounds bad, religion just isn't for me. I'm fairly staunch atheist. Anyway. They had me on Paxil, latuda and prazosin. The prazosin helped a lot with PTSD nightmares. My nightmares aren't as bad now but I kind of still wish I was on it. When I do have a bad nightmare, it kind of ruins my day and I get stuck in a spiral thinking about my trauma. The Paxil just made me retain weight and I was really unhappy. The latuda was for impulse control but man. I was still buying shit left and right.

These sensations have been described as tingly, crawling, creeping feelings, and cause the overwhelming urge to move the affected limb.""

I don't know what was causing this. I did everything I could to prevent it from happening, staying away from anything that could be causing this anxiety. It would happen when I was trying to go to sleep. The only way to relieve these sensations was to tense my muscles about every 10 seconds. This went on for about 4 or 5 months before I was prescribed the medication that helped me. I call it ""body anxiety"" because it's a physical sensation rather than mentally, which I also really struggle with. My therapist would tell me to calm my mind and I kept telling her it had nothing to do with my anxiety mentally.

OP can you try that for me tomorrow? Can you try the ice method for me? If you don’t have ice at home you can buy instant freeze bags. Just give it a go for me OP?

”If people care about me, they won’t leave me behind.” ➡️

3,"That puts you in a really tough spot; the ED recovery can really benefit from hospitalization, because you’ll have other people helping keep you on track to successful recovery. But BPD would want to keep you in the cycle of hospitalizations because of the thought pattern.

That’s something to bring up to the staff at the hospital or your therapist, that you know that the thought pattern isn’t ideal, or fair to you, but it’s very hard to break. Recovery is possible, but if you hide struggles the professionals can’t help you with them. Vulnerability is hard but worth it when it means getting better.

Once we reach here, there's a long climb to get to the top, and making this the penultimate episode robs us of the real healing the show's been promising us six seasons. By contrast, CExG had the suicide attempt on season three and gave us another season and a half to tell the story of recovery.  


Second, the final episode is basically Bojack realizing how increasingly estranged he is from his friends culminating in the convo with Diane where it's pretty obvious this is going to be the last time the two of them talk. For someone who's struggled with similar issues before, the idea of losing my friends and my sources of intimacy like that is incredibly bleak, especially with the show ending on the dissolution of the friendship that started the show (admittedly, very poetic).   


I watched Bojack because I thought eventually, we'd see an actual journey of recovery. Instead, we see Bojack almost take his own life and lose his close friends and promise recovery might be in the future. For someone with BPD, that's one of the worst fates imaginable.",Distaff_Pope,m49cmj

But in a way you’re stuck thinking of what ifs, should bes and you end up failing every time and end up being passive toward the situation, when you should eg get help.

2,"hello friend, the BPD subreddits are really hard to look at, especially if you're stuck in it. it is not the place to go for recovery, in my opinion - it's the place to go for a sense of community. sometimes, though, forming a community can stagnate progress. it's so easy to get sucked back into disordered behavior when you are surrounded by people who are also exhibiting disordered behavior. it's not their fault, and it's not yours, it's just what happens. 

I don't want to monologue here about how *things always get better!* because I don't want to waste your time, so I'll be short about it. 

I used to feel and do really awful things because of my BPD (a reason, not an excuse). for years I did treatment on and off, struggling with it, quitting, relapsing, hitting rock bottom, and then committing to recovery again.

unfortunately, it's messy and it's hard and there's no light bulb moment where everything finally makes sense and you're finally free. it's not like you wake up and you're suddenly happy all the time. I'm sorry for that. 

however. 

the small changes build up. it feels like nothing is happening when you're doing the work, and it can be so frustrating. but when you try to make little changes, one day you can look back and see that the person who was so overwhelmed by their disorder can now *function,* even if it's only for a few minutes a day, because that's better than not at all. I am truly sorry that there's no magic flip to switch, but there is hope. BPD has a very high chance for remission over time, especially if you're working to get better.

For me there’s no recovery n I honestly don’t mind it, I’ve accepted I’ll be dead soon n it doesn’t have to be a negative thing",throwaway19384718,mwtuye
7,This is a serious question but do you feel like r/bpdmemes is the same or is it a reasonable hypothesis that memes may help recovery lol,escuchamenche,mwtuye
8,yeah exactly,Dangerous_Owl_1858,mwtuye
9,"I'm sorry that nothing has seemed to help. it feels really hopeless and exhausting to go through so many meds and therapies and never find something that actually makes a difference. 

can you see even portions of a recovered life, just small fractions? like, as simple as wishing to wake up feeling grateful. or wanting to have an experience you feel your BPD is preventing you from having. or getting a pet. anything like that?",astrangewindblows,mwtuye
10,for me personally this subreddit is the same. I've been trying to make a concentrated effort to stop joking about my mental illness because I found it was stopping me from dealing with my problems and preventing me from being vulnerable and honest with myself and others. that may not be true for others,astrangewindblows,mwtuye
11,"I have got a pet and he’s my biggest support system, I am such a recluse I don’t enjoy hanging out with friends and don’t have any interest in any love interest at all. I just don’t get how people have the motivation to live an entire lifetime",throwaway19384718,mwtuye
12,"what's your pets name, if you don't mind sharing?

to me, it sounds like some part of you wants to recover, given that you posted a meme about it. is that true, even if it's just a really, really small part of you?",astrangewindblows,mwtuye
13,Truly not I’m just an attention whore lmaooo his names Grandpa,throwaway19384718,mwtuye

4,"I would’ve done anything for that kind of recovery, damn! Weird question but Can I ask if it was good??",kinkyscum,qld9l4
5,"Lol it was amazing! Not sure how I recovered so quickly, but she was a planned 4 week premature birth so they had to induce me. Started closing up as I was birthing her, super weird birth…would not recommend",glitteringfox93,qld9l4
6,"That’s insane, No bueno! Hope baby is well!! I had a third degree tear and a horrible long long long recovery, getting coochie surgery soon and I’m 10 months out. Grass is always greener, eh? 💕",kinkyscum,qld9l4
