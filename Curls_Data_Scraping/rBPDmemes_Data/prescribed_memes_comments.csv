12,"What part? Bc the answer is yes.

They used to [perform ""pelvic massages"" to treat female hysteria](https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/medical-vibrators-treatment-female-hysteria). Also, Freud heavily supported the use of cocaine to treat mental illnesses. 

To be fair tho, back then medicinal approaches to psychiatry were little more than ""if it makes you feel good, it must help your mental problem"". That's why Valium is known as ""Mommy's Little Helper"", or why Germany was on so much methamphetamines, called Pervitin at the time, during the rise of the Third Reich.",PKFat,1cbln5b

7,I'm on Zoloft (sertraline in the UK)it is helpful but it can be a bit manic when starting on it. It can  effect your sex drive too. Too much info here but it can affect your ability to climax.

31,"How does medication give me a false view of the world? 
It's the opposite actually my brain gives me a false perception of rhe world, medication and therapy help make things Normal",vaultgirl7689,z5tlcu
32,"so my belief is basically that it‚Äôs different for everyone but I was trying to explain what I assumed must be the sentiment of the person who said medication is true hell. For some people, medication gets their brain in order but with medication there‚Äôs always a trade off with the side effects. That‚Äôs why some people strongly believe in doing things naturally. But doing things naturally when your brain is ‚Äúoff center‚Äù won‚Äôt fix what you‚Äôre going through - it will typically only prolong it. 

there‚Äôs no reason to not get the help you deserve and nobody who‚Äôs not a medical professional should ever be giving you advice on whether or not you in your specific makeup need to take medication or not.

I hope that makes sense!",,z5tlcu

so I'm pretty sure my liver was used to ""working overtime"", and that night I was so sad I forgot that, thankfully, otherwise I wouldn't be here writting this, checking out memes, watching the 3rd season of Travelers, I wouldn't have discovered that my crush actually liked me, I wouldn't have found my passion (singing, I use to study engineering).

Edit: I've been using many, many, many different anti-depressants and none of them really help with my executive dysfunction at least, but every case is different in that regard at least. As for my BMI it's somewhere between 14 and 17, I can't say for sure.

I don't have an eating disorder as far as I know, I don't starve myself intentionally or purge my stomach (I don't think I've puked in over a decade now, let alone intentionally). I'm just too lazy to eat sometimes. Anti-Depressants won't really have an impact if you watch out for it.

9,"Well, there are no meds specifically made for treating bpd so we usually get antidepressants or antipsychotics, with varying levels of effectiveness.

Right now I'm taking paroxetine, which is an antidepressants and I've been taking it for quite a while. I don't really like it because it fucks with literally everything in your body and if you take more than like 10mg you get horrible constipation and other great stuff like a complete inability to orgasm. The reason I still take it is because the withdrawal is so incredibly painful that I'm basically forced to take it. 

 I used to take quite a lot of seroquel, which is an antipsychotic and univerally hated by the entire bpd community for its massive weight gain side effect. I also suffer memory loss because of this drug. Stay away from this one unless you want to turn into a fat zombie with anmesia. 

Sometimes I take carbamazepine, which is usually used to treat people with seizures but its also prescribed to manage manic depression. I hate carbamazepine because it never works for me. Also apparently, according to my psychiatrist, if you get pregnant and give birth while on this drug theres a big chance your child will have spina bifida. 

The first med I was ever prescribed was risperodone, which is an antipsychotic and usually prescribed for shizophrenia. It did make a difference but I'm pretty sure it gave me literal brain damage. I didn't help that I was just 17 when it was prescribed to me.",AnxiousShallot,fhx9h5

A lot of antipsychotics are unfortunately incentivized by money and pushed before proper testing has been taken to assure parents of any long term side effects.

This is the world private insurance has brought us to- pharmaceutical companies are as much a for-profit business as your cereal conglomerate. Only instead of potential dental or obesity related issues, you're left with mood disorders and hormone regulation issues.

Imagine being a parent who seeks help, or seeking help yourself, only to have a licensed psychologist pedal drugs a large company sent them to the Bahamas to prescribe.

As much as I'm aware there are probably drugs out there which would help me regulate, I would simply rather force myself to improve on my own.

16,"yes. I have taken it in the past for that as well.

And if it's extremely unhealthy for us long term and will shorten our life spans... this would be a bad thing?

27,"I definitely felt less feelings on it but it made me so sleepy and hungry. I'd wake up, eat, take a nap, wake up, eat, take a nap, and so on. 

My bf did NOT like me on it because I was a zombie, I guess and I gained too much weight for my liking so I stopped it. 


Side note: Rexulti effects psychedelics negatively as well.",Quix_Optic,els5lh
28,"When did I mention ASPD? I said: ""Studies suggest that the lack of Omega-3 is related to more frequent violent EPISODES and antisocial and psychopathic BEHAVIOUR in patients with known and unknown (non-diagnosed) MENTAL ILLNESES."" Did I specify? No. Most of this studies were conducted in prisons where they didn't exactly care for a diagnosis but for the incidents as a statictic. I'm pretty sure highly functional PD patients can benefit from eating fish everyday even if they've never seen a shrink in their lives. Same goes for people with other illnesses or even ""normal"" people.",ShintouHiroyuky,els5lh
29,"lmao, how does it affect psychedelics? when I was only on Prozac and Wellbutrin I had to take like twice or even three times the dose my pals took just to be cool, at Creamfields I usually spent like US$200 on extasis and I didn't even share. 

I remember this one time when a friend and I were gonna lsd, youtube and chill. But off course I ended up with a live dj playing all night long while some dealers were feeling so comfy they were literally giving away pills (after everyone bought a bunch). One of the dealers at some point in the night approached me and asked me if I had cocaine, if I had been consuming it and if that was the reason I was still so ""sane"". He also wanted some cause he ran out and he had a test the next day (and alcohol in my house used to be like always free for all and in copious amounts (so he was wasted)). But I answered that I didn't know exactly why, I assumed it was my prescribed pills, but I had trouble getting high. He was amazed, sad, happy and disappointed. Amazed that I didn't need coke, sad that I couldn't get easyly high, happy that he had found a great client but disappointed he wouldn't be able to sniff some Colombian snow. 

Shit I wrote too much. Btw I quit hard drugs and alcohol, I never really liked soft drugs.",ShintouHiroyuky,els5lh
30,"I'm in Welbutrin now and that never seemed to effect drugs or alcohol but I have always needed to take more than people to feel the same as them. 


I think it's just because I already start lower than ""normal"" so it takes more to get me to their level. 


Rexulti diminishes the effects of LSD so you'd need to take more. I was on a low dose so it wasn't a huge deal but I did notice a difference.",Quix_Optic,els5lh

10,"Oh sure. It made me a complete zombie. It was prescribed to me as a sleep aid. I was tired all the time, falling asleep at work (which got me fired).  I literally could not feel any type of emotion. I couldn‚Äôt recognize myself in the mirror. My family was so worried about me. It scrambled my brain. I forgot 6 months of my life, as well as random pieces of my past. I‚Äôm still having trouble remembering things right. 

I found out this happened to a friend of mine as well. She was on it longer than me and she‚Äôs missing two whole years of her memory. 

Just a clear case of mis prescribing but it really fucked me over. I was 19 at the time. 25 now still trying to recover. ",Monkey_Face93,altqaw
