7,"Everyone is talking about BPD not featuring manic episode. Which is true but people with BPD can experience hypomanic episodes and euphoric episodes. Many people with BPD also have overlapping symptoms with cyclothymia (linked to the hypomania) 
Regardless it's relatable and funny",,19ez9wl
8,"Disclaimer : as someone who is solely responsible for their comments, I must disclose that I was unaware of the fact that mania isn't a bpd thing. I suppose it is quite my fault not being well educated about my own illness, anyways , that's pretty fucking stupid but my point is..Having those which I allegedly called *MANIC EPISODES* seemed to frustrate alot of people which I found quite preposterous. However, that is merely my personal opinion but I must acknowledge that it indeed does refer to borderline personality disorder,  perhaps not all people with bpd are likely to experience this but it is a THING , the only difference between it and bipolar is that it is short termed.

25,Nice to get PC-ed on my own disorder! My 'euphoric' and 'uneuphoric' states usually last longer anyway,AliceFlynn,19ez9wl
26,"Aww man :( 

Some people say they‚Äôre having manic episodes but it is not the same as BP manic where it lasts days, weeks, or months. Most people with BPD that do experience what manic feels like, only feel it for a brief fleeting period but enough that feeling manic is how it‚Äôs best described by them. 

I guess that‚Äôs why they say BPD is like BP but only much faster lol",MindingMyOwn2021,19ez9wl
27,"no. you don't wish, trust me. 

I've finally reached a point where I realise when my manic episode starts and I can counteract it by having a smoke or putting on relaxing music. usually, I do enjoy that mania for a while before I calm myself, but I literally have to get myself out of this absolutely amazing state I wish never stopped, because once it does stop... oh boy. 

complete 180. especially episodes that last almost a day are so painful to ""come down"" from. within seconds my energy levels drop to near zero, I dissociate and cannot get out of it while at the same time feeling incredibly sad and broken to the point where I _want_ to break down and cry, but I can't because I'm stuck in dissociation.. for sometimes multiple days. even if I get out of the physical dissociation, I'll be sad and at the same time completely deprived of any emotion-inducing hormone. 

it's awful, actually.",ursa-minor-beta42,19ez9wl
28,"I simply explained the correct terminology for those of us with BPD. It is called euphoria by its academic definition within the DSM-5. 

Im sure I don't need to explain to another individual with BPD how harmful mislabeling can be. Especially when done purely because you think it's ""cooler"".",JustRandomNonsence,19ez9wl
29,"""BPD mania"" and bipolar 2 hypomania do seem to share a lot in common, as someone who's experienced with both. I could differentiate the two mainly by whether I was still flying high several days later.

Full bipolar mania is a whole other beast though. At that level it starts to more closely resemble a state of agitated psychosis. Think of hypomania like being on a coke binge, and mania like doing a shit ton of acid. Thought disorder, hallucinations, major delusions of persecution and grandeur, basically ceasing to make much sense. It's often a full-on psychiatric emergency.",TheLastHayley,19ez9wl
30,"My manic episodes could never last up to 20mins , the highest I've ever been was 3 hours and god could it have gone any better?",Ok-vennie-1053,19ez9wl
31,"It was an offhand comment, one I didn‚Äôt think before I wrote. I have friends that have majorly set back their lives during a manic episode so I know they shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly like I did. I‚Äôm actually the complete opposite, I‚Äôm always fighting to stay out of depression it‚Äôs exhausting, to have this period where I don‚Äôt need to fight so hard and just be happy sounds so amazing, again I know it‚Äôs not, but on paper it sounds amazing.",LineChef,19ez9wl
32,"Well maybe I call it that because I feel more comfortable with those terms, especially since (as I said) my states tend to last longer and are more similar to bipolar. I said 'cooler' sure, but really I mean I'm more comfortable with that definition. The way we express our feelings shouldn't be reduced to academics, we should just be comfortable in how we express it. Also, sorry for lashing out, not doing to well rn and needed to vent some frustration lol",AliceFlynn,19ez9wl
33,"ah, I see. on paper it really does sound amazing, and technically that piece of time where you feel that way is amazing too. it's kind of like a major drug trip. you're high as fuck and it's amazing, but once you're coming down the withdrawals start. 

I have to deal with depression myself so I can absolutely see where you're coming from when you say ""I wish"". anything to get me out of that hole..

0,"Talk to him and express your concerns, don't let your fears and worries go unheard but do it from the heart not in any kind of ""point finger"" way. You say it might be to numb something, he may need help with mental health and needs support getting to there. 

I can say from experience that letting it boil over and getting angry at them would only do them and yourself harm. For me I started drinking when I met my ex and she brought over vodka, I quickly went down the rabbit hole after a couple weeks because we would always drink. I suffer from severe PTSD and BPD so after a couple months of us dating she just pulled the switch and started getting excessively angry at me for drinking and said she had been quiting for weeks (I wish I had of known so we could have together). She left me and now instead of the strong, healthy, confident man I was when I met her I'm just a husk and a alcoholic.

Nutmeg is a spice/nut that gets you high for a long period of time. Apparently there are also visuals with it at higher doses but I've never taken that much lol. Getting it down is a pain cuz it tastes pretty bad but if you don't mind a little nausea then it shouldn't be too big of a deal. 

And pure lemon/vanilla extract. They both contain a pretty high alcohol count so if you're underage and don't mind a pretty bad tasting drink, you can mix it with something and get drunk.

I'm sure there's more but those are the ones I know of and have tried. If you do try any of them, make sure you do some research first before. You need to know proper doses and what specific stuff to get, otherwise it could be very dangerous. Which it still isn't really good for you, if you're able to get weed that's a much better option honestly.

Just Kinda depends where you live üôÇ if you are in the US or Canada it is pretty easy getting spores online and then shoot them into an uncle bens microwave brown rice bag and just let it sit for some time before making a small hole for mushrooms to come out of üòÑ. They smash u with just wave after wave of seratonin and the visuals are breathtaking üëÄ it really helps me for months after the trip as well. Or u can learn about mushrooms and go foraging for them which is also really fun!,yongfong87,1337lll
40,"I'm with you here tbh. I'm all for micro dosing LSD and Shrooms but there's a time and a place. Also adding an experience that could become traumatic doesn't seem ""safe"". I've done shrooms and it takes prep it's not always sunshine and rainbows and peace and meeting the sky elves. Despite what psychonauts want to make it seem like.",Cultural_Outside8895,1337lll
41,Putting somebody on shrooms? they arnt an opiate or harmfulüòÑ people use mushrooms to kick drug habbits and I have zero regret telling people that have suffered an abusive life and have addiction problems to try mushrooms. It helps and works and like you say Op is at a point they are trying to get high off Walmart crap that can be harmful .. so maybe it is time to try something much less harmful that has been helping people like us. I do it and I swear by it after a lifetime of drug problems. Join some mushroom groups and even opiate groups and u will see it is helping many people.,yongfong87,1337lll
42,But of course be safe and careful and learn dosages and all about it before trying. Just like with any medicine. Could also help Op kick cannabis or atleast taper down a lot.,yongfong87,1337lll

There is a lot of info on psilocybin therapy and long term depression and helping with trauma.. also helps a lot of terminally Sick and old people come to terms with the thought of death.. I have to say it is the best medicine I have ever tried in my life.. but set and settings is everything and need to make sure u take the right amount and have some one u love close by to trip sit or help if things get a bit heavy.. it lasts for around 6 hours.

69,Im not even really sure what everything she had in that picture was..cough medicine.. vanilla extract.. I know monster  i dont know what the other stuff is but I am sure whatever mix she had going with it would be much harder for her body than mushrooms.. plus she is not gaining anything from doing those things.

And even for months later it does something to your head where for people like myself it helped me talk to people again! It made me feel connected again bcoz I clocked out of society for a very long time and just honesty could not be bothered talking or explaining things to anybody. It is not something to just jump into and honestly at 18 it is young for sure ‚Ä¶ but it is proven to help many people with addictions and even for myself I stopped smoking after and changed to edibles.. and I don‚Äôt even do those now .. this was all part of why i foraged for this amazing medicine it was months of researching everything about it and doing it the safest way possible.. maybe my comment did not explain everything like this but if Op was to get into mycology they would learn this and it is all very interesting and part of the process.. on the night I could not stop laughing and I could not stop crying it was just beyond words.",yongfong87,1337lll

8,"Hi! I've been sober 5 1/2 years and I never thought I even wanted to do it. This is just a reminder that difficult things aren't forever and you've gotten through so much in your life already so you can definitely do this. It's also definitely worth it. And I never thought I'd say that. My emotions still go up and down and I still have rage episodes but as opposed to them being every day it's a couple times a month. 

What helped for me was getting mental health treatment alongside substance abuse treatment. I had to treat all my issues at once or I had zero chance of recovering. Also sober supports are super super important and can save your life and sanity. I found my sober people through a 12 step program so that is an option or there are definitely others also. 

If you need to talk/need help my dms are open. (I might take a bit to reply though because I'm not responsible enough to have notifications on)

Edit to add: And even if you do relapse, try not to beat yourself up too hard. It's part of the learning process and one slip wouldn't be the end of the world. But the important thing is to own it and then do what you need to do to get back on track. Remember that you're human, and humans aren't perfect. We just do the best we can with what we have.",psychxticrose,18n9v6s

11,"This isn't just how it feels to be sober. Partly, you feel lost because your brain hasn't fully recovered from the drug abuse. 

When you're taking drugs, your body produces less of the natural happy chemicals because you are getting them artificially. 

Even though you stopped the drugs, it's still not producing as much dopamine as a healthy brain so you don't find normal things enjoyable. 

Stick it out and let your brain fully heal and then you will get pleasure from basic things again, and you'll feel good sober. You got this far. If you start using again,  you'll have to start the process all over again.",MILO234,18n9v6s

Makes me laugh how many times I have said about wanting to hurt people to the point of XYZ person needing an ambulance, but they‚Äôre still like ‚Äúoh yeah, she‚Äôs sound‚Äù like sleeping with a knife in your room is standard behaviour",kimberleyann98,z5tlcu
31,"How does medication give me a false view of the world? 
It's the opposite actually my brain gives me a false perception of rhe world, medication and therapy help make things Normal",vaultgirl7689,z5tlcu
32,"so my belief is basically that it‚Äôs different for everyone but I was trying to explain what I assumed must be the sentiment of the person who said medication is true hell. For some people, medication gets their brain in order but with medication there‚Äôs always a trade off with the side effects. That‚Äôs why some people strongly believe in doing things naturally. But doing things naturally when your brain is ‚Äúoff center‚Äù won‚Äôt fix what you‚Äôre going through - it will typically only prolong it. 

there‚Äôs no reason to not get the help you deserve and nobody who‚Äôs not a medical professional should ever be giving you advice on whether or not you in your specific makeup need to take medication or not.

I hope that makes sense!",,z5tlcu

yes! sometimes the monster isn't us! but it's impossible to see until it's too late.. bc you're so busy fighting a war with the monster inside of you, that you don't realize the tender hold of your partner is becoming more and more like a noose.. I would never, ever wish a covert narc on my worst enemy. that was a hell i fear I will never truly recover from. I opened up about my bpd to him, and he gleefully took that and used it against me.

I just hated that the old FP absolutely love-bombed me which is something I was telling myself not to do to people for a while prior, so when it happened somehow I didn't even see it and I just got swept up. So when they went cold on me I was absolutely blindsided. It really ripped my guts apart at the time.

I'm not sure if you're aware. But, the emotional numbness that a lot of the time that we feel is because of the intensity of our feelings over a duration of time. Causing an emotional ""burnout"" effect.  


I'm not sure if you're able to work through what you're currently experiencing at the moment, whilst feeling the way you do.  
But, the last time I was experiencing that, I was able to pinpoint what was causing it and, accept the feelings, rather than the automatic repressions and hollowness that it was causing.  


I honestly just don't feel as though using a substance to cope with life is good for you in the long run. As, you're not utilising any of your healthy coping mechanisms to defuse and mitigate the issue, nor are you using your cognitive skills what environmental factors caused this and figure out a way to improve your situation.

(üö®‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT, DO NOT USE THAT MUCH UNLESS YOUR BODY CAN HANDLE IT. DO NOT. I took that much because my body can handle that much without dropping into Serotonin Syndrome. KNOW YOUR DOSE, PLEASE. Serotonin Syndrome ain't nothing to mess with, so please always be safe!!!‚ö†Ô∏èüö®) I'd been in an episode that was just getting worse by the day for over a month, and a fully loaded brownie and 30 minutes later I was calm, relaxed, and thinking clearly. My husband asked if I wanted a nap and I told him ""I mean, I feel like I could nap if I wanted, but I also feel like if you drove us to the park to take a walk, I'm down for that too."" Like. Over a month of an ever worsening spiral was shut off by a brownie and half an hour. How or why states keep it illegal (insert bombastic side eye glare at Kansas here), when it can help mental AND physical illnesses? No, it's not a cure all, but it really does come in clutch a lot. (Sorry, mobile, reddit, format, they refuse to fix for some unknown reason, but small rant incoming ->) What annoys me is how much better ""big pharma"" could be if they dipped into botany/herbalism. I don't mean ""don't worry, I cured my kid's (serious illness) with ‚ú®Ô∏èoils‚ú®Ô∏è"" crap. Which, they DO help, but again, not a cure all. Good examples? Peppermint oil extract in hot water. Few drops, and it helps with nausea and anxiety. Can't sleep? Make a blend spray with lavender, chamomile and melatonin to spray on your pillow (Dr. Teal's actually has this spray and a whole line. Epic brand to trust!). Unwanted warts? Dab tea tree oil on it, cover with bandaid. Repeat until it's gone. My dad had one on his finger, and it took about a month. (DO NOT use it on your face. It's harmful to be ingested in any way, including eyes and nose.) But all that to say that if they utilized natural medicine and the science of how making meds for the masses would triple their cash grabs. Dandelions? Actually a pretty powerful herbal remedy, but they claim it's a weed, and most you see (depending on where you live) are already being chemically treated because they're ""weeds."" While they do have the ability to spread LIKE those under the ""weeds"" umbrella, they're really good for more than a few things.

31,"Not trying to accuse you that you wouldn't know what you do, but how did you try them?

There are a few reasons why it doesn't work for some people:

- Some people don't get high the very first time they smoke. The cannabinoid receptors don't respond to it and it might take a few times to activate them to get high.

- If you have only tried edibles then you might be one of the people that don't have the enzymes to metabolize THC/HHC.

- If you have smoked it, maybe you didn't inhale it into your lungs. Some people smoke it like cigars, which get absorbed better in the mouth, so they don't pull it into their lungs. Weed is absorbed in the lungs.

- Someone sold you CBD weed without THC.

I'm not saying that it has to affect you. Maybe you don't respond to it at all. I have something similar with alcohol where my body gets drunk but my mind stays clear.",Jonne24,17r8r34
32,I‚Äôm sorry I know how that can be im lucky enough to only have relatively temporary bouts of it nowadays when it happens and keep my consumption low enough to avoid more serious instances of it. If weed helped but you want something with less risk id try the atypical anti depressant Mirtazipine. It specifically promotes dopamine production and release in the prefrontal cortex which is the area most associated with the issues that come with BPD. It helped me out of some of the most depressed and anxious months of my life but I specifically have physical prefrontal cortex trauma as well as any incurred through years of emotional and physical abuse so your mileage may vary it may just be a good fit for me.,Sole_Meanderer,17r8r34
33,"What were the signs of how it started? 
Could you feel it build up?

I try to make sure that I only get high when I feel great and am in a good mood to not be more vulnerable because of stress or anxiety and try to limit myself to once a month.

My therapist was worried about me going into psychosis from drugs. She has a lot of experience with treating drug addicts and has seen some heavy stuff and what could possibly happen. She is already concerned about that without the drugs and sent me to a prevention program at the hospital. I still don't have the results yet.

I love weed and psychedelic drugs in general and don't want to give them up. I don't use them to cope so I'm able to control my consumption, but I would really miss them if I can't have any at all.",Jonne24,17r8r34

I'm also really paranoid and it sucks. This is also the reason why my therapist is concerned.

When I'm under stress I have this feeling of losing control over myself and behave irrationally. This is why I don't want to do drugs if I'm not feeling stable.

Until now all of my experiences while high felt normal except the second time I had used it where I dissociated because I just couldn't get my breathing right. I usually sleep bad for the next 2 days when I get high but that time I would constantly wake up after falling asleep thinking I stopped breathing and was going to pass out because of it.

I just wrapped up my first month of attempting OLD with no success except learning. It‚Äôs weird being in one‚Äôs 40s doing this to begin with, but I was trying to be smart about it, not seeking dates with just anyone because I have limited time, energy, and money, instead really narrowing it down to women who seem like they would be compatible long-term. For me that‚Äôs compatibility on age, politics and religion, weed, socioeconomic, and no kids and don‚Äôt want any. Incompatibility on any of those means it‚Äôs a dead end, and even if it lasts a year or two before ending, they just means I‚Äôll be back at this and be even older‚Ä¶ fuck that!

12,"The difference is that death from benzos alone (not combining with alcohol or opiates) is relatively uncommon, with withdrawal even rarer. If you are a VERY heavy user who withdraws you can detox rather than cold turkey and be ok even if it's hell. 

Opiate deaths on the other hand are very common. People probably died from opiates while I was writing this comment. Over 80% of benzo deaths (USA) are when combining with opiates.

I've been a heavy benzo user, but I made it back and I'm still here. Likely would not have been the case with opiates.

I wouldn't recommend coping with benzos or alcohol to anyone if they don't need them, but if the alternative is opiates I would 100% of the time.",rakuu,1bu1uhe
13,"I'm with you, I'm being released from the hospital tomorrow, I had a major surgery last week. I was on ketamine and strong opioids for the first day in the ICU, after that they gave me different opioids, but since I'm being released tomorrow they aren't giving me the opioids anymore, ""just"" tilidin. I'm glad they wouldn't prescribe me the opioids, because.. the feeling sure was peaceful. such a quiet head.. and just generally more grounded. even my outbursts were controllable as hell, and I'm pretty sure those good aspects wouldn't last long if I took them longer. 

I'd recommend talking to your doctor about medication, and definitely asking for something that isn't based on opioids. may even let them know why, if you're comfortable being that honest with them.

probably the only thing that kept me from getting absolutely hooked on the stuff immediately was that it gave me really vivid nightmares. okay, not all death and gore and terror but they were very anxiety inducing. it's silly but the first morning after, i was questioning if they were real. i sometimes get flashbacks when i'm awake, five months later.

15,"We're past both of those. We've tried SSRI, SNRI, antipsychotics,  anticonvulsants, lithium, and have now begun Adderall. Even though I was crystal clear with her about previous addiction issues with it.

I'm tired of trying stuff. People always say suicidal people should try EVERY POSSIBLE TREATMENT OUT THERE first, except that's not feasible. You can always pull some other bullshit ""treatment"" out of your ass to say ""aha, gotcha!""

Those people don't realize how absolutely exhausting it is to keep trying and failing and trying and failing. That shit gets discouraging.",kb3uoe,1c5waa7
16,"I never said it had to strictly be tms, I listed more options than just TMS cmon now. I tried but like I said I can‚Äôt force you to wanna keep trying. I can‚Äôt help someone who doesn‚Äôt want it.It honestly seems like you wanna vent rather than hear solutions and that‚Äôs okay just say that. We all need that sometimes. If you ever need to just vent let me know other than that I can‚Äôt do much for you other than what I already had done and suggested. I‚Äôm sorry nothing more I can say or do the ball is in your court now. I can‚Äôt make you do anything.",GL0D0LL,1c5waa7
17,"I understand getting discouraged and like trying new things over and over eventually could feel like a waste of time, especially when you just wanna die anyways where it‚Äôs like what‚Äôs the point? Hearing ppl speak on what suicidal people should do without having experienced it themselves is pretty frustrating bc they act like they understand when they don‚Äôt.I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through that. But unfortunately options are limited, it‚Äôs either keep trying or just give up, I can‚Äôt make you wanna keep trying or undo any discouragement you feel.

Hell not even gonna lie even after all those treatments ts don‚Äôt go away completely but it does help ease some of the BPD symptoms, but definitely doesn‚Äôt help all symptoms much less cures it, but the help does make it more tolerable to live with.But ofc theirs no one size fits all treatment.

All I can do is give advice and share what helped me, and wish you the best and hope you get through it and find an effective way to cope. I really hope you‚Äôre able to find the willpower to push through and find something that works for you and that it gets better for you, hell I didn‚Äôt get better till. Just recently. I had given up for awhile and was being a crashout, off meds, in and out of psych wards,Becoming a polyaddict that mixed and took dangerous amounts of substances and deep down hoping it‚Äôd kill me, wasting life away, constant Suicide attempts etc. and just overall letting BPD take full reign of me.

But once I finally got my shit together and made that effort to try new things after I had given up for a few years, that‚Äôs when I was able to find what works for me. And it‚Äôs honestly the best thing I ever done for myself.So I don‚Äôt judge or blame you if you for giving up bc I had done the same for a few years but I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs worth it to keep trying bc it doesn‚Äôt hurt to keep exploring those options. I really hope you see the light at the end of the tunnel and you have the will to not give up bc once you do it just gets worse from there.",GL0D0LL,1c5waa7
18,"No, I know. I don't mean it that way. I just got off the phone with them and they told me it's not covered and it just feels like something else has been knocked out from under me. 

Like, my treatment options are rapidly thinning out and I don't know what the fuck to do. Can I get the vagus nerve stimulation thing? What if I can't? What if a million different things.

This is why I absolutely despise the American healthcare system. Just because two companies don't want to play nice and work something out, I'M the one that has to pay the price.

I'm just so frustrated and emotionally exhausted about all this.",kb3uoe,1c5waa7
19,"I am so sorry I thought you were yelling at meüò≠. But yeah I‚Äôm so sorry they only take certain insurances which is fucking stupid like if you don‚Äôt have the best insurance they don‚Äôt wanna do it. Like if they aren‚Äôt able to suck the amount of money that a car would out of you or your insurance then they just act like you don‚Äôt deserve treatment. It‚Äôs so beyond fucked up. Everyone who needs it deserves treatment regardless of their insurance or financial situation. Fuck the American healthcare system tbh. It‚Äôs literally so evil the way it‚Äôs set up. 

Without insurance TMS is more expensive than the ket treatments, if you‚Äôre gonna save up money to do either I‚Äôd suggest the ket bc it‚Äôs cheaper and way less sessions. Or even cheaper like I said get shrooms the microdose through the tor browser online. 

Ik I probably sound like a broken record but theirs really limited options already as it is, even more so for you bc your insurance doesn‚Äôt wanna cover a lot of stuff.I really hate how limited on options you are.It‚Äôs not fair at all. Like our only options outside of pills are crazy expensive inconvenient treatments. 

Or seeking out other drugs to self medicate which is not the best idea especially with someone that had a past with addiction. It would be incredibly difficult to constantly have that level of self control it takes when self medicating while having that addiction trait, ik from experience I personally can‚Äôt control myself when it comes to self medication bc my past with drugs. I couldn‚Äôt microdose tbh I‚Äôd end up bingeing it till it was gone. But that‚Äôs just me tho. You may have the willpower that it takes for that. It definitely doesn‚Äôt hurt to try the shrooms and see how you handle yourself on them. And how much they help. Bc their not addictive at all you just gotta have self control over that mental urge to use recreationally instead of therapeutically.",GL0D0LL,1c5waa7
20,"No need to apologize. I see how my message could be viewed that way. Once I read your reply, I realized that's how you interpreted it.

My insurance said they cover ketamine and ECT. I don't know how I'd get to and from the ketamine treatment two hours away, multiple days a week, so that's essentially out. That just leaves ECT, which... who knows how that will end up working out when they give me more info tomorrow.

I wouldn't be able to do shrooms for the same exact reason. It took me less than two weeks to abuse the Adderall. I was prescribed Vicodin for two different surgeries, at like 17 and 19, and I abused them way back then too. I've always abused anything I could find, regardless of consequences. 

Like I said, I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing fucking works. I'm gonna fucking ***__SNAP__*** one of these days, and I do not know what will happen. I've been going around with so much pent up hostility and aggression that I've genuinely thought about fighting someone simply for catharsis and getting that shit out.

21,"I'm proud of you for being sober for long. I have only been sober 3 months maximum and currently still am not.
I did get off fentanyl and switched to lighter opioids like percs laced with OSDMT(very oxy /morphine like, related to tramadol but feels stronger), kratom, tianeptine(antidepressant/opioid). these are more manageable than fentanyl and heroin was because they're cheaper they're all legal except OSDMT which I get from China(not sourcing so don't ask).

you're a lot stronger than me without my opioids I couldn't live with my BPD and bipolar type one w psychotic features. my mom threw my meds out and I relapsed after 1 month of sobriety after the psych ward. if she didn't throw them out id probably still be sober because they were working but when she threw them out the antipsychotic, gabapentin, and antidepressant withdrawal would've made me kill myself so I relapsed so I could regain my sanity. I was hallucinating and acting strange after I quit. it's like the psychosis they were suppressing it got more intense for me than my normal psychosis.

if you want my advice to stay sober; get naltrexone. it's a powerful opioid blocker and it stays in the system for 7 days. when you use it it won't let you get high for 7 days which is long enough to curb momentarily cravings. 
without it, I'd never would've quit fentanyl I had a 20 fentanyl laced perc a day habit. I was selling them to maintain it making no money for myself. the naltrexone saved my life it would've killed me. it made the withdrawals worse but they subsided faster and stopped relapse and prevented me from getting high.

also I want you to remember this phrase; when dealing with post acute withdrawals symptoms or pain relating to BPD or the PAWS. tell yourself ""this too shall pass"" it's supposed to remind you that the feelings and cravings and pain are temporary and they will eventually pass.

another thing is if you do relapse use kratom. I don't recommend relapsing but don't go back to heroin. kratom is legal and overdose on it is practically impossible unless you mix it with other depressants or opioids. it's a lesser evil and much better than going back to heroin. now don't do this unless you basically are 100 percent gonna relapse.

you will be okay you got this you're much stronger than me if you could make it 5 months you can make it years homie :)

my advice comes from 7 year long opioid addiction and I hope all the stuff I learned can help you too.

9,"Sorting it the fuck out. I had felt that demon dwelling and growing inside me from about the time I started going to school and that demon broke out and that demon almost ruined my fucking life. Honestly, scariest thing I ever did was letting that thing out but at that point, it was stronger. Since then, I have gotten so good at just sitting and listening to myself. Not just the initial feeling. But I fucking drilled and basically interrogated the shit out of myself and all those feelings and muffled and incoherent voices. Eventually, I actually found that there was so much I hadn't done for myself and since then, whenever I start to feel that demon, I ask it ""what do i need to be doing for myself? What do I need to be doing to ease your suffering"" and before long, after going through a couple short lives stages, I know what I need to do and I figure out how to incorporate it. And oh my god, I don't feel a demon anymore. I mean, I still feel like is something vicious in there, but it's not evil. It's just learning and accepting and integrating. Me to it and it to me.

I tried therapy, I tried a medication, I even tried going completely numb. I tried some risky behaviors and I've tried vaping and all I do now is smoke weed and occasionally drink alcohol. But I am making strong relationships and actually starting to do things in my life again that felt good. And it's because the things I'm doing are actually the things I want to be doing, not just the things I'm convincing myself I want to be doing. If you have one wish, what would you use it on? 10 seconds and it expires. Right now, what do you want? In one year time, given the wish again, you may have a different wish as time has passed and you've gained a new perspective. Find what you wish to be doing and just figure out how to make it happen. But make sure wits coming form somewhere that feels good overall and not just at the moment. Figure out what feels like a healthy choice not to cope with something and not to prove something to yourself, but to just enjoy yourself as a human in this world with a duck to give about how you appear to yourself. Give yourself one day if just pick something and go do it and learn what is good and learn what you think is good but is actually just coping. Wreckless behavior isn't the option. It never was. You might think that you don't view yourself as being the center of everything, but ultimately this wild behavior is that in disguise. Sit down with yourself. And I mean, really sit down with yourself and tune everything out and learn what you can do better. Impatient while driving and deciding to speed or closely follow people, take a moment say to yourself ""what the fuck are you doing? Get your ass to a better speed and give him some damn space"" and then do it and delete the urge to just fall back in, tell yourself this is an achievement that you are simply being in a more stable spot of the road.

Do that with everything. Learn where the healthy spot is and tell yourself where it is once you know where it is. It's a vicious fight learning to control that demon, but eventually you can coexist with it not as a demon, but as a friend and as something that you both understand and feels understands you. Be the demon as much as the demon will be you and that middle ground that is healthy will be found it created.",AppropriateKale8877,14x9qyr

1,"I pretty much did the contrary. At the end of high school I choose to study psychology at uni because I wanted to ""diagnose myself"" pretty much.

First year, first week, one of our teachers said that a good amount of us are probably here to better understand ourselves more than by passion of psychology. Guy knew what he was talking about.

I did the first two years until I started missing classes more and more only to realize I was basically ""socially anxious"" or something like this. I felt weird things going to uni, immense feeling of doom, couldn't breathe... and I finally abandoned university for good.

That's only how it went for me. I certainly don't want to discourage OP or other readers with this. I just want to say: Be true to yourself, do something that you really want to, take some time to think about it, talk with older students and graduates. You can also begin something and quit if you feel like it won't work for you. Also, do not care about your family/friends opinion because you quit.

It's not just a matter of *affording* thearpy. Finding a mental health professional who can truly help you is *extremely* difficult, and that struggle is magnified when a potential patient has BPD, since BPD is stigmatized even among mental health professionals.

I mentioned a few days ago in r/BPD that I believe there's a ""hidden"" mental health crisis that nobody talks about: The sheer number of people in the mental health field who shouldn't work in it. The financial struggles of obtaining therapy coexist with the struggle of avoiding the mental health ""professionals"" who would just rather you disappear.

Sigmund Freud is reputed to have said, ""Patients are nothing but riff-raff. The only useful purposes they serve are to help us earn a living and to provide learning material. In any case, we cannot help them."" I don't know if this quote is factual, but I can't help but consider some of the psychologists and social workers I've been a patient of and wonder...",RedStellaSafford,a05150

The average wait time of things is enormous, because everyone can get anything done without paying. Or you go private for faster service, and it ends up breaking the bank.
