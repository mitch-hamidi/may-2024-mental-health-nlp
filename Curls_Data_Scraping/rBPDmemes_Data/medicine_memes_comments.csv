3,"Oh boy, Seroquel. I was on 200mg for three years. After taking it, there was a 50/50 chance I would either fall asleep in minutes OR it would make me jittery as fuck for hours. I was tired 24/7, slept 16 hours a day, couldn't focus on anything and gained a shit ton of weight.

28,"Oh cool, I didn't know it had a name! It's the absolute worst. I would always hit myself to the point where I had bruises just to relieve the restless feeling. Once I took Seroquel on a 13 hour flight and got this. In the middle seat. Had fun time.

The withdrawal definitely messed with my sleep schedule as well! I would go several days on 2-3 hours of sleep. It improved significantly since then, though. I'm sorry you got hit with insomnia on the top of it all :(",RigelAchromatic,hdjkpm

15,Technically you shouldn‚Äôt drink on prescription meds ever but it definitely depends on the person. I don‚Äôt see how anyone could drink immediately after taking it because it zonks u out so crazy. I literally wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep without my seroquel. I love it. I‚Äôm currently on 150mg. I do drink on weekends and socially and I‚Äôm always fine. And like I said earlier I can‚Äôt have more than a beer after I take it because within an hour I am passed out. Sorry about your mom though it sounds like she had other issues as well and that can be hard to deal with as a kid. Can I ask what u mean when u say ‚Äúunbearable‚Äù? Unbearable like how?

I'm on 300mg quetiapine since 3 years, and thanks to my substance abuse problems I drank and took every drug A-Z nontheless, but drinking alc was the worst.

I do have panic attacks on a full dose of mushrooms so, basically you can say I have to walk on eggshells with my anxiety I guess.

2,"It can sometimes take about 2 months for the medications to be in your system, so it can take a while before you feel better. I‚Äôve gone through multiple medication combos and finally found the one for me after about a year of trial and error. Sounds terrible, but it was SO worth it in the end. 
I‚Äôm on a combo of Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I read below that your sex drive was affected by the pills you had, my friends and I call Wellbutrin the ‚Äúhappy, horny, skinny pill‚Äù. It‚Äôs worked wonders for my depression, while giving me energy, suppressing my appetite (emotional eater here üòÖ) and making me want to have sex on the regular (but not obsessively). The Lamictal has stopped me from having the highs and obsessive type thoughts. Pretty much a medication combo for bipolar 2. Just wanted you to know there‚Äôs hope and a light at the end of the tunnel if you can stick it out. It took 3 hospital visits, failing out of school, losing multiple jobs and serious strain on my relationship to make me finally see I need to be on my medication and to stick it out to find the right one. 

TLDR; there are good medications out there, might take a while to find the right combo. Give it 6-8 weeks before giving up on a medication.",clashXrocker,eo56u3

E: added intestinals bc forgot it lol",humalanpoika,eo56u3
4,"im glad you found something that works. I just think I dont need medication at all expect maybe for the nootropics ive been self medicating which do make me ""happy, horny and skinny"" plus ""can study for ten hours and never sleep"" even though the skinny is kinda bad cause it fuels my eating disorder. If i wasnt under the huge pressure I am right now, I think I would be okay with just psychotherapy. I think very few people at my school do not self medicate cause it really is difficult and once Im outta there I will at least lower my intake (I usually stopped taking over the holidays and I was fine). BPD has been proven to be treated by pills very poorly anyway and the only significant evidence I found was on various psychoterapies, DBT usually coming on top.",the-charm-quark,eo56u3

7,"haha luckly not, i take 1 happy pill, 2 sleep pills, 2 acne AB's, 2 lactic acid bacterias, 2 fish oils, 2 'biotin' and 1 multivitamin and on top of that those fizzy tablets for after sports for hydration (not like i do sports everyday i'm just a dehydrated bitch). also my sex drive is gone, like not even kidding, it's. ALL. GONE. i used to be so hypersexual that i don't actually mind it but it does get my bf a little down since we only see each others like 2-4 times a month (i'm in the military service right now)",humalanpoika,eo56u3

12,"yeah i've been looking into yoga but as i live in a 20 square meter room with 4 other women it's hard to do anything here. i could try hitting the gym in our military base for yoga but i'm really insecure about exercising in public (everyone else there is lifting weights, fuck). i'd love to start running again and i know it's good for both my physical and mental health but it's not running season here, roads are icy and i don't have shoes with grip so i might break a few bones if i'd just go out there. but thanks for reminding for the yoga thing! i could try to find some time for it, even for a few stretches to get myself started",humalanpoika,eo56u3

They were going through a truly hard time, and all the while, I wasn't helping like I thought I was, I was making it worse. I only figured out some of the damage by scrolling back for a year over our messages, and some of the accusations became more clear, as I was looking for anything that could have possibly come across wrong, and what did either come out wrong, or it was wrong. But I'd no idea. So, to be fair, I have to admit my part in this, and the pain I inflicted on them - aware or not. However, yes, I look back on who I was with them, and I see where I was basically a support beam. My feelings, interests, and so on never mattered to them. Sure, they'd hear me out and give advice, and that would go as one would assume, but sometimes it didn't. For the latter, as an example, my interests didn't matter unless it was a mutual interest, or something they found to like, but if it didn't line up and they didn't have interest in what I was, I would get the chance to explain it, or start talking about it (using 'it' as a placeholder for interests), they'd hear me out a bit and then totally change the subject to something else and I wasn't even done in the first place. So, make no mistake, my family on this earth, I am not toiling or asking the ""but why?"" anymore. It was made clear that me having no idea was simply unacceptable, and they were done with me. I tried and even sent an apology email for what I'm aware of as far as my part goes, but they seem to be living their best life without me, so I gave up. What's the point in chasing after someone who clearly doesn't want you? Idk about anyone else, but I do not have the energy for that pain, frustration, and drama. ü§£ü§£ I do not lmao.

The second:

>Counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists shall terminate services only after giving careful consideration to factors affecting the relationship and making effort to minimize possible adverse effects.

I'm no lawyer but that language is pretty clear cut.

I already have my undergraduate degree in psychology and am starting a new one in Fall. My goal is to work with youth and adolescence with trauma. If I make a fucking youth center to work with teens, that's my prerogative/my dream/my goal, and no I'm not some meanie ageist because I don't want to treat little kids or adults.

99,"#I never said the existence of women's spaces is messed up. I said the exclusion of men invalidates BPD as being an illness that anyone can suffer from. 

The fact anyone was simply turned away instead of being comprehensively helped is what's messed up about this. This makes BPD seem like a ""women's illness"" and therefore treated differently by both professionals *and* people who don't understand the science. Why didn't the institution have a place for men who also have BPD? That's a failure on the part of the institution.

I work at a domestic violence center. To gender my program would be deeply unethical and a failure on part of my program, more women come through my doors- but that is not to say men don't also need us just as much. Yes, especially in this situation, it's incredibly important to be comprehensive of the gender of the client in question. But if you don't have the resources to segregate based on gender- to deny is to discriminate. Denying men in my program would be an outright professional statement on our part that we do not recognize or validate men going through exactly the same thing- which is deeply *wrong*. Women's only spaces are deeply important- believe me I understand that better than most people. But you can't justify the discrimination against other genders in favor of another. Do they also deny agender/multigendered people? Do they have to be afab? Slippery slope imo",JupiterInTheSky,11yjhrl
100,"Yes, women DO need their own spaces. Again, I've only ever agreed with you.

The fact they only have options for only one gender is literally a failure on the part of that institution. It feels like you just want to fight. You must spend a lot of time on Twitter.

The fact more women get diagnosed than men is the same kind of gender bias that leads men to be more often diagnosed with ADHD. That in and of itself is a professional gender bias on its own. And *exactly* what I'm talking about. That feeds into the stigma that men don't have BPD as often, have it less severely, or need just as much help as us women who have it. They also deserve their own space free from people who would say they're less deserving of a space.

If an organization only has funding for one program, then it is deeply unethical for them to gender that program.",JupiterInTheSky,11yjhrl
101,Someone who's that bad at evidence-based risk assessment definitely shouldn't be diagnosing people with anything. They're really acting like it's some extremely rare disorder that only 0.000001% of the population have,jasminUwU6,11yjhrl

103,"Oh I TOTALLY understand. I'm not the same, but I do use she/they and consider myself a demiwoman. We really need more niche groups, if anything. I don't think the problem is having things that are only for certain demographics -- The problem is when it's only catered to just one demographic (re: segregation in America -- places for black people were always rundown, poorly serviced, hazardous, and places for white people were rich, pristine, clean, etc. That's where the issue lies in segregated spaces, when they aren't equal/equitable in quality. That's why HBCU's can exist. Because white people already have tons of college options.)

&#x200B;

I think it also would help if their were groups centric on queer, nonbinary, trans, and other groups, too. I know some exist, I've heard of them and I'm sure there are some in my area -- But it gets a little more difficult with how (in America) the political environment has been with a rise of bigotry. Even in the case of men's spaces in say mental health, it can be difficult to get off the ground or staff it, due to things like toxic masculinity and lack of awareness for men's issues, that can leave many men afraid or in denial of asking for support or talking about emotions and feelings.

&#x200B;

I remember doing a project a year ago for a lifespan development class where I focused my topic on men's mental health, because one of the lessons that stood out to me was one that taught us men can ALSO have postpartum (it is called paternal postnatal depression) and many suffer greatly on their own because a lack of awareness about the condition and lack of resources for it. 

&#x200B;

This is why I think we need MORE demographic-specific spaces (in all things -- hospitals, colleges, mental health groups, websites, etc.); Not less. And men's mental health spaces are definitely lacking, and ones for groups like GNC people, trans people, queer people are targets for bigotry, then you also factor in the lack of access to a lot of services and facilities in most nations of the world (and again in America as I know being American) due to finances, disabilities, location, transportation, and so much more.

I love how you admitted men with BPD should just ""man up"" about it.

Me: ""hey that kinda leads to the stigma that men don't need help like women do?""
You: 'wehl, achkshually, the stigma is justified bc (regurgitates stigma)'
Babe watch out, you're so full of shit it's falling out your mouth.

This subreddit has no idea how professional gender bias works. That kinda sucks, especially with an illness that is so entirely wrought with it. 

Women do not have the illness more often- women are more likely to be seen, diagnosed, and treated for it. Please understand how diagnostic statistics work before you go around stating what is and isn't ""objective fact"". This leads to people believing we should prioritize one (like only provide a safe space for women) while the other receives no such comprehensive safe space for themselves, where they too can heal, free from stigma. It leads to people regurgitating exactly what you've said here, literally trying to argue it *is* a woman's illness.

Not a single time have I ever stated that the women's group is bad, or that women's only spaces are bad, women's only spaces are not only positive but immensely important to many women's recovery and health. But to say men don't need that, or are less of a priority is really messed up and factually inaccurate.

131,"That's assuming the clinic is inpatient, but a clinic often offers more than just one therapy type and highly doubt they'll restrict gender access to their other therapies. 

I am not arguing against that some people of both sexes and different genders need very exclusive and specific environments to heal, but there are ways they could accommodate multiple for something that's already really specific and hard to get help for. My main issue remains and is also, this can cause people to get help too late. It doesn't help OP clearly who is facing exactly that issue - not able to find any other place they can get into and their insurance covers.",CactusEar,11yjhrl
132,"And you need to acknowledge the reality of the said society we live in. There‚Äôs a reason safe spaces exist for minority and disenfranchised groups. Like the person above said, many women with BPD are survivors of abuse at the hands of men. Giving them a safe space to recover and heal outside of the presence of men is not discrimination. It‚Äôs like if you‚Äôre straight and angry a LGBTQ+ group can‚Äôt let you into the space and claiming you‚Äôre being discriminated against. Sexuality and race specific safe spaces exist. If your argument isn‚Äôt valid for those conditions, they aren‚Äôt valid for gender. Bffr.

Most BPD clinics are co-op. it‚Äôs unfortunate that it seems the ones in OP‚Äôs area don‚Äôt take his insurance. But that‚Äôs not the fault of this single clinic that has a specific focus. There should be an overall expansion of therapy for BPD patients, not a shutdown of specific safe spaces. 

The fact that there might be less male only spaces rests on that fact that BPD diagnosis is highly sexist towards women. Epidemiological rates are about equal in the population but women are diagnosed 4-5x as much as men are. If psychology assumes there are more women with the disease, they are going to focus their efforts on that group.

So instead of going woe is me and trying to tear down a safe space for a group that is already much more stigmatized against, why don‚Äôt you go advocate for more awareness for men with BPD?",brookeiu,11yjhrl
133,There's no good excuse to deny someone access to a therapy group,Hayley-Is-A-Big-Gay,11yjhrl
134,"It absolutely does not help op and I'm sorry!! It would affect a lot of men sure, but it would help the group that makes up the majority of BPD patients.

135,"The group is literally catered to a specific type of person. That's like complaining alcoholics anonymous won't take you in for being a recovering meth addict. Or that a post-partum group won't take you in when you're a person whose never been pregnant or had kids. 

&#x200B;

They wouldn't be trained for you. They will be addressing different issues from OP's. Certain therapy groups are centered around certain conditions, demographics, and disorders. I have BPD and CPTSD and am queer, why would I go up to a therapy group for people with OCD and CPTSD and are heterosexual/cisgendered and complain I don't fit the criteria of the therapy.

&#x200B;

It's not like the therapist can just randomly create a brand new group on the spot for OP. Those things take funding, time, scheduling, permissions from the government and people who run the clinic, staffing, training, licensing, and more. 

&#x200B;

This is why I've said multiple times we shouldn't be mad demographic-centered things exist -- We should simply make and advocate for more things that cater to groups who have gone without. AKA men who have a lack of male-centric mental health groups, centers, and clinics. The solution isn't 'get rid of women's only therapy groups', it's 'we need to make more men's only therapy groups'.",Katviar,11yjhrl
136,"I do agree with that actually, women exclusive spaces are important. I guess I'm a bit sad for OP, I just wish for specific things like that (that involve BPD/certain other conditions that already have trouble receiving therapy) they offered some alternatives, maybe an alternative space in a different smaller building for people who are ok with a mixed space.

0,"In my defense, I messaged my doctor for my anxiety meds and they said they'd give me *1* month now but I needed to make an appointment for more, and there were no appointments for 4 months.

Ipso facto, its the medical establishment who failed me, not vice versa. 

[It's especially crazy because I go in every 6 months for my ADHD meds to get renewed, it's not like I expect continuous meds without check-ins. But because *they* forgot to give me a depression screening at my last one, a survey that takes 30 seconds to fill out, somehow the meds I'd been on for over a year and a half were too dangerous to give without reconfirming I'm still mentally ill.

i've had so many people violate my ""please dont dm me vents unless i ask"" rule that it's just caused me to lose my fucking mind: i can't take this shit anymore. i'm just so so miserable and not even the medicine fucking works anymore. i've had some of my close friends tell me to ""be kind"" and assume the best, but i'm not

56,"The most effective treatment for BPD is therapy, especially DBT because it was created specifically for those with BPD. Because of the rapidly changing nature of BPD (ex: going from feeling super happy to super angry really quickly, general mood instability) psychiatric medication isn‚Äôt as effective for BPD as it is for other mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. 

But medication can be helpful when used as part of a broader treatment plan that also includes consistent therapy and practicing skills/healthy coping mechanisms. The most commonly prescribed meds are mood stabilizers/anti-psychotics, most are in the same family as Abilify, but this family of medications can lead to a side effect called Tardive dyskinesia in some people (myself being one of them lol), but it‚Äôs not overly common. There are alternative mood stabilizers like Lamictal/Lamotrigine, but that specific med can have dangerous side effects if not taken consistently. 

Antidepressants and anti anxiety meds can also be helpful in terms of treating anxiety and depression like symptoms, but are less likely to be effective in those with BPD on their own. I apologize for info-dumping, I hope this was helpful!",batalieee,tzbw73

I don't know how to feel about it. I'd be curious to know how many subscribers/active users have been diagnosed specifically with borderline personality disorder. I know a lot of people think this is a bipolar subreddit. 

I appreciate the group outlet, from and for, people with various mental health struggles. However I don't want people coming here, seeing memes that don't *really* apply to BPD, then think they have it and self-diagnose. It's a complex diagnosis and not one you'd want incorrectly I don't imagine.

5,I had a psychiatrist that didn't really care who I could be honest with. Was bummed when she retired. Then I went to a new one and an intake form said prior substance abuse would disqualify me from the nonpharmacologic treatment I was seeking so I lied. About to have an appointment with another new one closer to me and I'm lying about that too. I don't want to be denied certain drugs or treatments because I've used in the past. Use doesn't always equal abuse. Using or even abusing one drug does not mean you're going to abuse drugs with legitimate use. The medical community needs to pull their head out of their asses on that.,eac061000,vwwx1s
6,"Don't know if I can find any providers that would be ok with my usage, honestly. I just don't get how they judge you less for using one hard drug (alcohol) vs any other hard drug. Pretty sure alcohol abuse is more dangerous than amphetamine abuse.",Self_bias_res1stor,vwwx1s
7,I've been a good noodle for about a month now and only drink moderately. I'm totally open about me having a drink or two a night to them.

8,"That's a good way to possibly not get life saving medication in the future. I don't even touch benzos recreationally but what if I need one eventually for a good reason? Pain meds in case I get hurt? All because I abuse stimulants here and there could ruin that for me.

I'll tell my damn therapist when it's not actively harmful for me to.",Self_bias_res1stor,vwwx1s
9,Exactly. I don't like opiates. They don't make me feel good but they sure as hell work for pain. I'd never abuse them. Losing access to those just because I like stimulants too much isn't worth revealing to my doctor.,Self_bias_res1stor,vwwx1s
10,"amphetamine abuse is still dangerous, and no provider will probably be okay with your usage because it is dangerous. while the stigma for amphetamines is worse despite being comparable (long-term abuse resulting in death), sudden death with amphetamine abuse is much more common (heart attacks, blood pressure spikes). it is pretty important that you stop using if you are aware that you are abusing the medicine/drug. while it sucks to lose access to medicines that may be helpful to you (like other schedule one medicines), they are not worth their potential to abuse. there are other options for pain and anxiety management. part of recovering from addiction is coming to terms with a lack of control around hard substances, which is by no means easy or comfortable",Ovrzealous,vwwx1s
11,"They'd treat you the same.
Depending upon how the substance is physically impacting upon your body and physiology, that's all they take into account really.

It's good that you've told them about the alcohol consumption.
I'd suggest that you tell them in manner that comes from pride and joy.
E. G. ""hey, guess what! I've been able to take back heavily on my other substance abuse issue."" 

They'll congratulate you on your success, you'll reduce your risk substantially of not getting of the drug course you want and, the medical team gets more information about you, that they need to help you out. 

Be open and honest, even if it's uncomfortable at times. 
Even if the administration of the substances is somewhat questionable. 
They'll understand why you do it and, contemplate a plan of action of how to improve moving forward",WolfKingofRuss,vwwx1s
12,"I know what you mean,

13,"I understand, but you also run the risk of dangerous interactions with your prescription meds and drugs. Please be very careful. There are also anonymous drug helplines that can give information about interactions without it going on your medical file.

14,"Have seen people go through palliative care denied pain medications because of past abuse of unrelated class of drug. Would rather not be dying of cancer (Lord knows I'm high risk with my family history and smoking) without proper pain meds buddy 

""Power through the pain"" is alright for some minor procedures but I think if I have a surgery/extreme dental work a Vicodin would be well worth it.

17," you are thinking pretty far ahead insofar as palliative care and potential future surgeries, surely you understand that continuing to abuse hard drugs like alcohol/amphetamines will rocket you to the hospital much faster right?

if you get to the point that many get to - dying of liver failure, or heart failure, due to drug use, it is quite literally one of the most painful and agonizing ways to go. 

Look. I understand that choosing to not tell your therapist about your drug habits is your way to prepare for disastrous negative outcomes in the future. I know that it seems like it‚Äôs not that big of a problem and that you can handle it without help or that they‚Äôll just overreact and take your access away without really understanding. I just hope you consider the other disastrous outcomes that can happen if you remain going on benders without getting help: in no uncertain terms, it will kill you, in a pretty agonizing and slow way.",Ovrzealous,vwwx1s
18,"the first part of quitting is deciding to quit, yes",Ovrzealous,vwwx1s
19,"I don't deny my use is bad for my health. I'm addicted to nicotine, told multiple doctors, yet they wouldn't deny my medications for me being addicted to nicotine far more than any other substance I use. I have an easier time putting any other drug down than nicotine. When I go on videogame benders playing 8+ hours a day, I don't have people telling me I'm strictly forbidden from games. I'm addicted to fatty foods and caffeine ,I don't have arbitrary food and caffeine restrictions placed upon me. Even my drinking is considered within normal bounds (1-2 a day ) but using that substance  doesn't get me barred from future meds

I'd love to be open about my usage if I could trust the medical system to act in good faith towards me just for revealing any illicit substance use",Self_bias_res1stor,vwwx1s
20,"having an addiction makes addictive drugs really dangerous, to the point where you are better off without them. if it is true that you go on benders for games, caffeine, and fatty foods, then you may need someone to tell you that you are banned from them, to help you regulate your behavior: them telling you ‚Äúyou are banned‚Äù is not what makes the behavior harmful; what makes it harmful is that it negatively affects other areas of your life (your job, health, relationships, etc).

It‚Äôs not all stigma. Amphetamine addiction is treated harshly because of its potential to completely wreck your life if you remain addicted to it. An untreated amphetamine addiction will ruin your life more than losing access to opioids and benzodiazepines (or other schedule 1 drugs). It increases your mortality by 4x (similar to alcohol or heroin addiction) and can cause brain damage, heart attack, and stroke. 

So yes losing access to other drugs is a negative. But it is not worth keeping an addiction untreated. Because losing opioids like pain medicine or benzodiazepines like anxiety meds may be painful. But amphetamine addiction, alcoholism, and nicotine addiction WILL kill you. It‚Äôs not worth your life man",Ovrzealous,vwwx1s
