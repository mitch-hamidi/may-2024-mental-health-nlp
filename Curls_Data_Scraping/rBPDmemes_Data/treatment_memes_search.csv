41,stuff happened that made me want to vent about this,"I opened up to my roommate about my BPD, she didn‚Äôt know what it was, so I explained it to her and she was basically like ‚Äúoh I think I have it too then, I have a lot of mood swings haha.‚Äù 

I was talking to my best friend and I told him about how I‚Äôm so jealous and paranoid that I once stalked my bf outside his work to make sure he wasn‚Äôt talking to any other girls (not proud of this). He called it ‚Äúbased.‚Äù He also brags about his gf being crazy possessive, going off if he talks to another girl, etc., even though she‚Äôs basically forcing this behavior (she only started acting like that after playing The Coffin of Andy and Leyley). 

My former roommate and I were talking about our psych classes and she described people with BPD as manipulative and bad people essentially, yet she was also the type to romanticize being ‚Äúpsycho.‚Äù This was before I told her I had BPD, and that comment is why I took so long to open up about having it.

And finally, what caused me to make this post: in one of my psych classes we were discussing the stigmatizing of certain psychiatric illnesses. People were speaking up about their experiences having autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar, and even someone else with BPD spoke up too, so I decided to share my experience. After class, a guy came up to me and told me I ‚Äúlook like I have BPD,‚Äù to which I was like wtf. And then he started hitting on me, I told him I have a boyfriend, and his response? ‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs lucky, I‚Äôve always wanted a hot crazy goth girlfriend.‚Äù I shit you not, I fucking wish I was joking. I had no words. And he wasn‚Äôt even a neckbeard type either. He looked normal, kinda cute and jock-y even, which somehow makes this even more sad.

55,When nothing helps and nothing works and you're supposed to just deal with it ,"Insurance is fucked. I hate it. The whole fucking healthcare system in America is bullshit.

Nothing I've tried has worked. I've felt like shit for years. We're getting desperate and looking into TMS, ETC, and Spravato/esketamine.

Except my insurance straight-up just doesn't cover TMS. 

ECT? Yeah, that's covered... at facilities 2.5+ hours away. 

Spravato? A mix of both. It's like an hour and a half away, AND the medication itself isn't covered by insurance.

I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm running out of options and ran out of hope a long time ago. By the way it looks, I'm just gonna have to deal with it...

Until I can't, and I don't know how long that will be.

And all of this fucking shit is because these fucking companies bribed their way to where they are now and completely fucked everyone. Now, because they can't play nice with certain places, I either have to make inordinately long trips, or just do without and feel like shit. 

I hate this. I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it.

He called me a bitch, annoying, stupid, etc and he never apologized because he insists he wasn‚Äôt in the wrong. I‚Äôm seriously considering breaking up with him because I have the feeling I‚Äôm just prolonging the inevitable and this relationship is doomed to fail but I‚Äôm so scared to lose him. Despite how he gets when he‚Äôs mad, he‚Äôs generally a very good boyfriend and I‚Äôm scared to let him go. It‚Äôs the best relationship I‚Äôve had so far. He‚Äôs very loyal. He spoils me and pays for a lot of my stuff and most of the time makes an effort to come see me, and he takes care of me. I‚Äôm so codependent on him I don‚Äôt know what to do without him. I‚Äôm an immigrant so I don‚Äôt have family here in the US besides my immediate family, so his family is like my family. I also have social anxiety so I don‚Äôt have friends except for online, his friends are my friends and they‚Äôre the only reason I have any social life. We don‚Äôt live together or anything but still our lives are so enmeshed. But I‚Äôm so tired, the past month has been amazing and our relationship went smoothly but whenever we argue I get so depressed I genuinely want to give up if you know what I mean. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to break up with him, I don‚Äôt want to make any decisions when I‚Äôm probably splitting, I just needed to vent I guess.",1699310769.0,False,36,0,needygameroverdose,None,17pfhr4,https://i.redd.it/k99eigdd3tyb1.jpg

92,BPD girl with abandonment issues and my hot psychiatrist is leaving me and I‚Äôm having a mental breakdown: the electronic boogaloo,I‚Äôve had the same psychiatrist for a while and we‚Äôve gotten super close. I can joke with him and feel 100% comfortable telling him anything (it also helps that he‚Äôs incredibly hot and we matched on tinder but that‚Äôs a different story) about a month or two ago he told me he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to see me anymore due to him switching to pedi patients only. I can‚Äôt shake the empty feeling of being abandoned all over again. I even cried to him about how he‚Äôs leaving me ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don‚Äôt want to have to get comfortable with another psychiatrist and spill my guts all over again.
