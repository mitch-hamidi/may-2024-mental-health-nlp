 I'm so fking high right now. ü§£ü§£ü§£ 

So, if you don't know, one of my size only needs about 300 or 400mg to have a nice trip. And I took 700mg like ""wow, directions""ü§£ü§£ 

I'm in the warm fuzzy space out phase. Zero anxiety right now. No worries or fears.

28,Thought I share some kinda poetry,"Pretty cheesy, wrote this in therapy,

tried to write one ""poem"" each day,

&#x200B;

For my cat.

Mr Miaui, my therapy cat¬†

I've got a cat named Mr. Miaui  
My therapy pet, he's always by my side  
When the world gets too heavy, he's my saving grace  
His soft purrs and gentle touch, keep me in a better headspace

Mr. Miaui, my therapy cat,  
With razor-sharp claws and a sleek, black coat,  
He's always there to calm me down,  
When the world is spinning round and around.

Sometimes life can be a fight  
And the battles seem too much to bear  
But with Mr. Miaui by my side  
I know I have a friend who cares

He's seen me at my highest highs  
And my lowest lows, where I could barely survive  
But Mr. Miaui never judges, never criticizes  
He's just happy to be there, to see me rise

Mr. Miaui, my therapy cat,  
He's always by my side,  
With his purring and his soothing meows,  
He helps me to survive.

When life gets tough and the world is dark  
Mr. Miaui is my shining spark  
His eyes, like emeralds, pierce through my soul  
And his love is the one thing that makes me whole

Mr. Miaui, my savior in fur  
When life seems unbearable, he's my cure  
He brings me comfort, he brings me peace  
And in his eyes, all my worries cease

When I'm feeling down and out,  
And the weight of the world is too much to bear,  
Mr. Miaui jumps up on my lap,  
And he reminds me that he's always there.

In moments of great despair  
Mr. Miaui is always there  
His presence, calm and serene  
Is all I need to stop the screams

Through the ups and downs, he's been there  
A constant presence, always aware  
He's the one who understands  
The complexities of my human demands

Mr. Miaui, my therapy cat,  
Brings me peace when my mind's attacked,  
Fur soft as silk, purring so sweet,  
He's the one who never judges me.

In his eyes, I see a world of grace  
A reminder to slow down, to embrace  
The simple things in life, to replace  
The chaos with calm, and find my place

When my thoughts swirl and my heart races,  
Mr. Miaui sits still, calmly faces  
My anxious moods, my frantic mind,  
He brings me back to the present time.

In moments of sorrow, when tears flow,  
Mr. Miaui's there, to let me know,  
That I'm not alone, that he cares,  
With a gentle nudge and a loving stare.

When I'm feeling down, he senses it all  
He curls up in my lap, never to stall  
His soft fur, a calming touch  
Mr. Miaui, I love you so much

Through the ups and downs of my days,  
Mr. Miaui never strays,  
He's my constant, my rock, my guide,  
My loyal companion by my side.

When the world feels harsh and cruel,  
Mr. Miaui reminds me to be cool,  
To take things slow, to breathe and rest,  
To find comfort in his furry chest.

As the night falls and I prepare to sleep,  
Mr. Miaui curls up at my feet,  
A purring ball of love and grace,  
A warm reminder of life's embrace.

Mr. Miaui, my therapy cat  
With fur as black as the abyss  
He brings me comfort, he brings me peace  
In a world that's full of madness

He may not speak my language  
But he understands me like no other  
And when I'm feeling down and out  
He's the one who brings me out of the gutter

Mr. Miaui, my therapy cat,  
He's always there, never falls flat,  
With his purrs and gentle touch,  
He eases my pain, it means so much.

When I'm feeling down and out  
And the weight of life is too much to bear  
Mr. Miaui jumps up on my lap  
And suddenly, I don't feel so scared

I never thought a cat could mean so much  
But Mr. Miaui is more than just a pet  
He's the one who keeps me going strong  
His love is a beacon in a world that's wrong

Mr. Miaui, my therapy cat,  
A furry friend, always where I'm at,  
Purring by my side, when I'm feeling low,  
He helps me cope, and helps me grow.

When I come home, he greets me at the door  
His eyes so bright, his purrs I adore  
He rubs against my legs, his love so pure  
My therapy cat, my heart is sure

Mr. Miaui, therapy cat,  
Bringing peace where there was once combat,  
With a purr and a meow,  
He'll make all your troubles go.

When I'm stressed, he feels it too  
He cuddles me close, as if he knew  
His soft fur, his gentle purr  
He makes my worries all a blur

Mr. Miaui, my therapy cat  
My salvation in this troubled world  
With every purr and every meow  
He makes my heart unfurl

He knows just when I need him most  
When I'm feeling lost and alone  
He's always there to comfort me  
And make me feel like I'm at home

When I come home from a long hard day,  
Mr. Miaui greets me, ready to play,  
He jumps in my lap and purrs up a storm,  
All my worries just seem to transform.

Mr. Miaui's a warrior at heart,  
He chases toy mice and never falls apart,  
But when I'm sick or feeling down,  
He stays by my side and never makes a sound.

Through the highs and lows of life  
Mr. Miaui's been by my side  
His love and comfort is my light  
In a world that can be dark and wide

Mr. Miaui is a force to be reckoned with  
His claws are sharp, but his heart is big  
He's got the power to chase away the blues  
And make everything right, no matter what I'm going through

When the world feels like too much to bear  
I know that Mr. Miaui will be there  
He'll sit on my lap and cuddle up close  
And I know that's when I need him the most

His big yellow eyes look up at me  
As if to say, ""Everything will be okay""  
And suddenly, I know he's right  
With him by my side, I can win the fight

Mr. Miaui, my therapy cat,  
He's always there, to counteract,  
The stress and worries, that come my way,  
He's my constant companion, day by day.

When the weight of the world is too much to bear  
And I feel like I'm drowning in despair  
Mr. Miaui jumps up on my lap  
And suddenly, the world is not so crap

With his playful antics, he can make me laugh,  
He's the best medicine, when I'm feeling sad,  
He's always eager, to lend a paw,  
Mr. Miaui's love, has no flaws.

He's more than just a pet to me,  
He's a friend, a family,  
He's the one who knows me best,  
My therapy cat, he's truly blessed.

Mr. Miaui, my therapy cat  
With his soothing purrs, he's where it's at  
He's always there when I need a friend  
My furry companion until the very end

Thank you, Miaui, for being there  
In my darkest moments, you truly care  
You're more than a pet, you're a friend  
With you, my heart and soul can mend

So if you're feeling lost and alone  
Just remember, you're not on your own  
Find yourself a therapy cat like mine  
And you'll have a friend for all of time

&#x200B;

Take your time to purr....
