I‚Äòm from Germany and got the diagnose about 3 years ago. I found this sub last year and it‚Äòs helping me ever since ü´∂üèª  
That‚Äôs why my goal is to keep this a safe place for everyone who needs it and wants to be part of this. 

You can help us by reporting harassment and stigma, it will make it easier to investigate on those comments/users. 

I hope I can do great work here!
