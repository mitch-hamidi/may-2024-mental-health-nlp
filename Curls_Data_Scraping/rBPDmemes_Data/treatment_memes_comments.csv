71,">I think semantics play a huge role in this debate. For some (including me), recovery or being cured means there‚Äôs no need for maintenance.

All minds need maintenance, all bodies need maintenance. BPD is profoundly environmental. The way it neurpsycologically functions is complex, but essentially that's the wrong way to think about it. There is technically no disease, and no cure, there is no diagnosis that describes more than a spread of loose traits.

What I mean is that it's possible too love and be close too people, to not be suicidal, too be emotionally healthy and calm in the long-term, to not be emotionally reactive, too not disassociate, too be nonreactive to abandonment, too not exist in a state of constant agony.

BPD is a structure, and one that stems from a lack of identity. It extends into trauma, and through that can do all sorts of harm too the consciousness.

Heal the identity, and you heal the source of the pain.

Heal the trauma, and you have the ability too get close too people again.

>And while therapy can help people overcome the debilitating effects, why do we want so bad to make it seem like something that must go away for a worthy life?

People's lives are already worthy before and after, however as you know BPD sucks ass. Freeing yourself from the haze so you can love and be happy would be absolutely amazing.

75,"Hehe well I'll give an explanation of mine and you can provide yours.

I'm going into critical (neuro)psychology, and have spent years putting together this diagnosis.

My BPD stems from years in isolation, abandonment, systematic abandonment,  and a predisposition too emotional reactivity. Specifically this developed proclivity too react too situations where I feel helpless with extreme nervous system states.

I had pure quiet BPD, and existed in a state of abject and complete disassociation, undetectable even too therapists I saw, except when I randomly melted down when I got too close too someone.

It's likely codependant with OSDD, meaning that as I enter these states, I fully loose emotional memories, any sense of time  and enter a shell identity. My borderline and OSDD relate directly.

I have long since debated between qBPD and CPTSD, however the lack of stable identity, and history of unstable relationships seems like a hard tell.

78,"Thank you for sharing. It's good that you are doing your research. And please don't take this the wrong way, but to me it seems like your understanding of BPD is all based on your opinions and research from biased observations. I am not saying you are or aren't BPD. I genuinely have no idea and am not even thinking about that. But what you have described is not a standard, as there really isn't a standard. Even the 9 criteria look wildly different on people who experience them, as I'm sure you can see based on memes here alone. 

I got diagnosed in 2017, during a crisis by ""the BPD expert"" of my city. I had no idea what BPD was besides the ""crazy ex girlfriend"" trope, and that alone made me incredibly offended to be associated with that. It took me 3 years to give DBT a try, and I did it for a little less than 18 months (which is the maximum time you can do DBT -- complicated healthcare system here but basically you technically can only do it once in your life). I graduated DBT because per what the books were saying, I was doing fine. I had a job, paid my bills on time, had a life partner, was pregnant and my therapist felt I was going to be a good and safe parent, I don't explode on people, I was way less toxic in my interpersonal relationships (I had none left lmao) etc. etc. etc. But me ""graduating"" DBT is based on current societal expectations of what ""doing good"" looks like. I feel like a lot of people with mental illness are forced to view our struggles through a 21st century capitalistic lens. Add to that the many other intersections of oppression/privilege and you get a whole mess. What opened my eyes some time ago was when I read somewhere that apparently a lot of those shamans in traditional cultures have some form of psychosis, many are full on schizophrenic. Yet they are respected members of their societies and are seen as having a ""plus"", instead of a handicap. The way their societies viewed them turned what is considered a disability here, into a positive gift there.

With BPD, of course a lot of people experience objectively harmful behaviours, thought processes and life habits. But a lot of people are just different, and their difference isn't adapted for the culture or current times they live in. That's it. It's a difference in how your brain works, based mostly on trauma, but not even always. Some people with BPD have never experienced trauma yet their brains do the thing lol. So can we really pretend to know exactly what works and what doesn't? If therapy is all about ""being outwardly functional"", is it really recovery or conformity? A lot of autistic people are taking therapies to learn to unmask, and I feel like a lot of PDs could benefit from this kind of shift in the way we view ourselves as well. Many people with BPD are objectively neither good or bad. We're just different. 

TL;DR : Mental illness is not as exact of a science as we want it to be, and I wish we could view it through a human lens and not a rigid academic sense only, when the academic side of things is not precise or often up to date with current realities.",yikkoe,18yf51e

This quote is icky, not gonna lie to you. I just feel like it's a bit of an unfortunate view of mental disorders. Because lots of people with BPD ""have a life"". Have goals. Have active careers. Have manageable or even enjoyable social networks. But they still have BPD. 

Our mental illness is complicated and highly debated. That's why I believe what I believe based on observation, without of course pretending to know better than anyone. But what I do know is that there is no concrete 100% factual answer to this, and a lot of people are incredibly biased so of course their observations will be biased as well.",yikkoe,18yf51e

When I had all of those things my BPD went into a state of remission.

The only difference I guess is I personally have no beef with being seen as mentally ill, but the connotation of it is what I find issue with. Which I guess is also what they have issue with, again just a difference in semantics. All in all, I really wish we didn't see mental illnesses as something that must be gone. Like, I have BPD and it is how my brain is. I was blessed to not deal with overtly harmful behaviours, my harmful thoughts are manageable enough to keep up with current life expectations, and the way I deal with my emotions is objectively okay so I am privileged in that and cannot speak for everyone. But my emotions are not wrong. They may be too much for most people to handle, but they are never wrong. I don't want to get rid of them, and I wish BPD ""recovery"" wasn't all about getting rid of objectively harmless traits. The fact that it gets in the way of keeping a job doesn't mean it's objectively bad lmao it just means jobs and work culture isn't adapted to our brain.

It's such a vast and complex conversation that touches on literally every aspect of human existence. It touches on ableism of course, but also classism, sexism, racism ... list goes on. We would need to dismantle so many systems of oppression, we would need to free ourselves from capitalistic values in order to really allow mental illnesses and neurodivergence to be free of stigma. A daunting task. I'm not sure I'll ever see it happen in my lifetime but I hope one day humankind will change.",yikkoe,18yf51e

Bipolar and depression are mood disorders. However those too are disassociation+identity cycles neuropsycologically.

52,"A diagnosis of BPD is largely based on external behavior. Self-harm, desperate attempts to avoid abandonment, relationship difficulties due to black-and-white thinking, impulsivity, things like that. It's possible to make enough progress that those behaviors are no longer the default response to situations that used to trigger them and, when that happens and is sustained for long enough, the diagnosis no longer fits. At that point, it might be better to say that the condition is in remission rather than cured (since it's unfortunately still possible to experience a relapse), but the diagnosis can be, and often is, removed.

Of all the named personality disorders in the DSM-V, BPD has probably the best available evidence for successful treatment methods. While DBT is considered the standard first-line treatment because of its demonstrated efficacy for many (although by no means all) people with BPD, other types of therapy have also been studied to a lesser degree.

Of course, someone who recovers from BPD will virtually always have remaining problems that need treatment, since the condition is so often rooted in trauma. Quality of life is usually greatly improved, though, and other, lingering issues are more easily approached than when you still meet the criteria for BPD.",MadotsukiInTheNexus,17a4mcm

New person has come into my life. 

Old behaviour: sacrifice my wellness to maintain proximity

New behaviour: how am I feeling? I think I‚Äôd like to hang up the phone now & get some sleep. I don‚Äôt want to hang up the phone but I cannot be like everyone else, I cannot make exceptions with boundaries

Old behaviour: Wow I want to be around this person all the time!! Let me do everything to secure more time together!!! I‚Äôll entertain plans with other people less as a result!!!

New behaviour: Actually although that day is sooner & would give us more time together, I actually wanted to do something else that day with my friends & wanted to solidify those plans with them tomorrow, I am okay with not constantly being aware of this person

Old behaviour: I want us to be together forever & I never want you to leave. I want to ability to be around you as much as humanly possible!!

New behaviour: what does developing an fp feel like? How often am I thinking about this person? This is some warning signs of an FP, I think I‚Äôll fill my days with other things & remember that I have more to offer myself than any person will offer me in exchange for my obsession 

Old behaviour: I am not in the mood for sex. I will entertain their sexual advances out of an obligation that does not exist but I feel compelled to 

New behaviour: This feels like something I do not want. I will share this with them & we can exit this situation. Intimacy & affection are nice & can be expressed in ways that I am more willing to participate in. 

Three words basically. Interrogation of self.

You need to know WHY you‚Äôre developing an obsession with people, then recenter yourself because YOU deserve it. Pinpoint the behaviours & rewire yourself. Just start with your thought process. Catch FPs early CATCH THEM EARLY!!!! Distance is okay!! Creating distance between you & a potential or current FP is okay because ultimately refusing to circumvent your actions will just enable you further & you‚Äôll be miserable. WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO BE MISERABLE?? YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY

My last FP was a final straw to me, honestly I didn‚Äôt even like them that much. I kinda cringed so hard after it was all over I said ‚Äúnever again‚Äù & I basically police myself to bits (then rebuild!!) 

My self esteem has never been better. I just feel good. Not ecstatic, not fantastic, just good. I can have four moods all day. Sleepy in the morning, happy in the afternoons, sad for an hour or two if something provoked it (hearing bad news for instance).

2,"in my personal experience, one of the things that helped most with my bpd is stability. i was scared for the same reasons. whn i first moved into where i am now i would scream, cry, hit the walls, hit myself, argue with my housemate every day and lament over the fact that i could not get help because i was terrified. i was terrified of who i would be without this mental illness i'd had my entire life. i didnt want to find out who i'd be - what if i was boring, what if i was completely different, what if i didnt know what to do with myself, what if my friends didnt want to be friends with me anymore ?

after a little while, the fact that the people i had around me were 100% not leaving, that my housemate wasnt going to kick me out, even after the 10th friday in a row of me screaming and crying and hiding under the island in the kitchen. my bpd started to get better. the symptoms were presenting less often and less severely.

and its amazing. so much has changed from who i used to be, i didnt know this is who i'd be when i started getting better and it's honestly so relieving and amazing.

looking back at what i used to be like - unhealthy coping mechanisms, intense and aggressive splitting, mood swings, self harm, crying and crying and crying - it feels the other way around now. im cant believe what i used to be like.

it didnt 'cure' me, of course it didn't, but having someone around me who cares and helped me through each step helped SO much.

seeing a therapist regularly and having that stability of having someone who actually knows what they're talking about helping you and seeing you on a regular basis will be so so good for you. you'll have the benefit of the stability and also the fact that. y'know, they're a therapist and can help you train your brain in ways to manage your symptoms, cope, and help yourself.

0,"Step 1 is accepting personal responsibility for your own actions and your past mistakes. Own your past and make peace with who you were. It won't stop the pain, nor the nightly cringe reliving those memories. It will however start you on the path to being able to improve who you are today. Each day, small things that may seem inconsequential in the grand scheme of things such as simply complementing someone's outfit for no other reason then because you noticed the effort they put into it. It will feel sometimes/ a lot of the time especially at the start that you're simply masquerading as a good person when deep down you see yourself as evil.

But every day that you carry that energy and dedication to improving yourself and the lives of those around builds the character of who you become in the future. It armours you against the self hatred, pain and self destructive tendencies. 

&#x200B;

Eventually, over time, you find that voice inside you telling you you're worthless or the world would be better off without you or that you're a fake who is simply fooling everyone with your pretend good person act gets a little easier to refute. It gets to the point that it's no longer the dominant self belief that you are fundamentally flawed and broken. Merely the equivalent to a scar that was once a wound that was able to heal because you stopped picking at it and focused on taking steps towards healing yourself.

I'm no physician or mental health expert, merely someone who's had that same realisation. Take personal accountability, take steps towards being a better person in whatever ways you can and accept that it is a process you will have to bear the pain of as you heal.

I'd personally recommend cognitive behavioural therapy to help you be able to identify your thought patterns and negative self talk before they cause your mental and emotional state to spiral out of your control. However, we're all different, you can only do what feels right to you. 

At the end of the day, we have to find a way to be able to live with ourselves. So do what you need to do in order to grow beyond who you were in the past to become who you'd like to be in the future.

2022 and 2023 were really chaotic for me, but here we go. Last year I was hitting a rock bottom. I HAD to start treatment for the first time in my life because I tried suicide. I went to the psych ward and there I was diagnosed with BPD. But before that, I was already going crazy for a while. Anyways, last year I had fucking three FPs. One of them I met on the psych ward. And all of them were like a vivid intense toxic romance that ended very fast. The last two hurt me pretty bad, and they clearly were difficult people since the beginning (I only fall for difficult people, they take me to paradise before ruining everything. I probably do the same thing). After I started taking my treatment seriously, I no longer want these kinds of people, but I still don't like normal people enough.

Besides that, I had to get a full time job and started living by myself. I used to live with my brother, but he couldn't handle my BPD anymore and basically kicked me out. In the beginning it was really difficult, but it was the reason I started taking my treatment seriously because I REALLY needed the job if I wanted a place to live. And with all that, I have way less time to give people attention, and less time to think about them. But the treatment is the main reason of course.

I had to drop college, but who cares. I will get back, and my job is in my area of knowledge. I still constantly dream with the last two FPs to this day.",raquellab,18djosd

You put yourself in a really vulnerable position to try to teach people about it and hopefully make things better for yourself or others, and it sounds like it ended in the worst possible outcome. It sucks that you got hurt like that.

I think that for the most part people either have no experience with bpd and so they just think it‚Äôs haha funny quirky because that‚Äôs what they see online, or they have had a bad experience with someone with bpd and have seen how bad it can get when people with bpd are at their worst moments, and so they think that everyone with bpd is just like that.

5,"Hey btw, BPD has a **FAR** better prognosis with regular treatment than a vast majority of mental illnesses. 

In fact, BPD is becoming more understood to be one of the few mental disorders that can be remitted through therapy. 

Unlike depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, etc., BPD is not a disorder related to chemical imbalances. It is, in fact, a big web of unhealthy (but valid) defense mechanisms that were twisted together in our childhoods. 

There‚Äôs a big idea in psychology known as ‚Äúneuroplasticity,‚Äù and that idea is that our neurons in our brain physically form themselves into pathways that subconsciously guide our actions as we repeat behaviors. This causes us to have certain unhealthy (a lotta healthy ones too tho) behaviors that our brains just initiate without us even making the decision to. 

It‚Äôs made for survival, when you repeat behaviors in nature, you need to revert to them subconsciously while in danger. But in modern life, it isn‚Äôt quite the same. BPD treatment is entirely based on this idea of neuroplasticity, in that this disorder CAN truly be picked apart by getting deep into the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù of all the things we do 

Sorry if I‚Äôm a bit preachy, but this is something that helped me when I was feeling the ‚ÄúI will never stop feeling this way‚Äù vibe",,kgtqhr

If I spent half the time trying to explain to them that I'm not bullshitting them, we could have moved mountains by now. And I'm 100% certain that my family would drop everything on a dime if I came home with a serious medical condition. BPD honestly seems like a serious medical condition-- especially when one considers that 10% of people with BPD succesfully end their own life. That's a staggering statistic that, to me, indicates it's a deadly disease. I'm not attempting to compare it to cancer, but saying I wish people would have the ""it's time to act and show up for so and so cause they need us"" attitude to BPD that they do to other medical conditions. 

And let's be real here, the stigma towards BPD combined with the massive dollars made in the cancer industry definitely helps skew the way people respond. We have many feel good stories about people supporting cancer on our shows, our news, our movies, our journalism, everywhere-- because people coming together for one another sells and helps to prevent people from expressing their outrage at the financial ruin that cancer treatment entails. BPD doesn't have the same media representation so people don't have experience the ""we can be like the people I saw on TV who came together for this person"" so they don't think to do it. Unfortunately, I think people care more about being like everyone else and having their own ""I did some good"" story that serves to fill the emotional hole that they're feeling from a loved one being ill--""It feels good I was able to do something for them. I needed to be able to help or I was going to lose my mind"" kind of thing, self fulfilling reasons. The ""social credit"" aspect of showing up for your loved one struggling mentally isn't the same, because of stigmas, because most people try to hide that kind of thing than share it with family. It's something they talk about in secret. There's no calls to the aunt's and uncles to share ""oh my gosh they're diagnosed with BPD we really need to come through for them"" it's ""well I haven't told anyone about it cause I don't think it's their business to know something personal like that about you and I don't want you to be embarrassed."" It's stigma, and we all feed into it, and our media conditions us to feed into it, and it's just where we are. 

If we lived in a better world, I think we'd see close friends and family outside holding signs for their loved ones on their first day of new therspy. First day with DBT or Stepps. First day on a new med. First day home from the psych unit. Whatever. It's not ""people should hold parades for every meltdown and episode we experience"" but ""people should hold parades to help support us in our treatment the same way they do to support others for treatment of more culturally accepted illnesses--whatever they may be."" I imagine everyone on this sub would have love for people to come to bat for them, full throttle, the same way people rally around a cancer patient. That's all my point really is (as long as it took to make it lolol)",farleftofgay,kjeqwr

Maybe it would be beneficial to come at it from a different angle? Work out how your brain receives information, what it does with the information, and where it goes from there. Follow the strings of the web, etc. 

It also helps to find as many triggers as possible, even if they fluctuate and only trigger you sometimes, so that you can find a ‚Äúclean‚Äù day in which you‚Äôd be more functional to do the therapies.

I can sympathize with pwNPD because generally it comes from them being abused themselves, but I know of only a handful of people on the internet with NPD who work on themselves and I've never met one myself or have personally seen a pwNPD get ""better."" That being said, only the people with NPD who are especially destructive are noticed and clocked for having NPD, so maybe I have met people that do have NPD and they're working on themselves and I'd never know.

That actually happened to me once where I was dating someone and my BPD Fear of Abandonment¬Æ flared up and I explained to him that I had BPD, and he was like, ""What? You? I couldn't even tell,"" shortly after which he dropped me. (I'm never telling anyone again lol)

Either way, if someone treats you badly, there is no fault in immediately leaving. No one is obligated to be abused for any reason, even if the abuser has a personality disorder. People have rightfully left me before, and I don't and will never fault anyone for leaving me when I act toxic, even though I'm actively working to be healthier.",,xfvks9

34,"The thing is ppl use the exact same logic for ppl w BPD too. People will have had bad experienced with one or more borderlines and demonize the whole group based on those few individuals even though theres like thousands of ppl w bpd who arent terrible and dont treat ppl like shit.

My parents could both definitely qualify for a NPD diagnosis just based on criteria and .. me observing how they are, and they abused and neglected me and are the reason I'm fucked up today but even if they did have NPD and not just narcissistic traits I wont call it narc abuse bc they abused me bc they were shitty parents not because of their NPD (if they have it)

Narcissistic abuse and emotional/mental abuse is the same thing, theres no defining difference other than one abuser having NPD or narcissistic traits and the other abuser not having that. We dont say BPD abuse, depression abuse, autistic abuse - so I dont know why we should say narcissistic abuse

I honestly understand where ur coming from like I do but idk, its kinda harmful to stigmatize a whole group based on a few bad experiences. And the reason why we say cluster b has to stick together is cause stigmatizing one of us will lead to further stigmatization of the entire cluster b. And its already hard for ppl w NPD to get treatment bc therapists look at them as monsters who cant be helped so further stigmatization will also make it even harder than it is for them to get help, and thats not good bc how are they going to improve or get treatment then? :/

58,"(I'm drunk sorry for typos or weird wording)

I def agree with everything you said its just hard for me to ""stick togther"" with people who act very similar to my abusers even if its in a casual and non-abusive way.

Generally I dont wanna associate personally or casually with a narssaist. I understand that may be biased (almost certianly) so unless its someone whos directly abused me I wouldn't tell them specifics, but I dont think its worth bringing up my own trauma forcing myself to be supportive and a part if a community with people who do nothing but trigger me, even if its not their own fault. They can have their space and ill have mine. I can support their treatment from a distance.

I agree stigma effectes acsess to treatment as well,but remember that a lot of people with NPD won't outwardly accept theres something wrong w them even if they have acsess and internally know it. Not saying that makes it okay to stigmatise, I just think its worth noting.  

Personly my ex is diagnosed with NPD and it only came out in an argument where they tried to prove their mentally ill because they have a habit of faking disorders for attention despite being dismissed by multiple drs multiple times for the disorders they publicly claim. They still claim it was bs despite me having sc proof and texts from their mom confirming.

And the other person is my dad who hasn't been dx but my therapist whos seen him dozens of times says he has ""narcissistic traits"" and that if he'd see a psych he'd prob get dx but dosent have the authority to dx him.

So maybe its just my experince, but its also just a product of the disorder they'd not admit smth is wrong unless it benefits them. Which makes even getting dx let alone treatment, hard.

Again I actually agree with everything you said, but atm at least, I dont think it'll mentally be comfortable for me to interact with them. I know their not inherently abusive, same as us, but even their casual tendencies just bring up a lot for me and I don't want to be around that. Maybe that's selfish idk, but keeping my distance is what I want yo maintain.

Edit: also forgot yo add this im all over the place, but im sorry you went through that and im genuinely impressed you can see it in a nuanced light despite all that. I hope ur doing okay and I'm both jealous and proud you can have a compassionate out look on npd!",kanincottonn,xfvks9
59,"Yeah I agree. I think just, since ots _part of the disorder_ to ignore that you have any flaws it just makes me more... hesitant. 

I know theuyre not all abusive so I _want_ to support those who can take a step back and realize its not right how their feeling, but th ppl with NPD whove harmed me have only ever used that dx to seek attention and sympathy. And they were even only dx while trying for their _6th_ autism dx after being denied they were autistic both before amd again after that. They just wanted sympathy and oppression points. And an excuse. I only even know they have it because it was brought up when we argued about their weird disorder faking shit.

I'm also so sorry you went thru that, my dad has ""bpd traits"" according to my therapist whos met him maaaaany times but refuses to see his own therapist so I can't know for sure. It rough, I hope you can heal from that :(",kanincottonn,xfvks9

68,"Yeah, my mother was and is in no exaggerated terms sadistic. Especially towards the end of our relationship when she was at her most abusive, I remember seeing *excitement* in her face when she was able to cause me the most pain. 

She was violently abused as a child and even told me as I was growing up that more than anything, she wanted control, all the time. Being able to control me and hurt me made her feel ultimately powerful (the only thing she's ever wanted all her life), and it didn't matter to her that I was in tremendous  pain, bc she was not capable of empathy and couldn't see anyone past herself.

I think with the majority of pwNPD, the main issue is that it is part of the pathology of the disorder that one of the last things they'll ever do is recognize there's anything wrong with them, bc that means admitting they're not perfect, and that causes their fragile egos too much pain to admit. In general, bc that lack of empathy and introspection is built into NPD, they're far less likely to want to work on themselves or ever start to, making them have way more potential to be abusive and toxic for their whole lives, vs BPD, where we can empathize (*before splitting) and see our faults more honestly, which give us the opportunity to try and fix them.

That being said, seeing some of the new YouTubers with NPD blows my fucking mind. I hope they can change and I root for them.

And with *that* being said, the second someone is abusive to anyone, that person who is being abused has every single right to leave then and there, which is a standard I demand of my behavior, too.",,xfvks9

If not for my childhood friend who was critical of my toxic behavior as we were growing up, I genuinely believe I would have turned out as trapped in narcissism as my mother (I still remember my attitude and thought process before my friend nudged me in the right direction, and when a narcissist does something objectively toxic, I can always understand the mindset they're coming from bc I've been there, too). Instead of being totally narcissistic, I feel like I ended up with ""narcissism lite,"" bc I'm not as far gone in my personality disorder as my mother.

56,"The most effective treatment for BPD is therapy, especially DBT because it was created specifically for those with BPD. Because of the rapidly changing nature of BPD (ex: going from feeling super happy to super angry really quickly, general mood instability) psychiatric medication isn‚Äôt as effective for BPD as it is for other mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. 

But medication can be helpful when used as part of a broader treatment plan that also includes consistent therapy and practicing skills/healthy coping mechanisms. The most commonly prescribed meds are mood stabilizers/anti-psychotics, most are in the same family as Abilify, but this family of medications can lead to a side effect called Tardive dyskinesia in some people (myself being one of them lol), but it‚Äôs not overly common. There are alternative mood stabilizers like Lamictal/Lamotrigine, but that specific med can have dangerous side effects if not taken consistently.

Insurance providers will only pay for treatment if there is a billable charge or diagnosis, so a lot of the time we use ‚Äúadjustment disorder‚Äù (which is a nice way of saying some shit is going on in their life right now) in order for the patient to remain in treatment rather than diagnose someone based on the intake information/ assessments since that info can‚Äôt really paint the ‚Äúfull picture‚Äù.",bornforthis23,qsfl6l

18,"The most important thing to know about bpd is that the the illness does not represent a clearly defined set of people, it‚Äôs not people with cancer or a skin rash. It‚Äôs anyone who happens to match a set of symptoms. The thing we have in common is those symptoms, if you try to look for other commonalities you‚Äôll find some of us are one way, others are another. You can invent your own disorder if you like in a similar way, just come up with some symptoms you think go together. 

Now the major use of a set of symptoms is to prescribe a treatment for everyone who meets the criteria. For example say people with brown hair who like cabbage, look at porn and go on holidays in cold countries. The treatment is dancing, the only way you can guarantee that the group I‚Äôve created is worth even thinking about is if I can prove that dancing does something positive for these people! 

What if I couldn‚Äôt prove that, well that‚Äôs how bpd was at the start. In fact the best treatment now is about 50% effective. Weird, like why? Well people often get better by themselves and all of these treatments are very expensive and take a long time. Another important thing it impossible to do a double blind for this kind of therapy. Giving a placebo therapy would be unethical, because you‚Äôd have to invent an expensive waste of our time that looks exactly the same somehow. Wouldn‚Äôt work. 

So what‚Äôs the answer? How do you help someone with bpd, well I can tell you what helped me, I realised that I do not benefit from the help that other people give me.

It‚Äôs not an easy thing to realise, that even if you got the help you want, that doesn‚Äôt exist you would just hate yourself even more. People won‚Äôt help you, they will attempt to reduce your choices. 

The next thing you figure out is that you aren‚Äôt broken, you are colonised. You don‚Äôt act in your own interest, you are a slave. Maybe someone did that to you intentionally, doesn‚Äôt matter that much. The only thing that should matter to you is your freedom. If you don‚Äôt want to suffer act in your own long term self interest.

The next part is when you realise that actually other people aren‚Äôt just not better than you, they are weak as fuck. They have never gone through the hell your own mind put you through and survived.

A former slave isn‚Äôt always a motivated person, but a runaway slave always is. In their mind they have won their freedom and they need to protect their saviour which is themselves.

They told me that it's not necessary to diagnose it because it's a personality disorder and there isn't treatment specifically for BPD .. but she said we can try to fight the symptoms/intensities with medication.

18,BPD does have hypomanic-like states that are different than Bipolar. It‚Äôs probably more associated with the Cluster B aspects of BPD like grandiosity from narcissism.

I feel like my manic states are more the emptiness that drives reckless/impulsive behaviors. Just my take though.,hippocampfire,khy9ey
19,whats the difference tbh?,timeactor,khy9ey
20,"That may be hypomania. And that would mean you likely also have Bipolar Disorder. What you're describing, especially the physiological effects like insomnia and the tremors, does sound like true hypomania. People with BPD have rapid and severe mood shifts, but not usually the physiological changes that go with true hypomanic and depressive episodes, nor do their episodes last quite as long, although there's no perfect time stamp on either issue. So, my completely armchair and therefore worth almost nothing analysis is that this actually does sound like hypomania. 

This is an important distinction, because the treatment regimens are completely different for the two diseases. Bipolar is largely treatable with medication. BPD is far less so. This is because they are caused by totally different chemical imbalances and underlying issues. There's a totally different relationship that your medication treatment and therapeutic treatment need to have if you have both of these diseases, or have been misdiagnosed, so it's certainly worth getting RO'd for bipolar specifically, because the right diagnosis and therefore treatment can make a ton of difference.

Be well",kharmatika,khy9ey
21,That means that you likely have bipolar as well. You can have both but it is just a fact that BPD does not have mania. It just doesn‚Äôt. I went to school for this. Several psychologists have told me. It‚Äôs just a fact,randomforprivacy,khy9ey

25,"i agree with you that BPD can have states that might resemble hypomania (and i‚Äôve experienced them) but the DSM 5 definition of hypomania is:

‚ÄúA distinct period of abnormally and *persistently* elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.‚Äù 

I go through states like this but they tend to last a couple hours or at MOST a day and half. I think the longevity of these states is really what qualifies them as true hypomania. another difference i think is in BPII these states don‚Äôt seem to have apparent triggers while in BPD they often do (e.g. impulsivity as a reaction to emptiness, intense anger as a reaction to rejection, etc.)

Another thing, BPD mood swings are moment to moment, it‚Äôs a mindset. That‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs a personality disorder and not a mood disorder like Bipolar

Edit: look anywhere you want, the DSM, the internet. You will not find anywhere that says BPD experiences mania.

21,"First thing is to try everything in your power to get treatment, and then actually follow whatever treatment program you get. For example, attending your DBT sessions and doing the assignments and all that. This will help stop the damage, and allow healing to begin. I know this is extremely difficult but the only way to even begin is to try to gain control over things you have the ability to control.

You/we must be very careful about coping mechanisms such as drugs or doomscrolling. We need relief valves but some of them are a trap, and will only make things worse in the long run. 

Start reading, if you don‚Äôt already. Get out in nature if you can. Physical activity affects brain health and emotional control. Activity outside is even better. 

Attempt to improve any relationships you have and try to find a few friends. Companionship and social activity has proven benefits.

As for nature versus nurture, it's clearly both in both cases - in BPD a certain level of emotional instability and separation anxiety is thought to be innate, while in C-PTSD I'm foggier on the details of the nature side of things but I wonder if the extent to which and frequency with which someone dissociates is partly innate, as peritraumatic dissociation is a fairly important risk factor for developing (C-)PTSD.

Unfortunately, people around me understood what I was going through too late,they thought I am attention seeking and stuff,but in reality my depression and this disorder have beaten me quite badly.
Medication that worked for me:
Serlift(Sertraline) a half a pill at 3PM and a pill at 9AM;
Olanzapine a pill at 9PM
Tritico 1/12 a pill at 7PM
Cebrium a pill at 9AM
Romparkin a pill at 9AM
and as supplements Supradyn Energy.
I didn't find a good psychologist or psychiatrist until I got at hospital and received the diagnostic,after that I went to someone that treats this kind of disorder.
If you are depressed try meds,they won't stop the EUPD/BPD, but will stop depression.
I don't know if this would work for you, but I would've been glad to know that I could hospitalize at a treatment facility earlier willfully,instead trying to cut myself in order to show people in how a bad state of mind I was.
