0,I was in the same situation but being misdiagnosed with bipolar 2 for almost a decade. üôÉ,,q2qhls
1,And then you have both BPD and Autism...,,q2qhls
2,All my therapist either were shit. Wouldn't diagnose me. Diagnosed me with bipolar. Or when I lived with my parents said there was nothing wrong with me and only listened to my parents. My last one I had finally sat down and listened and diagnosed me with bpd. It always seems to be the last choice,_TheAmalgamate_,q2qhls
3,I‚Äôm diagnosed with both. Autism at 8 and BPD at 18 üíÄ good luck out there,OCPostings,q2qhls

5,This is me and ADHD,,q2qhls
6,My psychologist doesn't want to diagnose me with BPD because I have autism even though I very clearly am showing all the BPD symptoms...,,q2qhls
7,I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and the person also hinted that I *might* have high-functioning autism.. honestly its one of those moments where you wanna scream. What ELSE could be wrong LOL?,GutsBoi,q2qhls

14,"Me who's been diagnosed with everything in the DSM by different therapists so I have legit no idea what's wrong with me lol. I've had therapists think I'm a narcissist, bipolar, borderline, schizoid, avoidant, (every time I went to a new therapist I got diagnosed with something different and they disagreed with the previous diagnosis) and others who disagree with the other therapists and it's like they're fighting over who's right.

28,"I wish, diagnosing mental illnesses/neurodivergency were easier. It's an exhausting process and going through it, while having no mental resources whatsoever makes it infinitely worse. And then mistakes happen or misdiagnosis or mistreatment and you can't even argue",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls

ASD and BPD, ah what a cluster fuck :)",C0NTRARIUM,q2qhls
33,"It's certainly a possibility, but they are/were both extremely hesitant to test me for both or diagnose me.

34,"I am worried about being autistic for a few years now.
I am finally getting the test soon and I couldn't be happier.
It's just a concern, but I will feel better if I know it for sure.
I get so confused about autism because I can not find much scientific information on the subject. This drives me mad. I mean, what does it even will mean if I am autistic? I am clearly not the ‚Äúclassic case‚Äù/hight support need (please, forgive me if I am using the wrong words), so where is the line between ‚Äúlow support needs‚Äù and neurotypical? This classification will surely change so much over the next years. It's scary and confusing how little people know about autism right now. I hope medicine advances quickly in this area. <3",hellparis75016,q2qhls

38,Thanks! Good luck to you as well,SuicidalSwing,q2qhls
39,"Yeah, it's possible, I guess, but they can't just test me, for some reason, so yeah. Fun times. And then they wonder, why I can't just accept my diagnosis. Maybe because you can't either?",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls

50,"I completely agree. It is also easier to just say, ""Oh yep they're bipolar. Next!""

It honestly ruined my life. It wasn't until I was 19 when I realized I wasn't remotely even close to being bipolar. But ahaha you have mood swings. ü§™

I've been called bipolar irl due to mood swings and the stigma around all of these mental illnesses and false information pisses me tf off.

Anyways sorry for ranting, lmao.",,q2qhls
51,"HOLY HECK! I notice a lot of people getting misdiagnosed with bipolar or autism. They prescribed me lithium and it only lasted 3 months. I would sleep at 5 or 6pm then wake up at 6 am. I felt like I was doing nothing with my life and all I wanted to do was sleep! I'm sorry this is happening with you. Maybe a dumb question but have you brought up the emotional triggers with the psychiatrist and that you've seen no improvement with it on medication?

The only medications that slightly helped was a low dose of fluoxetine it was either 20 or 30 MG. I'm not sure and it was combined with a low dose of diazepam, but now I'm medication free. Sad to say but I'm terrified of medications.",,q2qhls
52,"I agree. I feel it is even worse when you're underage because they'll just pull out the, ""you're still a child and going through a lot."" like no Margaret!

I definitely understand that mistakes happen, but half the time it feels like they don't care that we were misdiagnosed and suffered that long.",,q2qhls
53,That's actually so insane. I'm happy you've been diagnosed but mortified with how long it took.,,q2qhls
54,i have a personal theory that having autism can put you at more risk for developing trauma in the way that  becomes BPD.,panochito,q2qhls
55,Oh yeah. I'm shocked they managed to get both at the same time,,q2qhls
56,I have BPD with lots of friends on the spectrum. There is alot of overlap for sure.,thatisnotmyknob,q2qhls
57,"No matter if it's 'classic' or 'mild' autism, it both goes back to the same thing: difficulty with processing information. You might (especially if you're a girl) look completely normal to the outside world with autism but still struggle a lot everyday because of what's going on on the inside.

Also I agree with you, even the people that are supposed to know about autism, don't know enough about it. Good luck with the test, I hope it will give you some peace :)",,q2qhls
58,"Try looking up stuff regarding Aspergers specifically, and different ways it can present.

63,"""Big"" trauma isn't necessary.

And chronic trauma during childhood and adolescence is often mistaken by sufferers as ""normal"" because it's all they know. 

A good route would be for you to pro-actively read some literature about borderline in order to familiarize yourself, because often clinicians are not very knowledgeable or interested in dealing with these sorts of things (a whole other story...).

https://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Oz-Other-Narcissists-Relationship/dp/0972072837

https://www.amazon.com/Hate-You-Dont-Leave-Understanding-Personality/dp/0399536213

https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748/

https://www.amazon.com/Will-Ever-Good-Enough-Narcissistic/dp/1439129436

The reason for the book on NPD is NPD is very closely related to BPD, and often children of parents are who have NPD develop BPD. 

If you read those and start feeling a lot of emotional resonance, you very likely have BPD. People with true bipolar disorders develop coping skills to deal with the emotional changes caused by bipolar. In borderline it's completely opposite - the behaviors and unhealthy/lack-of coping skills are what causes the disorder.",oO0-__-0Oo,q2qhls
64,"Same. And adderall for awhile for me, which was like gas on a volcano",Justmestillsadly,q2qhls
65,[deleted],,q2qhls
66,"the thing is, i have brought it up before. i told my psychiatrist that i have more trouble with triggers than BPD but she says ""therapy can help you with that"" basically and continues to give me lithium. last time i had a therapist she messaged my grandma and told her i was a ""manipulator"" without further context. i'm assuming it's because i felt insecure to open up to her or wasn't doing my homework... but as a therapist... you'd think these people would know when to use the right word. it was a very negative experience for me because she also tried outing my childhood trauma to my grandma too (in person) when i was literally almost 18 (like 2 months, so disgusting how i got taken advtange of) and wasn't in danger at all! i literally told her this. i just wanna get the fuck off meds but i'm waiting for my next appointment, i stg literally nobody has listened to me for the past 2 years i was at the clinic concerning diagnoses or meds. i was told i'm bipolar and that was it. what a punch in the gut to all my negative experiences in life lol",pokemyiris,q2qhls
67,"I feel like therapists for children and teenagers are worse than the ones for adults. I'm barely not a minor anymore and get treated so differently as opposed to when I was under 18. Every therapist, psychiatrist and psychologist I went to as a minor didn't take my concerns seriously. ""Everyone dislikes puberty, we are all sad sometimes, why don't you draw a picture and we analyse it?"" Like ??? I tried killing myself the first time when I was 9, but sure, puberty is my problem.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls
68,"I think that's very likely, since autistic children have very different needs and ways of communication than neurotypical children and if those aren't sufficiently met during childhood, it can be very traumatic.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls

71,"Hey, thank you so much for saying this. It makes me feel better. I am always second-guessing myself. In this case, it's just a possibility and I am already worrying.

72,"at first her words hurt me because i've never been called that before. i was thinking of every action i've done in those sessions and came to the conclusion that there is absolutely nothing to gain off of manipulating her, therefore why the fuck would i care? can't believe i had such a dumb bitch tell me how to live my life for a year straight with the mentality that ""if you don't open up more, there will be consequences"". i'm sorry you experienced something similar to me, nobody should ever experience this when seeking/trying to get help!",pokemyiris,q2qhls
73,"I feel you. Everyone around me, who's not mentally ill or neurodivergent tells me:'You don't need to know a diagnosis, you just need to figure out what coping skills help the most'. Yeah, no shit, don't you think a diagnosis might be helpful? Also, it would be nice, knowing exactly where I belong. I know, something's not right and I wanna know what exactly.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls
74,"That's actually insane. I was given Adderall for a small amount of time but it actually cracked me out and I said no after the second pill.

75,"I swear people on Facebook will fight over anything. Bipolar and BPD are often confused with each other. People still think BPD stands for bipolar disorder and I have to explain that 100 times.

Don't let her get you down. üå∫",,q2qhls
76,"I'm so so sorry that ever happened to you. That's fucking disgusting and your therapist or psychiatrist whomever it was needs their license taken away for sharing that information. They can only share information if you were going to harm yourself or others. I really understand being misdiagnosed. Honestly, I think my last psychiatrist was the only one who paid attention because I had been to the psych center 4 fucking times and I told him straight up, ""I'm not bipolar. Just because I have mood swings does not mean I'm bipolar."" I explained to him everything (whole life trauma) in two 2 hour sessions and I was diagnosed.

Majority of my life I wasn't taken seriously and was told that my mental illnesses and suicide attempts were just a phase. It gets so exhausting. On top of having an exhausting mental illness and having nobody I just imploded. I hope it gets better and if you need anyone my dms are open!",,q2qhls
77,"That's around the age I overdosed and tried to commit suicide as well but they push it off as us being hormonal teenagers. Which is so so dangerous! I won't get into it but having my parent feed information behind my back as well to my therapist made me lose all trust. I refused to go back to therapy until I was 18.

Minors aren't respected in therapy and the doctors have been known to cross lines in which they can lose their jobs due to it.

I'm just a paranoid shit now and after receiving my diagnoses and maybe 3 months of therapy-I just refuse to get more treatment. I can understand my mental health and I've been working on it at home with resources but I refuse to go to a place that triggers me and I feel unsafe.",,q2qhls
78,"I hate that I went through it because now it's always a constant thought in the back of my head, which makes it so fucking hard to open up to anyone",_TheAmalgamate_,q2qhls
79,I feel you on that. I just want to know why I am the way I am. I want to learn how to be able to communicate and have emotional permanence. I feel like a diagnosis would put me on a path of not only surviving but succeeding. I‚Äôve struggled with relationships (platonic or romantic) for as long as I can remember. It would be nice to have a stable friend group and hopefully a stable partner. Relationships is probably where I struggle the most tbh.,hannh_rse,q2qhls
80,Yeah I had a general practitioner prescribe it and it was bad. Way way volatile,Justmestillsadly,q2qhls
81,"i'm not sure if she even brought up the being in danger or not part about my SA when she told me to get my grandma to have a talk. and basically tried getting the ball rolling by saying ""so, wasn't one of your family members involved?"" LIKE WTFFF BITCH THIS WAS LITERALLY THE PAST PAST? i'd be so happy to know that she lost her license or something one day because i wonder how she treats other patients if i was the one she liked the ""most""? 

and i relate with you so much when you said that just because someone has mood swings doesn't mean they're bipolar because i feel this a lot. i tell my grandma that my pills don't work but she makes me take them regularly or says something like ""if you aren't medicated you can't be in my house."" ugh, life is so stressful right now. i'm surprised i'm not as suicidal as i was in the last 2 years but think i just got mentally stronger or something from all the pain. idk, it's better to think that than my lithium pills actually working this whole time when they probably haven't since they do absolutely nothing for my triggers. so so tiring. also, if you ever need anyone to talk to my dms are open as well! (:",pokemyiris,q2qhls
82,"I completely understand you. I was lucky enough, that my parents didn't push me to go to therapists I felt iffy about, but that also lead to them being like:""Well, take care of it yourself then"" and I was not in the right headspace to find my own therapist at 14/15.
 It's sad, that there aren't enough resources during the time, in which you might actually able to still change something. I wonder how different things could be, if we listened to more to kids and helped them with their worries and concerns, instead of simply pushing them aside.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls
83,"i 100% get you. i have a partner and i tell random people on the internet about more things related to trauma or being mentally ill. shits so hard, opening up is incredibly hard now. tbh, i've began lying more than i used to now than ever probably. i will only use white lies to fit whatever situation i'm in to make it less awkward. lying has saved me so many times from awkwardness and it's sad that i now use deception on people than ""simply"" exposing myself because of these scarring experiences. i'm just SO scared people will find out the true me. i try to be as moral as i can in the world but i still think i'm a terrible person sometimes. lying about my mental health, where i've been, tastes, knowing people, approval, ghosting, denial, emotions, dislikes, likes, etc, has taken over my life now and i embrace it even though it's frowned up to lie. i found out at an early age that lying can prevent so much heartache, thanks ""strict"" parents.",pokemyiris,q2qhls
84,"Exactly. My parents are worried, I might use a diagnosis as an excuse, but I just want an explanation. Please. If you have a specific diagnosis, you can learn strategies against the symptoms of said diagnosis. Everyone who's watched Dr House knows, that diagnosis is important.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls
85,"Uuff I'm sorry to hear. I hope you're doing better now?
I was prescribed Ambien and Wellbutrin by a general practitioner and he almost got me killed.
Ambien has completely wiped my short term memory and Wellbutrin did a number on my mental (overdosed and went into a coma).",,q2qhls
86,"If she continues to treat her patients with such lack of respect and breaking a contract (that all of them have to sign) - she will be fired sooner rather than later. I'm appalled by the way she behaved with you.
Also, medication isn't for everyone. Medication can literally make some people feel worse, lmao. I really wish I could help in some way vs just empty words. Yeah, if they don't have any bad side effects it is better taking them vs being kicked out and I appreciate that! Thank you. üòä",,q2qhls
87,"Yeah, I really wanted therapy and I can understand how my father thought I was just being dramatic considering that every little incident I would freak out. I didn't have a good home life (bad uprising, abuse, etc.) and having a parent who made it worse didn't make me want to go to therapy especially when the go to was, ""you're only doing it for attention, whore.""
The mindset in my household was:
""I'm the adult and you're the child. You do as I say not as I do."" That has mentally warped me so much. If children were listened to and help then maybe they wouldn't go through ruining relationships or going through way more trauma than needed.
Talking about this topic gets me heated so sorry if I keep trailing off.

Also, I don't think most teens are in the right heads pace to find their own therapist. If I was told to find my own therapist I'd push it off until I was was half dead.

Edit: too many typos
brain goes zzzsz",,q2qhls
88,"I am 100% in the same boat. That's a little scary. Added on that it's scary to open up, I tried opening up to my parents and it got blown up back in my face so now its terrifying to do it with anyone expect strangers because at least you wont get rejected in person. My parents were so strict I would just lie and not talk to just please them, which is probably why I'm such a people pleaser to this day",_TheAmalgamate_,q2qhls
89,A diagnosis is freeing in a way. A diagnose lets you be able to really hone in on specific things that‚Äôd you‚Äôd be able to work on. And be able to ‚Äúfind your people‚Äù. It makes the world less lonely to know that you‚Äôre not the only one who feels things similarly to me. And House is my favorite medical show hands down.,hannh_rse,q2qhls

91,You are not alone in this. I had a terrible experience on Wellbutrin as well,kelssssrawr,q2qhls
92,"no, no your words aren't empty at all. this is why i love reddit and listening/sharing experiences and advice because the world doesn't offer me these tools conveniently. it really helps a lot you have idea. 

i want to stop taking meds just to see what it'll be like (haven't been off in prob 2 years) so that'll be interesting next appointment maybe. the medicine helping me the most right now is honestly weed lmao. if i'm feeling depressed and take some, it's crazy how quickly my mood can change for the better unlike what pharmecutical companies can ever provide me with imo. :)",pokemyiris,q2qhls
93,"No need to apologize. This whole ordeal is part of the reason why I'm still not in therapy. I was inpatient for some time and they told me, I urgently need a therapist, but left me off with a not very recent list of phone numbers and the comment, that most therapists don't take people with diagnosed BPD as a patient. Thanks I guess. 
I hate that children are seen as not capable of experiencing emotions. Of course, for you it might seem silly to cry about a fight they had with their ""best friend"", because you know that they will make up soon. But for them it's a real concern. They had a fight and are sad and angry and need comforting, whatever the reason they were fighting about is. In the clinic I met so many people, whose whole life would have been different, if they were treated with respect and dignity while they were kids. Its maddening.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls

95,"I'm so happy I found this sub. Memes have always been my preferred way of communication and while I'm still not sure about my diagnosis, I can still relate to the memes here and people can relate to my memes, so I figure, maybe I'm not that wrong here anyway.

99,"I only say empty words, because I'm a random on reddit, haha. It does help a lot though to understand what others go through and what helps them. I think the only medications that have ever helped were always leaving more towards anxiety medications, lol. Weed is really good. I can only use indicia though because sativa gives me panic attacks.

I think the main issue is that not all but some psychiatrist like to think they know us better than we know ourselves. We know if a medication isn't working once it has been a full month or more. We know how we feel but sometimes they gets pushed aside do to unprofessional and egotistical psychiatrista. Also, I forgot to say that I'm sorry your therapist said you were manipulating her. That's so dumb. I had a nurse in the psychiatry center that told me that I basically need to ""deal with things and stop running away from things and that's why I was there.""  The reason she said this was because I asked to be swapped to another room (this was pre-covid). The lady with me had extreme paranoia and anxiety. I am not judging her but she was constantly making noises that triggered me and was pushing me and pushing her problems on me. That's fine because they decided to let me leave a letter review and I just wrote ""UNPROFESSIONAL ASSHOLES THAT WOULDN'T LET ME SWAP ROOMS AND LET ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE."" :)
You'd think that in a place that's supposed to make you feel safe they would act a bit more decent. US mental care is horrific and I'm honestly glad to be out of that country.",,q2qhls
100,"I was about to say sorry again, haha. I apologize way too much. Also, that's horrific. The 1 time that they scheduled me with a pyshcitarist was when I overdosed and went into a coma. Otherwise they leave list of numbers that half ass worked. I'm sorry that happened to you. I had to explain this numerous times to my family that something that may seem small to them is almost like a tragedy to me. Is it healthy? No, but that's apart of what I'm trying to work on. If I can't find my glasses then I will literally throw what I call a ""bitch fit"" and I'll get red with anger. Over some glasses..!

It just leads to the whole, ""you're not mentally ill and it is only for attention."" To say none of my actions were based off to get attention, that'd be a lie. Invalidating me because I have done that is not okay.

A lot of the kids I met inpatient... were suffering but never showed it. I feel like they felt they weren't allowed to, because people would go in and be like why are they here if they're laughing and so happy?",,q2qhls

103,"My first meeting with a therapist was in first grade, when I started acting out in school. She saw me quite a while and came to the conclusion, that theres nothing wrong with me, because I'm supposedly to intelligent to have a problem. I still don't know how she came to that conclusion. 

I hate that whole ""You're doing it for attention""-bit. Sure, I love to get yelled at, exactly the attention I hoped for /s 
I sometimes have phases of selective mutism, and during my time in the clinic I couldn't speak for three days, which was scary and unusual, since those phases are usually much shorter. After I could speak again, one Nurse talked to me and asked, why I couldn't speak, and I said, I didn't know and that I couldn't control it. He then said, that everything, people do, is to get a result and asked me, what would result of me not speaking. I didn't know and he told me, to get attention. He didn't believe me, that I couldn't control it, and apparently thought, I did it to get attention. 

And yah, of course some things I do, you do, we all do, are to get attention. Some of the good things and some of the bad things to. That's just natural, and in no way a reason to invalidate someone's experiences and actions. Being mentally ill and doing some unhealthy things for attention are often related to each other. 

In the clinic most people had a brave face on, as much as they could. Always balancing the line between not wanting to burden others and not alarming the nurses, who were also at the ""lookout"" for to happy behaviour, especially for patients with problems with their emotions.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls

106,"Imagine correlating intelligence and mental illness. ""Ah, yes. You're way too smart to have BPD. Good day now."" I've noticed that when people don't understand things that they resort to saying it is for attention. You being mute for unknown reasons doesn't mean it was for attention. If the nurse was professional they would have assumed it was due to a trigger and asked if you needed help vs making you feel worse. If you say you don't know why it happened then you don't know and they should stop poking at it and making the situation worse.

Yeah, I've done some heinous things for attention and I'm definitely not proud of it, but that does solely mean I have no mental illness at all? If that was the case then nobody has a mental illness and we are all free to go and do fuck-all.

Yeah, my first time being admitted inpatient I was deadly terrified of everything. This is awful but I just faked being happy until I got out. I have an eating disorder (binge disorder) and the inpatient psychiatrist said that's not true and he doesn't think I have that and also didn't believe I was abused. I just kept to myself and gritted my teeth the whole time there.",,q2qhls
107,"Oof. My parents are big religion fucks. Stepdad punched a hole into my wall at one points. Constantly locked in my room to isolate, escaped in games mostly. Bought my own food and drink when I was old enough so I wouldn't have to leave my room <had attached bathroom which helped that> my favorite experience is when i checked out some wiccan library books and he through such a fucking fit that he took them and wouldn't let me return them saying a school doesn't need shit like that. Almost didnt graduate because of that....it was so embarrassing explaining to the librarian why she wouldn't be getting those back.",_TheAmalgamate_,q2qhls
108,"Yeah, I was very confused by hos behaviour, especially because if any, I was even more isolated and withdrawn than before. If any, I did want as little attention as possible. I don't know.

Crying for help is difficult and sometimes, we can't help ourselves and do bad or even terrible things to at show, how bad we are feeling. And some people are faking some mental illnesses for attention, that's may be, but even that obviously shows some deeper issues they are trying to communicate. Attention-seeking behaviour always has a root, and that is mostly something very ugly. 

I feel like being inpatient is such a risky thing. If you have the right people there, it can be a great help, but sometimes you are just unlucky and feel even worse after, for an array of reasons. I hate it, when therapists don't trust or believe you. One time, I told a psychologist an emotion I felt (don't remember what exactly) and she told me:""No, I don't believe you."" Excuse me, you don't believe that I felt something? Never went back to her. 
I feel like eating disorders are especially doubted. Even professionals often just see the stereotypical underweight girl, who doesn't eat and no other way to have an eating disorder. Which is just so damaging. I hope, you had at least experiences that were a little better.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls
109,"Their behaviour was inappropriate, honestly. I'm not sure if it is me but I've noticed inpatient staff/nurses (not all of course) acting more unprofessional.

I think what makes it all of it worse is that there are multiple subreddit, blogs, etc battering down on BPD (and NPD) constantly without any actual psychiatry knowledge of the illnesses. There is a lot of stigma around mental illness as a whole and it is easier for people just to put the blame on them trying to seek attention or just acting out.

Being inpatient helped a little bit later in life but my first and last experiences were awful. Also, she isn't there to dictate whether she believes your or not? She's there to do her job and help you. I was a bit chubby (I hit puberty at the age of 9). I feel like he looked at me and was like, ""hm, she's not skinny enough to have an eating disorder."" which is extremely ignorant because binge eating literally has nothing to do with that.

There is actually *a lot* of research showing it's not developed in adulthood, it's developed in childhood, relating to the inability to regulate emotions most often due to trauma, and trauma isn't just something like physical abuse, it's usually neglect and abandonment, which is a form of trauma.


But I will repeat what I said, I've never met anyone with clinically diagnosed BPD who didn't suffer some form of trauma in childhood. I've worked with a lot of DBT therapists *and TFP therapists who specialize in BPD.

You can not claim that BPD isn't a condition one is born into. Research shows that there is a genetic component and related brain abnormalities.

They told me that it's not necessary to diagnose it because it's a personality disorder and there isn't treatment specifically for BPD .. but she said we can try to fight the symptoms/intensities with medication. I'm on the same medications as lots of ppl I've seen in these reddit groups. And theyve acknowledged i do have borderline traits. Idk .

You know how BPD brain works. Being invalidated so much made me think that I was being dramatic and things weren't that bad as I made it out to be. I was lucky enough to live in a country where seeing a psychiatrist is free. Other people aren't as lucky. Please find it within yourself to empathise with people who feel like they might have BPD instead of causing them more pain.

So if your definition of gatekeeping is requiring a professional to perform a thorough evaluation before providing a legitimate diagnosis then I'll have to disagree. If you have a different definition then maybe clarify a bit cos i see this term thrown around for different things

I‚Äôm not ever going to discourage someone from researching/educating themselves on BPD, nor am I going to discourage them from doing DBT because it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúBPD treatment.‚Äù Even though DBT is what‚Äôs commonly used to treat BPD, that doesn‚Äôt mean people without BPD can‚Äôt benefit from it or shouldn‚Äôt have access to it.

I've also never seen someone who self diagnoses use the free dbt pdfs going around on the Internet, personally. it's only ever used as an accessory. it takes literally no time, even if you do want to engage in a community, to specify that you don't know for sure if you have said disorder. if you're running with your own theory it's just logically not sound and quite disrespectful.",koorvus,11sgchi

If I took this test 10 years ago, these all would've been full though, so I'm happy with the results.

Also, just wanted to say, the ""please don't self-diagnose"" isn't fair. I was misdiagnosed for a decade and after some research and self-identification, I spoke to my therapist and was diagnosed.

These are symptoms I've had for over a decade now and have had so, so many therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists in that time. None of them properly diagnosed me. Had I had been properly diagnosed years ago, I would've understood myself better and it would have saved me years of pain.

Not to mention, so many people are misdiagnosed when it comes to BPD, especially women. We usually get a long list of other disorders before (if) we ever get this one.

Similarly, if someone takes this test and it comes back with high probability, they probably do have BPD or at the very least have something close to it (autism, ADHD, etc). It's still a good starting point for self-exploration and there's no harm in it.

Lastly, not everyone has access to healthcare or seeing a provider to properly diagnose them.

57,"While it's wrong to self-diagnose, I'll tell you about my long, exhausting diagnosis adventure.

First of all, the psych didn't just come at me with ""you have x"". I was already diagnosed with ADHD but my cognitive behav therapist sent me to this doctor saying there's something else at play that ADHD and CBT cannot account for. So I went and began. We explored possibilities together, discussed what I feel and experience and what I don't, and he gave me homework to study certain conditions and see if I find them fitting. 

We went back and forth between BPD and Bipolar (and tried a few meds) and concluded that it's BPD after 8 months on a once-per-week session schedule. The doctor didn't decide on anything by himself, neither did I. It was that discussion and exploration that helped us finally reach a conclusion.

Though it's not a good idea to self-diagnose yourself on your own, it's vital to observe yourself and explore conditions and see which one describes you the best. You might be having symptoms that you didn't know were symptoms or how to describe them, reading about these helps tremendously.

Trying to prevent people from getting any info or idea themselves hinders this self-awareness and self-exploration part. And I don't think this is helpful or beneficial...

Sorry for the wall of text and thanks to those who beared thru.",UnluckyScorpion,11tcxjw
58,"Totally agree.

And I have to say based on my own experience, when I was trying to sort myself out because I couldn't see a therapist, I self-diagnosed with a few mental disorders (including BPD) after several years of research.
And after I've been able to see a therapist, I have been officially diagnosed with 3 of the disorders I considered and told my therapist, in depth, about my research and we got through it and she told me where I was wrong etc.

I think that self-diagnosing can also be a tool to help you understand yourself, your struggles, and to find things that can help you while you seek adequate professional help.",The_Shepherdess,11tcxjw
59,"I agree in part. My take is doing your own research and suspecting something is ok, but don‚Äôt claim to have a disorder without being diagnosed. For me I did suspect BPD before my unofficial diagnosis (psych said I meet criteria, but didn‚Äôt want to diagnose me because they weren‚Äôt sure if it was it‚Äôs own disorder for me or part of my PTSD since I‚Äôm not in therapy), as well as pretty well all of my other diagnosises minus dysthymia",Garfield_Simp,11tcxjw

I'm truly sorry for people who don't have access to healthcare or cant afford it etc but that doesn't give them a green light to play psychiatrist and diagnose themselves with a condition that senior doctors can have a hard time diagnosing.

64,"Heavy disagree. In a system where it costs hundreds of dollars out of pocket for a visit, you do have to play doctor. And even if you can go in, doctors don't know everything. Again, I've had access to healthcare and was still misdiagnosed for over a decade because ""doctors"" thought they knew better and could tell everything about me in an hour visit.

Those 10 people who may be wrong, still need help in some capacity and may find the correct answers after doing more research. If you self-diagnose, there's definitely still something wrong with you, even if the exact diagnosis is wrong.

Romanticization of any disorder is not ok and I agree, those who may think it's quirky, should fuck right off. That being said, I have not personally come by anybody who romanticizes it or tags themselves with the diagnosis for shits and giggles. As a matter of fact, I've never seen anyone do that for any disorder.",,11tcxjw

Don't just take my word for it though, literally most of the medical community agree with me.  
Sorry if that's inconvienient for you but this whole ""an official diagnosis is a privilege"" thing needs to fuck off.  
I'm going to assume you're in the US because of the ridiculous costs of your healthcare system.   
I'm from Ireland where we basically have free care and we still get twats self diagnosing who won't go through the public system for fear of being told they don't have BPD and those who have gone through it and told they don't haev BPD but still claim they do because:

To add also, BPD is as wide a spectrum as autism. So it manifests wildly differently from person to person (though stats lean heavily into it being a female dominant diagnosis--though societal norms may have a overwhelming influence in this).

But yes, you're correct in your correlation of abandonment/attachment issues. And go ahead and throw in trauma, self-worth issues, and skewed cognitive biases with some ptsd and hyper vigilance...but then again, it's been reported on the rare occasion that a small percentage of individuals with a BPD diagnosis report no known memory of abuse or trauma (I personally subscribe to the thought those individuals are either misdiagnosed, or their biases are skewed to the point of not being able to identify abuse).",Downtown_Caramel4833,1ae8v23

You‚Äôll likely alternate between states of powerful validation, imposter syndrome, anger, depression, denial, resentment, and the impulse to just cram it all back in the tiny box it‚Äôs been trapped in for years. It‚Äôs a classic example of ‚Äúit gets better before it gets worse‚Äù. 

My only advice. Pick a ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù that you trust. Similar to in AA for sobriety. Their only job is to check in periodically and make sure you are GOING to therapy and not talking yourself out of it. You don‚Äôt necessarily need this person for emotional support, because that is a great job for your therapist, but they can hold you accountable. My friend and I do this for each other. Empathy for each other‚Äôs struggles, but also the ‚Äúfirm reminder‚Äù of ‚ÄúGO TO THERAPY, are you going to therapy? Have you told your therapist this?‚Äù 

If you don‚Äôt have someone in your life that you can trust with this responsibility, I would be happy to DM you periodically to check in!",healing_potato_lemon,k4ip9k

1,"I hope it gets better. Many doctors won't diagnose people under 18 with BPD. Even though it's possible to have it. It's just that for very long it was considered both incurable and doctors didn't want to have BPD patients, as they realized a lot of time and energy and the outcome wasn't great.  So a diagnosis didn't do much good.

I still don't believe in the way DSM (Psychiatry ""Bible"") handles personality disorders. The science has went far past the current methodology. 



Still a diagnosis helps patients feel less alone and understood and have hope.

Plus nowadays several therapies have been proven to work : BPD, Mentalisation therapies, Schema based therapies, STEPPS therapy

Therapies can help improve the lives of pwBPD . And even if we aren't fully ""cured"" we can get better with therapy, work and support.

Most importantly you don't need to have a serious illness to benefit from therapy. Actually, serious mental illnesses make therapies harder, take longer and be less effective. 

So why not talk to your family about what you are feeling and see if they can help you. Hopefully you don't have BPD, but even if you do you are not alone and either way you are welcome here obviously.

So I‚Äôd say the bpd really started around 4-5th grade when I was 10 (when my mom started treating me worse).",nm_potato,jpuvwf
18,"My symptoms started to be more obvious at 10 but id had it building since maybe 8? Anorexia/ED;NOS started at 10/11 as well. Drinking always around 12, and self harm at 13. 

Im ""quiet"" bpd I believe but just diagnosed BPD. I begged to have therapy from age 10 onward, I was miserable, but parents are dad Antisocial-PD and mom likely bipolar w/adhd, and HATE therapy. 

Had a lot of intense baaaad stuff happen from 3-18, and didn't get away from the abusers til then

At 26 I started therapy finally after a big big mental breakdown. And at 28 started DBT. I got my CPTSD diagnosis at 27, and my official BPD diagnosis at 28 after dbt started (currently just hit 29 2 weeks ago) 

My parents still hate therapy and think im ""hopped up on meds"" because i finally put some basic healthy boundaries between them and me.

21,I was diagnosed at 17 in one at one of those lockdown schools rich parents send their troubled teens.  Couldn‚Äôt leave for a yeR and was miserable af. They diagnosed me right before I left too. The place made me full on BPD but def had traits since like 10.,freebrianwilliams,jpuvwf
22,"Heck, I think I had some mild traits when I was 9-10, but no severe thoughts or assumptions. In fact, I didn't really care for relationships. All I focused on was the only ""friends"" I had, and protecting my mother (while she was supposed to be protecting me.) 
When I was 11 those traits started forming into actual symptoms, and slowly severed over time. I'd say when I was 13 I believe I had all symptoms of BPD (side note; I didn't know what BPD was. The only mental illnesses I thought I had was depression, and later ADHD. I didn't know of many mental illnesses either, nor did I study them like I do today.) 
and at that point it was pretty much full blown BPD. The worst part was I had no self-awareness, and I didn't even know the phycological definition of ""toxicity."" I didn't know people could be ""toxic."" 
13-14 I lost a lot of people due to my thoughts and actions. I didn't know what was wrong with me, I didn't understand what I was doing wrong. I didn't know what gaslighting, guilt-tripping, or manipulating really was. Because I grew up with that kind of treatment, around toxic people. I didn't know I was doing anything wrong. 
After I lost my first major FP when I was fourteen, I realized... I was bad. I was toxic. So I spent a year supposedly ""getting better."" God, the signs were as clear as day at this point if only I had known of BPD. 
And here I am, turning sixteen next month and I lost my girlfriend/FP in July. Complicated story. I've been going through the worst agony I have ever felt in my entire life, and I have literally been stabbed before. I'd rather be stabbed again, and again, and again, than have to live in a world where the love of my life -- the girl who I thought was my soulmate, ends up blocking me and hating my guts because I don't know what the hell I'm doing. 
The physical and emotional pain I have been experiencing every day since then is HORRIFYING. I can't describe how traumatizing losing her was for me.

The feminization of many mental disorders- such as Bulimia, make proper diagnosis more inaccessible to men.

21,"That‚Äôs the whole point.

Misogynistic gender roles say that women having strong emotions and swooning over men is to an extent acceptable. Admitting that these traits have become a problem is understood and empathised with. 

These ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù traits are seen as unacceptable in men and ridiculed. ‚ÄúBoys don‚Äôt cry, you don‚Äôt want people to think you‚Äôre a *girl* do you?‚Äù is drummed into us from an early age. 

The core reason for this is that to appear feminine as a man makes you lesser. This would not be the case if women were not considered lesser - the definition of misogyny. 

I‚Äôm also bisexual and bi men have a similar problem caused by misogyny. We‚Äôre seen as gay people who are ‚Äújust pretending‚Äù whilst bi women are seen as straight people who are ‚Äújust pretending‚Äù. How we interact romantically with men is the part of our sexuality that society obsesses over and our love for women is ignored because of misogyny. It‚Äôs less important because women are less important.

I suppose what I‚Äôm saying is that just because it‚Äôs hurting men doesn‚Äôt make something misandry rather than misogyny. It‚Äôs about what fundamental premise led to it and in both cases they boil down to a belief that men are more important than women.

For this reason it‚Äôs important to remember that feminism is not just about helping women, it‚Äôs about helping everyone with problems that are caused by society valuing men more than women (and in doing so placing harmful expectations on both) by fighting that root assumption.",,v8rfuu

Adverse childhood experiences (which from my understanding are incredibly common amongst those with bpd) are also known to cause heart problems due to stress so it's no wonder that people experiencing a mental disorder that is pretty traumatic just to live with in and of itself would put someone at higher risk for loss of life at a young age.

It's absolutely ridiculous that unnecessary stigmas still get in the way of bpd care being taken completely seriously by the mental health care industry.

""I just need to talk to someone in private about issues I don't think my parents would understand."" Only give more details if they MAKE you.

I would also advise you to familiarize yourself with the disclosure policies that therapists themselves also have to follow if you are still a minor and you still want to live with your parents, considering the ongoing history of abuse there. I don't like having to say that because I think you should get the fuck out of there asap, but if that is the only choice you have right now for whatever reason, you should know that therapists have obligations to report certain information to authorities. 

I would also like to add that a psych ward is not always counter-productive if that is what one really needs. I needed it once, and it helped me greatly. I will also remind you that as horrifying as words can be, they won't last forever and while they may FEEL true in the moment, that doesn't MAKE them true.

1,">You do have an authentic self, because there is always a part of you that doesn't change. Yes, you may act differently in different situations or around different people, but these are simply variations of your true self. You maintain the same values, emotions, thoughts, mannerisms, and so on in each situation you find yourself in, but may act or speak differently depending on your audience, purpose, or context. Self is a continuous phenomenon; it doesn't just go away when you change settings. As you grow older, you maintain that seed of true identity from when you were a kid, with more thoughts and emotions and values and experiences added on. If we only had the self we have in the moment, we would have no sense of identity. There would be nothing to link between our selves, and our identity would become confused and muddled. We need that true seed from our youth, something that can remain constant as we enter different settings. You always have an authentic self.

It‚Äôs a long ugly history of stereotypes and honestly, eugenics. The idea that there‚Äôs a standard of human evolution and if someone falls outside their assigned gender or racial stereotype there must be something wrong with them that must be corrected. The Medical Model is very xenophobic and what‚Äôs considered a ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù is originally based on what falls outside a standard of behaviour that was very limited and binary

37,"There's currently a bit of a scandal in the uk because women who have been raped and/or sexually assaulted are being disproportionately given electro-convulsive shock therapy, often without consenting. A decent number of these will be women with a BPD diagnosis. 

There's also a method of 'treatment' that was being used in the national health service that deliberately targeted women with BPD, whom it deemed an 'unnecessary financial burden'. The treatment involved coercing women to sign agreements that allowed police to become involved in their care, and promised not to use emergency services or ask for help with suicidality. If the women became suicidal she could be imprisoned and given a criminal record. If she showed up at hospital she could be denied all medical care (even for things unrelated to mental health). The treatment isn't measured in any way that indicates patient outcomes. It's measured on how much money is saved. 

Which honestly is hella fucked up for the 2020s. BPD care is currently in a seriously bad way in England, most can't even access therapy.

I talked about certain things about how I deal and situations I face where at most a month later when they went to the local psychological hospital (or whatever one will call it) in fear of self life ending deals and well, they were diagnosed with BPD, and afterwards I got a ""probably should tell you that I found what you said really relatable but didn't say so, and I was diagnosed with BPD myself when I went in"" kind of message which was quite something for me to hear.

It's just a strange feeling on it because it adds to my feeling of validity in how I feel (something I really needed honestly) while also meaning that I quite possibly helped them to that point themselves in some way.

0,"No one can tell how we should react to/ handle our trauma. But diagnosis is important to understand how our trauma has impacted us. It helps us to unlearn certain coping and defence mechanisms that no longer serve us or worse make our current life difficult. And to learn better ways so that we could be in healthy relationships. 

It sucks that we have to do all this work while the abuser gets away freely, most times without having to pay for their actions. But if we want a better life, better relationships, etc. We must learn to not let the past dictate our present. It's so fucking hard and unfair. But we are worth the effort.",everythingisducked,1bi7ayn
1,"Think of it as: A normal mind is like a tidy room, everything in its correct place, ordered, working as needed.
A trauma is like a toddler, animal, or strong wind that comes into the room and scatters and breaks things, leaving it disordered and less fit for purpose than it was (that purpose being to process external stimuli and internal information for you so you can survive in the real world).

It's correct to call the messes that have been made within people's minds disorders, because they are parts of people's minds that need to be cleared-up to allow them to function.",Infinite_Total4237,1bi7ayn

10,"Nope, abuse is an environmental factor that does affect one‚Äôs brain chemistry regardless of being predisposed to certain diagnoses genetically. ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps the Score‚Äù documents this; there are multiple fields (sociology, psychology, human development across the lifespan, neurology, etc.) that also explore psychological and physiological changes due to external factors. 

It is simply cause and effect of a negative environment resulting in the victim developing maladaptive coping skills for the sake of their survival. 

As far as diagnosis, the DSM has been criticized many times over the years ‚Äî but it‚Äôs currently the best we have at the moment for diagnostics. It‚Äôs a culmination of common and observed patterns of behaviors\symptoms in attempts to categorize for treatment‚Ä¶nowhere does it state that there is an ‚Äúordered‚Äù way or that it is the ‚Äúonly way‚Äù to express the result of abuse and trauma.

6,"I'mto be fair to you, 12 to 19 (and young adulthood) is extra emotionally challenging for people who are more ""typical."" 

I'd say it's less ""cope,"" and more ""adapt."" So you will have a type of cross to bare, but if you manage your life in a certain way, you may have to ""cope"" less. 

For instance, you know that phrase, ""you don't have to believe everything you think?"" My friends with BPD symptoms have been able to realize that much more quickly in the moment, as they get older. So, they don't ride the emotional love or hate horse when it offers a ride. They are somehow able to separate different moments and recognize them as moments, whereas they used to just full on split and believe their current perception as the permanent truth. They still have to cope, but things have been easier because they are more aware of the splitting. It's like how my bipolar friends are nicer to themselves when they can call their mania or depression out for what it is. In the past my bipolar friends wouldn't be aware they were drifting, but some are able to catch it earlier before they start making things worse by fueling the fires of depression or mania. All of my bipolar friends have been much more mindful about many facets of their lifestyles that could be triggers
 Do you see what I mean? Like, we still have the cross to bare, but sometimes tweaking our approach to our lifestyle and reactions can really help.

to manage, the friends that are able to be kinder to their bodies/minds are also able to be a little more resilient, so their good health helps the splitting pain not feel worse than it has to. This is much like people I know who struggle with bipolar symptoms, and how their mindfulness about their health has helped reduce the intensity and frequency of symptoms. They have less deleterious mania and depression. So, they still cope but when they manage their life a certain way, they are not coping to such an extreme degree. Things can be challenging, but they can be less challenging if my friends live a certain way. They are all a little different, so their strategies may look different from the next person's. I'm just dancing around the same point in these paragraphs. I hope the constructive and hopeful point comes through. Good wishes to everyone.",AnonymousAgapeLove,1bjrziy
7,"i didnt think it was possible to get diagnosed at as early as 12. your personality is still forming in those years. but that aside..

the symptoms get easier with age, especially if you have a good support system, and it absolutely is possible to have a normal and healthy and fulfilling life with this disorder. 

but we will always be more sensitive than the average person, with more intense emotions. thats how we got it in the first place. being sensitive in an invalidating environment from a young age means we learn reactions and coping strategies that are not good for us. so we need to understand when theyre happening, to learn new coping strategies, and leave environments that are bad for our wellbeing. all of that takes time and effort.

so, our emotions will always be intense. but thats both a blessing and a curse. we can experience the beauty of the world more strongly too, we love with everything weve got. many of us are artists, and for a reason. we just gotta learn to use our strengths.

as for the meme, honestly, to me it helped to not focus on my identity that much. i have the things i love, the people i love, and as for everything else? i have no idea ""who i am"", but thats okay. i can do what i like in the moment, and theres nothing wrong with that",tortoistor,1bjrziy

Ex my paternal grandparents grew up during the great depression and became hoarders. My father's a hoarder. I had very strong tendencies towards hoarding tho I've gotten loads better about it.

He asks Dr. Jinx to make him have feeling again - rage is probably the easiest feeling to bring out in someone with ASPD and we rarely get to see Dennis experience emotion that isn't rage.
I'd also say pwBPD usually experience a lot of guilt whereas Dennis nearly never expresses feeling bad for messing people's lives up, which is a big differentiator.

One key thing though is that I am very **resistant to depression, self harm or suicidal ideation** so hopefully it isn't BPD. 

I am just hella different you know in a problematic ways sometimes. Also I am a hermit

If I had to guess I would say I am a weird amalgamate of ASPD, BPD, ADHD and autism but nothing of it is coming on top.

I suspect in my family we have naturally stunted amygdala thing by some amount thus unable to truly connect with people and barely feeling these empathy and remorse things but it is rather hard to judge something that was always like that. 

Only external experiences makes me think that maybe other people are different. My mom and I are definietly normal in my own eyes. No dramas ever because open dramas are kinda useless and serve no purpose you know, it is all favor power struggle who can pretend to do most ""crucial"" chores to leverage it to make other person do more so that's pretty normal for me. Art of convincing someone to do things your way is like what we with mom do usually so lotsa so called ""manipulation"". She teached me things but I believe I surpassed her now though she clutches to having ""elderly experience"" as last grip in talk games.

I realize though that with more ""neurotypical"" people I would have to drastically change something to accommodate this difference whatever it is because I guess **nt people are pretty sensitive usually** and think in weird ways",Julie_mrrea,1197a2m

Or it's the opposite and someone special has to be the light in the fog that lets you know where something is.

Discover and learn for yourself. That may be your best way forward. (Edit: or at the very least be worth exploring as a possibility. Where a road ends, there is another road to go down that maybe doesn't. But also, maybe it's paving your own. I've healed a lot and it wasn't in therapy, it wasn't spending time in my own.

16,"The irony is that no one can decide if you are objectively intelligent or not. What's the measurement? Purely cognitive ability? In what form, sciences, math, general retention of information, critical thinking? 

I think we tend to get caught up in what other people think of us because we place our self worth on external validation, since we have a hard time validating ourselves. So now you see someone's perception of you as a new standard to live up to, when the standard was never there to begin with- they just voiced their opinion. YOU are the one creating the standard, YOU are the one deciding your worth. And it's hard when I'm sure you've grown up in an environment that invalidated you at every turn. No one is born liking themselves- that's supposed to be our parent's job. When they fail, we have to pick up that responsibility.

The best thing you can do is realize that everything that anyone has ever said about you is an opinion, not a fact. (Bar things like physically tangible stuff). There's a narrative that has been crafted since you were a child, based off what other people said to you, made you feel, and you internalized. You can work on re-writing that narrative. Good grades don't mean you're smart, but they also don't mean you're an imposter for working so hard to obtain them while feeling like you don't deserve them.

Imposter syndrome is a paradox of self worth. Because you FEEL like you don't deserve something that another person FEELS that you do. So you think ""wow, I don't deserve this, I'm lying, I'm gonna be found out."" When in reality, it's your self esteem that is telling you you're unworthy, because your boss or professor's opinion is also not a fact. They see you as competent, so you are competent. If you don't think you're competent, that's an internal issue. And with BPD, I think we ALL know how that feeling can be SCREAMING at you. It takes time and coping, but we have to tell ourselves that we ARE good enough. Cuz the thoughts saying ""you aren't good enough"" are intrusive and incorrect. Even when you don't FEEL good enough, you gotta yell back ""I KNOW THIS IS A DISTORTED THOUGHT FROM MY BPD AND I AM GOOD ENOUGH DESPITE FEELING LIKE SHIT RN"".",misschronicamars,q4w2x4

0,"Letting them know that you feel like something is coming on is a great first step. Most of the time our partners can tell when we're feeling off anyways. It turns out that staring off into space, being completely stone-faced instead of laughing at the things we usually do, and crying aren't exactly subtle behaviours. And so when we say that we're fine, they know that we're struggling. When we try to pretend like everything is OK, usually we're just causing them to stop trusting what we say. They then have to read into our behaviours and what we say all the time, which is exhausting and unhealthy for everyone, because no one can read minds and even if they're really attuned to what you're feeling they will eventually get it wrong. Open and honest communication always is a great rule. 

Letting them know some things ahead of time that might help is a great thing too. Asking them to be extra cuddly, to tell me why they love me a bunch etc., having a nice phone call etc. are all things that really help me. It also helps them brace for my weird coldness if didn't quite catch it in time. They know that I still love them and that i'm just having a rough time instead of wondering if they did something wrong/if I hate them now etc.

As someone with quiet BPD, I'm tempted to say that everything is fine because I don't want to be a burden. I fear them sighing and saying ""I don't have the energy to deal with this tonight"", and on a larger scale being like ""you're just too much"". Usually it's a matter of reminding myself that they chose to be with me because they actually like who I am and part of that is how sensitive I am. It's one of the reasons why telling them what's going on can be so valuable, because they can offer the validation and support instead of me having to dig for it in memories. Also, if I catch it while it's happening or if I'm able to identify it later, I'll tell them what triggered me. I'll explain that I'm calming myself down and steering myself away from the self-fulfilling abandonment behaviours and that if I seem pre-occupied it's because I'm trying to wrangle with those emotions (for example, being cold, not communicating, pushing them away etc.). My partner gives me a ton of really positive messaging about how much they love me and how they're not going anywhere. I find that really helps shorten the duration of my episode/split.",TheColourofHazel,13qva64

And while I can kinda see where she's coming from (Tiktok romanticizing mental illness and some, not all, people faking mental disorders) I've been diagnosed and she still acts like I'm faking. That being said, mentally stable people don't normally ""fake"" mental illness for attention. They might not have the disorder they claim to, but something isn't right there.

13,"Wow. That's a lot to unpack. Yeah boomers are even worse then gen X when it comes to mental health stuff. That's terrible that you're dad did that. A lot of times people who gaslight others into thinking their symptoms aren't real have been gaslit themselves, not an excuse just a repetitive cycle. I hate that stuff like that happens, but for now it is what it is.

>!I scare myself a lot, I always end up putting myself in the ER before I get to off the deep end, but next to my suicidal ideations I have homicidal ideations on my medical record. A lot of times I'll cut to keep from attacking someone else. Did it right in front of my capture when I was in drug trafficking was headed towards her with a knife but in the end you realize there'd be feds and her henchman after me and ended up attacking myself instead.!<

>!I have a way of putting myself in the worst situations, not even consciously trying to. I've just been always more comfortable around thugs, being called one myself by them while also being called ""not the usual suspect"" !<

>!Since getting raided years after escaping and her being offed by her business partners I've had a lot of time to reflect on this. I was raised in such a way that caused me to hate authority.

>!I have self harmed a lot before, mainly cutting but also punching myself. I drink when I have access to alcohol, I'm 19 and my old boss used to let me drink after work. I've been drinking since I was 12, but I had less access when I was younger so it was less frequent then. As far as other substances I've vaped before, but only for a few weeks, hit someone's weed pen and smoked a cigarette...alcoholism was the only thing that stuck!<

>!I've been sexually assaulted before, once when I was 7, I had to go to school with him for 8 years after that...another time when I was 15 dating a 17 year old. Oh, also my dumbass talked to a 24 year old when I was 18 and still in high school. He was an alleged ex-cartel member with a son, and he told me he and his wife were separated. That was a fucking lie. I found out later when she contacted me and said he'd been talking to 5 other girls and I was one of them. I wanted to throw up.!<

>!Also religious trauma, I was raised Christian conservative and I'm queer. I went to a Christian school when I was younger, so a lot of people thought I was spoiled...my parents couldn't afford it, I either got free or highly discounted school because my mom worked in the daycare. Also Christian schools can be really traumatic, a lot happened to me there and nothing was done about it. I got bullied on the regular, even beat up by a dude until I learned to fight, and on top of that we had to go to Bible class and chapel and were taught a bunch of sexist and homophobic shit. A lot of people there were racist/ at the very least microagressy. I'm white but still made me hella uncomfortable, also of course we were taught hella altered history where the American settlers were the good guys who ""saved"" the natives, my grandfather was native and it always made me pissed when they fed us that narrative. !<

i only just realized that it could be the autism (and some minor trauma) that's giving me a far less severe version of BPD-like symptoms. this meme just gave me a surprising amount of insight!",chasingcorvids,uyh303
