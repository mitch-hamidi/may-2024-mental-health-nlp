0,I need friends to support each other with recovery ,"Hi I'm trying my best to recover and I wish there was something like sponsors that AA and NA have of recovered pwBPD helping those in recovery.

He reminds me that I do have the power to get better but it takes time of course but it helps when you have loved ones there helping you on your way to recovery.

38,Not me finding each single trait in every therapist I've ever been to,"This really sucks to think about but to have so many experiences with loads of shitty doctors and they all give you the same diagnosis and act all kind and pure then refuses to treat you just because ""you're a really hard condition to deal with"" and that my negativity is just *TOO MUCH* for them. The only doctor that ever made me feel comprehensible and told me they'll be the one to give me answers and show me the way eventually canceled sessions with me and kept rescheduling and went on 2months+ vacations until my parents felt hopeless and stopped taking to me to new shrinks. I still do go to my first ever therapists to get cipralex prescriptions that'll last me atleast 6months. I ended up recovering on my own because I realized no one's really gonna give much effort to someone who's not even interested in living.., summer vacation was my NEW START I stopped talking to people for 3 months and went to a new school , became obsessed with fitness and body building , started actually taking care of myself as if I was my lil chick  , did so many hours of guided/individual meditation which btw is fascinating,  I found out I'm quite extremely fond of biology/neurology  studies(NIH)/mayo clinic and Harvard medical school as well as psychological research and other Yale university educational programs. At that point I was the healthiest person I knew , I used to think just because bpd is lifetime and has no cure does not mean it cannot be controlled. I can be pretty fucking awesome if I could just get back to where I used to be 4months ago-",1706154754.0,False,20,4,Ok-vennie-1053,None,19f08j8,https://i.redd.it/z8281ww1eiec1.jpeg

40,Thank you,"I want to thank everyone here for making me feel safe and never alone. I don't think I have ever found a group of people I have related with so much in my life. This place; although sometimes sad, is probably the most supportive group I've seen. We all struggle differently but no one is competing, no one puts anyone down, always encouraging and picking with others up. I honestly want to stay with everyone so much but I can't, I'm very far in recovery and I'm not sure I can keep looking at some of the post.

46,Just a lil remind to everyone! We are allowed to be complicated!,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of jokes on here and around recently off ‚Äúme n my multiple personalities‚Äù but I just wanted to remind everyone that DID is real and diagnosable, and some people may have it! So keep that in mind üíõ

AND not only that - I‚Äôm not trying to guilt people -and I just wanted to say that we are all multi-faceted and complicated human beings whose different traits show themselves in different situations! 

It‚Äôs hard times here in quarantine and I think everyone deserves the reminder: You are a whole human being how you are! You are allowed to be complicated, you are allowed to be inconsistent, and you are allowed to be moody! It is all a part of being human, and being you.

I am mostly recovered now. Recovery is possible. You may struggle, but every day we as people work on ourselves. You are lovable and whole how you are now. Every single day we work hard on being better, or being who we truly are. I‚Äôve been in bed for days now, it‚Äôs the little things that can keep us going. I got up and changed today and ate something. That‚Äôs huge for me today!

We may talk shit about ourselves, and people with borderline and other disorders are always working on ourselves - whether you or others are giving the credit you are entitled to or not.

For those who don‚Äôt have access to care, r/dbtselfhelp has some great resources if you ever feel up and open to doing some worksheets etc!

I just wanted to try to add some positivity to the feed !
