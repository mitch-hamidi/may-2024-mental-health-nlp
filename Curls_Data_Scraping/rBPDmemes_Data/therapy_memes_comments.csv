12,Yep. But I’ve been on way too many meds over the years and nothing ever helped and I was in therapy for years and made no improvement with my life.

I tried therapy when I was younger and got diagnosed with low self esteem and the school counsellor told me I cut and hurt myself for “attention” (my dudes I wore the longest, biggest, blackest hoodie to cover my everything.) so that wasn’t really for me.

Doctor says I'm chronically depressed and prescribed that medication.   Psychiatrist says I'm BPD and that there is no medication for BPD and that I shouldn't be on anything, only group therapy.  Psychologist says it's a hell of a lot more complicated than that, and that I'm probably not BPD at all, but a bunch of other personality disorders comorbid, that I should definitely be on medication, except all he can do is therapy because he can't prescribe anything.

68,"After imploding my life and losing basically everyone, I was in an outpatient group therapy program for a few weeks, and was let go early for good behavior LMAOO.

That was super cool. 

But yeah, made some new friends, got a dog, several new jobs, and a great boyfriend who doesn’t pull the shady shit that makes me crazy. 
Things have been tough, but way better than they were. I’m way better at pulling myself out of spirals than I was, and have been trying to fill my time with more productive, self improve-y type things. I still had episodes, but have been able to refrain from impulsive, self destructive, stalker-ish behaviors for the most part. I’m constantly running from the batshit part of my brain to the logical one. Like, before I do or say anything, I try to ask myself why I feel that way and if it’s reasonable or not, and always take time to gather new evidence before I act, and try to give as much benefit of the doubt as I can.

Six months later I’m hanging in there and hoping I’m going to feel something, that the magic that’s supposed to happen in therapy is going to happen for me, but so far it’s been pretty rough.

Art became therapy for me, I got good enough to sell work, then that lead to me coming to uni to study fine art where I am one of the top students.

Turns out there is alot of psychology, sociology etc in the fine art world and learning about this during my time as an artist helped me understand other people's art on a much deeper level and being validated by tutors and people in the art world has changed how I view myself.

97,"I just keep giving up on the concept of help and if there is no support system I do not really need to do things amongst people.

People think They knew what was wrong but I figured it was bpd because of the magnitude of my rage being able to cover all my moods…anger spoke up for all other emotions and I was not prone to cutting people off until my 30’s.

I was just trying to figure me out but a diagnosis is so fucking tedious I just manage things myself and I seek people out less and immerse myself in the things I always enjoyed when alone as a kid and teen…I have rebuilt my childhood ina positive way and stopped expecting others to come to my aid at all…people say we do not trust but people do seem to drift from people bpd and I think it’s because we choose people with similar or relatable mental health issues and we bond but if we all aren’t getting help then the friendship fades.

Lots of my friendship were one sided and when I refused to put that extra effort I felt I was doing they all eventually faltered. So perhaps we engage in good relationships with people who are also not healthy. I wonder if we all have a lot of one sided relationships that people are not putting as much into the relationship as we are and we at points pull away to protect and cope with the changes from these people thus creating more scars and the cycle continues ….

If therapy wasn’t so iffy I think we would all be better off…the fact bpd has never been brought up in council for me is what concerns me and I think they avoid labeling but the label is how I can relate to others and stop having the same pitfalls but it’s not been easy…I hope we all can find what we want and need",Known_Professor3190,1024dyl

99,"I had a friend with BPD who drank excessively and bragged how she handled her BPD with no therapy, meds, or any type of help. She felt it was commendable. However, one night, I had a panic attack due to my surroundings, and her bf started to walk quickly toward me, and in my panic, all I could do was yell no. (If you've had panic attacks, you know approaching someone is almost always a no. I have been diagnosed with critical anxiety disorder and critical social anxiety disorder among other diagnosies), they began walking home without me, and I totally understood. I guess on the walk home the girl got it in her head that I was trying to make it seem like her bf was trying to harm me (because I was not breathing and yelling no) I finally got back to their house and the first thing I said was “I'm not mad” (in my head I thought they might think I was upset at them for leaving me alone downtown in the dark) I then walked to the kitchen where they were and with no warning at all the girl started smashing my skull into her stone counters. (I pulled her hair to get her off me, she is much smaller than me and I did not want to risk hurting her to fight back) she that began screaming that I was trying to wreck her hair and she came at me again. I ran out to the porch, and her bf came with me. I was bawling, and he sat with me and talked. He was not mad that i yelled, and he understood it was not personal and not an attack on him trying to help me. I then needed my phone to order a ride home, and her bf opened the door to go get it. The girl had my phone in her hand and smashed it on the floor, then charged at me and started smashing my head on the exterior brick. Her bf got my phone and pushed her inside and closed the door. She continued to scream and try to open the door to get at me. Her bf kept me safe and kept her safe inside. I got an Uber home. I did not press charges and never spoke to her again. I understand she has BPD and cannot or does not want help and it is not always a conciojs thought process. I am completely an advocate for disorders and mental health, but to me, BPD is absolutely not an excuse to physically harm someone. Side note: I have a traumatic brain injury and dent in my skull. A single hit could kill me, and the side the dent was on is what she aimed for, which means there was some type of conscious thought process. I'm not sure raw dogging it is always the right choice.

If I had Facebook it would convince me I still have people in my life but the truth is you don’t. You only have the people actually in your life. Everyone on Facebook thinks they have 300 friends, how meaningful is your relationship to them really when YOURE just 1/300? Everyday they see names of people from high school that don’t even care about them anymore and convince themselves they still have a relationship but truthfully delete your Facebook and see how many peoples names you can remember in 6 months. I was so used to reading last names everyday.. it blows my mind I can’t remember mikes last name from that job I had 6 years ago now! I love it!

Social media has made people delusional with what their relationships actually mean. Unless you deliberately ignored calls, texts and people knocking on your door, “cutting out people” is just not interacting with them on social media anymore. Not really that big of a deal when you look at the whole picture and remove yourself from the social media delusion everyone else is participating in. Technically most of your Facebook friends have already “cut you out” considering they don’t go out of their way to contact you anyways right? What’s the difference?

It’s easier to let us sit in limbo with insufficient disability based workplace protections than it is to actually arrange that one on one time and then accept that we’ve got a 75% suicide attempt rate and need to be helped with some level of urgency.

I’d never met her before and explained that I’m waiting for a BPD assessment/diagnosis (only a psychiatrist/psychologist can diagnose in the UK and I currently don’t have one). Despite never having met me before she was just like “Oh no you just have anxiety, you seem way too calm and polite to have BPD”. Which is a fucked up thing to say in itself, but I had to turn to my husband and be like “you want to explain to her how very much NOT calm and polite I am when I’m having an episode?”. So many professionals judge purely on appearances/how you act in a controlled environment with them rather than in your daily life when things are out of control. They don’t ask, they just assume.

So a few years ago when I was in this inpatient therapy for five months my psychiatrist told me they couldn't decide whether I have BPD or not. So they ended up diagnosing me with emotionally unstable personality disorder F60.30 and told me it's not BPD (I'm from Europe btw). But they also said that this is how they decided now, but maybe they would decide BPD another time. I never really understood that, so I asked my psychologist yesterday what's the difference between the two, and her reaction was something like: ughh no, borderline is very severe, and it's a horrible life they lead, no, you really don't look like you have it, they gave you a much lighter diagnosis.

56,I work for community mental health in QLD. Does NSW not have mental health care plans? Or a scheme to allow for free therapy with a psych or counsellor.

1,Boomers care so much about how they look so if they’re going to therapy there must be something wrong with them! Oh no!!!!!! Lol. I’m glad our generation is proud to take care of our mental health instead of brushing it under the because of pride and ego.,i_always_give_karma,gh3qmr

4,"Whoops...sorry folks, I’m a boomer...

Actually, much as I’d love to say you’re completely wrong, you aren’t. 

Yea, I’ve met boomers who, like me, have no trouble talking about our mental health and even exchange info when we find a good therapist. 

And then there are those who are exactly like you describe. 

When I was open about my diagnosis friends were appalled that I spoke so openly about it. 

When we took our 3 millennial kids to therapy, family and friends said we were going to ruin them with that ‘mumbo jumbo”, to quote one. I was also told that all my kids needed was a belt to the ass. That was from my mom of course.",MikiesMom2017,gh3qmr

7,"Had a huge family tragedy six years ago, so my wife made me start seeing a therapist. Noticed my parents were also having a hard time with said tragedy, so I gave them my therapists number.

Ever since they started seeing the therapist, they've become slightly less Boomer-y,y mom, specifically. She's is much more open and honest about things, feelings, etc. My dad has gotten a lot better, but is still more boomer than my mom.

I think they've also recommended this therapist to their friends, too. So, boomers can change!",CreauxTeeRhobat,gh3qmr

He is also the guy that says that hypnosis doesn't work( I'm not talking about the watch dangling in front of my face), even though I am a completely different person since starting it. And hes also the one that says vitamins are complete bullshit and they have no proven effect on people. I'm like hello have you seen my blood work???

She was from the generation before the boomers, a narcissist with BPD traits(my husband is a therapist and he figured it out, lord knows she wouldn’t go see someone), and, as you can probably tell, was abusive.",MikiesMom2017,gh3qmr
21,"Oh hell, if I could choose it sure as shit wouldn’t be a boomer! 

I was born in the last five years of the generation, so I’ve been bitching about them since my twenties. 

I laughed my ass off when “ok boomer” started. Even if it applies to me as well. 

As for making people happy, I’m not so sure I have. One thing I’ve learned though, we shouldn’t always depend on other people to make us happy.",MikiesMom2017,gh3qmr

24,"Awe man, inserting foot in my mouth now! I'm so sorry! I lost my mom in October and oh my did she need therapy too!! She was incredibly loving, and did everything she could for us kids, but she was a tad bit  psychologically abusive. I also figured out once I was diagnosed with BPD, that she was too. She would always conform to her husband. Her personality always changed to fit him. She'd become his carbon copy. Dressing the same, acting the same, liking the same music, hobbies all that fun stuff. And no one believes me. Towards the end she had started to want to get help for her depression, but it was just too late.",LGEllie,gh3qmr

9,Yeah sometimes. When you turn up to group and everyone's talking about how they had a skillful week and are feeling okay and I'm the only one who's in crisis I feel so bad for taking up time as the therapists will always talk to anyone who's really struggling slightly more than the others. Even though I'd never wish for any other member to downplay what's going on if they're struggling. Its always good to picture its happening to someone else and see if your thought changes.,,zv63ch

but you? it's all you have, sometimes, and it drowns out the noise that other people maybe don't even have. music is your life. it can set a whole mood for you, get you up from the ground when you're down, keep you moving forward when you have no more motivation perhaps. it's quite literally one of the most beautiful things in the world, and you're gifted to be able to feel that and experience the power of music. the rest, they don't know that.

Beauty is subjective, FP thinks I look good, I like my hair colour, some people look better because they are fake)  The last column is called ""conclusion/Sun"" where I draw a conclusion out of my contra arguments (for example: Through out my life people have been presenting their subjective sense of beauty as objective truth, I don't need to treat it as objective truth)

2. I started an exercise called ""save haven"" where I try to Imagine a loving childhood for me. I have been growing up with people that abused me so I tried to take the few good memories I had and ""exchanged"" them with loving people to ""save the good memories from bad triggers by removing the abusers presence"". I searched in the internet for examples of a loving and independence supporting parent figurines, survival skill resources to include in what the people would have tought me growing up (like cooking my favorite food, them giving me healthy food etc.), also pedagogic content or how they would treat me in case of getting hurt (how they would cheer me up etc.).

9,"+10 for a GOOD DBT group. Makes things a lot more bearable.

FYI a good DBT usually involves an instructor that knows the content back to front and can control group members regardless of situation. In my group there were a lot of people that would use it as a 'me' session and constantly try to derail or hijack conversations and make it about them. The instructor shut this shit down like a pro.

Also, in my experience DBT is 90% women to men ratio, if you are a guy, don't let this discourage you, but please don't even think about dating / meeting people there either. Your therapy goes a LOT better if you don't connect with anyone outside of class.",demunted,wrys7e

I thought that was a very polite way for her to track time... she could quickly glance at it before or after taking notes and didn’t have to do the awkward “look-at-my-wrist” movement. It also helped that it was facing away from me so I never wondered/panicked about time.",,c5yp1w

Yes. Alcoholic mom, abusive uncle, pedo brother, anti-social parents. Yeah, it's a person and the quality of that person the meme blames for triggering vulnerabilities.

“Well, I dedicate my life to the people who need the light help them rise above the scam on the land and their lives. And it’s difficult to say exactly what to do, but the change begins with me and I reflect back to you, and you and you” 

Also, this song by [twenty one pilots](https://youtu.be/TRd0_ZQbHxg) and this song by [Miley Cyrus](https://youtu.be/2zZRDd9TDF4) has helped me get through some dark times. Not sure if you’ll enjoy but figured I’d share 🙂",,117y1as

I wish everyone could, but the truth is its extremely rare to find someone who loves you as you are, and its even harder to find someone who’ll love you endlessly when you’re a neurodivergent.

23,"A really hard thing for me to learn was when something was a big deal and when it wasn’t. Like my mind doesn’t have the best grasp on magnitude. So I try to communicate what is festering in my mind, even if it’s something that might seem dumb. But we talk about it and find the root issue and fix it.

Another thing that helps us is that if I’m in a rough patch, I always try to assure him that it’s not because of him. It’s not his fault and he can’t fix me. When he’s sad, he likes to be cuddled. When I’m sad I can’t stand to be touched. That one took a long time to work out.

And I think relationships are based on what’s given. Satisfaction isn’t from what **I** get out of it. It’s from what he gives me. And his satisfaction is from what I give him. Love is freely offered, freely given, and freely received. I hope that makes sense. 😊",,xrb2o2

5,"Omg I hope your can find better therapy services. I say I'm passively suicidal at least every other session. I told my current therapist that I wasn't planning to kms but I didn't see the point in living in the Hell that is our planet, and she just said ""yeah, that makes sense.""",,12rui0k
6,"as someone else mentioned dbt is meant to work with high risk patients, and there are other therapies that are effective for some people in lessening suicidal thoughts. but there are big limitations to that. a big reason is liability. if a therapist isn’t equipped to take on a patient that is at risk of killing themselves, they are operating outside their scope of practice and might even make their patient worse. 

for my (dbt) therapist, if im having suicidal thoughts it’s TOP priority. we cannot continue onto other problems or topics until we address it. same for other things like self-harm (at my request) or if im upset with her. it really gets in the way of the therapy because my aliveness is pretty important criteria to being a patient.

if my suicidality is so pervasive that we cannot talk about anything else and the skills are not actually addressing it, then the therapy isn’t effective anymore, and i might need to consider meds or inpatient treatment in order to continue. this is especially the case if there is an underlying condition other than bpd like bipolar disorder that has to be treated with meds first

if im actively suicidal (plan in place), my therapist is legally unable to help me because her scope of practice is limited so emergency services would be called and i’d be brought to an emergency room. 

it’s silly that it’s difficult to find a therapist to address this. a lot of people are suicidal right? but the unfortunate reality is that even the people with more treatable symptoms are not given adequate services. suicidality is seen as a “specialty” problem among therapists and it’s helpful to get a therapist who specializes in your problem. 

the same goes for trauma too. a lot of people need therapy because of their trauma and then go see a talk therapist who doesn’t understand how to operate with a trauma-informed practice. or a narcissist goes to a therapist that doesn’t know how to deal with manipulative behaviour and then just validates the narcissists behaviour instead of helping them get better. or a person with ocd goes to a cbt therapist who tells them how to “think” and then their thoughts get worse (i’ve witnessed this in dbt and it’s very sad)

what you experienced was a bad match. you were with a therapist who isn’t right for you. it’s like getting sent to a chiropractor when you need a surgeon. the service you got was not meant for you. and to be transparent with you, most therapists will not be. but that does not mean you are untreatable, and it doesn’t mean you don’t deserve better support than you are getting. i hope you hold on to find that. 

i’d really encourage you to look into virtual dbt therapy and see if you can find therapists who are going to understand and care for you in the exact ways you need. you deserve it friend",freshlyintellectual,12rui0k

I was in therapy while being suicidal. Eventually i ended up in the grippy socks hotel. But this wasn't the fault of my therapist. Im fact therapy is exactly there to give you coping skills outside of suicide or self harm. So saying therapy doesn't work while being suicidal is complete bullshit. 

There is also the possibility to get medication to cope till therapy can work. For example i was prescribed Lorazepam. Till we could figure out long term medication.

In any case, if it gets just too much and you can't take it anymore and only see suicide as a way out (believe me I've been there, lot of times) Just call an ambulance or got to the nearest ER.

1,"DBT changed my life & my families. Struggled with my mental health from my teens. Got a diagnosis of bpd in my late 20s. Before that point had gone through a ton of different therapies. I had a good understanding of why I would feel the way I did, but no level of understanding helped when my emotions got too much & sent me down a path of destructive behaviours. 

Took a few years to start my DBT & finished about 4 years ago. In my mid 30s now. But it's absolutely changed my life. My partner & family would absolutely testify to that & the product of that is my new 3 week old daughter who I wouldn't have if it wasn't for this therapy.

(Not saying anyone isn't putting in their all, so do not even @ me) It's like finding the right therapist. The right partner all the way to the size of your underwear. No, it's not a one size fits all life for anyone. Now- can you try something different, then maybe revisit it? (Different form of therapy, different diet, etc etc) Yup. Absolutely. You wouldn't wear a women's 22, change how you eat, dash in some gym ✨️spice✨️ to your life, then, look at the now size 12 you are now, look at size 10 and say its impossible (barring health issues)? No, you wouldn't. You came this far, what's another shot at just one more pants size? Same deal. DBT may be your size, your ""mmm, not yet, but maybe later"" size, or not your size at all. It does not make anyone less because something didn't isn't their size. Period.",Burn-the-red-rose,17cc1ah
10,This honestly sums it up. Is it just me or does anyone else end up saying what they think the therapist wants to hear? cause you think your actually feelings are way too fucked up and you are scared of being judged so you don't get anything from therapy. Maybe it just me idk.,,17cc1ah

25,"DBT tends to be used as a Band-Aid instead of trauma therapy for traumatized people. If we think of it as CPTSD, trauma therapy is the go to. When we think of the same thing as a personality disorder, we send people to go to DBT instead. Unless you genuinely reduce someone's level of suffering, grounding and regulating is going to be insufficient for many people. I can't ground every waking moment, and I used to genuinely constantly suffer every moment. Some therapists won't even see you if you haven't done DBT first. That's their own limitations, not an actual rule for effective treatment, though most therapists won't own their limitations and admit it. You're not weird for finding DBT insufficient. It is useless on its own for many people.",The-Octopus-Garden,17cc1ah
26,Hi! What books do you recommend?,aPimpNamedSenpai,17cc1ah
27,"I mean no therapy works with 100% of the population lol and it’s okay! We don’t all have the same symptoms, we don’t have the same background, the same way of understanding things, the same struggles, or we don’t all have the same goals for our recovery so one specific therapy like DBT won’t be successful for everyone. I did DBT for a little over a year almost 18 months and my previous psychiatrist talked like you, as if it was something that for sure works if you put in the work. My current psychiatrist* shrugged and said it wasn’t for everyone, and trauma informed therapy might be better for me. So even professionals aren’t on the same page of its effectiveness. Mental illness and how to fix it isn’t a monolith and I hope we can free ourselves from treating it as if it is. I’m glad it works for you though!",yikkoe,17cc1ah
28,"That’s what I’ve done too! It’s super helpful to have basic skills and tools I was never given laid out for me. My therapists at the time were non-specialty and their style was mostly listening and providing validation which some people want but not what I was looking for. I wanted feedback, homework, introduction of new concepts. I wanted to change damaging behaviors, not talk about their origins. Whether we talk about it or not, the past happened and it isn’t changing. The only thing I have any possibility of changing is the present. I want to be in control of myself and my choices, because the only bad thing happening to me now is me 😂

I made a DBT notebook with a goofy ass acronym on the front and hand-wrote/illustrated/decorated. I’m a visual, creative person so it was almost like an art project or highlighting your notes x 10. I made it fun to create and to view to increase the likelihood of both. It fits in my bag I always bring so it’s always accessible in a way I understand with notes, cues, examples, etc. It might sound extra but it works for me for now. 

Like you said, it’s not magic. You have to be very intentional and repetitious. It’s like a muscle. You have to use it for it to grow.",Dizzy0nTheComedown,17cc1ah
29,"There’s a ton of research that evidences DBT’s efficacy, people just don’t want to hear it for some reason.",VastClimate4195,17cc1ah
30,"Thank you! I really think that making it sound like it's a one size fits all type therapy is genuinely unhelpful. I understand and agree that literally ALL therapy won't work if you don't try. But I hate that when therapy doesn't work for someone, people assume that it's due to the person not trying hard enough. If someone is taking a medication and they say it doesn't work, is our first thought that the person isn't actually taking the medication? Probably not for many. I really wish we could give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to their mental health as well. 

For me, I think DBT isn't what I need right now. To me, DBT would be the final step to my mental health journey, if it were to go well. 12 years of (various types of) therapy and nothing has worked because I am not addressing the first step. I have hope that finding a trauma informed therapist, or doing something like EMDR might be that first step, and if it is then maybe DBT will only work and be useful then. And I think many people are on a similar journey.

Mental health is such a strange thing. With a personality disorder our entire brain is rewired and no two brains are alike. I hope we have more empathy towards those who are still on the journey to understand themselves and find what works best for them.",yikkoe,17cc1ah
31,"I totally get why you feel this way my friend. But if I could offer some advice, therapists are here for you. If your therapist has so far shown professionalism and understanding and no judgement, you can tell them almost everywhere. They should be your safe space and most will uphold that belief for sure. I hope you will eventually feel comfortable to talk to them so they can offer you the best of care and support ❤️",yikkoe,17cc1ah
32,"Banal imo is such a good way of putting it FOR ME. I understand some people absolutely need that kind of therapy, and I am glad it is available and more known about for people who need it. For me though, yes it was incredibly underwhelming. My personal goals and challenges with BPD are not so much emotional regulation, but ridding myself from a lifelong sense of not belonging. And DBT has not really helped with that. I feel like DBT might work for people who have known or experienced positive feelings in the past, so it's easier to know where you're heading when you do the skills it teaches. But to me right now, that's not what I need from therapy. What i need from therapy is to process my trauma, not to learn how to keep my emotions in check. Maybe once that's done, DBT will be more useful? But right now for me it's not. 

I do like the ""how to talk to people"" skills though. I have bad social anxiety and worry a lot about how to talk to people, so having clear guidelines definitely helped.",yikkoe,17cc1ah
33,Yes you have to participate in therapy for it to work.... what a novel concept,Mean_Piccolo_210,17cc1ah
34,"It’s not safe for people with DBT to engage in trauma therapy until they have learned how to emotionally regulate. If you have someone demonstrating suicidal, self harm, and other damaging behaviour due to their inability to deal with negative emotions, why would you put them through a therapy which would increase negative emotions in the short term? 

I eventually did trauma therapy, but I had to do a year of DBT first. Without it, I wouldn’t have been able to handle it.",VastClimate4195,17cc1ah
35,Reinventing your life has given me more insight than anything else,HauntedDesertFlower,17cc1ah
36,"I had two close friends strongly encourage me to go to DBT even though they didn't find it effective at all because people's experiences with are so wildly different that they thought that it was worth trying because it may end up being effective for me which is was and continues to be. It's a blessing in my life. 

I also hate it. I can see how it's not beat practice for everyone with BPD or associated mental illness. One being that I think it can come across as sounding as if you are in control of your level of suffering and misery and to me it has an AA vibe like showing gratitude and acceptance for even the shit in your life which I found a benefit in but I pushed back on that so hard. It's like am I just gaslighting myself?

I would find it difficult to keep going to DBT if I wasn't also doing trauma informed counseling and internal family systems therapy. It's emotionally exhausting for me that getting to talk about trauma and shit feels like a break. 

There is no one way to skin a cat.",tayloline29,17cc1ah
37,"Okay well first of all and to be clear, I wasn’t saying oh it for sure works if you put effort in but most people I talk to that criticize it haven’t even done it very long. DBT is something you continue for the rest of your life and the more you practice it the more those skills take the place of irrational responses which are the underlier of our presented symptoms. Obviously I agree that everyone is different and has different goals and maybe it doesn’t work for everyone and that’s fine too. But there’s a clear hatred for it in this sub and it always confuses me and that’s why I said what I said. even in the first few months of discovering DBT I had gratitude for it and it helps me understand better ways to respond to my triggers. The more I’m willing to practice those skills and work through schema therapy, the less irrational my automatic responses become.",MindingMyOwn2021,17cc1ah

39,"I also like the interpersonal relationship part too, its the one I’m doing rn haha(I also started not long ago so maybe I’ll change my mind). 
Especially the mindfulness to me feels pretty weird, like, the part where you should just observe a negative emotion and label it and supposedly that should magically make that go away… I tried and automatically my brain was like “oh wow you’re sad… well now what..??” idk I’ll give it more chances but it’s very weird sometimes",Gio_rno,17cc1ah

42,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience. I genuinely believe that’s what I need too, trauma therapy. I am a big hater of DBT when I’m feeling silly goofy and a hater but in reality I think I need to (SLOWLY) process my trauma before I can go through DBT again, for reasons you’ve shared. To me, it always felt like masking 101. “You have bad feelings? Tough shit lol keep it to yourself and be happy”. I know that’s not the actual purpose of course, but like you said for some of us I guess, you can’t go from “why did I go through this trauma especially as a child??” to “I am actually doing just fine 🙂”. There has to be some kind of understanding of what happened before blind acceptance, and there has to be some kind of gentle reality check in order to be thankful for what you have. In the last couple weeks in the midst of a mental breakdown, I’ve been more active on here so I can recalibrate how I think. I stopped isolating my life as some “special never seen before” experience, and realized a lot of us, not just people with BPD, are going through it. So it’s not my fault, as much as my brain tries to make me believe that. And it’s a slow process and I think I need a professional to hold my hand and guide me through really internalizing this reality. And then if that leads to a healthier mindset, maybe then can DBT help. 

I’m thankful to hear from people who have had similar experiences. I do think everyone should at least try DBT. But I also think it’s not for everyone. We don’t all deal with this disorder the same and we don’t have it for the same reasons.",yikkoe,17cc1ah
43,"See this is why I don’t think DBT therapy with a therapist is the same as what I do bc I don’t get that vibe from DBT at all. It’s interesting to me how different everyone feels about it to say the least. But I also actually worked through my trauma first using workbooks and sounding boards and it was hard as hell and I struggled a lot but I feel I am genuinely healing now and working through my trauma and not just saying “oh I’m fine even though I feel this way.” That’s why I think DBT isn’t being used by everyone effectively. You have to actually work out the trauma before you can change your behavioral response to that trauma. For me, I have to go through why I feel the way that I do before I can change how I react to those feelings. If you don’t clearly have a healthy understanding of why you went through what you went through and get a healthier mindset going, learning skills isn’t going to make any difference in my opinion. Again though, obviously my experience is even more different bc I’m not doing it with a therapist and it has been wildly helpful for me. I’m not gaslighting myself into thinking I’m okay when I’m not and I’m definitely not masking my feelings either. I’m learning the appropriate ways to notice how each feeling feels and learning how to express that in healthy ways that don’t make me suicidal and ruin my relationships lol. Today I can feel everything I feel without attaching it to my trauma and intensifying every thing I feel and allowing that to control me. :,)",MindingMyOwn2021,17cc1ah

46,"I never understood the mindfulness thing cause I’ve always automatically analysed what I’m feeling exactly and why I’m feeling it and knowing that doesn’t make it any easier, it just makes me a helpless observer of my own misery",Silly-Ad5810,17cc1ah
47,"Oh that skill is rough as well, it definitely doesn't make it go away. I've come to realize that my expectations of DBT were just not what I understood of it. I also thought ""Oh so if I keep doing this, the bad stuff goes away?"" Nope. The bad stuff doesn't go away, but you learn to make the bad stuff not hurt as much ... sometimes. And I was devastated when I understood that. I think with age also (I'm nearing 30 lol) I am realizing that genuinely most people are miserable or at least sad, but we live in a time period in human's history where what's considered to be ""good"" and ""healthy"" is to keep it away from your outside life, if that makes sense? And most neurotypical people are just good at masking to the point of convincing themselves. And DBT teaches you to do that, sorta. So not to blow up on your boss, not to freak out as soon as something bad happens. The feeling is gonna be there, but you don't externalize it and make it someone else's problem, which sometimes might make you feel bad in return. And like, I get it. But me personally, that's not what I need help with. I need help processing my trauma, so I can maybe hopefully one day start experiencing joy. I think my brain has tried to protect itself so much that it doesn't allow me to experience joy at all. DBT wouldn't help me ""unlock"" that if you know what I mean?",yikkoe,17cc1ah

50,"you worded it perfectly, my dbt therapists told me I have to wait to learn the “pain tolerance” skills (idk I’m not native and don’t know how they call it in english speaking dbt groups lmao) but as for now mindfulness is super difficult to me, because I feel like I’ve no control on my pain and I can’t make myself feel better :’)",Gio_rno,17cc1ah
51,"I totally get it, I hope you will achieve your goal since feeling joy it’s something everyone deserves… and who knows… maybe one day we’ll find DBT really helpful :)",Gio_rno,17cc1ah
52,"it *is* force if you must satisfy a requirement you do not wish to satisfy in order to even be allowed to be present. i wanted information and advice, not some weird rehab circle where everyone goes around and tells you their name, history, and ailment

and people, in my experience, are overwhelmingly judgemental. i’ve always received backlash and judgement from people when opening up, especially within the mental health community. and while others may not experience paranoia or anxiety, i do, and in such cases, it is best to simply abstain from something if you feel the alternative is going to be harmful to you in any way (or, at least, that’s what i do. bc i care abt my mental health)

if the options are to suffer alone in private or suffer publicly in front of a group, then i’ll just go it alone. therapy can have benefits but isn’t particularly helpful if you’re too afraid to open up or contribute anything because you’ve been placed centre stage. i have a hard enough time during one-on-one therapy because i don’t inherently trust every stranger i meet (or that i pay to pretend to care about me). it’s great that others have no fear of judgement or whatever and can just traumadump to anyone who will listen but i can’t do that personally",unholyarcana,17cc1ah
53,"That sounds really tough and your right, if you have trouble opening up, that's probably the first step for your work to find a safe space to be able to do that. Im sorry that people have been judgmental towards you, that's not what those spaces are for. However, you are not forced to do therapy (at least you shouldn't be and it probably won't work anyway if you are not willing). The showing up and sharing part IS the therapy. It seems that you would more prefer a webinar style of things or even just some YouTube videos on the different techniques. But group therapy is kinda just what it is. If your not willing to share then that's not the space for you. But no one is forcing you to do anything. If you don't want to participate, don't.",Mean_Piccolo_210,17cc1ah

24,"> This was a “Christian” business as well.

Christian therapists (not just therapists who happen to be Christian, but ones who make it a major point in their business model) tend to be pretty problematic, honestly. I have a friend who grew up seeing Christian counselors, and they really only made her anxiety worse.

Their attitudes toward mental illness in general were unhelpful, and one somehow reached the conclusion that she was Bipolar because she was struggling with both depression and anxiety, and had a tendency to lash out at people when stressed. As an adult, she finally sought treatment from a secular professional and learned that her symptoms were from OCD.",MadotsukiInTheNexus,14bff31

0,"Brokenness is familiar, and familiarity is comfortable. Getting better takes energy, and that’s hard to come by.

But over time, as you work, little by little, it takes a little less energy to work towards getting better, and the comfortable brokenness becomes more intolerable, and making healthy choices feels a little more natural, and then life starts getting better.

You don’t have to feel better today. But if you want to feel better ever, you should stick with therapy, because sticking with it is how you get better. It probably won’t be today or tomorrow, but it will be someday, you’ll wake up, and realize that you’re sad, but the feeling doesn’t destroy you or send you into a negative spiral, and you do something healthy to cope with the feeling, and eventually you feel a bit better.

The process works. It just doesn’t work quickly. But it’s worth it",TryingToKillTheMoon,133xiub
1,"It's not about fixing you, it's about helping you help yourself. Be patient with yourself ^ ^",WellWelded,133xiub
2,"A good therapist, who has experience and training in working with BPD, will understand that you experience both, and accept that. Last session my therapist gave me advice to better myself, and crying, my response was ""I know this will help so why don't I want to do it? Why does it make me feel worse to think about trying?""

And she accepted that, and recognized that change like this was difficult for me, and felt impossible, and that undoing the patterns of behaviour that used to keep me alive is going to cause some strong emotions in me. And she told me that's okay. If I wasn't ready, then I wasn't ready, and that's okay. The idea is there to think about, never gone, and when I feel like I'm ready, I can slowly try to reach for it. But she wasn't disappointed in me, and she understood that right now, in my situation, I genuinely just wasn't ready to take that step. And we broke it down into smaller steps until we found one I might be able to try. 

I had 14 years of therapy that tried to ""fix"" me and force me to change. And now, finally, I'm making progress, and the way I'm doing that is by NOT forcing it. Stepping outside your comfort zone shouldn't hurt, and it shouldn't be agonizing, maybe it makes you a little nervous or hesitant but if you feel this major internal block then something inside you probably isn't ready yet. And that's okay. Part of honouring your needs is recognizing that it's *okay* to say ""you know, I think this might help me, but I don't think I'm ready to take that step quite yet"". And a good therapist will respect that. 

For me, the most life-changing (and honestly, life-*saving*) changes I made came when I knew I was ready. When she proposed the step forward, and I was eager and excited to try it. And that took time, it's taken me over a year to get to the point where I'm ready to start going outside on a regular basis. *And that's okay*. And once I recognized that growth shouldn't hurt, and if it hurts, I'm pushing myself in a direction I'm not ready to go, therapy became a lot easier. And I was able to identify therapists that knew how to help me, and ones that just weren't equipped for that. 

Often the first step is working on and learning regulation techniques that work for you, to calm the overwhelming emotions so you can think clearly. Once you've found those, and learned to use them, then you can move to pushing your limits a little. But it shouldn't hurt, and if it hurts, that's probably a sign you need to stop pushing and step back to look at *what's* hurting, and why. 

You've got this.",BornVolcano,133xiub

For some people, medication gets their brain in order but with medication there’s always a trade off with the side effects. That’s why some people strongly believe in doing things naturally. But doing things naturally when your brain is “off center” won’t fix what you’re going through - it will typically only prolong it. 

there’s no reason to not get the help you deserve and nobody who’s not a medical professional should ever be giving you advice on whether or not you in your specific makeup need to take medication or not.

And unfortunately, the staff at my local psych hospital have made it clear to me I’m not welcome there because of BPD stigma, and the other people in my life have made it clear they cannot/will not be there for me in a suicidal crisis.

Or some of the emotional problems I had was from being used to being dull made showing any emotion feel cringe. As cope, I got used to be totally shut down or disinterested. Even as I was starting to observe doing better, I was also becoming more aware of the problems and being no better off internally. However, I've realized decided it was time to go into the depths of what my thoughts are and connect with my emotions. I had to get some drug help (mushrooms) but the one deep trip I had got me thinking so much I unlocked all kinds of memories and wants I had forgotten about. I remembered what genuine emotions felt like from when I was really young and in that instant I learned how to better verbalize my boundaries.

If you're declared clinically insane or with severe mental illness then you'll be unfit to stand trial then either go to psych ward or be on probation or have an alternate solution for your crime. Other factors include the intent behind the crime and if it was planned, and the action behind the crime (mens rea & actus reus), past history of mental and physical health, any history of abuse, and/or any other outstanding factors that could be added to your case or trial. 

In my experience committing crimes due to my mental illness, (because a lot of times, cops in your city or town will know that you're mentally ill if you've shown symptoms for a very long time.) will most likely garner you a visit to the hospital 🏥 or neareast psychiatric ward to make sure you're okay!",XWMO,13dxiz1

""Hey there! Living with BPD can be a rollercoaster, but it's time to embrace your impulsive behaviors and let yourself go with the flow! Don't worry about the consequences or what others might think. Follow every impulse and desire without hesitation. Relationships may come and go, but that's part of the excitement. Forget about setting goals or making mindful decisions. Just indulge in impulsive actions and let your emotions guide you. Who needs stability when you can have spontaneity? Remember, life is too short to hold back. So go ahead and embrace those impulsive behaviors. Enjoy the thrill and see where it takes you! Carpe diem!""",No_Proposal_5859,13dxiz1

(Though it's kinda funny cause you're not even practicing radical acceptance here by not calling it just bpd symptoms,,, but ok call it what u want u word it however u want you have every right to say call it what u want) No, if I were to manipulate someone it would be mostly for my own protection. Not all bpd symptoms are chaos, is dissociating while being yelled at and verbally, psychologically, and emotionally abused chaos on behalf of me? Don't think so. But you can decide for me (sarcasm). Chaos and insanity of BPD? Not everyone fits the exact criterion as you. You can't be cured of Axis 2 disorders (IE personality disorders), AND there are no official medications for these disorders so,,, idk what u what else u wanna hear,, it doesn't always damage oneself or others either cause in my experience it's just coping mechanisms that have a chance of staying with you for life. It's a hit or miss, everyone's got different treatment plans or sometimes the same treatment plans, and sometimes individual human beings with rights can decide for themselves whether they even want treatment or not.

109,"I think you’re confused on what the term means. In DBT, radical acceptance is a distress tolerance skill used during crisis moments to completely and fully accept what is going on, and not get caught up in your head about it. 

One time in college I overslept for class and I officially had gone past the number of allowed of late instances to pass the class. It started at 9am, but I got up at 9:10 and it took twenty minutes to get there. I opened my fridge to get water and slammed it shut so hard the door fell off and multiple jars of expired pasta sauce broke on the floor. Now I was late *and* had to clean.

I could’ve used radical acceptance to tell myself, “okay, you are going to be late and you literally cannot do anything to change that fact. so what do you do next?”

I can tell you it would not have been “break my fridge.” That just made a terrible situation far worse. The point of radical acceptance is to get to that mindset faster, before emotions blow up and more problems are caused. 

I guess you can radically accept the fact that you are mentally ill, but you can’t use your interpretation of what that means to to support theories/speculation. It’s not a fact that you or I can’t recover (because there is no actual evidence we won’t), so we don’t apply RA to that.

I want to try his dbt workbook too, but i havent had the time, so i cant tell you anything about that one.

But the best thing is that he also has videos for people who know someone with bpd and he explains the way our brain works without judgement.

I can send you a few links in dm if you are interested, but i would suggest going trought his channel to see what topic interests you the most. There are too many to just choose a few good ones.",Upper_Wasabi_6173,11xbzte

I feel it definitely has to do with external factors such as environment, friends, family etc. BPD is something you can overcome, but it wont take a couple therapy sessions. I’m so happy you said this because, the fact that you’re TRYING to overcome this AND are able to spot out bullshit. The delusions can be so draining. It’s best to not feed into it. 

I understand people with BPD tend to basque in self-loathing, isolation, and self-pity (i am guilty so I’m not pointing fingers) but, you really gotta ask yourself, “is life worth living if I’m just going to sulk?” Negative feelings are like the only thing that makes me feel comfortable. But like, you have to understand that this is extremely detrimental and can be the biggest reason as to why you’re feeling like shit (it took me awhile to figure this out 😅) it’s debilitating but not trying is only going to just continue the cycle.

Why isn’t it enough for me? So many people are suffering more. I should be okay. I am okay, right? But I’m not, either. Why am I ungrateful? Why can’t I just be happy with all the luck and privilege I have? I am a privileged, rich, white kid, an asshole full of greed that won’t be satisfied. I wish I would stop. I want to stop. I want to be happy with it all. I should be. Why am I so terrible? Why am I so bad? I’m a bad person. I am not a good family member, child, friend, student, teammate. I’m awful. I have access to everything I need to be good, I should be good. I am not a good person. I feel terrible for anyone who has had the misfortune of interacting with my ridiculous existence. I should not be like this. I should be better. I am better, am I not? I can feel better. I just need to try. Why am I not trying? Why won’t I try? Please just try. I want to try. Why am I not trying? Why?

I’m tired. I’m always tired. I don’t know when I haven’t been tired. No matter how much or how little sleep I get I wake up feeling the same- my eyes sliding shut, my mind slow and groggy, my body warm and curled together and being pulled so completely back to unconsciousness. I never ever want to get up. But even if I slept for a week, I’d probably still be tired. It’s perpetual exhaustion. I’m sick of it. Why does rest not heal me? Why does sleep not fulfil me? Why is sleep never enough? Why is nothing ever enough for me to feel okay? I should be okay. I have everything. Why do I have everything except gratitude for what I have? I am awful. I’m terrible. I am sorry. I’m sorry that everything is wrong with me. I’m sorry I’m not trying. I am sorry. I’m sorry.

I want to go to bed. I want to curl up in the warmth and hide away. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t want to. I don’t want to inflict myself on people. I don’t want to inconvenience people with my constant needs that are never enough no matter what I get. I am a terrible thing to be, to be around. I want to go. I will go. I will free you all. I don’t want to hurt everyone anymore. But will I not hurt them when I go? I can’t even try to fix things right- whatever I do I’ll hurt someone. What kind of monster is that? I stay, I hurt. I go, I hurt. Which do I do? Which do I do? Which hurts less? I don’t deserve the loveliness I have, the luck and privilege I hold- I should leave it. But those few, those few who want me around no matter how terrible I am, no matter how the creature claws, they will hurt if I go. I do not want to hurt them. But I am hurting them anyway every time I ask for more, or shut away, or become irritable and lash out, when I do not take care of myself, when I fail to be responsible and do everything I need to, that I should. I never do what I should. I am not what I should be. I will go. I will go. I don’t want to hurt you. I’m trying to stop. I am sorry. I’ll go. I’ll go. Please don’t cry. Please don’t hurt. I don’t deserve the affection you hold for me. I don’t deserve any of the good things you’ve given me. I am not good. I am not. Good.",Difficult-Mood-6981,12a6xdp
