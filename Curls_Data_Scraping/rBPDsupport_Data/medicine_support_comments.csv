Ik for a lot of people meds don't make a difference with bpd, it can help a little but dbt or cbt can help a lot as long as you keep up using it",punkmexicana,17gz61z
1,"I'm on Abilify and it's helped with all of my symptoms dramatically. Only problem is it's helped so much, I can't tell when I'm splitting. I used to be able to identify it when it was happening.",,17gz61z

3,I‚Äôm on many meds and unfortunately none have really worked on my splits. The only thing that helps is being alone and processing why i‚Äôm splitting thru writing,youtubehistorian,17gz61z
4,Lexapro has in general made my symptoms alot more tolerable but I don't think anything can directly help with splitting,belmoria,17gz61z
5,I got prescribed an ssri for my anxiety and a few other symptoms and it made my splits go crazy. I was thinking about trying to find a good mood stabilizer.,More_again1959,17gz61z

Then there is Dr. Glenn Patrick Doyle, he posts inspirational stuff mostly, but most of them you can relate to. Hope this helps you even a little bitü´Ç‚ù§Ô∏è Love and strength to you my dear.",Winter_Sandwich_9166,185cu1s
0,"I'm lucky my partner understands me (his mother and sister have both bpd) but i know it's still hard for him. I split a lot less since im on Lamotrigine but it still happens every now and then. Therapy hasn't really started for me yet. But when i split on my partner we always talk about it later.
What i was feeling, what i think triggered me and i'll make sure he knows im sorry and realy trying.

I also have 2 very, very loving friends. I told them i have bpd and gave them enough information to understand it better. Answered questions they had. They took it reaally well which i didnt expect. If i split on them they understand and just give me a hug which is what i need most of the time.

I don't know your whole situation but i hope this helped :)",paniekskater,16ixhgk
1,This was really helpful actually. I've been on lamotrigine also for about 2-3 months now!  I think it's been helping a lot too üòä,DiMiTriDreams420,16ixhgk
0,"i totally understand where your coming from, whenever i've gotten out of the psych ward or residential treatment i always feel so disregulated, a lot of the time i feel the exact same if not worse than when i went in. for me i've gotten through it by talking to the people around me but also just trying to come up with a new routine myself, do a deep clean of your room or living space and write out things you've been wanting to get done or start doing, kind of a cleanse of some sort is what's helped me. or try to do an old hobby you used to really enjoy even if you have to force yourself. and getting a new therapist is always so annoying because you have to start all over and it's more of an inconvenience than anything but in my case i just tell them the major things that have affected me in life to give them context and go from there, hope this helps!",Emo_barbie420,158x973

0,"I don't know what the meds mistake could do, but feeling a drop in mood overall makes sense. One thing about BPD is a predisposition to emotional vulnerability and a difficult time at regulating once stress has made you feel overwhelmed. So it makes sense that even for a few days you've been noticing low energy and mood. (I would definitely encourage you to eat, get water and morning sun, and rest, those can help reset).
