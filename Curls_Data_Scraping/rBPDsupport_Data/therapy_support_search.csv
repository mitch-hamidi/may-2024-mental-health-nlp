5,Has anyone ever taken the DES assessment while receiving therapy?,"Recently, I‚Äôve experienced a severe mental breakdown - to cut a long story short, the experience resulted in several hospitalisations and taking time off work for 2 and a half month to the present date. 

The aftermath of this was me receiving a care coordinator and psychologist, who have decided that given my recent experiences, they want to do an ‚Äòextended assessment‚Äô to clarify my diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with BPD for close to 3 years now and when initially diagnosed, I did not have to take the DES assessment. 

DES stands for Dissociative Experiences Scale, which is essentially a test of 28 questions relating to dissociative tendencies that you rate between 0-100% based on the regularity of your experience with the posed scenario. 

This is not anything I have ever been asked to do before, and I am unsure if this is a typical part of a BPD diagnosis. I have made peace with my diagnosis and being presented with the DES has sky rocketed my anxiety that it might not have been right all along. 

The last thing I want to do is send myself down the rabbit hole by googling to try and find any form of clarity on this, and I would be immensely grateful if anyone could shed any input on this or if they have any experience (personal or not) with the DES assessment. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this stupidly long post, it‚Äôs really appreciated.",1693350608.0,False,5,4,Ghostieeefizz,None,164xo6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/164xo6o/has_anyone_ever_taken_the_des_assessment_while/

9,advice on how to manage expectations/splitting in therapy,"Hey everyone,

I am looking for help with how to lower my expectations of my therapist and articulate what I need from him after feeling like my therapy has become stagnant. I have once previously voiced how I feel therapy isn't going anywhere asking him to be more directive and strict with me. I've realised I am withholding how I really feel from him or withhold being honest about what's going on for me as worried to be vulnerable but then I build up resentment towards him for not knowing what's going on or being able to help. This is a pattern in all my relationships and causes them to be really turbulent and painful. I am frequently told ""I can't mind read"" or ""nothing is ever good enough for you"" from ex's or family which I know is invalidating but I can see truth in what they say. All of this causes me to get very confused and not know what the truth is.

I have been working with a my therapist for 6 months after moving DBT clinics. It is really frustrating as I now dont do DBT the traditional way of group, coaching and individual all at the same place and instead see my individual therapist privately outside the clinic I do DBT in due to changes in the system. He is the 3rd DBT therapist I have worked with an I have been persistent trying to ride out my feelings of therapy being futile and work out if I am splitting on him. From a logical/rational perspective I understand he knows his stuff having worked as a DBT therapist for over 10 years and has done a mindfulness retreat with Marsha Linehan and frequently goes to trainings overseas. I found him after meeting a girl in a psych admission who said her BPD was in remission due to him and I take anything people say as gospel and immediately left my therapist to try and see him. I don't understand why I idolise people I haven't even met and then when they dont meet those expectations try and look elsewhere. I suppose I want to move to the next stage or address bigger picture stuff but he is hesitant to look at the past/family as it is not really inline with DBT which is focusing on the present and change. I want to get clear on where my therapy is going as I do'nt struggle with problem behaviours daily like I used to however I am frequently having melt downs, blowing up friendships, can't move on from failed toxic relationships or manage any perfjoamcne related stress/be employed.

This is my first post in reddit and am looking to become more involved with the BPD support community so any help in how to do so (commenting, with subs etc) would be appreciated. I usually attend weekly skills group, face to face therapy and daily 12 step meetings and due to COVID-19 I am unable to as I am sure many others are and I want to share experience and learn and help others.",1587470192.0,False,2,3,lilmissclingy,None,g5dvfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/g5dvfe/advice_on_how_to_manage_expectationssplitting_in/
10,I dont know how to get what I need out of therapy,"I havnt brought this up to my therapist because it seems kind of embarrassing but going into therapy I expected someone would beable to ask me the right questions to help me figure out what's best for me. This dosnt seem to be the case at all, is it because I'm just going through the free healthcare system or is therapy just not like that? Everything seems to be up to me and I'm supposed to know what kind of support I need to improve and maybe I'm just not that smart or something but that seems almost impossible to me. I do research and self reflecting often but I cant figure out the direction and actions I need to take in order to improve, I have tried some things but without success. I have told my therapist about the symptoms i deal with but so far I'm just working on a work book that isn't too bad but i feel like i need alot more. Its extremely hard for me to open up and it's also hard to Express that to let people know they need to encourage me to do so and be more presistant.

14,BPD vs RAD,"I have BPD (current diagnosis) and was treated for reactive attachment disorder at a ‚Äútroubled teen home‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm 21/F and was misdiagnosed with RAD (reactive attachment disorder) as a teen after I came out as gay to my parents. They blamed my ‚Äúunhealthy attachment to women‚Äù as ‚Äúmommy issues for being adopted‚Äù and claimed that I acted out and had behavioral issues. While I did have severe attachment issues, RAD is usually given to kids who are violent, constantly rebelling, and have no attachments at all. I never once was violent towards my parents or even threatened them, and my ‚Äúacting out‚Äù was me texting my girlfriend at the time behind their back because I knew the consequences if they found out. My parents were also heavily involved in the church. I had good grades in school, never had issues with other kids besides typical teenage drama, never used any substances until I graduated (good ol‚Äô MJ but nothing more). I did struggle with SH and my entire mood would be dictated around my girlfriend at the time, and I did feel as if I would pass away without her. However, those feelings never manifested through anger outwardly. 

 I was sent to the institute for attachment and  child development in Colorado, who‚Äôs notoriously known for mistreating and even taking the life of children. Just look up Candance Newmarker for reference, she was a victim to the same administration under a different name. The results of the treatment left me with years of trauma and it wasn‚Äôt until I was an adult when I got the BPD diagnosis and started doing therapy for it when I finally started healing. Therapy/meds for bpd has truly changed my life for the better, while therapy and meds from the RAD places made me even worse than I already was. 

I can‚Äôt seem to find any solid research on the differences between BPD and RAD and how detrimental it is to treat someone with BPD (who doesn‚Äôt have RAD) as if they had RAD. Does anyone have a similar experience or has studied this?",1713649446.0,False,1,1,GlassShake8689,None,1c91dsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1c91dsl/bpd_vs_rad/
15,No where to turn,"
No one needs to comment or read. I don't know where to type or go. 

My SO of 6 years told me to turn to reddit to ""vent"" instead of SM or friends. So I did. He wasn't happy with that. I have therapy 1 hour once a week. No one really knows how dark my mind is, even when I was ""venting"" in general.  We both have bad trust issues, we came out of bad marriages, we have done things to each other we regret. 
He's been reading things online and books that he knows are bad, but is sure I'm a typical BPD horrible person now. At first he didnt , i thought he knew better. We feel 10x more than neurotypical people, so sure, we react different than them.
This past month+  has been more than horrible. My dad passed when we weren't really expecting it (my mom passed in 2017 as well, that was truly unexpected). His dad passed in October which is bringing up emotions from that. He confessed something about 1.5 weeks ago and I'm trying to process that as well and I feel shattered from that too. I have a lot of emotions going on. It's like he thinks I should be over everything by now and be just fine. I'm TRYING to hold it together and I can't. I'm lucky to be alive if we're being honest. My depression is at an all time high, I'm anxiety predominant so this is odd for me. Yes. I've seen psych 2 weeks in a row emergent and will next week again for my regular visit which will male 3 weeks in a row (not including therapy.) 

It's constant tit-for-tat. Who can get who worse. He's no better than me but he seems to think he is bc he doesn't have the horrible bpd diagnosis.
 
At the same time there's so much good found in him and we can be amazing together. When it's good, it's great. He's the best to my kids. He treats me like a princess. He saw my dad the day before he went into the hospital when he went to get stuff from my brother and dad and dad and my SO talked abt marriage. He spent time at the hospital with him when I couldn't. He was with us when he took his last breath. It means so much to me. I cannot imagine life without him. 
My chest has been hurting since he made his confession. Not normal costochondritis muscle pain. I can't take another heartbreak. My marriage wasn't a heartbreak, that was a good riddance. This. I won't survive. I already feel it. 

With his dad, i helped make his transition as easy as i could on his family even it was just by being there (it was a long, heartbreaking decline.) I was strong for him until his dads funeral. My dad wasn't the best (I reminded him too much of my mom, so our relationship was strained, and other factors including his lady friend til they broke up) so his dad was a great father figure to me. I cherished every moment with his dad even more. 

 No relationship is flawless. I saw my parents go thru hell and swore they were going to divorce but they got thru whatever it was. We know we love eachother. 

He just started iop this week on his own and honestly I'm nervous bc I've been inpatient 7 times, in IOP for a while. I hear how they talk about bpd and know they're going to tell him to leave me fast especially when he tells them what's going on. I'm sure he's going to not tell them what he's done. It's human nature to save face. WHY is the person with bpd acting so erratic? There's a reason. 
He needs therapy for sure. Group therapy is just nerve wrecking with his situation overall (I don't want to tell all of his business.)

We're going to start couples therapy as well, if he still wants to do it. It would be nice if my therapist did couples but gotta be married. Idk when we can do it btwn everything going on. 

I wish I didn't feel. I wish I didn't care. 

I'm terrified. I can't leave my kids. I already tried once and nearly succeeded.

2. Tried to join a 52 week program on dialectical behavior therapy. The program was twice a week once for group & once for individual therapy.

5. I have not found self isolating to be such a bad thing till recently. Also, at the time mid Covid pandemic, and I submerged myself into continuing to grow my real estate brokerage. Business has been great! However, self love self care and therapy went to the back burner. In the meantime SUD has progressed. 
6. I am looking for a treatment center that has a detox and residential program that offers more of a deep dive into DBT but also allows for an hour or so each day before or after group to use my phone and computer. Dropping off the face of the earth when you are a small business owner is nearly impossible. Who is going to pay for the health insurance to stay in treatment? Often times the treatment is out of network or self pay so money needs to still come in. I have employees that are counting on me and their families.

21,Needing support,"Hello!
This is my first post ever on Reddit. I need support from people who also have BPD. 

I am 22f and I was properly diagnosed with BPD last year although I suspected it for a long time. I always had troubles with impulsivity, deppresion and emotional Control. Last year I fully realize how bad I am even though I was in therapy for almost two years at this time. It started when my boyfriend broke up with me. I Had a relationship before but this was first more long term. We were living together for couple months. 

I am acknowlegding that we had problems on his side, but I was more impulsive abusive and awful, because my mental Health was awful. I just got out from my parents house, was adjusting to new work, new city and was dealing with relative that Had dementia and unfourtunally died at the end of 2021. I am not saying this to demish what I did which included intensive splitting, arguing, trying to keep it through being FwB even though it was hurting us both etc. This land me in group therapy which I couldn't handle, because I really had a hard time hearing critism and taking full accountability for what I did. 

My question is does anybody else deal with a guilt after being abusive partner or is afraid of repeating the pattern? If so does it get easier and can you fully recover from it and be a good partner?

I am in New relationship since March this year and I am just afraid. Especially that It is long distance.. I don't want to hurt anybody else or myself. The guilt is sometimes overwhelming.

I have been in solid private therapy for nearly a year. It hasn‚Äôt been until recently I started properly opening up with my therapist and delving into the deep stuff and doing image rescripting.

Since I met him, I have been attracted to him in / physical way. I recognised he‚Äôs a good looking man‚Äôs in his early 30‚Äôs. He has a really kind and empathetic nature (duh he‚Äôs a therapist) and he has a really raspy deep soothing lovely voice. He listens and validates all of my feelings 

He made boundaries clear at the beginning of therapy and I remember being upset by his sentence ‚Äúyou will never know me in real life outside these four walls‚Äù - it made me feel grief after only having been to see him a few times. I know that‚Äôs insane, and he was setting a very normal and practical boundary. But I felt like I‚Äôd been kicked in the throat so I have been attached to him since very early on 

I can‚Äôt help that a part of me is just absolutely infatuated by him. He is tall, dresses casual-smart, has cool tattoos, looks after himself, is interested in art, healthy, likes good music, likes same TV shows as me and he is honestly just a really nice guy.

He has complimented me a few times but has always backed it up with him saying ‚ÄúI mean this in a professional manner‚Äù etc. 

I kind of want to talk to him about this crush but I‚Äôm also putting it off because it‚Äôs nice to have something to be excited about like I haven‚Äôt in a really long time. I realistically know him making any move would be horrible because he is a professional and I don‚Äôt want to get him into trouble. 

I honestly want to seduce him, and I want to lose weight and become prettier to appeal to him. I would actually do anything to be with him and it‚Äôs crazy because I know I‚Äôm just acting crazy. 

I have read about transference but I just don‚Äôt know how to get over it or how to actually tell him. I keep thinking about him and it‚Äôs all consuming literally I haven‚Äôt felt this way about someone in so long

26,"How do I stop an addiction to a toxic person without breaking down entirely again?
","
I've always had relationships that made me go ""insane"", awfully high highs and low lows and never understood why am I like that, until I was finally diagnosed a few months ago.

However I'm still waiting for therapy and can't seem to manage myself properly.

I had a toxic relationship as always and it seemed to give me the highest highs so far - what he says, the sex we had, just overall his energy, it was all a huge fixation for me and the source of euphoria. When it went downhill I hit the lowest lows in my life and that's a big thing considering that I've been mentally ill since childhood and have other diagnoses as well.

I was usually good at not expressing my reactions towards other people, they just ruin me. So in this situation I have someone who's hurt me deeply and who has been  for the past months a source of basically anguish I would say.

However now he's back and acting all nice and I'm all euphoric again. Life makes sense and I feel alive and everything feels so good and easy. When he was gone it was all just dark and I felt either  like I don't exist or shouldn't exist.

I know it can't last and I'm gonna crash down so hard again. But I can't afford to have that happen again. My uni and work has suffered because of the breakdown I had over the first breakup and if that happens again I'm so so screwed. I don't have access to my psychiatrist as I'm in a foreign land and I'm waiting still for online therapy. I'm alone here and if I crash down I'm just alone in the void.

I'm so happy now but in the back of my mind  I know im doomed.

29,End it all: points of views are appreciated,"Im in my early 30st. 
I had a handicap since i was a kid that led to a childhood full of bullying and resentment.
Was SAed by a trusted family member (not close family)
Bullied throughout kindergarten, elementary, and secondary school, it triggered me do much that I 
Feveloped a skin rash linked to stress and uncured.
Got type 2 diabetes at age 14.
Had body image issues as a teen/young adult. 

Started self harming on and off by age 14.

My older siblings  were overlooked since i got all the focus and attention being the youngest child and the sick one. I had to be accompanied by my parents for physical therapy and for talk therapy (for kids) for years and years. 
So i lived with the feeling of guilt since i took away all our parents focus, and time.

By 19h i was officially diagnosed with chronical  depression and general anxiety. 
Started using meds to just survive day to day life, but was never happy or anxiety free, just alive. 

By age 25 i tried to commit suicide and failed. (Insulin overdose: no one knew it was intentional).

I turned 30 and my doctor officially diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. I read about it and it makes sense. 

I have a job that im giving the bare minimum to, and feels guilty for letting them down.
No friends because i cant keep a human relationships since i go through a lit of isolating phases.
I still see myself as the biggest burden to my old and tired parents. And a disappointment to my own self. 
I dont want to get better i want to disappear.

Im thinking about ending it all.

I dont want to traumatize my parents so no jumping from the rooftop or hanging in my room, im doing it by meds. 

I heard that if u mess up you can fuck urself up and not die so im looking for tips to not fuck it up. 

Meds that i have access to: fast acting insulin 
Risperdal (raspidone)
bromazepam (lesomil)
Lamictal (Lamotrigine)

30,Looking for reason(s) to live,"Hi, 38F here. I was diagnosed with quiet BPD last year, also have a history of OCD, PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression. I‚Äôm high functioning but have been going through a major bout of depression for about the past month. Feelings of emptiness and desire to die are pervasive and began around age 4-5. I go to therapy weekly and treat my symptoms with daily MMJ and occasional psilocybin.

In my latest therapy session, it was suggested that I need to find motivation to live based on ‚Äúpermanence‚Äù. My therapist and I both recognize that, while the structure of daily activities gets me through the day most times, I still lack an overall goal/reason to prevent me from ending my life prematurely. When asked what type of reason I might find, she said that it is up to me to discover that and I am experiencing a mental block to finding out what my purpose is, for lack of a better word. Have any of you out there been able to find a real reason to live beyond career goals, raising a family, or financial milestones? I want to learn to cope with this better but I‚Äôm really at a loss here. 

For reference, I‚Äôm financially secure, have a supportive family and plenty of friends, no desire to have children, and a complicated situationship that admittedly causes most of my acute issues with BPD.

37,How can I help myself?,"First I want to apologize for the long post that you're about to read but I'm really losing my sanity at this point.

I (f 21) was dating a guy (20) for about two months, he was a virgin and I was his first ever , everything was going so so well , we are very compatible and I really liked him a lot and still do like him , he also liked me a lot , until..

Before we had sex for the first and last time ever he had talked to me about STDs and I told him that he has nothing to worry about because I have never had an STD , so two weeks later we have unprotected sex , and it was really really good , ten days later he started experiencing some symptoms like a burning sensation when he pees , white or clear discharge, his penis was red and swollen, and he was going crazy and he was very very anxious and scared (rightfully so) he went to a doctor and the doctor told him that it's probably gonorrhea and he told him to start with the medication that he prescribed to him after he got a test , the test came back negative, and I also did all the STDs tests and all of them came back negative as well . (For the record we are syrians and we live in syria , so we are very tight on money and the whole process of going to doctors and taking all the std tests was very dangerous because any kind of sexual activity before marriage is not okay here) .

This guy is now convinced that I gave him something and he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, and he keeps calling me reckless (which I know I am I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago but my parents refused to believe it and didn't get me medication or treatment) .

My problem is that I was also too ignorant to believe it (because mental health is not really a thing in Syria) and now I feel like I desperately want him to stay in my life because I didn't do anything wrong, and I feel like my world is collapsing, and I know that I need to go to therapy and get treatment but I don't have any money, therapy is very expensive here and I don't know how to cope anymore, I truly saw something in him , and I feel like shit for losing him as a friend and as a lover , I didn't want things to go that way at all , and I don't know what to do.",1715932579.0,False,1,0,Unfair_Solution_2317,None,1ctzrvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ctzrvj/how_can_i_help_myself/

39,"Follow up - How to stop being abuser TW: SI, SA, ABUSE","Hello. 
Some time ago I posted here about being afraid of parpatuating in cycle of abuse. Since then some things have changed. 

I still feel guilty for my past. I still feel like a bad person and I still feel lost. But at the same time thanks to therapy and meds I was able to break the pattern.

Long story short I was in long distance relationship for past two months. Me and my boyfriend tried to work it out. Unfortunally he wanted to stay in a place where he currently is, because it is better than my country for him. I can't immigrate now because college in my country is free while in the USA where he is I would have to pay. And although I love him and I would immigrate it would be in a time when I finished college and gained more financial stability - I have problems with impulsive spendings - so It was hard for us. We drift Apart and although both of us tried we both weren't happy. Me especially because as a pwBPD I am triggered by abondoment and distance. And the first plan was he would come back to my country in 5 months time when he gets his papers in check. 

So at Sunday we broke up. It wasn't easy decision. I think we both took it very hard. But I am proud to say that I broke the cycle. I would split on him even back in March when we met. I would harras him, I would beg him to comeback even threathend to hurt myself. And just to him, but to my parents and friends as well. I would probably be institiunalized again or at least took to ER. But this time I blocked him. Not because I hate him. I am hurt, sad, deppresed but I don't hate him. I finally see the other side the other person feelings even though my heart is bledding. I see past my hurt feelings and unmet needs. 

So for anyone in similar situation: block your ex. Delete all of the contacts, reminders etc. Go to therapy. Practice mindfullness, meditation, yoga. Focus on other stuff. Do whatever neccesary to not cause harm to you or your ex, especially if they were your FP. Let yourself be angry, hurt, dissapointed. But don't took it onto yourself or the other person. Don't split. It is hard. But therapy and meds help.

If anyone Has the same guilt and shame as me and is afraid that they can't change let this be an example. And also don't beat yourself up if you fucked up. Healing takes a lot of time and work. You won't be perfect, I am not Perfect. But we can heal.

54,I lost myself,"I used to have such a strong identity in high school. I was sure of my self, probably a bit thick skulled- but I was a person. 

I still had issues, but I managed them much better. 

Then as I went into adulthood and started facing isolation, rejection, career rejection, toxic relationships, breakups, homelessness, domestic violence, hospitalization, more and more hardship on my own and often stacked on top of each other, my sense of self eroded into nothing. 

After my last break up my brain went blank. I moved back in with my mother and had to give up everything that once gave me joy and identity. 

That was almost two years ago. 

Trying to be myself hurt me so deeply and set me back a great deal. 

Now I wake up everyday wishing someone could tell me who to be so my life can work out. 

I don‚Äôt have any real hobbies, a job, money, friends, a relationship, I have nothing going for me at all.

55,I wanted to share some coping mechanisms,"Hello. Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and these are just suggestions:
Mindfulness Meditation: Taking a few minutes to focus on your breath can help ground you in the present moment and reduce anxiety.
Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and emotions can provide a valuable outlet for self-expression and self-reflection.
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Techniques: DBT skills, such as emotion regulation and distress tolerance, can be powerful tools for managing intense emotions.
Engage in a Hobby: Find activities you enjoy that allow you to express yourself creatively or provide a sense of accomplishment.
Reach Out for Support: Connect with friends, family, or support groups who understand or are willing to learn about BPD. Sharing your feelings can be therapeutic.

77,how do i have a normal relationship?,"So sorry this is a bit long but if anyone can give me any advice I'd appreciate it!
For some context - I have BPD and my boyfriend does not. He has some other mental health struggles but they infrequently cause any tension or issues in our relationship and none are personality disorders.
I started dating my boyfriend about 8 months ago and this is the healthiest/most stable partner I've ever had. 
In all of my previous relationships, conflict was always resolved in unhealthy ways like screaming or ghosting, and the relationships tended to be very intense and short-lived. Unfortunately, a lot of those behaviors and tendencies are still hardwired in me.
In this relationship, almost all the issues we have are caused or worsened by me escalating things out of instinct/habit.
I tend to get insecure about his feelings towards me, usually triggered by small things like a shift in tone or a perceived lack of interest, and I vaguely ask for constant reassurance (things like ‚ÄúDo you still want to be with me, do you still love me‚Äù etc). When his answer isn't perceived as ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to me I lash out and accuse him of not caring about or loving me.

I feel like I‚Äôm abusing him the same way my ex did me. Current partner did some things that weren‚Äôt completely loyal in the beginning of our relationship, so I cheated on him.

82,i feel trapped ,"‚Äº‚ÄºPLEASE READ‚Äº‚ÄºI have BPD and the person i'm in a situationship with also has BPD and we are sort of heading into a relationship with exclusivity but we haven't labelled it yet, but we argue frequently over small stuff and it's so mentally draining. Anyways what i wanted to say is, my ex was/is abusive and she was able to hide it so so well (even to this day i'm still not convinced she abused me but most of my closest friends in my life have been trying to drill it into my head), i'm just seeing a bit of a pattern with my current 'partner' and i feel trapped. I'm 18 and a lesbian so there's a lot of stuff that makes me feel giddy inside like how we have a shared playlist on spotify etc. I understand BPD but i don't think that can excuse their behaviour towards me, i keep saying that since i don't react that way then why do they react that way but of course we are all individual with our own opinions and feelings, i just feel like me having BPD also gets pushed under the rug and when their friends (who are also my friends now) come to me about something that happened with them and how i need to communicate and stuff, they are always a lot harsher to me but seem to step on egg shells around them. They have broken the one boundary i set (i have no boundaries or standards due to being a very passive and forgiving person) which was to not kiss my friends (lesbian circle is insane) and they did just that last month... 3 times (same person), the first time was okay ish since i didn't specifically set that boundary but the second time they split on me and did it in front of me (this was when i set the boundary clearly) and then the third time they did it and their excuse was to get back at me because they thought i was also kissing other people but i wasn't and the person they kissed was on pingers (supposed love drug) i'm still slowly forgiving them for it. Whenever we do argue, i always end up apologising for reacting (even when i rightfully reacted how a normal person would) and they only seem to apologise when it makes them look like a good person. I'm just worried about looking like the bad guy when i am friends with their friends and i have gotten closer to them and vice versa. Im scared if i end things i will lose the friendships i got from being with his person. I also don't think i can leave since i am so emotionally attached it really freaks me out. Also when we argue, it's never been me starting (except for the time they kissed my friend), it's always been them getting defensive and then it ends up becoming an argument. Ah i don't know i really like this person but it feels embarrassing that i would be getting into my next relationship with a potential abuser/narcissist AGAIN. Now i'm stressing that maybe i'm the problem. I think i have been able to tame my BPD but i don't think my 'partner' has and it is just so draining, because they are SO nice and sweet in person, it's just over text and it really freaks me out. For example (i could keep talking about this) today/yesterday they left me on opened on instagram, which isn't objectively a big deal but because of my BPD i get scared that if they don't like my message or respond then that means they are mad at me, so i said to them in a jokey way ""MATE STOP AIRING ME ON HERE ARGH LIKE THE MESSAGE OR SMTH PLZ üò≠"" they respond ""BRUH I DIDNT NOTICE"" I respond ""ü§ì you've done it so many times STOP IT"" they respond ""what the fuck it literally doesn't matter"" in response i did leave them on read/open. They also continue to dismiss my feelings on something. I really need advice. Im not sure if i can cut them off completely because we also have shared friends and i just worry that they will be on my 'partners' side and not mine (im not trying to imply there are sides but since they are closer to my 'partner' they would probably have that bias) and i don't want their friends to message me about it. Also needed to add when i say that they did something that hurt my feelings they straight away get defensive rather than thinking about my feelings and how to comfort me and reassure me.

84,Advice! How do you self motivate to keep your space clean??,"TLDR: I need help on how to self motivate to keep my space clean and actively make myself get up and do cleaning tasks!

Hey all! I‚Äôm reaching out for help and advice! My partner and I are running into an issue that is 100% my fault. I‚Äôm owning this and I need help on how to fix it. 
He feels as though he has to treat me like a child/ I treat him like a parent. Specifically in the areas of cleaning and house work. I have zero motivation to do any of it. I don‚Äôt get dopamine from cleaning, or from having a clean space. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me. Like at all.
But it matters to my partner. And it matters to most people, and I know that logically. But when I‚Äôm home and I know that I could sweep or mop or do the dishes, I just don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have the motivation to get up and do it, because it doesn‚Äôt make me happy. I don‚Äôt get joy from finishing a task or completing something. I don‚Äôt feel satisfied when I put effort into something, especially something that doesn‚Äôt bring me joy.
But he‚Äôs put his foot down. Last straw kind of scenario. We want to move out together on our own. And he doesn‚Äôt want to do that with me if he has to do all the cleaning. And that is completely valid, and understandable. And I‚Äôm not upset with him. I‚Äôm more upset with myself that I can‚Äôt bring myself to do what he‚Äôs asking.
So I‚Äôm looking for some ideas or things that have worked for others with BPD to get rid of or deal with the executive dysfunction that I‚Äôm struggling with!

86,Favorite person ,"For individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), a 'favorite person' can play a central role in their lives and significantly impact their emotional well-being. The term 'favorite person' refers to an individual, often a friend, family member, or partner, whom someone with BPD considers their primary source of support, validation, and stability.

The relationship with the favorite person is often intense and complex, characterized by strong emotional bonds and profound dependence. For individuals with BPD, the favorite person can serve as an emotional lifeline, someone they rely on to help them cope with intense emotions, mood swings, and identity issues.

However, it's important to note that fixation on the favorite person can also be a significant challenge. Individuals with BPD may become excessively fixated on their favorite person, experiencing intense anxiety and fear of abandonment if they perceive any loss of support or connection. This fixation can lead to disruptive behaviors such as outbursts of anger or self-harm.

Acknowledging and understanding the dynamics of the relationship with the favorite person is crucial for providing effective support to individuals with BPD. Therapy and support focused on developing healthy coping mechanisms and strengthening emotional regulation skills can make a difference in the lives of those affected by BPD and their loved ones.

Additionally, it's worth noting that for some individuals, such as myself, the fixation on the favorite person can be particularly severe. In my case, my previous psychologist was my favorite person, and I have not been able to move on from this fixation, causing significant distress and difficulty in managing my emotions. 

Are there others here who experience this as well? If so, who is your favorite person? And how do you cope with it?",1714856481.0,False,5,1,thisborderline,None,1ckaf90,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ckaf90/favorite_person/

89,Chronic Numbness/Emptiness *mention of suicide*," 

So I am currently sitting here in front of my laptop and this is probably my tenth time in the past month trying to write out my feelings but every-time I tried to it felt so forced and fake. The numbness I feel is so debilitating it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not a person. I don't feel like I am real. Someone on reddit said that bpd emptiness specifically feels like constant numbness simultaneously accompanied with a heavy tension. It feels like there is constantly something weighing down my chest. But I cannot process what emotion this weight stems from. However, one feeling that I am able to feel is kind of a worry/fear. Because when I have gotten in these numb episodes in the past it has never ended well. It resulted in months or even years of my life wasted due to a lack of motivation, of care, of any effort at all. Because after a certain point of feeling empty you stop caring about everything in the world including yourself. 

I'm so scared of feeling the full extent of my emotions because every time I do I feel like a freak or a fucking monster and I always regret it afterwards. Repressing my emotions in the past has led me to self destructive behaviours like failing out of school, self harm, and using sex and drugs as an unhealthy coping mechanism to try to fill the void. As these episodes progress it causes my self hate to grow and grow to a point where it makes me suicidal, because while everything is getting worse and worse I am fully aware of how bad it is but I still can‚Äôt do anything to change it. This adds a constant guilty feeling over everything. The guilt of not doing anything to stop it. The guilt of knowing better but not doing better.

It feels like I‚Äôm digging myself a deeper hole with each day that passes with this emptiness. And thinking about pulling myself out of it makes me feel so exhausted and drained. It takes sooo much effort out of me to do so. Feeling the full extent of my emotions feels like walking into a battle field with no amour. And it never feels like it's worth it because in the end the cycle will restart and I will find myself deeper than the last rock bottom I rescued myself from. Apart of me knows that because of my bpd this cycle will not necessarily ever disappear because the trauma I‚Äôve been through has rewired my brain chemistry in irreversible ways. However, I‚Äôve been through enough therapy and read enough books to know that trauma is an inevitable part of life. I know that I have to accept the things that aren't  in my control and change the things that are. I know that trauma has both the possibility to shape people into success or failures and ultimately it‚Äôs up to me to make that decision. 

I've heard of stories of people altering their lives with therapy and developing healthier coping mechanisms but the question I always seem to come back to is how do they make it last long term? Why does it work for them and not me? I too have gone to the gym for 6 months consistently and have gone to therapy for months on end, ate a good diet and got 8 hours of sleep every night but there comes a point where slowly one by one each of those skills and coping mechanisms tip toe out the door one by one. Almost in a way where I don't notice it fully until they are all gone and I am left barren, all alone with the dark twisted corners of the inside of my head. No where to find comfort, no where to feel safe, no where to breathe smoothly. Each time I feel like an idiot for thinking the cycle is over.  Boom, I get a trigger I can‚Äôt handle. A trigger that the gym can‚Äôt take off my mind, or therapy sessions don't help with. There it is. Consuming me and swallowing me and I have to sit patiently waiting for it to spit me out so I can breathe again. So I can try again.

So we started dating, and this is an emotional rollercoaster. She is kinda immature, eventhough she was diagnosed, she doesn't go for therapy. Most of our days are filled with issues and nights with immense longing and intense emotions. We almost fight and breakup in the morning and reconcile with like an super toxic couple. I try to help her with her issues, it doesn't work. I always have to be the mature person in the relationship and help her deal with the anxiety attacks of arguments and ghosting she fucking does. 

Its hard, but still fucking stimulating enough to make me focus on this more than anything else in this world. Its fucking with my brain and also for a first time making me feel like immensely loved by someone who understands me finally ( most of the time, we are still working on understanding emotions and dealing with it ).

Idk, if its gonna last, even if it's gonna develop into something beutiful or toxic. Still exploring that. Rgt now i just understood that this is a risk I'm willing to take. Also i don't know why, i seem to assosciate our relationship to the one in You season 2.

99,how do i stop these constant intrusive thought cycles ?,"I am 23 years old and have been diagnosed with BPD from a very young age, which i always found odd because such diagnoses are not usually given out that early. Besides the point after lots of therapy and lots of different medication I decided medication was not for me and using my skills/ maturing and growing would supplement. I absolutely hate the way medication makes me feel and I was very open to trying tons of different options from tons of different psychiatrists. Throughout all this time it‚Äôs just been years and years of absolute insanity I went through serious verbal emotional and sometimes physical abuse from my father when I was little developed a self harm and literal heroin addiction which after years and years I was able to knock. I was in a horrid relationship with a 30 year old grown man with BPD when i was 19 that was horrid but i was petrified to lose my cats ( which he ended up stealing anyways) But I finally mustard up the courage to leave. After that I really started diving into my healing, setting boundaries staying active and with purpose doing hobbies instead of going out to the bars so much. It was all starting to clear up for me and I was no longer a sad shell of a person with constant insane thoughts controlling my brain and perception. I have now began a new relationship with another undiagnosed man w BPD ( his family is holistic but his mother and sister have told me it runs in family and he definitely has it) way closer to my age range actually enjoys the things I enjoy I love him so much and it‚Äôs truly been so fun and showed me what I deserve in a partnership! BUT he has never seen any medication or therapy and has severe episodes that do always include extreme verbal abuse and sometimes extreme physical abuse. Because of these episodes I have started having mine again, which makes me uneasy as it has been a long longggg time since i‚Äôve had a violent raging self harming BPD episode and it scares me and makes me feel gross about my self. So with all that context this morning we had a very big discussion about how his episodes are causing me to digress and im feeling more and more mentally i‚Äôll every day. He has agreed to make changes and be a more active communicator. But i just have this sinking feeling that no matter how it goes all the hurt has piled up too much and my brain won‚Äôt let me forget all the lies and hurtful words and abuse. It also makes me wonder if people with BPD are just destined to be alone my mom always frowns upon me dating even though ive only had 2 boyfriends my whole life. I‚Äôm just scared that the thoughts in my head are going to consume me all my life until  i can‚Äôt live with it and i don‚Äôt know how to make them stop I feel very hopeless but I also know how to cope and start getting back to a place of productive healing i‚Äôm just weary of having to constantly talk myself of the ledge for my whole life. It feels hopeless.",1694123191.0,False,4,3,Objective_Way_678,None,16crlcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/16crlcn/how_do_i_stop_these_constant_intrusive_thought/
100,I need tips,"So I (25f) have been with my partner for the past two years. I was upfront and honest about my mental illnesses (Obviously BPD being one) from the beginning and about the fact that I had been in therapy most of my life. I've done a lot of work to try to get to a point to where I could somewhat control my emotions, ourbursts, as well as maintaining a job, my hygiene, friendships, etc.


Things changed when a few things happened that really hurt the trust in our relationship. I'd not been in love with someone for a few years before him, and when I fell, obviously I fell hard. I was extremely secure before it happened. So when this trust was broken, I began a course of losing control daily.


I began doing the things. Constantly asking if he still loved me. If he was cheating on me. If he fancied other women. I started getting so deeply obsessed with trying to find connections that may or may not have been there. Some of it is still hazy to me. I started taking care of myself less and less. Snapping at him and immediately registering any shift in his mood as his declaration of calling it quits for us. Granted some things I ended up being right about, but they maybe they really were not THAT big of issues?


Anyways, obviously this has put a huge strain on our relationship. I want to give him credit where it's due and say he has tried here and there to reassure me, especially when things initially went down, and somewhat tried to rebuild that trust. But finally admitted how hard it is to want to rebuild that trust, and give that reassurance, when I myself am constantly overthinking and constantly needing reassurance multiple times a day, for days at a time. 


This post isn't to complain about him, or get an opinion on whether or not either of us are treating the other fairly. We have had multiple conversations with great communication confirming we both want to make things work in the end, so I am also not wanting people to decide whether we should stay together or not. I will not speak for him, but I will say I truly want to do at least everything I can as my part in making it work as I know how frustrating and exhausting it is to live with this inside my own mind, and can't imagine how frustrating and exhausting it must be for a partner.


Anyway, my main goal in writing this is to ask if anyone at all has any advice to help snap me out of when I am ""splitting"". How to get back to reasoning with myself before reacting. How to think critically, rather than overthink every word or action. I've been able to overcome my lack of personal hygiene and have gotten back into taking care of myself physically. But after digging myself so far back into this hole, I am struggling with how to navigate getting back out and reclaiming my functionality when it comes to living with my own brain. Are there any books that don't make you feel worse?  TIA.",1705378052.0,False,4,2,WoahIssaMe,None,197tivn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/197tivn/i_need_tips/
101,What to do when you've lost a support group?,"Bit of a brief post here, on an alt, I hope that's okay.

Recently lost a few partners (polyamorous) and an entire, mutual friendgroup to a really hard month - I'm not going to mince words, I was really unpleasant and paranoid during said month and we had anxious, hours-long discussions about every little change. At the time I thought I was just exercising good communication, but now I realize I was simply exhausting everyone around me ...  


Most of them are gone. Most are NC. I feel like I don't have a safe space to go back to anymore and it's making the thought of continuing on with therapy, my workbooks, and everything else a lot harder than it used to be. I really felt like I was getting somewhere until I destroyed everything ...  


So my question is, what do I do when I really don't have anywhere to go? I have a few friends I can talk to sporadically, but as far as having a 'safe' place to fall back to goes, I'm completely on my own right now. I really need to find a new place to feel comfortable, but I don't want to do it in such a way that just repeats the mistakes of the past.

102,I just ruined my relationship of 10 years and I lost my home.,"I want to start by saying I was diagnosed with BPD in 2017. It's been a problem for years and after having a manic episode in 2018 because of losing my job and moving, I've been working on myself non-stop and the whole time my partner who I love with all my heart and soul was there. But this year has been a nightmare, family members passing, employment issues, and the kicker, our ceiling caving in and our landlord having to redo the roof and ceilings.
These stressers have trigger another manic episode. O moved into my friends place because I was getting sick from the mold in the house then My friend and I started about moving in together without my partner knowing, then we started talking to them, then I turned it into a ""you don't tell me how you feel"" and they responded with ""I'm scared of making you mad"" then we started couples therapy.
I started looking for signs of what I should do, like mystic spiritual stuff, and I took somethings as signs to leave. My friend and my mother supported it, they (mostly if not only my mother) had been pushing me to leave for years.
Last Sunday I finally did it. I left my husband and I decided to move out, but now I'm in a situation of whether or not I myself wanted this or was it just me being heavily influenced.
I'm miserable, I've been crying off and on since I did this and I don't know what to do. I know I don't want my partner taking me back, I've put them through so much, but I want to go home. Where we lived together is my home. I want to go home, but I already made my bed and I'm moving in with my friend and her roommates.

105,How best to handle partner with potential BPD considering self harm.,"My boyfriend was diagnosed with BPD years ago, but will often flip between possible explanations for why the diagnosis is wrong. I'm not going to challenge his view of this, but I need help.

Its a complicated situation we're in, but the pertinent details are that he will occasionally enter a severely depressive state and will seriously discuss ending his own life. He is normally a very talkative and outgoing person, but completely shuts for 1 - 3 days or so when these moods hit.

I suffer from depression and even attempted end my own life once, so I'm highly empathetic when he gets like this, but that was a long time and years of therapy ago. It's gotten a lot better as our relationship has progressed, turning from week long severe meltdowns to short depressive moments as he's gotten to be more comfortable living in the safe environment I've tried to create for him.

We're in a polyamorous throuple, and our other partner that lives with us is highly supportive as well, we often switch off trying to take care of our boyfriend when it gets too much for one of us.

Today's episode has been pretty bad though, it was triggered by not being able to find the clothes he needed, and was exasperated when I tried to help. He blew up pretty bad, storming around the house until he tired himself out and has been nonverbal ever since, only piping up to say he wants to die.

I love him so much, he's ussually such a pleasant ray of sunshine, a genuinely wonderful and amazing person, and hurts so much to see him in pain like this. If it were me I'd want to be held and comforted, but he actively refuses physical contact when he gets this bad and I don't really know what to do.",1700893489.0,False,2,11,Sovereign42,None,183df8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/183df8e/how_best_to_handle_partner_with_potential_bpd/
106,"thoughts on ""I hate you dont leave me""?","Im curious what other peoples experience with this book is as I'm failing to see why people keep reccomending it. I sought out this book as per reccomended by many people in this group. I am at about the end of chapter 2, and so far this book has been both transphobic/homophobic, lumping the latter in with ""sexual perversion"" and erased the existence of intersex people (aka bad science). It's clearly dated as it references the DSM IV released in 2000 as the most recent release. Therefore much of the information information it discusses as matter of fact is likely not even accurate by todays standards. Fuck, the book even tries to speculate that the increase in fascination with tattoos could be linked with ""the rise of BPD"" when earlier in the book it mentions that there probably isnt event a rise in BPD but a rise in awareness of it. This book seems to constantly contridict its self on top of being dated and bigoted. How does anyone find this credible?? 

I know i'm not that far in it yet. So i'm going to keep reading and give it a genuine chance. But at this point it seems likely that I am going to try to steer people clear of this book.

Out of curiosity, I looked back at our texts. Apparently, we sexted A LOT and, also apparently, had sex once or twice. (I have very poor recall of this time.) We ended things after he stopped responding and I got prickly and confronted him. He apologized and told me I was ""amazing and beautiful,"" and that I deserve honesty. He said he gotten sick, and during that time he realized that he wants a relationship, which at the time I said I did not want. I got mad and texted something snide, and he did not respond. I totally get it. Again, dysregulation.

Now in 2023, I am looking for a relationship. I'm medicated, in therapy, and actively working on getting my life together. I remember liking him, and would be interested in seeing him again.

Part of my BPD means that I get SO excited about someone, and then do Too Much.

I would just off myself if he felt the same way about me and I knew. I don't know anything about splitting which is making this scarier. I don't ever want to lose him because he's everything to me.

I want to stop the bitterness and anger and betrayal I feel. I don't ever feel this way and I don't believe any of this is true until I'm deep in it. I just want this to stop because he doesn't deserve this awful behavior.

121,Need someone to talk to,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439534.0,False,4,3,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ad08fd/need_someone_to_talk_to/

Recently I‚Äôve stopped going to therapy because my therapist is very old (I‚Äôm 20f) and doesn‚Äôt really understand me. I feel like I can‚Äôt be honest with her because of that. Anyways. The other day we were having a really good week and decided to see each other on Sunday, we woke up early, went to the Perot Museum in Dallas, went out to lunch, had some fun in a hotel room and then it was time to go home. Well when we got back to my parents house (we don‚Äôt live together but that‚Äôs a whole other story) my mom had given me the garage code so o could go inside and relax as I had work the next morning (I ended up calling off due to the emotional state I was in) but it didn‚Äôt work. No matter what code I tried, how hard or soft I pushed- nothing worked. At this point I was so frustrated I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and started going into an episode. I called my mom and started crying saying it wasn‚Äôt working then getting very angry and wanting to leave. My (ex)boyfriend started getting a little worried and said that he needs to take some space and he thinks it‚Äôs the best idea for him to go home as my parents would be back soon. I ran after him and stopped him from getting in the car. We had an argument and I kicked his front bumper and his front drivers door (I didn‚Äôt leave ANY dents or scratches) which made him freak out more.

My negative thinking and anger, self pity and such are becoming a real problem in every aspect of my life. 
To me the core of BPD is feeling emotionally invalidated but the. To survive we have to suppress and deny our emotions...my autistic logical brain hates this. I want to let out my feelings but they only bring punishment ostracization and so on. They get in the way of doing anything because I just haaaave to do what I feel like doing or stop trying to take action on unwanted tasks to avoid meltdown. Im tired of having to participate in roommate life, society, work, everything bc it takes such conscious control of my impulses and feelings at all times. Im worn out trying to be normal and can't tell when to take self care advice or when its time to compromise. I wish being honest, spontaneous and natural was actually okay the way They say it should be. To be honest that feels like lifelong gaslighting - just be you and it will all work out! Maybe for some folks. 

I feel like a permanent toddler, like I should just be able to do what I want, but I'm constantly in trouble, melting down and being judged for it. 

Is this something DBT works on? Or some kind if trauma healing therapy? 

Therapy sometimes just feels like more gaslighting. did EMDR once and it RUINED my life for years after. I even drew my therapist a comic of the different parts of me in boxes and her erasing the lines, the little tantrum throwing kid got out and the whole comic fell apart. She still pushed ahead and sure enough, I lost control and did some horribly embarrassing public meltdown that landed me in jail.

I want to understand the appeal of Adult Regulated life besides ""behave or else."" It so viscerally unappealing despite all the perks. My body & emotions really do seem to be stuck in toddler stage and its so frustrating!

So for example today, I didn‚Äôt sleep all night was doing cocaine till about 1pm today about 5pm I said to myself and meant it genuinely, felt like I really was serious for once, said I‚Äôve had enough of doing this, and it‚Äôs selfish and I‚Äôm bored of it and had enough of repeating this cycle & that I‚Äôm not going down this route, because I know what‚Äôs happened in the past when I‚Äôve abused drugs to much. I even said to my friends that I do drugs with, I was going to distance myself from them & obviously I have said this to myself before, but I like felt really serious this time. Bearing in mind I still haven‚Äôt slept, without even realising to myself what I said earlier I go and get more on tick when I‚Äôm skint and have an early morning hospital appointment, so deep down I know it‚Äôs a bad idea but just don‚Äôt even think about the consequences, even though my normal self is the biggest stress head and overthinker, but for some reason when I do these self disruptive things, I somehow just don‚Äôt care almost and just think will be fine.

I‚Äôm just wondering is this normal with bpd and i‚Äôve just never really noticed it before and if so, is there anyway to control yourself when you go into the self disrupt careless mindset, like how do you get your normal self back that thinks logically, because I can see this is like one massive problem in my life, and in the past that mindset got me to a point I was an alcoholic, doing cocaine whenever I got the chance and on a rehab list and eventually jumped off a bridge, because of hating myself so much n rhen doing it over again, then feeling terrible later on.

125,I forget who I am at least once every two weeks,"Hi I'm not a native English speaker so I may sound a little sloppy here and there. I struggle to keep a coherent and consistent idea of who I am. I've always been like this but it was harder when I was younger (I'm 26 now, my doctor told me I had BPD when I was 21) I grew up with dermatillomania and euretophobia (not sure how to spell it) and nobody to help me, just people telling me I was stupid/selfish/shallow/cringy. I was lucky enough to meet a great therapist. Had transactional therapy for 5 years and I got so much better at life my younger self wouldn't even recognize me. One thing that hasn't changed a lot tho is how fragile my concept of my own identity is. I've just accepted it as a part of life but it's frustrating to rebuild it everytime. Last time it happened was a few days ago when all of a sudden I remembered my own name and experienced a little dissociation, felt confused and depressed, started questioning myself about who I am and so on and so forth. Also, my job has a formal dress code and we always need to be chill even in stressful and overwhelming situations.

126,The pain of picking myself up time and again,"This is a rant and I'd also appreciate some support. Yet another failed relationship, life is throwing the same lessons until I learn to prioritise myself and know my self worth. Even after a year of what I thought I was doing, which was working on myself. I repeated the same mistakes, blurred my boundaries, gave in too quickly, trusted easily. 

Words are so effortless, promises are broken, I am afriad I'll go back into my shell. How much ever I try, I end up having to start all over again. Although with help from therapy and awareness of my weakness, I am able to handle it better, for now. 

Is it me? I constantly ask others, just checking if I've missed anything, or am I the one over thinking. It's difficult to know, because I completely lost faith in my instincts. 

If people who come are constantly going to test how far they can push you, how much they can get away with bad behaviour, and my reaction is valid, then why is the pain unfair. Why do I have to suffer more? 

It's so difficult to keep on picking myself up, it takes days months or even years to get over. How is that fair? I feel I'm gaslighting myself by not giving up, trying again and again. Are the lies I tell myself worse than the actual ways I've been treated? I do not know. 

I've reached a point where I feel it's better if I don't say anything, don't go out anywhere, don't meet anyone, don't do anything. The moment I move, I'm going to get hurt. 

Trust me I tried this time, and I'm sure I'll try again sometime. I'm good at being hopeful and optimistic, thinking if i only work on myself a bit more, and follow all these rules .. I'll have people that care for me and I get to care for them too.

127,1am wake up thoughts,"F 25. Just woke up and I have been uncontrollably crying. I was diagnosed with BPD around a year ago and have been in therapy since. Various shitty things in life have happened to me, but my first trauma came from my dad (shock!) when he abandoned myself (8 at the time) my older sister and mum for a 21 year old woman. This absolutely broke my mum, she was severely depressed and from this age until I was 15/16 I was always scared she might end her life. My sister became rebellious due to trauma, but I went the other way and hid everything else going on in my life to try and protect my mum from feeling guilty as I don‚Äôt blame her at all and she did her best. The issue is that this trauma response of hiding things that I‚Äôm going through has made further issues with things that have happened to me e.g. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone when I was being bullied at school because I didn‚Äôt want them to worry, I didn‚Äôt tell them I was self harming at 13 etc and it was never noticed, being groomed online, covered up that my partner was abusing me for 5 years. My mum says to me that she thinks I have BPD due to my abusive relationship. I wish I could tell her everything else but I worry she would blame herself, when the person I blame is my dad for leaving us and not giving a shit, to then have another child and he is a good dad to him. Why did I never get that ? Since then I have had a strained relationship with my dad. We currently speak only about once a month though. When I was in my abusive relationship (ages 18 to 23) my dad cut me off unless I ended it and this also created a lot of trauma for me. I‚Äôm now in a situation where I feel that maybe I should say something to them. Or just my dad. Or I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to keep carrying this pain alone. I just want my dad to be sorry and take responsibility for the trauma he gave me. Not sure if even attempting to see if he will do this will just give me more issues.

It was and will always be one of the most incredible and special things I've ever gotten to experience. Going from being her friend, to being her close friend then her best and eventually her partner, is the greatest thing that could have happened to me. I was diagnosed a month ago, and although it's been great to finally have a diagnosis it's become very apparent to me that old habits are hard to break.

After months of completely random outbursts that came out of no where and disappeared almost as quickly as it came, change in daily patterns and moods and general lack of communication in the relationship and motivation in life; my girlfriend has asked to take a step back from the relationship. She's such a good person to me, she's always been so patient, gentle and just generally supportive of me in everything I do. When she called me today to ask for a break I didn't break down, or panic, I let myself just feel how much it hurt to push another person in my life away. I've decided I can't ever let someone go because of that again. Especially not my girlfriend.

I need advice on how to break out of destructive loops. I need to learn how to stop allowing my mood to be taken care of by other people and become self sufficient, so that the day I get to be with her again I can make her feel the love I used to make her feel.

In a nutshell, my fianc√©e and I ended things little less than a month ago. My BPD took over and I became a person neither of us could continue to love.

I wish more than anything we could be friends and be in each others lives but I unfortunately broke the trust I was granted and I can‚Äôt do that anymore.

137,The ole breakup dance,"Soooo I‚Äôm here because my partner and I have broken up. He has commitment issues, depression, and anxiety. I just recently was diagnosed with bpd. We care about each other a lot but trigger each other OFTEN. Usually when he will mention some vague future plan and doesn‚Äôt include me in it then I‚Äôll get a fear of abandonment and spiral out which then makes him recoil from my clinginess. OR there was a time when he DID try fully committing but then I was suspicious of him/didn‚Äôt believe him. We‚Äôve been doing this dance for about 4 years now and have gone to couples therapy before I learned of my bpd symptoms. 

As a solution to all this he wants us to be broken up, for me to accept that, but for us to continue being intimate, and living together and working on our mental health but as ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù. I‚Äôve run this past a close friend who doesn‚Äôt have BPD and is aware of the black/white thinking that goes with bpd and he reckons this is still waaaay too hard accept even without bpd.

I made him leave about three months ago because his BPD episodes were out of control. Tons of people on this forum told me to let him go after I explained the things he was doing to me and my son. I told him he could come home when he saught help. We continued to see each other and I thought stayed faithful to each other.... He was with me oftern and constantly telling me how much he loves me, wants to come home, wants to get married. Actually still completely psychotic over me. Seriously psychotic. stalked me, followed me, blew my phone up day and night. Love bombed me like crazy one minute, split on me the next.... and then a friend posted a pic of him with another woman and he knew i seen it. He went crazy and started sayig hed kill himself if i didn't come back to him, threatened me that hed start doing meth and he was going to get high if i didn't come back, said hed go to inpatient therapy. but still denying being with this woman more than once. I contacted her and her sister and they told me he had been sleeping with her for 2 months and that they stayed together all the time and she thought she was his gf.... We obviously all blasted him with the knews we all knew what was going on. He went crazy insulting her, begging for me back. I didnt go back to him. I messaged her all the horrible things he was saying about her, the two months of text, messages, pictures, of us together, literally there are hundreds.

139,Major misunderstanding with therapist,"I am not really sure if this is the correct thread and hope this post make sense. F 28 and previously i reached out to my therapist when i had a breakdown and on the weekend. My therapist doesn't work on weekends.. If it is not an ""true emergency ""    then i can not reach out. I learned this the hard way and set clear boundaries since then. It is very hard for me with my  mental health diagnosis . 

Yesterday we had a phone session and my therapist had plans to go away for the holiday's. Last night i was writing my notes/list for my future therapy apts. It was very late at night and i unfortunately sent them to her. It was an honest mistake. The words of the  email ilude to the ideal of hurting onself. I can see how the email came off that way . I had no intention of feeling this way and i had no idea i even sent that email to her. I woke up to emails, text and missed calls from my therapist.  I called her immediately as i woke up and  i said im okay and I kept apologizing.  She was going away on her trip today so she hung up quickly after i said i was okay and it was not meant for her. I feel so bad and i know that my therapist will probably have a huge talk with me when we meet in the new year. She then sent me another email tonight with  crisis information and stated that if it not a ""true emergency ""to cal that crisis info. She obviously had to send that email to back herself up which is totally understandable.  

The email she sent ""  I
will have my phone available for true emergencies only so that I can have my own self-care to be a great therapist for my clients when I return.¬†""

 I am at fault and should be more careful next time. I guess i will just write my notes not on emails.... that was my stupidy.

140,i made this free card deck to help me manage my BPD,"hi y'all. i've used the DBT Skills card deck in the past, and found it really useful. I wanted to make something that brought together my favorite elements of DBT (emotion regulation and distress tolerance), plus what i've learned from buddhism.

so i made [this free, printable card deck that i'm calling the Mastery Deck.](https://bit.ly/3HjpwsM) 

it's a combination of Mood, Mindset, and Mantra shifts. 

* The Mood cards are mostly a combination of emotion regulation and distress tolerance tips from dialectical behavioral therapy.
* The Mindset cards are ways to shift your perspective and shore up your sense of self.  
* The Mantra cards are mainly quotes, including several from the wonderful Thich Nhat Hanh.

the deck is meant to be used in any way that serves you: by picking one card daily, or just when you need it, or by shuffling until something resonates.

I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago and I didn‚Äôt even know what it was until I got the diagnosis and it does make a lot of sense. Ive been in therapy a lot and gotten psychiatric care as well. 

I‚Äôve always been a pretty messy person. Not in a disgusting way or unsanitary but recently it‚Äôs gotten bad. I had kept my studio somewhat decent until my now ex girlfriend and I broke up two weeks ago and I‚Äôve spiraled ever since. With the holidays, my mental health goes in the trash and my apartment was starting to get messy but I just let it build because I couldn‚Äôt muster up the energy to clean it. I worked and if I wasn‚Äôt working, I was sleeping or binge drinking. Now, I have fruit flies all over the place and it was kind of my wake up call to start cleaning. I have dominos boxes everywhere, McDonald‚Äôs bags, clothes and I haven‚Äôt done dishes in over two months. Random trash and there‚Äôs barely places to walk. I know it‚Äôs disgusting and I really want to change things for myself. I know the task is going to be daunting and I have no idea where to start. Even doing dishes takes me awhile because my sink doesn‚Äôt have a disposal and I don‚Äôt have a dishwasher. So I guess I‚Äôm looking for tips on how to get all this done. 

How do I get rid of fruit flies besides obviously throwing away everything attracting them? Do they go away on their own, are traps enough after the house is clean, or do I need a professional? What‚Äôs a good way to build a healthy habit of actually keeping the place clean? It‚Äôs so bad that I don‚Äôt even have people over because of how embarrassed I am. I think the fruit flies have probably been here for two weeks and I‚Äôve been drinking to get through the days and haven‚Äôt paid much attention to them, but I‚Äôve been getting sober and more aware of the state I‚Äôm living in and desperate to change things.

148,i might be in love with my best friend/fp,"i am someone who has quiet bpd, and i have also been through years of intense therapy, which has helped me learn a lot of ways to control/redirect certain thought processes and other things that help me to function semi-normally w bpd. i have also learned to become very good at maintaining healthy relationships/attachments and recognizing when an attachment becomes unhealthy. however, my best friend of like 8 years is definitely 100% my fp. i feel bad because i also have 2 boyfriends (i'm poly and open), but i just cannot get her out of my fucking head. it's not even like i know this is an infatuation, this has been a constant for so long i don't even know, it has to have been over a year at this point. she is constantly occupying my thoughts, i even fucking draw her constantly in my notes when i'm in lectures.

it definitely doesn't help either that whenever i go over her house, we always end up cuddling and/or making out for HOURS. we both find each other to be really attractive, and i don't know how she feels about me (romantically) but i feel nauseous whenever i'm around her because of how intense my feelings are for her. i love her so much, it literally is killing me to keep this inside, i haven't told anyone because i don't feel like it would do any good and it would probably also just bring me a lot of unwanted attention from friends about this. it just kills me that i have no fucking clue how to tell her how i feel without destroying our friendship. i want her in my life forever, whether or not we're just friends or something more (which i highly doubt). 

it also just feels so wrong feeling this way. i know it's a bad attachment but i don't try to feed into it and i manage it in a way where our relationship is healthy. i do not completely rely on her as a source of comfort, but when i'm looking to get away from the worries of stressing about college and the mcat and other shit, going to her house and chilling with her for the day is better than therapy. her presence is so calming and comforting to me, sometimes we just sit together with a show in the background and do our own thing for hours, and i love it. i love her company, i just hate that my brain is fucking obsessed with her because again, it just feels wrong. like that's my best friend. i shouldn't be having thoughts like this about her. and not to mention the insane jealousy that i have to grit my teeth and smile through whenever she talks about how hot our other friends are, or how she wants to date xyz person. i wish i didn't feel like this, i've been doing my absolute best to make sure that this has never developed into an unhealthy situation that would hurt her because i love her so much. i know the easiest solution to this is to just talk to her, and logically knowing her i'm sure she wouldn't be extremely weirded out by it and we could have a normal conversation about it, but i feel absolutely terrified of ever bringing it up because i don't want her to abandon me. i (irrationally) feel like she would get so disgusted and freaked out that she would just leave me. 

right now i've been spiraling because i was out with her yesterday and being high out of my mind (it was pride in my city so ofc i was fucked up), i smoked a cigarette in front of her, which is a BIG nono when it comes to her. she hates cigarettes, and has a personal history with cigarette addiction and it made her really upset, and after i dropped her off at home i wanted to scream and cry because of the way i had hurt her. it made me feel like the biggest piece of shit on the planet. i hated seeing how sad she was when i was driving her home in my passenger seat. i never want to make my best friend feel like that. i'm so scared i'm just making her hate me more and more and she's just going to end up cutting me off one day and never talking to me again.

When I was a teenager I did not have a diagnosis. But I realized that with the way my emotions went very intense and also my affection to other people shifted quickly, I would have to be careful entering relationships. I was convinced that relationships are not possible for me.
I never dated, then I had a relationship that went on for 4 years and the guy was treating me shit.
I tried dating a little bit, it all went so wrong so quick.
I know that I have behavioural structures set up that pretend me from having intimate connection to other people. and I know that I can work for that, I am in therapy.
but one thing I am completely sure about is that I will never stop feeling alone. it's a feeling so familiar, it's so normal, it's always there. I lay in my bed and think about the things I would love to talk to someone about when I can not sleep. 
Do you have someone in your life, who you can call at 3 in the morning just to talk? somehow everyone wants to solve my problems or they want me to write stuff down or they tell me to skill without even knowing what that is. And all that is fine and well. but I need to talk to someone and really feel like there's a human there or I am going insane. like.. more insane than I literally am but.. that's a cowardly joke.

so the crisis support hotline in my city has become something like my bestie. just that they obviously aren't. they are there when I need someone to look out for me when I'm suicidal. But friends - of course not.

Friends on the other hand are always on the periphery. I have very lovely friends. but I think that the thing that I am looking for in a friendship is what other people are looking for in relationships. but I am ace and that's another thing that gives me very little self esteem dating.

I have had BPD sine 14 my husband of 5 Years knows this and has been great during that time. I pretty much have it under control for the most part (therapy and meds) But my anxiety has been rising since corona started, so I went back to the doctor to get myself figured out before it gets out of hand. 

&#x200B;

We have been having difficult conversations about our relationship lately I think he is depressed but don't want to push him to do anything. Either way yesterday he hit me with this question: 

&#x200B;

How do you tell someone you love that you might not love them? How do you know that ""the one"" is not out there or how do you know if you already found that person? 

&#x200B;

We evaluate our Relationship on a regular basis as I consider this healthy (More for my benefit to make sure its me and not the BPD that is controlling anything) But this has sent me reeling. We were planning on starting a family next year and I now wake up feeling horrible every morning. I feel better once the day progresses and I go through the Mantra of You are good enough, you are not an inconvenience etc. 

&#x200B;

Is it time for me to have a harder look at this relationship? It really hurts when he says things like that but I sometimes don""t trust my judgement about it. I felt hurt and angry after that statement yesterday... today I am mostly numb... 

&#x200B;

I dont even know what I want out of this message advice, perspective? Anyone going though anything similar? 

 As a side note when we met he was super duper in a depressive episode and I literally had to drag his ass into my psychiatrist office. This helped him back in the day with therapy and meds but I think it might be coming back? or am I just wishing for it to me a different reason than he not loving me?

156,Afraid of conflicts with my bf,"Ive (23) been dating my bf (27) for 2 and a half years now. We have a rather good communication and love to sit and talk for hours about the big life questions ect. But we do have some rough fights once in a while which puts us both on an edge in our relationship. I started grouptherapy twice a week in december, but due to the coronavirus i havent been in therapy for over a month. Whenever i was in therapy i used alot of energy to push myself a bit to talk more about my feelings. I have a hard time letting myself feel all the negative feelings at all. This combined with my fear of conflicts is a bad cocktail. It results in this: Whenever my bf brings up topics about our relationships with just a tini tiny negative tone in his voice (which i never do, i keep it all to myself and cant bring myself to just tell him, when something is bothering me) i start crying and brings up all the things I have been holding back. He starts yelling at me, because thats is actually the only way i really listen to all he says, i cry some more, he gets angry and the only Thing, that in the end really makes me listen to what he says, is if he threatens to leave me. Its hard for us both. He doesnt want to say, he'll leave be if things doesnt change. He loves be and wants to stay with me and fight for US.
So here is my bfs theory:
He thinks that the reason i start i crying whenever he brings up the tough topics, is, that i subconsiously tries to make him feel sorry for me. That me crying is some tool for me to make him drop it. And maybe he is right. Im not sure. I just know, that this is making our relationship rocky af.

But for context: when she's asleep, or we don't talk much I feel myself slipping. I feel empty. All I can do is wait for her to talk to. It's been like this for over a year. I've completely gone dependent on it and I know that. I don't remember how to be alone with just myself anymore. I get anxious, I get more depressed, I feel guilty for feeling clingy. I'm also not in therapy right now cause my therapist retired and the only one they had to offer me was a middle aged man... and I have trauma with men, so I couldn't do it. 

This is kind of a vent and asking for help? Are there any online resources for those with BPD and being alone? DBT tricks to how to cope or distract ourselves during these times? I feel like I've forgotten every vital skill beyond not self harming because I haven't done that in quite some time but... I also have a form of bipolar too (I can't recall which one) but I'm in that area where I'm completely depressed and passively suicidal on my best days and I am... actually kinda scared for myself when this has to happen next month.

159,Distraught ,"I texted my ex a few days ago and  sometime he replies, but not always. So today I said sorry and he said it all good no worries. I asked him if he still had his dog and Dog and about dating. Apparently he seeing someone for  a week or so  /hanging out . I guess "" week or so"" refer to a few weeks in my book. He said it nothing personal among other words. When I asked him 
We dated for 3 yrs and I broke it off to work on myself. It not even a year yet and my mom said I need to b over someone who hasn't talked to or thought about me for a year and just told me that he dating to get rid of me. Whatever that means  The issues that bothered me all have a solution now except the phone addiction.  I never had my life together outside of dating anyone. Everyone says I can do better and deserve better and how he didn't pay etc . I know I will prob find someone else one day . When we first broke up he said time will only tell and would consider getting back together one day and he would reach out when ready if he ever was. He never did. But of our first serious relationship.  . I know I should not want him but I do and I know I will find somone else I feel closer to . It was so easy with him and it was both of our first serious relationship.  I mean I didn't get along with his fam but I not dating them. His bday is next mths which make it a year so I won't b wishing him hbd. It crazy bc a month ago or so we were gonna face time so I could get closure and non tentivly brought up the idea of taking him out to eat for his bday. I am genuinely happy he will prob date this girl for his bday and no long worried of him being alone which he never put himself out there by me... I. Inuated it . My sister and my mom says I need to move on etc but r  mean about it . so here I am venting to reddit until my next therapy apt. I will prob date again too but not now. Now I feel ready to glow up revenge and I didn't think anyone else would find him attractive etc like I do . I am partly proud of him for putting himself first. Just crazy in a week they already hang out.  I now I have to let him be permanent and I am sure I will see photos on socials from his mom post... i keep roominatimg like what she look like and how now he will probably pay for her bc he making more money and how she in his new house and wearing his clothes n sleeping my side of bed . I was with him when he got thr house n signed the papers. He moved in and got thr place ,but according to my fam didn't consider me when moving.  It notnlike we have plans to move in.my therapist says I glamorize and forget thr bad. I feel like I been delusional all yr. Idk obvi no one is waiting around but I feel like the time I get my life together it will b to late for him. I just sent him one last text R u happy with her/happier ? That all that matters to me in thr end . No reply yet. I  still have his number and most recent pics and some ideas still in a box but got rid of a lot this yr. I remember his number which is annoying n I don't block. It weird he only reach out to wish me hbd last yr.

160,Repulsed by sex after breakup,"Hello, recently diagnosed with BPD in the last couple of months, but realize that I've certainly had it my whole life. It explains so much of how I react to things, why I fixate and ruminate, terrible self esteem and self image, etc. 

Anyways, I went through a breakup two months ago, and now almost anything sexual repulses me or triggers me into thinking about my ex and thoughts of him having sex with someone else. When I think about him being intimate with someone else, my face gets flushed, I go into a panic, and have terrible, intrusive thoughts about how I'm a loser, ugly, disgusting, etc. When I'm in a good place, I'm very sexually liberated and love to be sexual with my partner. However, this breakup really fucked me up and he also gave me an STI, which has left me feeling so undesirable. 

I want this sensation and feeling to be over, I want to move on so badly. My brain knows that I am indeed desirable and that this diagnosis (BPD and STI) are not necessarily going to hold me back from finding love, but the BPD part of my brain loves taking control and trying to convince me everything is pointless, worthless, and that I am indeed a piece of shit. Anyone else deal with this? Any recommendations to get over this or to work through it? Any mindfulness tricks? I know time will eventually heal it, but hoping for any other coping mechanism. And yes, I am in therapy. I will bring this up for our next session.",1653704713.0,False,20,1,liztonicedtea,None,uzdr2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/uzdr2u/repulsed_by_sex_after_breakup/
161,So Stuck RN,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. I‚Äôve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Soooo‚Ä¶..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and I‚Äôm therapy and have a psych and I‚Äôm still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. It‚Äôs like the spark or fire went out. I can‚Äôt seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now it‚Äôs been downgraded to better help. He‚Äôs upset he‚Äôs not getting a return on investment bc I haven‚Äôt been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

I‚Äôve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what I‚Äôm doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and she‚Äôs a flight attendant with her own Truman‚Äôs manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where I‚Äôm modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this month‚Ä¶nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations end‚Ä¶..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesn‚Äôt really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so there‚Äôs a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and I‚Äôve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. It‚Äôs so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I don‚Äôt feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc it‚Äôs actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my family‚Äôs needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I don‚Äôt have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and won‚Äôt do social things. And I‚Äôm so dysregulated rn that I couldn‚Äôt imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I don‚Äôt know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I don‚Äôt matter, I don‚Äôt want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in family‚Äôs house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. It‚Äôs exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. I‚Äôm pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. I‚Äôve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I don‚Äôt feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

I‚Äôm getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits I‚Äôm not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I don‚Äôt know where to start or what to do first. I assume it‚Äôs one little thing to the next. I just don‚Äôt know how to do it when i genuinely don‚Äôt want to be here and don‚Äôt care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, I‚Äôd really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesn‚Äôt have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine.

162,I am on the verge of giving up on life and i need help.,"I (24 female) have been diagnosed with bpd 2 years ago. I‚Äôve gone through lots of therapy and lots of medications but it feels like no matter how hard i try i always go back to my older self the minute i am triggered. I feel stressed and tired of life and i feel so alone. I work a full time job while attending university (studying engineering) at the same time and its been so hard on me. I am all alone in life which means i had to work and figure things on my own since i was 16 years old and i am so exhausted. I am trying to do better and be a better person, friend and partner but its like i am the most despicable person to them so i don‚Äôt blame anyone for abandoning me but it‚Äôs so hard one me cuz i am trying and i don‚Äôt want to be that person but i cant. 

It feels like I‚Äôve hit rock bottom and my life is a mess. I am on academic probation due to my declining gpa and grades even though i am trying my best i am attending every class doing everything on time studying well before every exam but i seem to be doing something wrong cuz my grades don‚Äôt reflect that. My job isn‚Äôt going that well it‚Äôs so stressful and triggering and i am overworking myself cuz I can‚Äôt lose it or i will be homeless with my university tuition, rent, bills etc‚Ä¶., My house is a total mess its disgusting  i am so embarrassed to show it to anyone its the worse it has ever got though i live in a tiny space. 

My relationship with my partner isn‚Äôt going that well and i am mainly the reason why. He supported me more than anyone in my life and been there for me through everything but when it comes to mental illnesses he doesn‚Äôt really understand what i am going through and keeps trying to encourage me in the wrong way with things that work for normal people or for him not for someone who is suffering from crippling anxiety and depression as well as bpd. Though he is trying to change his views.

And i need help cuz i can‚Äôt do this anymore and i want to give up i see no hope for future the harder i try the worse it gets and though i love my partner more than life and is the i only person in my life, he is better off without me i hurt him so much that I can‚Äôt even forgive myself anymore though he worked through it all with me. I cant do this life anymore i have nothing to look forward to and honestly don‚Äôt want anything. 

Also, I struggled with self harm, alcoholism, and drug abuse but i worked through all that but these days the only thing on my mind is to just get black out drunk though I‚Äôve been sober for a year. And its so hard to battle my urges. 

If you have any advices or experiences please share with me cuz it feels like i get a virtual hug when i talk to people who understand things and going through the same things i am going through.",1699861215.0,False,4,1,Informal-Loan3063,None,17u5m67,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17u5m67/i_am_on_the_verge_of_giving_up_on_life_and_i_need/

Me and m were friends since we were 7 years old. He was my best friend my everything. We got together when we were 18,19 things fell off after covid and I didn't know how to actually break it off bc I had an Attachment to him, he was my favorite person for a while. So more content me and him both dealt with abuse in different way but we were there for each other almost everyday when we were in grade school. About a year and a half ago I fell off and started doing drugs bc I started realize maybe m wasn't the best person for me and that really hurt bc he was everything why wasn't this relationship everything to me anymore. I got distance, started hanging with the wrong crowd of ppl and I really hurt him. I Snorted drugs in front of him and would tell him to fuck off or to just leave if he didn't like it. It got to the point where I was just verbally abusive to him, I hated myself doing that to him. I then broke up with him but still would have sex with him bc I needed to get off, I knew he loved me still and wanted us to work but I didn't care, I only cared about myself. then about a year ago I started messing around with my current bf, we made it official, but when my current bf left out of town, I texted m and fucked him while my current bf was gone. My current bf still doesn't know this happened but I told m everything he was hurt and blocked me on everything. I can't blame him I hurt him so bad probably worse then anyone has ever hurt him before. I then didn't text him for about a year but we have a Mutual friend that I just saw this Thanksgiving and he brought up the fact that me and m were so amazing as friends, it made me remember how much I missed him, I texted his sister to tell her how sorry I was and that I wasn't in my right mind from the drugs and now that I'm clean I would like to try to be friends or at least Acquaintances. Long story short that's prob never going to happen. Which Is totally okay I completely understand but I can't stop thinking about all the horrible things I did, the years I lost with someone all bc I couldn't just tell him I couldn't be with him anymore. There is a lot more to the story but this is already long as fuck. If anyone has any suggestions to help me not hate myself as much that would help, I have gone to lots of therapy for this and I know I'm the asshole, I know I don't deserve his friendship again im just really beating myself up and I'm scared it might lead me hurting myself or others again.",1701208678.0,False,3,0,lilknikie3002,None,18681fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18681fd/having_issues_with_forgiving_myself/

I want to know what other parents who have BPD do when it comes to discipline. As I was growing up, I knew beatings and insults were not effective or fair ways to get better behavior. As my kids have grown, I have done my best; my mantra being to never have to go to therapy because of anything I did or failed to do. It works well for the most part.

But I have a lot of trouble knowing with actually what to do, especially as teens. My daughter is pretty high functioning but incredibly high strung. Even a slightly harsher tone guts her. And I'm always afraid to hurt them in any way.

166,trying to be a happy adult,"As a quick question, what do you guys do to cope with bpd or heal from traumas? Especially without a therapist or medication 

I actually had therapy and meds since I was 13/14 years old, till I was 20 last year I stopped using my parents insurance because I completely distanced myself from my family and honestly everyone all my friends from the past because they all just were shit to me. 

After I left rehab when I was 17, I still had my bpd symptoms but I experienced a weird like 2 years just not feeling real. I don't remember much of that but I just really dissociated all the time. 

I started having friends again, smoking more heavily, did risky things more than ever. I even tried almost not even wanting to think about the past, I wanted to reconnect with my family a bit. But pretty much every single of those people ended up really hurting me. There's so much that was happening. My life honestly felt like hell to me, and it hurt my soul that growing up I've always thought about how the hurt seems to only get worse and worse. And here I am wanting to just be okay, start living independently. But my family doesn't give a fuck to admit their mistakes, these friends are all fake, people think I'm weird. I still get anxiety at work hoping customers don't notice or say anything about my arms covered in scars. 

But I'm so tired of suffering from my past wounds I want to just get rid of but why does the pain stay? I know I'll have to struggle with my mental illness, and just try to maintain it.

It‚Äôs been about two years since I found out and confronted him, and as far as I know he hasn‚Äôt spoken to her, but... ever since, I‚Äôve held this deep, burning anger and resentment toward not only her but him (and his other exes, for that matter).

170,Venting," 

Im sitting here writing to myself again. Everything is falling apart. I feel weaker than ever. I feel like my mom hates me. She said that I am a shame to my father who abandoned me and that she has done nothing as a mother. I have never felt so much pain in my life. I sobbed like a toddler in front of her. Because she knows that I blame myself for my father leaving me. She knows how much I fear abandonment. So for her to confirm that even my abusive and alcoholic father would be ashamed of me hurt more than anything could ever. She said ‚Äúlook at you, I did nothing.‚ÄùShe feels like she failed as a mother and in result of that I am a failure of a daughter. We failed each other. after I told her how I felt and opened up to my struggles she didn‚Äôt respond to anything I said and only made an issue out of the fact that if anyone were to find out about what‚Äôs going on all the blame would be put onto her. While I opened up to her about my bpd diagnosis and how I feel on a daily basis she was only concerned about how it would make her look as a mother. She says every-time I have a breakdown its the same story and same excuses. Which is true because none of these issues have ever been truly addressed and worked on. I can sit here and provide reasons as to why but it would sound like excuses and manipulation so I give up. I failed and I am a shame just like my father to her. She says my father still controls me and its true. I just don‚Äôt know how to stop it. I want to get help but all outpatient treatment options have several week/month waitlists, and although I have signed up for them I feel like I don‚Äôt have that time. She wants change immediately. She wants me to go cold turkey and suddenly change my life around to happiness and butterflies. Because if other people can do it so can I. But I just don‚Äôt believe that. No matter how much I try I just cannot. 

She thinks that I purposely do things to disrespect her (smoking weed). I know that smoking weed is destructive, it is my addiction. She believes that addiction is a choice. She kept saying if I wanted to change I would. To her it is simple. She does not understand the complexity of my mind and the things it makes me do. She believes that I am purposely manipulative. She thinks I don‚Äôt want to put in any effort. She thinks I am choosing to be a victim but she doesn‚Äôt understand that trauma traps the person in a victim mindset. That a person with untreated trauma is constant living in the exact state of the time of trauma. They are stuck reliving the trauma if it is untreated. She doesn‚Äôt understand how it affects the brain. She doesn‚Äôt understand that not everyone is the same. That just because she was able to deal with all of her trauma (that was  much worse than mine) doesn‚Äôt mean that I can do the same. I am not the same as her, but she expects me to be. She doesn‚Äôt understand that my thought processes are corrupted and that in order for me to regain control of it I NEED therapy, I need to learn how to unlearn and rewire my brain to adopt healthy coping mechanisms and thought processes. She doesn‚Äôt believe that therapy can help you help yourself. She believes its all a business and that people use mental illness diagnosis as an excuse for their bad behaviour. She keeps telling me to help myself but I literally cannot do it on my own. She keeps telling me to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome. Dealing with my trauma alone will never work. I can accept that but she cannot. 

I am sick and she doesn‚Äôt understand that. Because she is angry at me and angry at herself. Angry at me because she thinks I don‚Äôt want to put in any effort and angry at herself for creating a child like me. 

I feel alone. And I feel like all of my negative thoughts about myself were confirmed by her. Because I don‚Äôt think that people understand to what degree people with BPD hate themselves. The self hate is debilitating and constant. Ever since I can remember I have absolutely hated everything about my being. And when you don‚Äôt care for yourself, you make decisions that reflect that. The self destruction I engage in is not intended to hurt others it is only intended to hurt myself, because I feel worthy of hurt and pain. When I am in these long periods of numbness it is true I lose my sense of empathy. All sense of any emotion. And it causes me to hurt her. Because I am unable to even consider her feelings. I am sick and I hate it. I hate what I do.

I understand her anger because it is the same way I feel about myself. I just wish she could understand me. I wish we could break the wall in-between us.

172,Anyone else here polyamorous?,"My partner and I are both polyam, and have always had an open relationship. We've been together for over a year now, and neither of us have actually persued other relationships seriously. 

Well, theyve been reconnecting with an ex as of late, and I've spiralled down in behavior. Ive become irrational and irritable, and I've been filled to the brim with anxiety about being replaced by this ex. I mean, the kid just redyed his hair in a way I had it when my partner and i got together after things ended sourly between the two of them. That may be a silly thing to harp on but...it just feeds into that anxiety. 

Most of it stems from a previous situation where my partner was talking sexually with this guy, and I accidentally stumbled across that conversation. We've talked about it multiple times, and while i feel much better my hellbrain holds onto that memory and knowing my partner chose him over me before. 

I guess I just really want to control my jealousy again...im going back into therapy soon, ive been out for too long and at this point everything is too overwhelming to handle on my own.

This after several days of her being really nice to me. I just  got fixated and lost thinking about how to communicate on social media that I don't know if anyone even likes me....I feel like the only thing about me anymore is this illness and emotional dysfunction.
I  can mask through work but trying to do errands on my own or interact with people pleasantly is too much. I am actively and acutely aware of how much this is all my responsibility and my therapist, the divination I've been doing, my work, my ex.....everyone is like, this is on you, you have to have discipline and think positive. 
And yesterday she again told me I don't try and just feel sorry for myself. 
Maybe thats true. I wish I knew how to stop unraveling all the progress I make on a bad day and being so selfish. I know its the most important thing right now to take care of myself and manage triggers. I don't expect patience from anyone anymore it just really sucks to feel so pathetic and disgusting and empty at the drop of a hat and then if you believe that about yourself people will confirm it for you. Im not really sure what the alternative is to feeling sorry for myself bc beating myself up and being hard on myself doesn't work either. 

I am going to seek more extensive therapy but that also involves paperwork and multiple steps. So yeah this is a vent because life isn't that bad if I could just regulate my emotions and have some discipline. I'm exhausted from just surviving being myself. Its stupid.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He‚Äôs at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I‚Äôve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I‚Äôve become sober, and I‚Äôm trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I‚Äôve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it‚Äôs absolutely crippling. I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant now and I‚Äôm confused by everything, baby daddy isn‚Äôt involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am‚Ä¶.but I‚Äôm doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I‚Äôm bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn‚Äôt involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I‚Äôd he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me‚Ä¶.. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688445912.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q52w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/14q52w4/bpd_cptsd_bipolar_2/

178,I'm losing my mind and need guidance for the future,"This is my first post and I have a feeling it is going to be a long one. I also hope this is in the right place.

I am a high-functioning BPD sufferer. Only my close friends, brothers and Husband know that I have this condition. I have tried to speak with my Mum about this a few times but because it isn't depression (that she suffered with) and I can functionally live my life most of the time, she doesn't seem to fully take it on board. My Dad and Step-Mum don't understand in emotional disorders unless they can see it destroying your life, so again, not much help there. I have felt directionless for years, to give you an understanding see my more recent ideas for careers below:

Novelist (started 3 books, none completed)
Therapist (but who should really be taking advice from me?)
Baker ( I can make some amazing cakes and bakes, but in the UK if you bake from home then you have to have a kitchen that passes a health and safety check which won't happen whilst I am living in my Mum's house with 3 messy boys and when my Husband and I move out to a rented house I will still be stuck as a lot of tenency agreements state that you cannot conduct business from the house)
Working in recruitment ( Until I realised that it is sales and I hate sales)
Administration (I've worked in it before but I just get bored. Not enough variety and a lot of phone work.)

Recently I seem to be on a downward spiral and it is taking me for a spin. I have tried to get myself out but in recent years my lows have become more destructive and frequent than my highs. I am 26 years old and I have no clue what I am doing with my life. I have had so many career ideas that I don't know which are really ideas that I like and which are ideas that are a direct result or my manic episodes. I can feel my life slipping away and I feel like I am still going to be doing this well into my 30's and still have no direction.

Recently I decided that I would go back to university and study for my Masters in Human Resource Management with full CIPD training. Some of my friends work in this area and have told me I will be really good at it. I was accepted on to the course on Friday and I started to plan my next year holding down a part-time job whilst studying. My mum wasn't over the moon happy like I thought she would be (more dismissive but she did seem to think it was a good idea because it actually had career prospects) For the first few days it seemed like I was finally going to have some direction in my life but on Monday I went with my friend to an Emotional Therapy session and i left feeling confused and back at square one with my decision. During the session we had to think about decisions that we had recently made and rate our feelings of worry, anxiety etc about them. I spoke with my friend about my masters and she said she was happy for me and asked if I was happy but I wasn't. I wanted to want the Masters, I wanted to finally have a direction and a job that my Mum would be proud of but it would mean being in an office again and I don't deal very well with office environments because they are too rigid.

My friend and I have discussed, in the past, the possibility of me learning some Holistic Therapy treatments and going into business with her. I am a big believer in Holistic Therapy as it has helped me ground myself in the past and it pushed me through some very difficult times. I want to learn to give people the same comfort that I get from it, but it's not a stable income. 

When I was 13 my Mum went through a horrible divorce, depression and alcohol dependency. I was the eldest and the only girl so I had to look after her and my 3 brothers. She would tell me horror stories about the men she had been with and how they screwed her over. She would tell me that I would have to learn to look after myself because if I didn't I would be in the same position as her one day, no money and 5 mouths to feed. That time was really hard for me and I think it is my anchor point for all my messed up emotions now. 

When I met my Husband 11 years ago I found it hard to let him in. Maybe it was my severe abandonment issues, maybe it was my Mother's voice screaming in my head that he would be the same as any other man. It took a good 4 years before I started to tell him everything without the voices in my head telling me that if I told him all of my problem he would turn tail and run. He has been there through it all with me including my BPD diagnosis and trying to help keep my emotions in check. It also means that he has created his own coping mechanisms, for which I don't blame him. In this instance, instead of guiding me to the best idea he will tell me that he trusts my judgement and will support me in any decision I make. It's amazing that he says this but I need a more constructive answer. What can I expect from him after jumping from Idea to Idea and career to career for our whole relationship.

When I think about the future I never have a clear idea of the way forward and it normally brings on an anxiety attack so I try not to think about it. My brain throws up so many possibilities and I want to try them all but I know that I can't. I don't know which decision is right and I am so scared of making the wrong one that I don't seem to ever make a decision

Long story short though is I am stuck. Should I do my Masters and give in to my Mother's words of warning regarding men and stick myself back in an office job? Or should I go with the Holistic Therapy, something I am passionate about but doesn't have a stable income which could lead to future anxiety or downward spirals? Should I go with neither and sit here directionless again? I have had to take a sick day today because my brain is fried thinking about this and I am only 2 weeks into my new part time job. (Not a good start)

My Husband is always going on about how Reddit is the best place to post something like this and I know he's right so let me have it community because right now I am chasing my tail. Thank you so much for reading my post which is probably badly written and not correctly formatted,apologies for that. 

TL;DR - I am having a very hard time choosing a direction for my life (probably due to my BPD) and would like guidance and feed back from others.

179,I just realized how my maniac episodes are nowadays when I thought i didn't have any for a long time,"I've been diagnosed with BPD about 5 years ago and tbh the medication, therapy and working my self-control issues helped me get a lot better, but today I realized that every time I start talking about stupid or crazy things that I am aware that I am not going to do, but I portrait them to the people around me as if they were an actual possibility (like today when I was telling my brother how I could form a cult without a problem at 25) is that I am actually having a manic episode (like I went on and on for like 3 hours straight of how I would be able to form a fucking cult/my own nation, yeah super delulu ik) and on one hand I am afraid to tell my psychiatrist and worry him, making him medicate me even more (or worse, lock me) but on the other hand I'm relieved to know that my BPD manifests my manic episodes in this way instead of in a violent or really self-destructive way, I mean I know it's not right but it's better that it just me bluffing about doing crazy shit while being 100% aware that I'm not talking seriously than actually believing that as a reality or having any kind of reaction that hurts people or myself in any way. Although, what satisfies my ""craving for chaos"" is making people think that I am dead serious, I am aware that it is actually a joke, but it amuses me to see the reaction of the others. Is it wrong? Should I talk to my psychiatrist, even if I'm afraid of the consequences this may cause? If I'm not doing real harm to anyone, maybe there's no need to talk about it. Like, on one side I want to tell people that I don't really think like that and that it's just my way of coping so they don't worry but that would take away the whole point of it/ what's satisfying this internal urgency that I have and in the other side, perhaps by not having this coping mechanism I may develop another one that is really harmful/problematic/self-destructive. But at the same time I don't want them to worry but that reaction is what makes this coping mechanism work and cover whatever it has to cover, so that it fulfills its function. 

Like i want to talk about it with someone but I'm afraid that this will change the way they perceive me (in case it's a friend)/ it will no longer generate that reaction that ""entertains"" my need for chaos (in case it's my brother or family)/ leads me to have a more severe diagnosis or one that generates consequences when trying to fix something that, in the end, doesn't harm anyone (if I tell my psychiatrist) or generates a new coping mechanism that does lead me to do something bad to satisfy my need for ""adrenaline"" (in case my psychiatrist cures this one somehow).

I don't like ""living in peace"", I don't know how to do it, it bores me, and for now this is the healthiest way I can maintain a normal life and not do something stupid just to feel some rush.

Should I keep it to myself or talk about it with someone? For now, the person who I feel that could understand it better, give me an objective opinion and not judge me, would be my psychiatrist, BUT he is also the one who could generate the worst ""consequences"" for me In case he finds out, also, I was the only patient he actually enjoyed talking to and just had some issues but wasn't really crazy. I think this would really change that and if I tell him our sessions won't be like ""opening up to a friend"" anymore and it might become like any other medical appointment, which I don't want to bc i felt really safe talking to him and we made a lot of progress this way...

she made the entire call feel really invalidating. sure, i could have done better but it was just your basic beginning phone call, asking about her process and financial structure. does she expect to be talking to well adapted people all the time? this wasn't a job interview, I didn't realize how much I was going to be judged... I was a bit slow to answer questions and was unsure of some things, and she talked over me and had this very holier than thou attitude... eventually steering me away from her therapy.

I am not feeling appreciated enough and I don't think they're interested in me the same way as they were before. It's all very confusing to me. I've known them for almost a month. I think.

182,Relationship stuff... help.,"Hey Folks,

This is my first post here and I hope that I don't violate any rules of such with this post. 

So, I'm a gay guy (27) and have been with my partner (26) for nearly three years, which for one of us seems like a triumph, but I have a couple of nagging doubts which are ripping me up inside at the moment and I wanted to reach out for some help if I could. 

My beloved is a survivor of rape, so we've never been a couple which has had a lot of sex but in recent months it's been that he's been having more problems with disconnecting sex from our relationship. He says the more he starts to see us as a lifetime thing, the less he wants to have sex with me because he equates it with the trauma of being raped. 

Then, I agreed to an open relationship, again I know some of you are gonna shoot me down for this because of the BPD, but as I said, I agreed. The problems in my head now are that I cant get over the feeling of ""I love you, but I don't want to have sex with you and I want to have sex with other people"". It is killing me, because I'm trying to reassure myself that I can fuck whoever I want and that sex doesn't always mean intimacy but it's tearing me up to the point that I just want to leave. Half the time it's not even acknowledged that I find it hard to deal with, just that it's the status quo.

183,Potential break up shook everything up,"I really am going to try hard to summarise here because no one wants to read an absolute essay, but it's kinda hard to do so I'm sorry in advance.

I've been out of therapy for about a year now, and kinda thought I was getting on fine, still the regular anxiety issues but in terms of BPD,  kind of only really trigger based situations rather than it being a constant daily battle. But about a month or so ago when my partner of 7 yrs was literally in the process of breaking up with me it was like someone just opened the curtains and everything came flooding back. I honestly feel like I have not been awake for a long time. 

Long story short, we were able to talk some things out and I was showing some problematic behaviour that he never made me aware of, one example is that I just do not show much affection, I never have, but I guess for a while I've been cold. And I am now painfully aware I was this way, but he kind of let me get away with it, and I thought everything was fine. That's just one of the issues, but I've been working really hard to try and be more affectionate, both physically but also just saying I love you more often and things like that. 

It's kind of crazy because I thought I was managing my symptoms, but because I was never forced by him to put myself in a vulnerable position (not showing/giving affection means there's no potential for rejection), I stopped experiencing the symptoms. It turns out, I just found a really unhealthy coping strategy...now I'm in a position where it's like I'm trying a lot harder to keep the relationship, so now I feel so much more vulnerable and am seeing everything that he does or doesn't do or does or doesn't say as rejection. And it. Is. Tiring. 

He's been really stressed this week because of an audit at work, but I wanted to bring up to him that I notice the only time he says he loves me is when he's saying bye to me, so whilst I nearly got dumped for not being affectionate enough (one of many reasons), he's able to get away with only telling me he loves me when he's saying bye? Which to me, kinda sends the wrong message, and when we were working things out we both agreed we would make more of a conscious effort to say we love each other spontaneously or whatever. But because I know he's been stressed, I've kept it all inside and the audit finished on Thursday,  but I still haven't said anything. 
I know he's been so tired and overworked, so now he's asleep on the sofa downstairs. Even that has hurt me because when I went down I noticed he had got a blanket, so to me, that means he had no intention of coming to bed with me.  I know the longer I leave it I can turn back to being cold and resentful to protect myself, which just creates more problems. But I'm also SUPER scared to say anything, in case he actually just doesn't even love me anymore. 

For context, that is not just my BPD talking, but when we nearly separated he still said he has ""mixed feelings"", so it is entirely a possibility that he just doesn't want to be with me anymore, despite us saying we would work on some things.

184,"Help, I just had my worst episode in years + relapse","TW: SELF HARM

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm gonna try to keep this short: there was an incident with my boyfriend (who's in another country) which lead me to a massive breakdown during which I turned off my phone and went into full panic. I've suffered from Depressio, Anxiety  and Panic disorder on multiple ocassions in my life, although the last 3 years have been a lot better. This incident made me lose it.

I started biting into the pillow and wanting to die, having trouble to breathe and thought about self-harming (I used to cut but haven't in 2years7months) but stopped the thoughts. However, my body kept tightening and I ended up pinching, scratching and even punching myself really hard as a way to cope. I felt so scared but hopeless at the same time and now that I've come back I feel so scared of myself. I haven't been to therapy in a few weeks now and I think it's time to go back. 

Afterwards I spoke to my boyfriend again who thought I was ignoring him cause I didn't pick up any of his like 12 calls mid episode and I felt awful. He's said that he still loves me and wants to be with me but I am so scared he doesn't. I feel like he's finally going to break up with me now.

185,End marriage?,"TL;DR: I am trying to decide if I should end things with my husband, given his cheating and dishonest past, and I would like to know if my demands: **He needs to delete all ""friends"" he made from dating apps, and people he flirted with, and people he had a sexual relationship with, even if they do stay true friends now. Given he has never been honest with me, I demanded him to open up his phone to me fully so there is transparency and to make sure he is not having unprofessional interactions with other people** are reasonable to rebuild the relationship.

Hi Everyone, my husband and I are in a phase where we are deciding what to do with each other in life and would really appreciate some advice on this.

Some backgrounds on this:

We are an international couple, with very different views on dating. I come from a more traditional background and at my place, if we start a new relationship we are supposed to cut all contact with our EXes, or those who flirted or hooked up. My husband is American, and he makes friends on dating apps like tinder, where they would flirt and stay friends if they don't work out, he would also stay friends with the people he hooked up with. The thing that lead everyone downhill is the time I discovered him making a very sexual post on Reddit and made a Snapchat to sext, and ask to join a zoom room to do some nude video chatting. I proposed to divorce but he put his knee on the ground to beg me to stay.

I am the one with BPD and I cannot accept what he was doing even if he explains that he's professional with the people in the past, and he doesn't think he was cheating since the definition of cheating is to physically meet up for him. Since then my BPD got worse since I lost trust in him and become hyper-sensitive on who he is talking to. I stalked him and make shady comments when he talks to ""friends"" he made over dating apps, we fought bad, really bad, I grab knifes to threaten to take my life (end up having the police called on me multiple times, and restrainted in ER twice), and harmed him during the breakdown too. I know this is not correct and now in therapy i truely realize it is not ok to engage in unsafe situations whatever the reason is. I also realize I did a lot of harm to him physically and emotionally, and I do regret that.

In the end, he cheated multiple times, and would never tell the truth to me until I stalk him and find everything out myself. He said he felt so empty inside and lose himself gradually and he wanted an escape so bad that he cheated on me. He said he is no longer guilty of cheating, because of the harm I have done to him. Even before, when things were not escalated to this level, whenever we have a fight, he would turn to one of his ""friends"" and flirt with them, sext them. He even said, ""I find you cute, and if I were single I would be with you."" He said there is nothing wrong saying that, its just a compliment.

After therapy, I learned to stay calm and don't let BPD act instead of myself. I proposed to end things peacefully and I go back to my home country (which would mean we would probably never see each other again). My husband has issues with separating and wants to rebuild with me. But he is still dishonest with me when I ask him if he is interacting with other people sexually, he says he is not d**oing anything, but he would not reject filtering comments from ""friends"" and would sext them (all of this i have to find out by demanding him to show all his social media to me). He explains that he said he didn't do anything because he is not meeting up with these people (again, it's the idea that it's not cheating if is not physical). In fact, he still talks to the people he cheated on me with, even after multiple attempts of me demanding him to remove those people (which shows he only cares about himself).**

**I proposed 2 minimum conditions that I need for me to work with him towards a life together again:**

1. **He needs to delete all ""friends"" he made from dating apps, and people he flirted with, and people he had a sexual relationship with, even if they do stay true friends now.**
2. **Given he has never been honest with me, I demanded him to open up his phone to me fully so there is transparency and to make sure he is not having unprofessional interactions with other people**

**He said he would work with me but what I am doing is isolating him from his ""friends"" and invading his privacy, and refused to agree to these terms.**

**From where I am from, there are even linked accounts for couples, where we can access each other's social media, and if you are in a relationship, and you refuse to let the other person check the phone, then you must be hiding something, and you can absolutely have no contact with EXes and previous hookups (should block them).**

**At this point, there is no trust and honesty in this marriage, and I do want to end things, but he keeps holding on to me (but still talking with the ""friends"" and not rejecting flirty compliments).**

**I just need some input on this. I know this is very long, and I really appreciate if you read all this and leave some advice.**",1639086646.0,False,3,2,Ok_Captain784,None,rcs7y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/rcs7y9/end_marriage/
186,Just found out 2 days ago I have BPD,"I‚Äôm gonna rant and ramble so hold on to yer britches everyone! 

So‚Äî clearly I‚Äôve had BPD my whole life but as of 2 days ago I was finally able to acknowledge that this is what has been afflicting me. My mother has it, it‚Äôs been passed down, I get it. I‚Äôm going to therapy next week and I‚Äôm excited to get onto the path of recovery. I have a verrrry addictive personality and have dabbled in self harm terribleness. All this to say‚Äî I‚Äôm here reaching out to others with this same disorder because I‚Äôm going through a breakup right now. 

My partner and I are both not exactly the most stable of individuals and together it‚Äôs just like tossin gasoline on a fire. He and I have broken up and gotten back together often over the 4 year span of our relationship. The only difference is now he knows I have this disorder so he can leave me and feel justified in doing so which is a terrible feeling. Also every time he says he‚Äôs moving out it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs driving a knife into my heart (so nice I can say this stuff to y‚Äôall and ya get it that I‚Äôm not being dramatic i just legit feel like I‚Äôm dyyyying). 

Now that I‚Äôm aware of my disorder I‚Äôm trying my hardest to not manipulate him into staying with me. I bounce between despair and hope constantly. He says he‚Äôs considering leaving but also may not leave and he‚Äôs not sure yet. He barely talks to me, he won‚Äôt touch me and I feel like crap and super alone. 

I guess I‚Äôm just having a confusing ass time in my life at the moment and instead of explaining what BPD is for hours on end to ppl I thought I‚Äôd just see what nuggets of wisdom y‚Äôall can throw my way at this time.

187,Lost and looking for resources,"Hello. I'm not completely new to BPD. I found out about it when I was 16, and I've had people suggest that I have it since I was ~19. My parents had said I probably do not have it, and my therapists had not noticed it, though part of that could be due to my personality in front of other people which is different from my private personality. While I had been trying to cope with it for years and believe I am improving, I still have a lot of negative episodes where I just feel absolutely crushed. As I am 22 now, I am going to try to see a therapist specifically for BPD. I've been seeing far more resources on the net now than years ago, but most of what I've seen are people talking about learning to regulate emotions, seeing a therapist, getting group therapy, and getting DBT. Is there anything else you guys would suggest in terms of coping with it personally or looking for resources? I'm still inexperienced in looking for help regarding BPD and I would like to get some help based on your experiences.

188,"Abandonment, too scary and heart breaking","&#x200B;

kn I have been diagnosed with BPD since 3 years now. (I am 21). Abusive parents, abandonment issues, bullied at school, I have ADHD and OCD too. But as the fool I am, I thought someone will still stay with me. I don't think that is ever possible now. Last year, my parents told me how my sexual harrassment means nothing to them as it is not rape. I was shattered. Took an overdose of tranqs and cut myself. I never expected my parents to be nice, but I hoped they would be, and then this happened. That last bit of hope died inside of me. My then boyfriend didnt give 2 shits about it. I was depressed and asked him to just sit with me so I can study, he blatantly refused. He also abused me verbally. Told me he has to spoonfeed me and that I am nothing without him. He was my best friend for an year and then we dated for 1.75 years. He abandoned me when I needed him the most. I broke up with him. Additionally he was a nightmare for someone with OCD. And I decided not to date again as with all the issues I have, I didnt expect someone would stay.

&#x200B;

Then came my current bf, a completely different person. We fell in love. Things were going great. I moved to a different continent 1.5 months ago for an internship. I am here for 1.5 more. Things got bad. One day I was restless and irritated and tired and frustrated. He was trying to make some arrangements for us to watch something together on a video call. I was suggesting something else and he wouldnt listen. My anger got a hold of me and I started throwing stuff around. He got scared. We had conversations about it and he was not at all fine mentally by me throwing stuff angrily as he felt I would have thrown stuff at him too if we were together in person (there are reasons for his fear, it is not irrational) couple days later i split on him. And then i apologised. And he said the apology is sudden and he can't believe I am sorry. I tried convincing him it was legit and at one point i said ""i have bpd, i change"". next day he sent me articles on splitting. he said he  doesnt know how to handle this. (before all this he was pretty exhausted due to recurring fights between us) He said he doesnt  even  know if he *can,* handle this. Which i completely understand, it is not easy. i dont expect anyone to ever handle me. 

&#x200B;

Then things changed drastically. He has some serious issue at his home. He really cant focus on anything else right now He still texts me. He still asks about my therapy and how I am. But things between us are sensitive now and I dont see him coming back. I dont expect he will, i just wish, and hope, and want, and need him to come back. He is all i can think of. I believe I deserve this abandonment. I am damaged beyond repair and expecting someone will stay with me is far-fetched. No one will stay with me. I am hard to be with. And he is not coming back as he will be exhausted af.

&#x200B;

I have regular suicidal thoughts. I dont act on them tho, it is a discussion him and me had, and no one of us will act on those thoughts. But they are persistent. I get depressed randomly. I get stuck in ADHD Paralysis. I wish I had someone by my side. Atleast to talk to. I feel lonely and abandoned and stranded. I dont have a single clue as to what I should do next. I am waiting for the 1.5 months to pass and I can meet him. But i dont think he will come back to me, and I dont think I can face that situation.",1687404568.0,False,2,0,veeee2002,None,14fs4o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/14fs4o0/abandonment_too_scary_and_heart_breaking/
189,I'm in desperate need if anyone can honestly help I'd be extremely grateful. Unfortunately I can't find a therapist to help me even if my life depended on it here in Las Vegas.,"My psychiatrist is on leave until restrictions are lifted and that could happen who knows when. The last therapist that I seen on the 26th of last month stated ""I'm not even equipped to help you, just looking at you your suffering from severe PTSD, you also have an extreme amount of trauma from your past and to be honest I can look at you and know your going to be medicated from the rest of your life."" I'm desperately trying to seek help but unfortunately it seems to me no one here in Las Vegas is either equipped to help me or they just don't take patients with BPD because of it being so stigmatized or maybe they've dealt with horrible patients in the past I honestly don't know. I'm seriously here seeking help I don't want to be medicated for the rest of my life and I really don't want to feel like this anymore. To be truthful with you it's like I'm living in my own hell with nonstop flashbacks and I'm trying so hard to battle this mental illness on my own and I really don't know how long I can manage it. I'm in desperate need of help because at this rate I'm going to be living my worst fear....being alone....only with my deep, dark and empty thoughts of nothingness. If there is any help your willing to give, I'm willing to take it. I want to be functional, I want to fall in love and have a life one day before I die. All I know is I didn't case it or give myself this mental illness, It's unfortunately not curable but can be managed through alot of therapy, I honestly can't control it....but I am desperately trying very hard too and I'm just extremely exhausted mentally and physically at this point. I fully understand if you can't help or won't be able to help this thread is honestly my last hope so whatever help your willing to give I'll be extremely grateful for any numbers you give me to call if you have any.

Just calm down and think it through.""

But what if that's not enough? I'm doing the best I've ever done, and I'm still driving people away from me. I've been communicating well, taking my meds, doing therapy, exercising,  and yet even my closest friends can't really stand to be around me.

191,Am I a bad person?,"
I‚Äôm sorry if this post comes off as if I‚Äôm just putting my problems on all of you but really I just don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm actually really scared 

I feel as if I‚Äôm a bad person because of my mental illness, its like I can feel it getting worse and worse I‚Äôm very self aware of my thoughts and emotions but there so Intense.

Anger is like rage 
Sadness is like grief 
Joy is like being on cloud 9 

But all of that can just change in matters of seconds and it‚Äôs so scary, my gf the woman I know is the love of my life she‚Äôs so amazing and great she tries her best but why dose my heart and brain feel so betrayed and hurt like she‚Äôs gonna leave me or she‚Äôs cheating on me or just has the worst intentions ever I sometimes ask her if she‚Äôs gonna do these things and she says no with a very concerned tone. tbh I don‚Äôt know if I believe if she is or not she says she‚Äôs not and that she never will but‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt believe a word she says which isn‚Äôt good at all.


I‚Äôve been manipulated and assaulted by friends and family and the memories of that are tattooed on me (metaphorically)as a constant reminder that they happened, I‚Äôm always negative even when I try to be positive it‚Äôs like I can never see the light of things always the dark. I can tell how someone is by the way they act and there body language, my gf also has bipolar and OCD and I‚Äôm a big help In Comforting her and giving her solutions to her compulsions and rapid thoughts or if she just has a bad day.  

But when I need comfort she kinda just stares at me and doesn‚Äôt say anything and I get so angry at that like I just wish she can just help me and make the feelings and intense emotional thoughts just go away. But that‚Äôs not her job and Ik she doesn‚Äôt have the power to do that she once told me I was kinda negative and it affects her because she‚Äôs so positive and upbeat and I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm just realistic and I think that‚Äôs valid. lately I haven‚Äôt been telling her how I feel or what‚Äôs been happening, I have a bad struggle with eating I used to weight about 298 when I graduated high school in 2022 I lost 100 pounds since then but because I would starve myself constantly I never actually put any work into it. I weight 220 3 weeks ago now I weigh 198 today she‚Äôs been noticing how sick I look and how exhausted I am but I tell her not to worry but she always dose, I don‚Äôt deserve her before I met her I was a nobody that didn‚Äôt care about themselves or others but when I met her I was so motivated to go to therapy and finally try to fight and try, she‚Äôs so smart and she‚Äôs gonna do great things but I feel as if I‚Äôm getting the way of that. I read about BPD And saw peoples that had partners with it and the things they said about them and the things the person did. I don‚Äôt wanna be like that and I don‚Äôt want to treat her like that either I would rather die.

I‚Äôm sorry if most of this doesn‚Äôt make sense I have a very hard time putting how I feel into words especially if I have to type it out 

Sometimes at night I‚Äôll be in my room and just think about everything I‚Äôve been through or whatever my thoughts are telling me in that moment, I sometimes wanna say them out loud to people idk ig cause I hate the fact that I‚Äôm the only that knows about it and want some comfort and understanding that sounds terrible when I say out loud, it‚Äôs really lonely and sometimes madding. I‚Äôm not violent I‚Äôve never gotten into a fight or purposely wanted to hurt someone whenever me and my gf get into a fight I wanna talk about it and work it through, sometimes I slip up and am just a total asshole and my hypersexual tendencies make it so hard to just feel calm. sometimes she‚Äôs not in the mood and I just wanna touch or snuggle and she loves the attention from me but I can tell it can be too much and I just hate and feel so disgusted with myself I don‚Äôt wanna feel that and it‚Äôs made me hate sex and my body even more, I‚Äôm not In control and I wake up every morning into a panic attack it really hurts some mornings but ig take it day by day right.

192,Clingy/not being able to be alone or handle any kind of news well,"I blow up things in my head like most diagnosed with BPD. 
At this rate, I'll never have friends that at least won't be affected by my disorder. 
I have two friends, one I barely see because she's in the foster system and in regular school. The other I've grown most close to, talk to every day and spend almost every weekend together is a loner. She finally opened up and told me exactly what I've been worrying about, how my negative talk and behavior is affecting her. She no longer wants to talk all day or spend the night, it makes me really sad. Brings tears to my eyes.
She's my best friend and if she can't handle me; the strongest person I know, had been with me through hell and back for almost four years? I've never known a more real and trustworthy person and I don't trust easily. 

I'm just so fucking lonely, god, if I don't talk to someone constantly I feel crazy. I try to distract myself, believe me. I've tried painting, drawing, watching movies, talking in therapy and etc but this has been happening for years.

194,I'm thinking that motherhood is probably a bad idea,"I've pretty much always assumed/expected I'd have a husband and kids.  I would like to have that family with love and security and laughs and support.

However, after having had my diagnosis now for a year, I'm seriously wondering whether it wouldn't be better that I *don't* have kids.

I'm just about 33, very, very single, unemployed, poor, and still working this BPD thing out.  Realistically, it'll be about a year or so (maybe longer) before I complete further therapy, and a further while to get stuff like employment and housing (I currently rent a room in someone's flat) sorted out.  

If I was to find someone who would be able to handle my BPDness, just the nature of the disorder would make me very skeptical that they even were serious.  

I'm terrified that I would fuck my kids up, mentally.  Besides BPD, there are a few other genetic things that I seem to have inherited that I wouldn't want to pass on.  

Adoption is there, but I feel very, very strongly that if I am to have kids, I want them to be ""mine"".  I know that's selfish and awful, but I know that I would have issues with adoption.

So yeah.  If I'm to have kids, they have to be mine, but I'd fuck them up royally, and who would even mate with me anyway?  Plus, being older as a mum...  not great.

197,Not sure how to navigate,"This is my first time posting in here, kinda nervous ngl. Sorry in advance that this is so long..

I (f28) met my person (f23) almost a year & a half ago. I‚Äôm diagnosed & unmedicated severe BPD for the past 6ish years. When we first met, we both communicated very well about how we were & what we feel our ups/downs are. About 6mos in, I started having symptoms of a BPD split bc of a situation in which I attempted to let her in on my grief (something I guard ferociously) & it wasn‚Äôt perceived. At that time, it seemed as if she didn‚Äôt care about me the way I‚Äôd been believing she did up until then. That initiated my split & to be completely honest, I cannot even begin to list or explain the things that I was feeling. I just was feeling as though she was completely against me & didn‚Äôt understand why she stayed around. I was drowning in the moment that caused the split & got stuck in that spiral. While she, on the other hand, was pushing & pushing for me to meet her needs in the present moments. (Theres things & moments that I‚Äôm leaving out for the sake of trying not to make this post way longer). In December (2 days before her birthday), I was told something that was along the lines of her cheating on me that dated back to the summer. This set me off even more & when I brought it to her attention, she seemed as though it wasn‚Äôt important enough to take upon herself to rectify. That made me feel like there‚Äôs some truth to the information, which I still haven‚Äôt been able to let go of. In January she moved out & back with her family in an attempt to put space so we can get better. In my opinion, it was working up until mid-Feb when she came to me about a personal medical situation that threw me for a loop especially seeing how we‚Äôd been intimate & I was being made aware of it just over a month after she moved. I was feeling very much so like just as we were going to be able to close the door on one thing, another door of bs opens up. I started feeling overwhelmed again & I didn‚Äôt feel like I had any support from her because she was worried about why I wasn‚Äôt giving her what she wanted/needed from me in the moment. I tried explaining that I was having a hard time processing everything (I process from the past to the present, not the present to the past so it‚Äôs basically like everything in the present is on pause while I go thru the past to identify different things). At the end of February/beginning of March, I reached out to an ex due to the fact that I‚Äôd noticed similarities between that relationship & this one that I wanted to correctly identify so I could change it in the present. That led to her & I spending about a week or so together with her spending the nights here. On the day that the ex was leaving, my person came in & saw her standing in my room while I was in bed freshly showered & had just taken my robe off to lay down (so it looked way worse than it was). That led to a long night of me explaining the BPD split, the reason I reached out to my ex in the first place, as well as the lies I‚Äôd told to keep it from being found out. I admitted it was super impulsive & I didn‚Äôt think at all before doing it, as well as not taking into account how it‚Äôd look or be perceived by anyone else. I told her it could be fixed & we could get better but it‚Äôd take a lot of work to do so simply bc I‚Äôm now in a space where I realize I let my BPD get way out of control. I was in my own shit storm for 8mos at that point & I have a lot of work to do to repair this relationship that‚Äôs been broken for about 5 of those 8. The next couple of weeks was kinda hard, there were some uncomfortable conversations but I did my best & explained as much as I could. I started changing my behavior as well. Last week there was a night she‚Äôd come over to spend time with me & asked to see the text messages between my ex & I, in which I told her I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with that due to the sensitivity of the conversations (they were majorly centered around my grief & my feelings/emotions during the first two years of it prior to the breakup). It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want her to know now, I just feel like there‚Äôs steps that need to be taken before that due to the fact that up until this moment, the only time my grief has been brought up is during an argument about something else. She never asks me about it, and to me it doesn‚Äôt make sense to allow her into that part of myself without her ever even trying to talk about it with me. She‚Äôs now said to me that she started seeing someone, and is done trying to pressure me to open up to her. I‚Äôve been doing CBT/DBT, as well as the BPD workbook by Dr. Fox all on my own to be able to get better for myself as well as the betterment of our relationship. I‚Äôm stuck feeling like I‚Äôm not being given a chance to actually open myself completely up to expose myself to the person that I want nothing less than forever with. I texted her this morning asking if we could talk in person because I need to be able to convey this to her. I‚Äôm just not sure how to go about it at all - what do I say or not say, what options there are to hold myself to, and more importantly if she can be the support I need to get us on the same page again so we can move forward. Does anyone have any suggestions on what things to touch on and what to leave alone? I really want us to seek couples therapy to bridge the gap that we‚Äôve wedged.

198,How do I get better?,"I (20f) have been in a poly relationship for the past one and a half years with my partners 21f and 22f. For the majority of the relationship I have been completely okay, of course there have been ups and downs- my BPD has been what doctors have called ""quiet"" the majority of the time. This entire relationship has been consensual and for the majority of the time long distance with me living in the south, 21f living around 12 hours west of me, and 22f residing in Europe. 

I only started to feel insecure and unwanted in the relationship last July when I moved back go my home town to continue with my post graduate degree (yay full ride). When I moved it was fine for a few weeks, then when I started working again it seemed like I just stopped existing to 21f, she started to ignore me and act as if every time I went into work it was a direct attack to her- since I had less time to talk to her. Since I didn't want to hurt her, and to prevent me getting angry, I cut my hours and moved back in to my aunts home. Yet even after I cut my hours it was like I just ruined everything by having a life (she's physically disabled and had been out of work). We used to talk every single day but it went down to once a week, and I contemplated ending the relationship every day but I felt like if I left I'd just be compared to their abusive ex from like 3 years ago. So I stayed.

Nothing got better but I tried, I told them how I felt I tried every method therapy gave me, I bought them things they wanted, I spoiled them for their birthday but it didn't get better. Then my birthday passed, I was so excited and all I wanted was to watch a movie with them, but instead I got a long message about how awful their birthday was and how their parents did nothing for them and how jealous they were that I got gifts from my aunt (my parents are not in the picture). I was so ready to dump them that day but 22f convinced me not to- she was my rock during that time we talked constantly on call , constantly messaging yk? 

It got better with time, we were back to the before by September. But then I was talking about driving to 21f and she said no, she said she was too sick for me to come to her and that her doctor didn't want her to get sick. I understood since i am also immunocompromised- this was right after I got out of the hospital with covid and the flu. 

Not even a week later I got a message from both of them saying that 21f was going to be flying to Europe to be staying a month with 22f. I felt lied to, no matter how I looked at either of them it didn't get better. I told them so, I told them that it was their decision but that it was unfair how they treated me. I tried so hard to be calm and nice but all they said was that it wasn't their fault that I couldn't afford to fly to Europe. 

Despite the advice from my therapist I stayed, both of them telling me that my bpd was getting in the way of their happiness. I watched as they planned and Ultimately executed this plan this February. I woke up every day knowing that they were together in bed, I wasn't jealous of that I was mad. I was mad the entire month and was told over and over to calm down because clearly it was just my bpd overreacting. I listened, I thought I was the issue, I got angrier and angrier to the point that I was NV for almost two weeks straight, I couldn't talk- I could barely do anything (im also autistic). 

When 21f went back home I tried so hard to be calm, to forget but I can't. I'll never forget what they did to me. I feel so angry at both of them and objectively I know I'm the doormat for what I let them do to me but I just didn't want my bpd to affect them more than it already has with them being my fps. But now? I don't not love them but I still hate both of them. They both lied to me and then gaslighted me. I spent months in limbo hearing all their plans without me. 

I want to leave and I know it's dumb cause we're mostly long distance, but I feel so trapped. 21f has a tendency of always being a victim and every single fight that's ever happened always has to be my fault. Her ex also had bpd and she tells me at times she thinks I'm like him, despite knowing how much effort I put into not being like him its like a triumph card they use to try to make me a villain. They let things grow until they can't anymore and then blame me, its my fault they can't express boundaries, it's my fault they don't talk to me about issues (just because I don't know how to respond how they want me to). They expect me to always be their shoulder to lean on, and then when I can't I'm all of a sudden an awful subhuman who can't do anything right. 

I've been threatened with breaking up so many times by 21f its almost like a game, I can never be up to her standards. I'm like a broken record, I crawl back every time no matter how hurt I am and I just want an out. I'm not allowed to have friends I'm not allowed to go out, I'm just in a limbo. Ghosting isn't an option with how intertwined our families are- both of them know my entire family and I know theirs, this isn't just an online long distance thing we've known each other for almost 4 years now. I want an out but I don't know how to get one. I don't want to be a bad person everyone already judges me for my diagnosis and I don't want another reason for them to. How do I even fix this? How do I get better?",1711516417.0,False,2,2,thosewhohave_,None,1bou0so,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bou0so/how_do_i_get_better/
199,Coping skills for intense emotional pain when feeling abandoned?,"TL;DR: What are some coping skills that you‚Äôve found helpful or therapy techniques or things your therapist or someone has said which are helpful when your FP is going through a rough time and you‚Äôre afraid of being abandoned even though you logically don‚Äôt think they want to leave you? I‚Äôm especially looking for skills I can do anywhere, like while at my retail job or driving. 

My FP has talked to me more since having a death in her family but she still goes quiet fairly often for mental health reasons because her energy for being social gets low. I know she is struggling with her mental health too including some pretty severe issues and she recently reassured me very nicely that she‚Äôs always glad to reassure me and deep down I do believe her and believe she doesn‚Äôt plan on leaving. It‚Äôs just that she hasn‚Äôt talked to me AS MUCH as before and when she does talk to me after accidentally doing something that makes me feel abandoned, it‚Äôs been taking more reassurance from her to get me to feel confident again. 

Believing deep down she doesn‚Äôt want to leave doesn‚Äôt stop me from feeling like she is going to drift away from me too just like everyone else I have ever known has done, even though I know logically that her silence is no reflection on how she feels about me and entirely related to her trying to cope with her own issues. 

It hurts me though when she mentions any of her other friends because I feel like she likes them more than me so especially with feeling abandoned already it just makes me feel worse if she talks to me and talks to them. I‚Äôve been hurting so bad lately because I am terrified of her leaving even though logically I think she truly cares and wants to stay but I can‚Äôt make myself believe that so I‚Äôve been feeling so overwhelmed and freaking out a lot about this lately. 

Any helpful tips or coping skills I can do on my own? I just asked her for reassurance the other day and I don‚Äôt want to do it again already. Besides I want to get better at validating myself instead of always having to ask. 

The last thing I want to do is make her feel burdened by trying to take care of not only her own mental health but mine as well. I really really care about her and I want to do everything I can to avoid being toxic to her in any way. 

Thanks!

Edit: My current coping mechanisms are things like writing or making art about how I feel, trying to get physically comfortable with soft blankets or wearing comforting clothes, daydreaming, or trying to distract myself by cleaning or doing other activities.

200,All I do is hurt people,"[I ain't articulate so this is probably a mess.]

I am at a loss, there is no hope for me, I get better then I just crash.
Sick of my life, everything was going so great, I was connecting with family, socialising, practicing my DBT skills. Then boom, the paranoia, the sudden reaction of abandonment, trust issues then the rage.
Every skill I have been practicing just vanishes.

I have insulted, yelled and accused my FP of some crappy stuff.

I don't know if it's the Bpd or them, I can't trust anyone, angry with everyone.
Suicidal and I don't want to carry on with therapy, I have nothing, no friends, job or a social life, I am so lost I can't even get into a platonic relationship never mind having a GF.

My life has gone nowhere, I have no kids neighborhood keeps a wide birth of me.

I am just an unpredictable mess.

My thoughts and actions have cost me a lot, now I just don't want to be here at all.

I don't want to kill myself but I don't want help or to live either. I just want to stagnate and rot away. I haven't taken suicide out the equation, I just want to punish and hurt myself as much as possible first. 

I have tried over and over to make a better life for myself and I have nearly succeeded with great friends, money, vacations, but I just ruin it.

Is this some pitty story, not really it's more for myself. I hate living, the moods the inappropriate behaviour, the getting better and failing.
My cousin who was more of a brother killed himself, and I just want to go too.
I just need to build the courage to do so.

In the meantime all I can do is destroy my life, I don't deserve anything good.

I am going to give it a short while before I have made my decision. I have never liked my life.
Abuse after abuse, I should hurt the people that abused and destroyed my life before I go, I want to see them have that look in their eyes that they gave me, that realisation there is nowhere to go or do but put up with the pain. They are going first.

201,Canadian mental health's week,"This week is Canadian mental health‚Äôs week.

I cannot remain silent. I have witnessed so many prejudices related to different mental illnesses. And I have been victim myself of some prejudices related to my mental illness.

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I have an eating disorder (ED). 

I am trying really hard to recover from my eating disorder. It has been a year since I am in therapy and take medication. Even though I am on the path of recovery, I am still sick. My day-to-day existence is still challenging. I have been victim of many misconceptions people have about my disease. Today, I want to break those misconceptions. 

First of all, I have gone to my family doctor before my eating disorder went out of control. I‚Äôve told my doctor I was worried about the relationship I had with food. I‚Äôve told her that every time I felt angry, sad or anxious about something, I ate. I‚Äôve told her that I often got up at night to eat things I didn‚Äôt allow myself to eat at daytime. I‚Äôve told her that I was sometimes craving for junk food. I‚Äôve told her that I was often eating so much that I felt a pain in my stomach. I‚Äôve also told her that I was constantly checking my weight because I was worried that I was weighing more than my friends. Those are the common symptoms of an eating disorder. My doctor didn‚Äôt take me seriously. She didn‚Äôt consider my eating behaviors as a problem. Actually, she told me it was quite common among teenagers to like junk food and to eat ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. 

For a couple of years, back in high school, my eating behaviors remain the same. I was stealing money from my mother‚Äôs purse to buy junk food. I was hiding food in places where my mother could not find it such as my room‚Äôs closet. I had drawers filled with wrappers. 

Then, it got worse. Two years ago, I had convinced myself that I had some kind of virus and that I couldn‚Äôt digest food anymore. For a week, I had stopped eating. My close ones were worried but they didn‚Äôt question my behavior because I had convinced them I had a virus. When I started to eat again, food disgusted me so much that I felt like I couldn‚Äôt keep it: I had to throw it all away. And that is what I started to do.  At first, I told my parents that I was throwing up because of the virus. But, it kept getting worse. I could barely eat with them. And when I did, I ate a ridiculously small amount of food. I was throwing up after each meal. And I had started to skip meals. In a matter of a few months, I had lost a lot a weight (something like 25 pounds). At one point, I couldn‚Äôt concentrate at school anymore. I was feeling weak. I was feeling anxious around others. At that time, all I wished for was to disappear completely. I told my parents I needed to go to therapy. I knew something was wrong but I didn‚Äôt know what it was. My first therapist diagnosed me with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), related to a sexual assault I had been victim of a couple of years before.  Then, I was diagnosed with Depression. Then, I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, they found out I had an eating disorder: I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. Finally, after a suicide attempt and a stay at the hospital, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 

I have found it really difficult to hear about the final diagnosis because I knew that this one was accurate. When my therapist first described to me the symptoms of BPD, all I could think was: ¬´It is me. It is all me. Is it all that I am? Am I a disease?¬ª For those of you who don‚Äôt know much about BPD, there are nine specific symptoms to this illness but you only need to have five of them to be diagnosed with it. First of all, BPDs fear abandonment. That‚Äôs why BPDs make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Because of that fear of abandonment, BPDs have unstable relationships. BPDs relationships are often intense and short-lived. Also, BPDs have unstable self-image. BPDs may feel good about themselves for a short period of time and then hate themselves. BPDs often don‚Äôt know their needs and desires. They may change values, goals, and even sexual identity. Because of their unclear self-image, BPDs engage in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm, risky sex, alcohol or drug abuse, binge eating. Those self-destructive behaviors can lead to suicidal behavior. BPDs also have intense emotional swings. They are described as hypersensitive. In fact, Marsha Linehan, the psychologist whom invented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is now used to treat people with BPD, says: 
‚ÄúPeople with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.‚Äù BPDs also experiences chronic feelings of emptiness due to their unstable self-image and their lack of self-confidence. BPDs can also struggle with intense anger and can have trouble controlling it. More frequently, BPDs direct their anger towards them. Finally, BPDs can experience episodes of paranoia where they feel suspicious about other‚Äôs motives and out of touch with reality.  That feeling can lead to out of body‚Äôs experiences. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, I knew I had to tell my close ones. The impact of the symptoms on my life was so important: I could not pretend that they did not exist anymore. My therapist had warned me that the reactions to my diagnosis could be quite inadequate due to all the misconceptions people have about mental illnesses. Unfortunately, people often see BPD‚Äôs desperate calls for help as attention seeking. For example, that is often the way people feel about self-harm and suicidal behavior. Another common misconception is that people think that all BPD sufferers are extroverts. People think all BPDs express their intense emotions at the exact moment they feel them. In fact, some of us keep a lot of those emotions to ourselves. Sometimes, it is because we are not sure how to express those feelings. Sometimes, it is because we don‚Äôt even know how we feel: there are so many emotions trapped inside of us that ask to be released.  If you know someone suffering from BPD or from any other mental illness, you have to know there is no magic way to cure for those illnesses. The person who suffers from a mental illness has to be ready to recover and that feeling can only come from her. There is nothing you can do except stand by her side while she is trying her best to recover.  

I hope that my statement will help to demystify BPD and Bulimia Nervosa among some of you. And, I hope that those of you who suffer from any mental illness will feel less lonely. I also hope it will encourage you to speak up to stop the stigmatization of mental illnesses.

202,"[F,21]Just Diagnosed. Feeling Hopless in Need of Encouragment","My bf just ended our 3 and a half year relationship. He always accused me of being negative, manipulative, only seeing my perspective, over emotional, crazy, always thinking im right. He cheated on me and lied alot and was disrespectful. So i always saw his problems as much more severe. I didnt agree with his accusations besides being over emotional and sensitive. But now that ive been diagnosed ive been reading articles, looking into resources, and now  perspectives of boyfriends with BPD girlfriends, I see how he could see me that way.....

So, i just sent him a really long text explaining everything i now see, saying how although i had good intentions my actions came across negativley( i just got diagnosed about a week before the break up, so alot of this is just coming to realization). I said at the beginning of the text i wasnt sending it in hopes of being back together or reciving a response from him, but he didnt respond. And im starting to see just how severe my disorder is... cuz now im crying, wishing i never opened up to him and sent it, cus i thought he would at least aknowlege that I am realizing everything. And i know this is my BPD speaking... cuz i shouldnt care if he responds or not. Im acting out of emotions right now and assuming he must hate me or think im crazy or doesnt want anything to do with me. 

Needless to say, this realization is making me feel hopeless. I didnt realize how bad i was until now. I thought i was mild and a year of therapy could fix it. Is recovery likely?? Reading others posts make me feel like ill never get better. 

Please, I need encouragment that ill get through this, i dont have a supportive family and ive always gone to him for support and hes not here anymore,
I want to give up

203,I want to tell him.,"I want to tell the man I love that I am broken.
That I was raped and humiliated at 15.
That my ex-husband, whom I hastily married for reasons you should not marry, would drill into my brain that I am fat, unlovable, psycho, a cunt, a bitch, a whore...and that after awhile, I started to believe it, and un-believing it is harder than you would think.
That I am sorry for saying sorry all the time...I truly am afraid I have offended or angered you in some way (even though you show no signs of being either).
That after my divorce, I allowed myself to fall in love again, and he was nearly worse than my ex husband, in five months time he did an astounding amount of damage to my psyche and self esteem, and ended up dumping me and kicking me out randomly out of the blue...So I am scared...very scared.
That I have been homeless so many times I do not unpack anything. There is no point it seems. I have not lived anywhere longer than 3 months in the past 3.5 years, it is heart breaking.
That my mother is narcissistic and bipolar, growing up and still to this day I have always been forced to be the adult, to always be the bigger person. I have and continue to be yelled at every day for random little things that the average person wouldnt get angry about. I cant handle yelling...I immediately either shut down or start crying.

I am broken, and I am hard to love sometimes. 
But I am worthy of love, and you will never find a woman who will treat you so well and love you so deeply.

And you, my love, you are fantastic, you make my soul sing and my heart erupt in a firey passion.
The way you care for me is unexplainable and amazing.
I hope, with time, that through our love and through my therapy, that I will no longer be broken.

204,FRUSTRATION STATION,"Hey all. Thanks for having me here. 

I'm (27 FtM) struggling to prioritize in my life. Having finally gotten some self awareness on the borderline patterns of attachment, obsession, and trying to break out of this cycle of centering my life around unattainable or unavailable people, living in fantasy worlds, being super self absorbed, venting and only talking to people when I want attention, validation etc. that is keeping me from moving forward, gaining skills, etc. Everyone is so frustrated with me and I have had to come to terms with being emotionally abusive/neglectful to my ex, neglectful at my jobs and of my pets and self. 

It feels very awkward and unnatural and forced to try to be consistent in friendship, my habits, life. I never have had serious addictions besides social media and other peoples approval. 

Im exhausted. But I know I do have habits and can form new ones because I definitely have bad ones like laying in bed all morning or spending a lot of time in my head. 
Its just that every single day my mood is different even on mood stabilizers and I'm used to doing what I feel like impulsively based on mood, or what I'm forced to do. Which is a surefire way to spin out of control or feel hopeless. I need to develop my OWN locus of control and discipline and its just shitty that my moods are the enemy when they so badly crave validation after decades of gaslighting and being blamed for their intensity and destructive power. 

Im wondering for those who are actively recovering...what has really really helped you out of old coping mechanisms? What were you able to commit to?

I am PDA autistic and have ADHD or bipolar, still waiting on a psych evaluation, but one of my biggest struggles is finding something to be consistent with that doesn't end up trashed by demand avoidance or getting bored/splitting on it. 

Every kind of routine or demand outside of my fixations ends up feeling like swallowing pills or pinching your nose to eat something nasty until I just stop. 

 Everyone says to fight depression, meditate find hobbies and get outside yourself find something to do for others, exercise. 
But I legitimately feel my habits and mental copes are like gravity or a black hole and getting out of them or making changes in life exhausts me and I collapse back into them. 

I guess this is just what recovery is like. But I've tried Codependents Anonymous, talk therapy, astrology, divination, meds (except ADHD meds about to start those), being more social, creative expression. At the end of the day my brain always finds a way to invalidate destroy or get convinced that thing ""isn't it."" The only thing I come back to is taking pictures on my phone (never organized) and writing long rants on the internet. Im so bored of my SELF. And analyzing myself and recounting my past trauma.. everyone else seems to somehow find something to do, or to love, or commit to,, even when we have the same diagnosis and experiences. 
Ughhhhhhhhhh. 

Is it really possible to form an identity and learn how to commit? 

I'm so tired from fighting myself. 

It feels like a normal life is just within reach if I could follow the steps (apply for jobs, show up to jobs, budget the money, move put of home state, take care of my body, cook and eat, have a creative routine, go on a run, care for my pet, evaluate which relationships are good to have around, spend time in nature, set boundaries, learn time management, learn emotional regulation) so I can get to a place where I feel stable enough to really connect with others and not sabotage everything or get hurt because I picked someone wrong.

 But those steps feel so impossible when I keep proving to myself over and over that I will not stick with anything, I will sabotage everything, and every single day I have a new idea about my next big project or career path or what ever. 

How do you build trust with yourself or anyone else without consistent effort? 
The only way I feel motivated is to get a FP or romantic interests approval, or extreme outside pressure and fear of punishment. 

Im just so frustrated I could scream for days. 

Does it get better? And how! Does DBT help with this? 

Consistency is literally the key to unlocking life, and I feel like someone tossed it into a vat of concrete Im supposed to chip away at with my fingernails.

205,Backwards,"Major slide backwards

I started off the year strong. I had gone about 30 days with no contact with a guy I had a somewhat quasi relationship with at work. (Mistake #1) 

We were good friends, then I wanted more. He asked that I keep us a secret cause he didn‚Äôt want work knowing (they gossip) .. I was insulted and took it as he was embarrassed at me. He was offended I didn‚Äôt consider his feelings. 

Everything changed. He wasnt ready for a relationship and of course i blamed myself intentently 

Paranoia set in as he told me he‚Äôd back away since he didn‚Äôt want to lead me on. I told him to not interact with me at work. This hurt his feelings.

Then I missed him flirting and talking with me at work. Which confused him.

It‚Äôs been a mess since. Basically he‚Äôs always busy, I don‚Äôt believe him. He defends himself, I get insulted.  I insult him, he insults me back, then I say sorry and ask to hang out again, it‚Äôs our cycle.

But it‚Äôs so much more than that. 

I didn‚Äôt speak to him for 30 days. Everything was going well for me. We had an intense eye contact a few weeks ago and it started everything again. A week ago I had to have an emergency biopsy and I was scared and broke down and told him I was scared and missed him. He said he missed me too but he didn‚Äôt like feeling like he had to be my boyfriend or nothing, he said he didn‚Äôt like that I questioned his motives and that I would be hurt if he didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a text. 

I finally admitted to the first I ever was interested in that I had BPD. He was incredibly receptive and said we talked soon.

Fast forward to this week.. I started my bs again when I texted to say say and try being his friend cause he said I often didn‚Äôt ask about him or his day. It turned into completely ugliness with both of us getting nasty.

Both saying we‚Äôre done.

I went from being so strong and being proud of myself. I even told me he was the catalyst to show me that I needed help again cause I was falling into old patterns. 

Yet I blew it again this week.

I don‚Äôt know how to quit this guy. I want things to be the way they were.. when he looked at me like I was the greatest thing in the world. When I couldn‚Äôt get him to leave me alone. Now I hardly get a text back.

I need to get back to where I was. But it all hurts.   I‚Äôm sitting here after day 2 of back and forth horrible texting. 

What‚Äôs worse is I‚Äôm almost 40 and hes 28. He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm in middle school for constantly having to defend myself to a grown ass woman.‚Äù 

And he‚Äôs absolutely fucking right.

206,Advice on how to manage symptoms without professional help?,"This post might be a bit long so sorry in advance. tldr; I have no access to MH services and need advice on managing my symptoms. 

For a bit of background, I've had issues with anger and lashing out as long as I can remember. My other symptoms started to display between the ages of 13 and 16 and have progressively got worse as I've gotten older. I live in the UK and was with CAMHS while in college, my CAMHS worker said that she was pretty much certain I have BPD, but because I was 17 she couldn't officially diagnose me due to guidelines (something about puberty and hormones causing the symptoms, idk). My sessions were first thing on a Friday morning but as I progressed in college I needed to spend all my time on campus and couldn't go to my appointments anymore, and was discharged.

Since then I've not been to any sort of therapy, I went back to my GP at 18 and they put me on anti depressants which did absolutely nothing but made me feel worse and I stopped. I'm now nearing 21 and have been referred to my local mental health services maybe 4 or 5 times since, but nothing has ever come of it, they've just told me to self refer to drug groups/anger management groups despite the fact that I've said multiple times that my drug and anger issues are due to a larger problem, not the sole problem theirselves. I'll admit that I'd sort of given up with it due to being fucked around so many times, but recently my boyfriend got super worried after a breakdown which resulted in me not leaving my room for 6 days, bearly eating, crying near constantly and lashing out when he came to check on me because I took him not spending all 6 days with me as him not caring about me. After I'd regained my senses, I agreed to give getting help another go, and sent in an online form to the local services describing all my symptoms, explained that I've been told by CAMHS I've probably got BPD but couldn't be diagnosed at the time, and wanted help for that. 

Well this was at the beginning of March, and obviously with everything going on now, I doubt I'm going to get any help until this has all blown over.
I can feel myself slipping back into old habits, getting stupidly impulsive, saying nasty things without thinking, my moods won't stay consistent for more than an hour at a time and I'm getting increasingly paranoid that my boyfriend, housemates, family, basically everyone hates me and wants me dead. I really don't know how to handle this anymore, part of me knows I'm being ridiculous but it feels like the sane part of me is locked in a room watching the mental part of me take control and ruin every aspect of my life.

For those of you better adjusted than I am, how do you cope with these things, and generally for anyone, how do you manage your symptoms without access to proper psychological help? I feel like a massive burden to my boyfriend and can't go on much longer than this.",1585871847.0,False,6,3,snmrespnnjllyfsh,None,ftxj8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ftxj8c/advice_on_how_to_manage_symptoms_without/
207,Will I ever love myself?,"About 5 years ago I broke! I tried to go to sleep forever! I somehow lost all.ability to cope with my emotions. Though I have always been intense emotionally I was always able to ""function!"" but it became impossible! I was diagnosed with severe  depression and mild anxiety. We have tried every medication under the sun for depression.  About 2 years ago I again couldnt deal with the thought of having one more day! I was diagnosed with having Borderline personality disorder!! Once I actually received this diagnosis everything made sense. I could look back and see that I had this my whole life. I could make sense of feeling outside, I didn't feel so disgusted with myself for they way i used to hurt myself. I felt a glimmer of hope that now the healing can begin we have found the true problem. In these two years I have never been worse. I couldn't except that there was no magical pill to make me an adult again. I have closed off almost all communication from the world. I only leave my house when I have Dr appointments and only if my mother drives me (pretty pathetic) I have a nephew I only met twice and another maybe a handful of times. I have another niece and nephew that had me before I broke and now wonder where there favorite aunty has went. I can't stand to see my family all I see is pain and disappointment. All I see is their distrust that I won't kill myself. So I shut away. I can look in the mirror my view is so dark and distorted. I just want my life back. I have these people trying to help and everyone says the same thing. Only once I love myself can I find out where I belong and what I was meant to be. Only then can o find happiness. But all I have is hopelessness and an extreme hate for myself. I don't hate much I hate rapist and murders and people who hurt children or elders bit nothing is as and as the hate I have for me!! I am finally taking steps to get help. I start a group therapy program this week. I want to be realistic with my goals to avoid disappointing my family and myself once again. So really will I ever love myself? Or is this distorted view here for a lifetime? Can I have BPD and find happiness? Or is hopelessness all I will know?

208,"Need relationship advice, trying to have a healthy relationship but also dealing with BPD symptoms. Can you ever trust your intuition?","A little background on me: I'm a 28 year old female diagnosed BPD about a year ago. Not currently on any medication or undergoing any therapy (cost prohibitive unfortunately) but I am trying to be more aware of my symptoms and deal with them using DBT skills. 

My past romantic relationships have been very tumultuous. I have a lot of issues with self esteem so I tend to hold onto relationships for a lot longer than I should and tolerate a lot of things that I shouldn't (e.g. lack of commitment after long periods, cheating) because I'm trying to avoid being abandoned/prove my self worth. Splitting is also a huge issue for me and I can be very impulsive.

I recently met someone through a dating app and we have been seeing each other for a little over 2 months. We regularly go on dates, he texts me every day, and we talk on the phone frequently. He speaks favorably of our time together, is affectionate in actions and in communication, and we talk regularly about future plans. 

In typical BPD fashion, I got attached very quick but am now constantly looking for a sign that he's going to reject me. I again experience splitting, although I only share these thoughts with the few friends who know about my diagnosis (in other words, I've never lashed out at this person for any perceived slights).

If these things were the end of the story I would just continue to practice DBT skills and try not to react emotionally. However, I decided to do some investigating and he is still on updating/using the dating app where we met. I know that to someone without BPD issues, it was be silly to assume he would have deleted the app only 2 months after meeting me, especially after us having never had a conversation about exclusively dating. However, it's very triggering for me and makes me feel betrayed and rejected. I obsess over it and it causes me a lot of anxiety.

What I'm wanting to know is how to best handle this situation. Do I bring up the idea of exclusively dating? Do I  try to let the relationship play out organically and do my best to control my behaviors like I do in other aspects of my life?",1461308331.0,False,7,2,bpdanon88,None,4fxclm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/4fxclm/need_relationship_advice_trying_to_have_a_healthy/
209,It‚Äôs been a tough year...,Where do I even start... I mean my whole life has been chaotic and traumatic. But so fuck it let‚Äôs start out with my mom who was 20 years sober.. started drinking again when I was ‚Äúliving‚Äù with my parents. And then my parents got divorced and I was left with my abusive dad. I mean after she left he was nice to me. But 18 years of being scared of him was burned into my psyche so I couldn‚Äôt forgive. I graduated high school early my mom moved out of California (we barley talk) and I met this guy.. and I mean I did have feelings for him at some point. I ended up dating him. Then my dad moved away leaving me with no fucking choice to move in with (let‚Äôs call him N.C) and so I lived there and. Back track I WAS LEFT WITH NO MONEY NO SUPPORT NO CALI ID OR BIRTH CERTIFICATE (I got all that now) so I was stuck being a babysitter for N.C‚Äôs siblings and I did anything I could because I had no way to get a job so I was fucked. And I was only making 20$ a weeks (that N.C STOLE FROM ME ALL THE TIME) I was depressed and lonely. I didn‚Äôt even feel like his girlfriend or anything. He treated me like shit. And I wasn‚Äôt myself at all. Then in September my grandma passed away so I had to go to a town I used to live and a LOT OF trauma started there. Where every single night of my whole life I‚Äôd have nightmares about this place. So when I was there I was having a mix of flashbacks from actual events and nightmares. So I went back to N.C‚Äôs house stayed there for 2 days. And I mean honestly being in that town was way better than being with N.C. But my dad called me saying how he was at the point of Suicide. So I fled with no explanation. Like yea my dad was abusive my whole life but he was all I had left. Then N.C and I broke up (not mad at that only mad at how i was treated) so I was stuck in that town. I was there for 2 months and I was so not myself I didn‚Äôt talk to ANYONE. I smoked hella weed and locked myself in a room. Then my dad and I came back home. Ended up homeless staying in an abandoned RV with no power or heat in the middle of winter. Now I have a job and I‚Äôm able to stay with a friend for 3 months only. And I‚Äôm trying to go back into therapy. I‚Äôve repressed a lot of bad shit this year and I‚Äôm a fucking mess. Then what really set me off my friend I‚Äôm living with wants me to pay them in weed when I only got 8$ to my fucking name.

210,How to maintain a relationship with my bio mom while working on my mental health?,"Hi so i'm (20F) am living with my biological mom for the past 2 years, I don't have a job, I'm trying to sign up for therapy, do everything I can so I can get on my feet again, but my family aren't that supportive especially my bio mom. I was taken when I was 3, we used to visit a lot growing up but over time I stopped answering her calls for a reason even I don't know. I was diagnosed when i was 19 and now I'm almost 21 but I've always been like this even as a kid. My bio mom doesn't see that but my adopted parents do and they did everything the could (granted they didn't have a lot of knowledge of how to handle adopting kids) I always thought for the longest time the reason I'm like this was because I wasn't with my bio family but now that I know how my Bio mom is, I realized that maybe I shouldn't have left my parents house.

Ever since moving here, I've been yelled at for things I cant control such as crying over her jokes. She's said things like ""I hate crybabies"" ""I cant handle girls, I hoped you were a boy"" she's never physically affectionate, no hugs, kisses, I cant even lay next to her in her bed when I'm sad. She tries to make it seem like I'm an awful daughter. She calls me a bitch more than she says my name. I ran away once because I couldn't handle it anymore and then when I came back I told her how my friend let me stay with his mom, how I spent the whole time with them and she cried with me even tho she speaks spanish and I don't. She's hugged me kissed my forehead more times than my mom has in my lifetime. gave me clothes, let me sleep on her bed while she took the floor, basically everything a mom does for her kids. I then told her how I felt like I deserved to sleep on the streets but they didn't want me to and were worried about me. Her response was ""you deserved to sleep on the streets for acting like a bitch"" The whole argument she's talking about was bc I had $7 and I wasn't sure if I wanted to give it to her because she's an alcoholic and she wanted to buy beer and I kept telling her idk it's all I have left and to her it wasn't the answer she was looking for. She kept asking and I kept saying the same thing, its the last of my money but it's my social security money and I like to save the little amount I have for myself for the next month (I get less than $100 a month) and it turned into me being ungrateful, disrespectful, making her look stupid and my biggest trigger is yelling, she knows this and was yelling an inch away from my face and I was terrified I was shaking and crying and closing my eyes and she said ""why you scared? I never hit you whoever told you that is a liar, you're such a pussy"" ""youre so much bigger than me and stronger"" She also brought my bio dad into it who I haven't seen in years due to his ongoing struggle with addiction and it scared me because I love him more than anything, he's my favorite person always have been. It was unfair because he's not stable, he doesn't know what's going on with me because he wants to keep me away from all that for my safety. Oh, not to mention, my step sister (12) agrees with my mom that I'm disrespectful, I hate her how I don't deserve her ect. I get she's a kid so I don't hold it against her but it really does make me feel like I'm the problem

It was like a snowball effect, anyways, I've been thinking of calling my parents and telling them but I'm scared on how they will take it because my mom is my bio mom's half sister and she loves us both and has seen me on my horrible days and she might agree with my bio mom. I keep on wanting to ask to come home but to me, it feels like everyone hates me and doesnt want me around and it's getting to the point where I wanna end everything. Is this something that i can overcome or is this really a bad situation? I'm trying to get counseling but it'll take a couple months and I'm trying to find an alternative to living here but I know that stress will end up killing me.

211,How can I get over an ugly breakup?,"I fell in love with my ex early June, we were madly in love, I moved in after two weeks. Arguments over shitty stuff started to appear, mostly from me. Whenever I didn‚Äôt get what I wanted, I threatened to break up or commit suicide, more than 10 times till he couldn‚Äôt handle my abusive, manipulated behaviors anymore. We broke up late September. He packed my stuff and kicked me out of his apartment. I went through hell, missed him every day, hated myself every seconds. I then diagnosed with BPD, it explained all what happened. After 3 weeks of having therapy, I saw him again and asked if we could have another chance, he agreed. We were in love again, heaven was real to me. After a week or so, patterned thoughts and behaviors came back, again. He was so patient with me, he was there for me most of the time, he comforted me as much as he could. One day, when he was horny and wanted to put fingers in my butthole, I said no because anal sex is not my thing (he tried it before and I ABSOLUTELY fucking hate this), he still did it until I had tears in my eyes. Yeah, sexual assault. I have PTSD since then, including hallucinations. He was begging me for forgiveness, I said yes because I love him so damn much. Sadly, I couldn‚Äôt get over it. Whenever we argued, I threatened to call the police cause I cannot handle this shit anymore. I‚Äôm scared of men somehow. He said if I reported, he would lose everything. 5 days ago, when I was out with a friend, he locked me out with any signs, he messaged me saying that we were breaking up, he was going away, that he packed me stuff and I could get it back in the next 3 days. I couldn‚Äôt breathe AT ALL, I was in a terrifying panic attack, my heart shattered into dust. He blocked my number, Facebook, removed my shared Disney+ account, he just disappeared. The second nightmare came to me, even worse than the one in September cause this happened all of sudden, I wasn‚Äôt prepared for this. I also found out that the last week we were together, he tried to gather evidence showing my love for him (kissing pictures of us), I know he will use them against me if I‚Äôm gonna report his act. It hurts me like shit cause I don‚Äôt wanna hurt my loved one. I could imagine now I‚Äôm an enemy to him. BPD turns me into an abuser, I have to deal with this every day. I still want him back but it‚Äôs too late, he said he never wants to see me again. He is now having BPD as well, along with ADHD and GAD he already had. I realized we both have mental illnesses, his would trigger mine all the time and vice versa. He cries a lot, hits his head, screams and punches wall. I know it‚Äôs time to let everything go but I‚Äôm still obsessed with the thought of having him back once again. This is ridiculous, we both hurt each other so much, we are abusers. Should I report him or not? I‚Äôm confused, tired, I miss him every minutes. Love and hate at the same time is the worst thing to have in this world. I couldn‚Äôt sleep since he assaulted me and after the breakup, I cannot eat, I look horrible. I just want peace, just peace.

212,I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm doing this,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicide, self harm and all that bad mental health stuff. (Sorry if I did that wrong). 

Hi redditors. I‚Äôve never posted before. Thanks for reading and responding if you choose to do so. I‚Äôm sorry if the following triggers you or if you are struggling with the same brand of futile terrible I am. 

I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I‚Äôve struggled so much and for so long that I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm not angry or bitter or sad anymore; I just want it to be over. I‚Äôm tired of being confused all the time, completely disconnected from this thing called ‚Äòlife‚Äô everyone seems to be switched into. I‚Äôm tired of being panicky and depressed and anxious all at the same time, almost all the time. Im tired of being at the mercy of my insane mood swings where I'm experiencing overlapping interchanges of all these conflicting emotions all day long. I'm tired of crying so often that it feels like my brain is going to explode in my own head and my eyes will just cease to function properly. I‚Äôm tired of being dismissed when I say I‚Äôm unwell (psychiatrist included) because ‚ÄòI‚Äôm doing so well‚Äô - I don‚Äôt even know what this means or how you could conclude that from someone whose chronically unemployed, can‚Äôt finish uni or even leave the house or make eye contact with people without panicking. I feel like an absolute rotting turd most of the time despite what I‚Äôm putting out there (which feels to me like a shit show but to other people for some reasons seems completely normal).

People seem to consistently make this crazy assumption that I‚Äôm ‚Äòintelligent and capable‚Äô for some reason and therefore I don‚Äôt need help. They couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. I can‚Äôt accomplish basic tasks because I‚Äôm emotionally all over the place all the time and trying to do basic human things like pick what to wear in the morning sends me into shame spirals, suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I have no control over my emotions or impulses, I‚Äôm constantly floating away from my body and nothing feels real. I‚Äôm incapable of accepting any kind of affection or goodwill from others without completely self destructing and I don‚Äôt want to burden others so my relationships are nonexistent. 

I‚Äôve dealt with thoughts, feelings, urges and attempts of suicide my entire life. Its pretty much always been a terrifying backup in the back of my mind ever since I can remember as a safety plan to escape the torture of life where I can always feel exactly how close I am to death. Some days feel a magnetism to it but a strong resolve to resist. Other days, I‚Äôm basically hanging on by a thread and not telling anyone so they don‚Äôt come and take me from my home against my will again. 

I just want the freedom to be able to make this decision on my own. I did not give consent to be born, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ethical to keep someone alive against their will when they are suffering chronically and there isn‚Äôt a solution. 

I just feel like there‚Äôs no way out. I don‚Äôt respond to medications and suffer from such severe side effects that my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe any more drugs. My old psychiatrist had me on 5 different meds and I was equally bad, maybe worse, but in a completely different way. Those who have had adverse reactions to medications will understand this. Being mentally ill or being on psychiatric medication is like choosing if you want death by drowning or self-immolation.

I do DBT group therapy, see a psychologist and psychiatrist but I still feel like absolute shit. Everyone seems to be going through the motions, ticking all the boxes, but I just feel like nothing has really shifted. No amount of bandaids is going to help me when I‚Äôm walking around absolutely raw with no fucking skin on my body. It‚Äôs excruciating to just be alive but because it‚Äôs not visible, and it‚Äôs a slow death, nobody cares and the state ‚Äòhas a responsibility‚Äô to keep you alive. In my experience, everyone is all sad when someone kills them selves, but also calls them selfish because they‚Äôve left so much pain in their wake. Being passed around a mental health care system that can‚Äôt really help you, is insanely expensive and practically useless makes me miss the days when I didn‚Äôt seek help, suffered in silence but could at least hold on to the hope that there was a possibility of getting better if I had the right help. Now I know that‚Äôs not even an option. 

I‚Äôm just doomed to relive this cycle of extreme pain, possible suicide, absurdity, exhaustion, sheer terror, panic attacks, extreme mood swings, paranoia, catatonia, confusion, dissociation, spontaneous stuttering, paralysis and fatigue, where I can‚Äôt seem to express myself clearly no matter how hard I try or connect with other people. 

I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. No matter how hard I try, I just can‚Äôt stop the anxiety, panic, negativity, paranoia and depression from seeping in. I fear my emotions, I fear my thoughts and the things in life I can‚Äôt control that are going to hurt me so I just live in a constant state of sheer paralysis, frozen in fear and bracing myself for impact.

The only thing that‚Äôs keeping me alive is the thought that my sister will have to deal with the trauma of my suicide. But it also seems like it should be unethical to keep a person in this much chronic pain alive. I can feel my body deteriorating, my mind is basically scrambled eggs at this point, and I feel like I‚Äôm at the mercy of an emotionally handicapped body that I have zero control over. I keep harming myself and those around me. I just want to die with a little bit of dignity but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way out.

Life seems to be one trauma after the next, and continued reluctant attempts to help myself that only end up in things getting worse. I was not made for this world. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. Please let me go. I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone but I‚Äôm so tired now. Please tell me this will all be over soon.",1596368916.0,False,10,7,sarahthehumanperson,None,i2asxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/i2asxt/i_cant_believe_im_doing_this/
213,Should I stay in my messy relationship?,"I've been diagnosed with BPD since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and I've done a lot of different therapies for it. I thought I was getting better for the longest time because I thought I had my emotions and everything under control, especially in relationships. I've been seeing my boyfriend for roughly 2 years and I've noticed I've completely went off the rails. Any sense of emotional stability I've had before has completed disappeared. 2 years ago I was holding down a stable and really good paying job for 3 years and I think they liked me considering they trained me in every department and would always complement my work. I also had lots of friends and was very social, I even had friends that I was friends with for 9 years (there would be a few years in between where we wouldn't talk because of them moving or just different life pathways but always found our way back to each other). I also was in university and bought a car from the dealership and my credit score was really amazing too. I really felt like my life has direction at that point. That was until my dad got his second DUI and went into rehab and came out of rehab doing meth and completely flipping out. That's when I met my boyfriend. It was such a a rough time for me, I had to talk to the cops a lot and get a restraining order against my dad for awhile. My boyfriend was unlike anyone else I dated, he didn't try and force me to have sex and I waited awhile before hooking up with him, and even before we had hooked up he was there to support me through everything! I was so appreciative and really fell in love because I thought he was so compassionate. He had recently went through a break up so I had a sneaking suspicion I was a rebound and I just wanted to know where he and him stood. He promised me I wasn't a rebound and he hadn't talked to his ex for a few months. My BPD started flairing up and I went through his phone (I'm sorry I know it's bad but I developed this bad habit from my last ex being with him for a whole year and trusting him but seeing millions of girls messaging him till I finally had a hunch and checked and was mortified, I just didn't want to waste my time again) I found text messages between his friend and him saying that if he hooked up with me he'd basically be tunnel brothers with all his buddies (which is far from true, he thought I hooked up with both his friends but I only hooked up with his one other friend once when I was blackout at a party and I didn't even really want it to happen) it hurt my feelings to feel like he was talking about me like that to his friends and kinda made me feel like a whore. I ended up flipping and waking him up with a garbage bag full of his stuff and sent him home. We ended up talking it out and we started hanging again. But then whenever he got drunk, he'd call me his ex's name, and he called her and said he loved her and missed her. I was devastated once again, but now I felt like an easy rebound whore. So we once again fought and he convinced me it wasn't that way, just to go and hook up with her the one night I asked for space (he is extremely codependent). I was pissed and tried to convince myself I was done with him. But I'm stupid so I forgave him, I think I only did that because of all the trauma I was going through with my dad, I really wanted someone to be there for me and hold me and tell me everything was okay. He was back at my place again for awhile and then he disappeared to his ex's place for a whole week and swore on his life he didn't hook up with her and was just there to support her through a rough time (he only recently told me they did actually hook up). I spent the whole week crying at work and just being miserable. He begged me to stay with him and I did, which is something I've never done before. I've never ever ever let someone disrespect me like this before, but I felt so low and vulnerable. We were together for awhile after all that and it was so hard for me to not want to abandon him at any fight we had. We fought a lot and were pretty miserable together. I was really trying to break things off but he kept claiming he really wanted to be with me. He hooked up with a new girl he met and was hanging with secretly behind my back at his friends place for a month or two. What made me really mad is I would let him drive my car over there while I was at work and I bought an Xbox for him to use at my place and he was playing games with her while I was at work. Anyways he hooks up with her and she has BPD too. So off the hop she started tracking his location and everything, so he came clean to me about it and told me she was crazy and regrets doing it. I told him that he should just be with her and just leave me alone. She ended up needing help and he convinced me to go pick her up and help her get drugs. She ends up getting me and him into doing those drugs (we've done it before and were completely sober, just have a hard time saying no when it's right in front of me). We all ended up going on a 7 day bender and by the end of it I was all alone and the most mentally fucked I've ever been. They ended up dating. For a whole month he kept pressuring me to come over and give me drugs to drive them around and he even pressured me into a threesome. I only did it because I'm stupid and just did kinda want to be high and see him. They were absolutely vile to me while I was there and I finally got the back bone to block them and sober up. She would make millions of tiktoks about how she fucked him in the bed beside me to put me in my place and how she wants to beat me up now that I didn't want to be their bitch. She even threatened to send a whole gang of people to my house if I didn't send her money at one point. I was nothing but nice to her, swear on my life! She wanted to put me in my place because I warned her that he can be cheaty and to watch out! And she claimed I was trying to break them up. She still to this day posts about me and it's been a year since him and her were last together. Anyways, I was dating someone and doing shitty but alright. Sober, university drop out, bluey watching, chain smoking, loser on medical leave from work. My ex got me up and I dropped everything to meet up with him and to hear how shit his life was without me (hopefully) and it was. He GOT HER PREGNANT!!! And was absolutely MISERABLE! I was rolling. I wanted to laugh in his face and go back to eating cupcakes and watching bluey buuuutttt I self sabotaged my life and decided I wanted revenge on the girl for being a dick to me so I broke up with my boyfriend ( I held him back anyways, he deserves way better then a dumpster fire like me) and I hooked up with him while she was pregnant and behind her back and threw it in her face and then laughed at the tiktoks of her balling her eyes. I know I'm horrible, I really wasn't thinking right, I was kinda off the rails and sick of feeling like everyone gets to shit on me and have no repercussions, if I could go back in time I would have never met up with him. I didn't want to get back together but I ended up hooking up with him long enough that we did (the sex is the best I've ever had for some reason and he really makes me feel safe because of being there for the stuff with my dad). Getting back together with him made all my friends drop me, they were already mad at me for being too depressed and reclused for awhile.I was an ass to him though, constantly mad about him even being with a girl that was so cruel to other girls like that (even though I kinda was cruel to her by taking him back for revenge for all the shit she did to me). We were once again miserable together but I had quite my other job and now we were miserable and broke. my mom got us a job together and we started to work and save up for an apartment (I'm good at saving, he blew my money and his). I ended up having to borrow the money from my grandma for first and last ($3000, which I still have to pay her back for) I was also the only one allowed on the lease because of my good credit score and before we moved in, while I was working over time, he was looking at the girls onlyfans. Turns out he used his first paycheck to subscribe and look at her shit. It was a big blow up fight and he told me he only wanted to see if she was posting their videos they made together. We already had the apartment lined up so I forgave him and told him to just be honest with me and to never do it again. By that point I was so angry and resentful towards him, I was miserable everyday. He refused to cuddle with me or be affectionate with me at all or even have sex with me. I started becoming an angry violent alcoholic and we started to go at each other. I fucked his teeth up and he left me all bruised up. Our apartment was disgusting, he never helped me clean or cook or do laundry, he just played videogames and ignored me. He also brought his dog that he got with him and that girl together to our apartment and it wasn't house trained so it peed on everything. The dog peed on the couch I bought so much that I had to pay to throw it out. It peed on my Tv remote, laptop, bed and pillows, like literally everything. I dislike dogs because my parents would get aggressive rescues when I was a child that would attack me and I grew up to find them loud, obnoxious, and gross. I was the only one cleaning up after his dog. I found him on onlyfans again buying a bunch of girls content when he couldn't pay his phone bill that was in my name since he had no credit to get a new phone ( I got him a brand new phone and a phone plan), and he was even short on rent most of the time. He literally would beg them to meet up and everything. I was officially numb and done. I tried for a whole week to break up with him sobbing and begging for me not too, he begged me to give him one more month and I agreed. But then his dad died. I was such a a cunt to him though when his dad was dying because of the onlyfans stuff and I dislike dogs and his mom has 13 dogs and her house is covered in piss, shit, dirt, and dog hair. The dogs literally pee on everything. So I tried to support him from a distance, even though I drove him to the hospital and made sure to buy his dad blanket and slippers and soup when he couldn't eat the hospital food. But when it came time for us to wait out his death at his mom's place, I really didn't want to be there for him. I wanted to be able to come during the day but then spend the night at my parents place which was 10 minutes away. But he made me stay and we fought a lot. After his dad past, since we took so much time to take care of him we ended up losing our jobs. I instantly applied for welfare to make sure we could still pay rent, he on the other hand didn't. So I had to borrow money from my mom to pay his half of the rent. I also had to start going to the food bank and he refused to come with me even though I was anxious. I had to make him apply for welfare to help me because he refused to let me have my friends move in for us to be able to pay rent. Eventually I had enough and broke up with him and instantly hopped into a new relationship. I spent the whole month away from him anxious and feeling like shit, he was absolutely miserable and missed me and called me crying everyday. I ended up finding out I was pregnant with his kid (break up sex üôÑ) and so I got back together with him and ended up  misscarry on Valentine's day, which was not my worst Valentines day lmao. But since getting back together he's made major improvements and swears on his life he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and I hates himself everyday for what he did to me. He has made major improvements but now I'm so broken and fucked up, I've become just like him when he was treating me like garbage. We had to move into his mom's place since my dad started doing meth again and I have another restraining order against my dad. I just feel triggered constantly at his mom's place. So should I even bother staying with him at this point? He has changed a lot, but now I'm extremely toxic and miserable. I don't know anymore if I'm dumb for believing him still and if I should just get a backbone and leave for good?",1714374244.0,False,1,5,constellationcapra,None,1cfsqxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cfsqxh/should_i_stay_in_my_messy_relationship/
214,I don't know why I have BPD,"this is very long and i dont expect anyone to read it, its basically a breakdown of my life and how i went from a good little christian kid to whatever the fuck is going on with my life now
my bpd confuses me. I've always joked that I've was born with a broken heart because during my childhood, I can't really remember anything traumatic happening to me and I had a good home life, yet I loved sad music and I remember being very young, like 3-4 and praying to God (I was just raised religious and I am a trans man and those things did not mix well even though I didn't realize my gender identity was the cause of a lot of unrecognized dysphoria that I thought was just due to the fact that I was chubby until I was a Junior in high school) to take me to heaven now whenever I got yelled at. In middle school I always felt left out and inadequate. In high school, I was not popular and was never once pursued romantically or had reciprocated feelings for any of my classmates. And although I wasn't bullied, my roommate (religious boarding school)freshman often snuck out of our room to go hang out with our other friend and I remember spending nights crying and wondering why I wasn't enough for her. I started experiencing depressive episodes during the winter and during my sophomore year I tried to seek help because it wasn't going away during the spring this time and was met with a ""you seem fine you've got that real Jesus joy in your heart"". and then junior year I went into a depressive episode that hasn't really seemed to lift completely to this day. I cut myself daily and isolated myself a lot and started gaining weight, something that I hated because I was already overweight and hated my body. I remember praying and crying and wondering why I was feeling like this and why this was happening to me. I viewed myself as lazy, worthless, unloveable, and a complete failure at the ripe age of 17. I lost my faith, my ambitions, everything. I also realized that I was bisexual and trans and this further worsened the depression because I knew my parents would not approve. I was hiding everything from them and trying to hold myself together and ""cure"" myself by using a horrible system of cutting myself for not completing chores/homework that I needed to complete but had 0 motivation or energy to do. I wanted to take my life, but before I could work up the nerve to I opened up to my parents about how I was feeling about everything about the LGBT stuff. they got me an online Christian counselor who helped but I was still dealing with the LGBT aspects of my issues because I was afraid of being kicked out of my school or being sent to conversion therapy. I knew I couldn't deny these aspects of my identity because I knew they were things that I couldn't change, the problem was that every single person in my life was, although most not aggressively, homophobic and transphobic. I saw a light of sorts at the end of the tunnel at graduation, and I figured if I could just make it out of high school and shatter the glass ceiling on my current life, then everything would be better. Senior year I took Lexapro and it didn't really seem to help, but I continued to take it. Unfortunately I gained more weight because of binge eating and was around 240lbs, not that much but I was easily one of the largest people in my school. I had an online girlfriend who told me she loved me and then later said she never meant it when we broke up. I started smoking cigarettes and weed and spent a lot of my time alone because half of the time when I tried to hang out with anyone I felt like I didn't really belong. I felt like a lot like I was on the outside of my own life and looking in. At this point I was also very bad and still am at taking care of myself, which I am very embarrassed about and am working on. I didn't shower as much as I should, I woke up with only 5 minutes to get to class, and really just kind of blundered through life because I was using all my energy on just keeping myself alive. Finally, I graduated, and things looked like they were getting better. I came out to my parents, and my previous good relationship with them tanked. things were weird, they acted like I was this whole new person but I still felt like I was just me. This hurt because of the obvious disapproval of the true me, in identity and opinions and personal values. this is still a source of contention with my dad mostly but I've learned to just tolerate his unacceptance of my gender identity. I felt alone and ostracized in my own house and college was the way I finally began to branch out into the real world. I met my best friend, began smoking weed daily which I think has proven mostly beneficial to me but I will not deny this may be problematic as well. I hung out with my new friend and then her friends who have become most of my current social circle daily and was never in the house. I took a break from college which turned into dropping out because I was changing career paths and found my passion in dog grooming, which was great. as I worked and had money to spend though, problems began arising. at this point I had started to feel somewhat out of control of myself, staying up too late before working in the morning, starting to do party drugs occasionally like Ecstasy, ect. while at home feeling like I was stuck in the past. I noticed that when I was out with my friends and living my own life, I was happy and although erratic and overly sensitive to feeling the need to belong and be inlcluded in everything, but as soon as i stepped foot through the door of my house i could feel my mood start to tank. I only even slept on nights when i worked in the morning. I felt the need to be able to do everything with my new friends and keep up, and i deeply needed them to like me. I was still unhappy with my weight, although beginning to like my appearance as i was able to present as my true gender. I am a hopeless romantic and have always wanted to settle down and get married. I had a lot of trouble finding love and felt unnattractive and undesirable. I also spent my money impulsively and was often broke and struggled to make it through a week on a part time paycheck. Because i spent so much time away from home and didn't have much money, I often skipped meals in favor of a pack of cigs or whatever random thing i was focused on. Because i was eating less and stiffled my appetite with cigarettes, i started to notice a loss of weight. I have never been athletic and especially now since i ran myself ragged constantly socializing or working, I've never consistently worked out or really seen any weight loss. So I started to skip meals on purpose occasionally and not just to save money. I desperately wanted to be skinny, something I've never been. It didnt get to be a problem until later when i really started to drop weight. First though, in late 2018 I met my current boyfriend and although it's only been about a year and a half, I'm certain he's the love of my life, and he feels the same. However, with all good things there are problems. He had a rough childhood and because of it has a lot of very difficult mental problems himself. At this point, i had stopped taking my meds after beginning walbutrin to combat how dull lexapro made me feel emotionally at times. I didnt like how irritable it made me and i barely remembered to take my meds anyways, and i was feeling elated with a new relationship and thought it was a good idea. i don't regret it because although i spiralled into a depression enough to admit myself to a hospital for a short while. They diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which didnt really seem to fit right since the hospital seemed to diagnose everyone with some kind of bipolar disorder and gave everyone abilify, the worst medication i have ever taken. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, B, was going through one of the worst mental health years of his life, and I tried to support him the best that I could. I definitely tended to ignore my own needs to help his objectively much more serious issues. I was also doing more drugs and just got a promotion from bather to groomer and had to transfer to a new store. I was very close to my coworkers at my first store but i didnt fit in with the other salon workers at the new location. I was feeling very out of touch with my social circle and extremely stressed out. Then one day, B had a very bad dissociative episode and didn't recognize me. I felt completely useless and pointless, especially since that morning I had also slept through my alarm for work; again. I remeber bursting into tears before getting my best friend, who i now lived with, to comfort B because I all I could think to do run. I then left the house and got into my car fall apart. I noticed Bs nightmare medication and zoloft, and without a second thought downed the entire bottle of prazosin and drove to a park. I then swallowed a handful of zoloft for good measure before i got a call from my best friend. When i got back to the house (god knows how i didnt wreck my car because i was definitely starting to feel the effects) They knew what was up immediately and then I was hospitalized for a second time, only a month after the first visit. Before my first hospital visit, I discovered one of my worst vices: cocaine. While i enjoyed other drugs, not counting weed, I didn't really care to seek them out on my own. But i fell in love with coke. i loved the way it made me feel physically, and finally the persistent exhaustion of being alive lifted and i felt like i could actually focus on something long enough to accomplish it. I was a nasty habit that gave me panic attacks, made me somehow even broker, and by the end of it I had gone from 240lbs to 160lbs since it made not eating even easier. I was also even more tired and irritated constantly. Thankfully my best friend had dealt with an eating disorder in highschool and called me out and helped me start eating better again. And then B and I tried meth. It was amazing, but it was also the fucking worst. We only did it twice, and the first time I personally only had a long, irritating comedown, but B dissociated so hard he thought he was 16 again for 3 days. The next time we did it i started to see things and have panic attacks at the thought of having to go to work in the morning. I called into work and that day we broke up because I wanted to get clean and he didn't. The next day we talked when we were clear headed we got back together, him now ready to quit too. I'm incredibly lucky that we got out when we did from meth because it would have destroyed us. Its something i still fear that I'll relapse into again, even though i dont really miss it except when I'm feeling especially dead inside. I told my mom about my drug use and this prompted a visit to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with BPD. It's nice to finally find a diagnosis that seemed to actually fit. I'm doing better right now, relatively. I found a medication that actually works, thank god for trileptal, B and I are mostly sober, the hardest thing we do now is acid every now and then, and we still smoke, just probably too much now. I've started DBT but had to stop because i got a new job and it didn't fit into my schedule, but now im on job number 3 of 2020 and its much more loosely scheduled so i can actually focus on my mental health for once in my life.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask is I don't understand still why I have BPD. Everyone talks about how childhood trauama can ""cause"" it, and I know depression runs in the family, but not BPD. I come from a stable home where I was loved, although not really accepted but that wasn't until later on after my mental health started tanking. I feel guilty about it, and I can't help but think that I took a start for a good life and just shit all over it. I feel like such a family disappointment and I feel like im going to be stuck on this random, emotional rollercoaster forever and I'll just continue to destroy every good thing in my life. If i could pinpoint it to anything, I would think my roommate in freshman year sneaking out of our room might have been the start of the extreme fear of abandonment, but that seems like such a stupid, not traumatic or abusive at all thing to have caused me to go from who I was before, someone i can barely even remember what they were even like in terms of personality, to the dumpster fire ive become. Maybe theres some repressed memory of something happening to me, because I get asked if I was ever sexually assualted a lot, but I have no memory of anything like that ever happening and while I don't have a problem having sex mentally my body just doesn't seem to react that well to anyone other than myself. Maybe my brain chemistry is just that fucked that sometime as simple as a friend hanging out with someone else sometimes set it off. I just want to get to the root of the issue, any insight or if y'all also just want to spill your entire life story onto the internet feel free and I'll listen to you. Take care guys
