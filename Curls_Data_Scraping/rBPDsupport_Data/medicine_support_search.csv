0,What medicine helps the most with splits?,"I know not all people with BPD get any help from meds at all, but for those who do, what meds have helped you with your splits and mood swings the most? Iâ€™m currently taking Lamotrigine, and while itâ€™s making me a bit less â€˜generallyâ€™ depressed, I still have extreme splits. Most anti depressants unfortunately make me nauseous

1,Meds?,"Iâ€™m interested in what kind of medicine other BPDS are getting. I have on the highest dose of lamacital but was recently taken off because it stopped working for me and I kept SH. I got switched to olanzapine and propanol? I am also on seroquel. 

I never tried to olanzapine? Anyone tried it? 

Any other recommendations?",1701721715.0,False,2,1,Decent-Taro-8212,None,18atggj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18atggj/meds/

3,I've been struggling with splitting,"What are things you guys do to deal with the perceived pain/hurt when it gets too intense to think straight enough for coping mechanisms?? Any easy techniques that require less thought, effort or focus might work in this situation? I hate feeling like I have no control over my feelings. It feels awkward and embarrassing and I don't want to hurt anyone either. I do take medicine but right now it's only helping so much and I am very new to therapy still.",1694734291.0,False,2,2,DiMiTriDreams420,None,16ixhgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/16ixhgk/ive_been_struggling_with_splitting/
4,I feel like no one likes me,I feel like my friends like my gf more than me. They shower her with compliments and I feel left out ðŸ˜ž . feel like my gf doesnâ€™t love me and sheâ€™s just with me out of obligation bc I have nowhere else to go ðŸ˜ž. sheâ€™s my FP and claims Iâ€™m hers but idk I feel so shitty sometimes I sometimes split and say harsh things when Iâ€™m really upset .Iâ€™m just now realizing I most likely have bpd due to an abusive childhood and I think I also have rejection dysphoria .I  am on medicine and seeing a therapist and my therapist agrees that I might have bpd. My gf is going to attend my next therapy session with me so I hope that goes well .  We are both educating ourselves on bpd.,1700449763.0,False,6,1,esmeigh,None,17zetnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17zetnc/i_feel_like_no_one_likes_me/
5,A year since my grippy socks trip and I'm feeling the void coming back,"Things have been an overall good year. I got through the winter and I was coping. Medicine helps but now I feel lost without a routine. 
I'm coming to realize again I'm going to need a new therapist, someone who is actually available often and within my price range. It's just really hard to keep starting over. 
I've been in a relationship for almost 6 years now. He's so wonderful despite how much we both deal with. I'm tired of hurting both of us and I don't know what to do to basically ""get better"".

I don't know what support I'm looking for. I guess to know someone has felt like me and has gotten through it.",1690258245.0,False,4,1,thisisntannabel,None,158x973,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/158x973/a_year_since_my_grippy_socks_trip_and_im_feeling/
6,Iâ€™m in so much emotional pin right now- I canâ€™t move,"Iâ€™m going through a divorce. Iâ€™ve been off my medication for the last month due to things out of my control. My husband and I separated last may but I was able to distract my dumb self with a shiny new situation-ship. I knew better but I couldnâ€™t help myself. The situation ships seems like it might be fading away and Iâ€™m beside myself. I donâ€™t know if heâ€™s actually pulling away or is genuinely busy. Iâ€™m also realizing that I was putting off grieving my marriage and now it feels like the walls are crumbling. 

Iâ€™m lost inside my feelings. I canâ€™t stop crying or being upset. It hurts so, my feelings are so deep and consuming. I feel nauseous and dizzy. All I can do is lay in bed. I canâ€™t eat, sleep or think straight. Im not going to hurt myself but the thoughts are there. Iâ€™m in hell, I want it to end right now so badly. 

I reached out to my family and theyâ€™re helping me get more medicine but it will take weeks before it kicks in. 

I had my BPD under control for years but after deciding to leave my husband it was likeâ€¦.gloves off. I havenâ€™t had this extreme intense negative feelings in such a long time. I was on such a high this last month with my mania and distractions but now Iâ€™ve crashed. 

What am I supposed to do? ðŸ’”",1693780479.0,False,1,1,Valued_Employee,None,169ajst,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/169ajst/im_in_so_much_emotional_pin_right_now_i_cant_move/
7,"Does anybody else experience â€˜dropâ€™s? Kinda like In kink, I just need to vent sorry )","Iâ€™m almost 29 years old and I just realized something. I think I drop, similar to when a sub drops in kink, whenever something bad happens, but also when something good happens. It affects me for days and itâ€™s like a cold except I just canâ€™t bring myself to smile, socialize, or to stop crying 24/7. Iâ€™ve been seeing someone recently and even though there was aftercare, Iâ€™m still crying and unable to eat three days later. Iâ€™m realizing this has happened so many times in my past itâ€™s insane. I also canâ€™t tell if this is from having to slightly withdraw from one of my meds, the script got miswritten then the pharmacist explained to me I had been taking double on a medicine before that I didnâ€™t need to... an expensive one at that. So now Iâ€™m on half the dose of bupropion and Iâ€™m starting to feel that kind of raw, lacking second skin kind of anxiety I havenâ€™t felt in a long time. 

I canâ€™t afford therapy right now and I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about this so here I am....",1588993604.0,False,2,1,throwaway199161,None,gg7li7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gg7li7/does_anybody_else_experience_drops_kinda_like_in/
