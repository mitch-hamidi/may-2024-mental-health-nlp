1,MacLean Hospital is supposed to be the best. There is also Clearview in California and Timberline Knolls in Illinois.  Hope you have good insurance.  I was in the first two.  I would say they are not worth the $$.  IOP is just as good.,pricklycoconut,3rcvcr

0,"You can buy Marsha Linehans book and do it yourself. DBT isn't difficult, and it works well with a combination of CBT. Lots of free resources for that. Both of these you can practice alone.

DBT is simply about radical acceptance. Such a disappointingly simple but difficult goal. It doesn't cost 40k to work with it. 

If you need a detox program you can find one.",BettySwollocks45,18vug3n

2,"It's a traumatising illness. You can have DBT, and for many, it helps manage ideations, emotional distress, emotional outbursts, and many other symptoms. It's not a case if you are cured. As humans, we rise, we fall, and fall many times, getting back up again with some sort of resilience. It's a very misunderstood disorder, and many form inaccurate judgments on bpd, which reinforce shame amongst us who suffer the daily pain and misery of sensitively and disregulated emotions. We only have ourselves to believe that we are not our mental health only. We are much more beyond that. We are deserving of love , compassion, and understanding. If loved ones can not tolerate us at our worst, then that is their choice. You learn the art of knowing that despite the negative traits/symptoms of bpd, it's a double-edged sword, we feel intensely, we love deeply, for we have lots to offer also, we aren't immune to LOVE, to be loved! It's important that we do not believe negative perceptions of us of this disorder that can increase our suffering. We have to create a loving relationship with ourselves. We can not rely on others for that. It is a difficult rd, one that is relentlessly trying, one that makes you feel very alone. Again, we can not rely on others' approval or acceptance. It's the patience, love, care, forgiveness, and  tolerance of ourselves that lesson suffering. 
                 It is dam well hard. Please be KIND and gentle to yourselves! üôè",,1blvdvy

7,"I'd suggest looking into DBT and CBT techniques, as well as grounding exercises. They can be super useful for managing stress and emotions.

The thing that actually helped me while practicing CBT and DBT is keeping myself busy, especially with the right and most beneficial things:

Consider trying out different hobbbies, even if you think you might lose interest in them later on. You can always try something new.

Try working out, or just joining classes like Pilates or spinning once a week at first .

Something i can also suggest is taking free online courses on topics that pique your curiosity can be incredibly rewarding and can be added to your CV.

One thing i do personally is that I make it a point to research any topic that catches my attention or that I'm not well-informed about. It could be as simple as looking up word definitions or diving into a whole study on a planet i once heard about in a tiktok video .

And when it comes to doing things solo, I recommend giving it a shot. Eating out alone can be a surprisingly enjoyable experience.

Pet sitting can also be a nice experience.

I hope this helps..

1,"I am currently having a similar thing happening. First appointment he‚Äôs confident enough to tell me I have quiet/high functioning bpd. Talks to me about DBT therapy and all. Next appointment I feel super invalidated he tells me I could do dbt by myself cause I‚Äôm high functioning and I end up feeling super invalidated through the entire appointment. He did refer me for a social worker that follows you at home and first time they came they made me feel better. On the reference paper it said : light bpd. They told me that there is no such thing and the fact that I‚Äôm high functioning and I seem like I got my shit together doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt have it or that I can just deal with it all by myself. They were really encouraging and made me feel like it was ok and that being quiet bpd doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have it. I think for psychiatrists we are like ‚Äò‚Äôeasier‚Äô‚Äô patients if they compare us to other types of personality disorder or intense bpd so for us it probably sound a bit invalidating. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for the services they offer, but I do understand how you feel as I am currently living something similar and it made me question everything so much.

1,"Also, this was for me personally when I was your age. I'd make a lot of dicey sexual decisions and my bpd, being neglected and abused as a child up untill my late teens played a huge role in making bad decisions that I didn't even want to make. I hurt more people than I am proud of, and I didn't even want to sleep with them or hook up with them. 

What worked for me was trying to make it as not about sex as possible. I think being this way makes things feel like it is a lot more than what reality is. And that included sex for me.

I was just making very bad decisions... And as much as other people had their role and responsibility in it. I am responsible for choosing poorly and making bad decisions. Whether I have bpd or not.

0,"I don‚Äôt know much about DID, but this is the advice I‚Äôd give for BPD alone. 

The big question for me is whether your loved one is in treatment or open to treatment. BPD is a personality disorder that is indicated by having at least 5/9 symptoms listed in the DSM. With treatment, you absolutely CAN reduce your symptoms to have less than 5, meaning you no longer qualify. The work is difficult, dialectical behavioral therapy is what I did and I still have to practice every day, but it‚Äôs 100% worth it.

I'm no expert here or anything, so please never quote me.
Nobody can be properly diagnosed unless being willing to be 100% honest with a psychiatrist (not councilor, therapist, psychologist)
I understand what mourning the relationship is because to this day I feel it. 
What I've discovered recently (before you dm'd me) is that you can attempt to resolve troubles within a close relationship but as long as the other party isn't in page, things could get worse. So please don't pressure anyone for both you and the party involved could become more guarded and resentful. 
Being BPD is very hard to recognize or even come to terms with. I sure as hell know it fucking was for me!
If you suspect your mother has this affliction....honestly, just like myself and probably everyone with mental illness....it will take time to acknowledge and accept. 
To tell you the truth ilovekittty, I'm pretty sure that my father suffers from bpd as well (this disorder is usually passed down the gene pool) 
...shit I derailed myself so bad, I just deleted like an hr offrail blabbering....lol
But if you suspect your mother of having bpd or npd...it it quite likely due to what you have witnessed and experienced. From experience....don't go up to her and say, ""you have bpd or npd."" ....it will only make her feel defensive....(I'm diagnosed and recognize my bpd but if someone confronted me  saying this is what you are"" I'd put all aggressive walls up immediately....without even the intention of doing so.
....I guess where I'm trying to get at is, if you suspect that your mother has bod or npd, be gentle. For both of these disorders confrontation will only make things worse. Maybe try to make it more about yourself than who you are trying to help. (I know that sounds fucked up but....people with these disorders are smart people (believe it or not) if the person you're trying to help is coming to a possible solution.

The thing about lithium is that it can cause hormonal acne, which means the only thing that can really target it is prescribed medication. 

Furthermore, lithium breakouts and skin issues tend to last 6 months- 1 year as your body adjusts. You‚Äôll want stronger, longer lasting methods to deal with your skin. 

Book an appointment with your dermatologist and take pictures of your skin when breaking out. They can prescribe something that will treat the issue at a level that over the counter cleansers and face masks just cannot. ",ooooq4,b4wron
1,"I started to break out because it made my skin super dry. I'd suggest to start washing with a soap like Cetaphil or CeraVe, also if Neutrogena has a natural line that works amazing (at least for me). Use a lotion that's for normal to dry, vs just dry, because mine got greasy as well. Lithium is weird because it made my skin dry, but if I got too carried away my skin got greasy. Lol

As for the make up, go ahead! I used a moisturizing primer before putting on any kind of foundation. Don't get discouraged though, if your face still breaks out or doesn't get better. Some makeup (especially foundation) still made my skin dry and I broke out. Just experiment with different types. And remember to wash your face before you put your make up on and when you take it off. Also wash your make up brushes often.

Appointments suck I feel you. Plus the derm is never cheap. But my self esteem plummeted with lithium because of the breakouts. The prescribed medication was the only thing mitigating them enough for me to keep taking lithium. 

The breakouts associated with lithium can be more long term (6-24 months, mine was 2 years) hence why I drove home the whole idea of making an appointment now since it can take awhile to get into seeing a dermatologist. 

Feel free to dm me to get info on any of the prescribed topical medication I used and their copay cost. Or just about anything else skin related and lithium related.

1,"BPD is a sadly stigmatized disorder, and it's disappointing that professional bias is a real thing.

If you're struggling with PTSD symptoms like flashbacks and dissociation, EMDR could be a highly effective treatment. One challenge in treating BPD for someone who has post trauma responses is ""staying present"" during treatment; trauma therapy like EMDR usually includes practicing skills specifically to help that.",TranZeitgeist,fu914t
2,"Usually for people with BPD the best course of action is to do DBT and get to a stable place and then do EDMR or other trauma work if its applicable (it sounds like it is). DBT is kinda like crisis management skills so you can tolerate the every day, and once you get that under control it's much easier to work on the less fun stuff. Doing any kind of work with trauma isn't something you want to start if you aren't at a stable place because it's a really difficult process and it can bring up old wounds and make you worse before it makes you better. You want to be able to cope with that before you bring it all up. 

I'm sorry that your therapists are being difficult. It's so frustrating how stigmatized BPD is unfortunatley. I don't know if your diagnosis is already officially on your file, if it's not, it may be prudent to delay mentioning BPD until a few sessions into treatment. Therapists without much  experience often have stereotyped images of a disaster client when they hear borderline. And honestly it may be best to look for a therapist without such views. As much as it sucks to be turned away by therapists, if someone thinks they wont be able to treat you properly, them not treating you is in your best interest.   

If you can, look for a therapist that does DBT because more than likely they will be willing and used to dealing with patients with BPD. A therapist with a trauma background is also ideal, and they usually go hand in hand.",,fu914t

1,"For me, it helped to have a diagnosis because I always knew something was very wrong with me but didn't have the vocabulary to describe the terrifying happenings of my brain. However, for the most part, a lot of therapy for mental illnesses is all very similar and uses similar techniques. Even neurotypical people respond well and have better lives when learning DBT techniques and mindfulness, for example. You might hear people mention the DBT workbook by Marsha Linehan. Whether you get diagnosed or not, I reccomend trying it out, because it has some good skills in it for basically anyone and is very helpful for people with DBT specifically. Mindfulness meditation is also very helpful, although keep in in mid that you don't have to meditate to be mindful. It can be a practice you have as you go about your idea. It's a state of mind, and can be very elusive, but it's easier to start with meditations. Body scans are especially good provided you don't have chronic pain. Hope this helps! Remember, you're the same person you always were, and there are many people with BPD who go on to love happy lives. In fact, some psychologists think that BOD may be an unborn sensitivity to others emotions and actions that can be a skill when you develop it in a positive environment. There's a possibility that the reason it effects people negatively is because they may never be taught to use it in positive ways or because they experience trauma that ""activates"" it in a negative way. There are positives to any mental illness, even though they don't outweigh the negative parts. In people with BPD, we tend to be more creative, sensitive, and empathetic, although it's different for everyone.

1,"First of all, it's important to recognise that there is a huge difference between symptom-free and being well enough to live a life where your symptoms are manageable and you can be happy. Forget the thirty years and focus on this year - what is affecting you the most right now? Take that to therapy, take the meds, and try to keep you mind on now. Mindfulness can be helpful with this - there are loads of free resources on YouTube as well as apps like Headspace.

Secondly, it's very difficult (and I would say unethical personally) to put a number on recovery. Different people respond differently to treatment and some people commit to therapy and making changes more than others. You could speak to a different medical professional and get a very different answer. That's not saying that you shouldn't listen to your psych, *you absolutely should follow their advice*, but don't let that number stop you from committing to treatment or give up hope because of it.

0,"I don't know that either of these 2 points will bring you real comfort but

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

3,"Hi, Thank you for your thoughtful reply. 

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out.

1,"""NHS"" stands for ""National Don't Ask Don't Get Help Service"" (somehow). You have to find out exactly how the system works for your particular problem you're experiencing in your area. What's the process? Who runs that step in the process? Where are they located? What criteria do they expect me to meet to be eligible?

Then you need to ask and ask and ask until you get what you asked for. Particularly so for mental health.

GPs are generalists. They know a little about everything. One thing they know very little about, even those who say they're mental health experts, is borderline (aka emotionally unstable) personality disorder. Part of the reason for this is that the behavioural traits are so often hidden to everyone but a small group of close friends and relatives or the person's partner that it would never be evident to a stranger in a public setting.

In many NHS trusts the people you want a referral to are the ""complex needs service"". Find out if you have a version of that. If you're desperate for an official diagnosis that can usually only be issued by a psychiatrist and in some cases a clinical psychologist. Research the difference between the two. To make out how to make the process work for you you have to understand the process.

It is a highly narcissistic way of thinking. It isn't correct and the person saying that lacks empathy or can't deal with THEIR emotions. Please understand that. You are not incorrect.

In my case the person who was telling me these things I kept trying to explain to her that the more she pushed the further locked in my mental crisis prison I would get. It was horrible. I empathize so much with your pain and anger and self hatred. I tried and tried to change myself that way and its exhausting and soul crushing. 

From your post it sounds like your mom is very mentally damaging for you to be around. Is there a reason you are stuck being around her? Is there any way you can get out or away from her influence? You clearly have a lot of pain to process and this is only  making it worse. She probably will not listen to you. 


In my case the only thing that soothed that intense self loathing was that, miracle of miracles, the person who was pushing and gaslighting me ended up validating the harm they did to me apologizing and reaffirming that I did not deserve it (up to that point they insisted I deserved it). I have been locked in cycles with her for a long time. And the way out was that I swallowed my pride and apologized and took responsibility for the damage I had done her, and listened to her even though I didn't agree with her perspective, and she actually opened up about how much my behavior hurt her or just the pain she was feeling, and then I was able to follow that up by sharing the same, how much her behavior had impacted me. We still have to separate to heal and protect ourselves but I have never felt ANYTHING like that moment of validation. It showed me how powerfully mind destroying gaslighting is to someone with a vulnerable mind. I began to imagine what it would be like to be around people who did not gaslight me at all, even if I was simply alone. I imagined how different life might feel. 

It inspired me to decide with a heavy heart I have to cut off contact further with my parents if they keep gaslighting me and leave a job that is confusing where I have bad boundaries.
 I have thought I can tolerate it and explain or just put my feelings aside. But there will come a breakthrough point when you realize how much your peace matters and that nothing in the world is worth mental chaos because it will destroy your soul and everyone around you will be affected. 

All that is to say I hope you can find a way to unentangle from your mom even if you still care or love her. Don't be surprised if things begin to feel a lot different. The stuff you are saying here is very heavy and dangerous. That amount of shame and self blame will eat you alive. It isn't that you have BPD and are bad as much as your BPD may be allowing you to emotionally stay in a destructive situation. 

All the best to you.",oisin_berry,ul6h66
3,"thank you so much. Im really happy that you‚Äôre doing much better now that you have zero contact. i wish i could leave too but she relies on me for so much. i help pay her bills and she‚Äôs threatened to kill herself before. and i never realized how messed up it is until now. and you‚Äôre right she did emotionally neglect me my whole life. 
i‚Äôm just gonna try to cut back on speaking about any of my issues to her until we‚Äôre in the presence of a mediator like a therapist because i don‚Äôt see the value in communicating with her anymore. everything i say to her is ‚Äúmanipulation.‚Äù i‚Äôm going to focus on staying productive and healthy as much as i can. thanks again!",ImpossibleBicycle249,ul6h66
4,"Oh no this is very clear now that you shared this information. It sounds like you are in a mind trap where she is able to exploit your guilt and shame to make you useful for herself as she probably can't face her own inability to care for herself.  

I also struggle with oversharing my issues with unfit people, an early childhood pattern. That you can recognize it is a great step. Maybe you can find another outlet or somewhere to receive validation as it seems you are experiencing a strong amount of manipulation and gaslighting yourself from her and she is projecting. If you are paying her bills and she is threatening to kill herself if you leave that is an abusive domestic situation and you may need more serious help to extract yourself don't take it lightly. There are domestic violence shelters and places that could help you begin the process when and if you are ready. 

You got this and deserve to experience a more free life no matter what you have done! Sometimes we can't help people we love except by helping ourselves.

You can have compassion for your mom and what she's been through and still choose to save yourself. It may be the hardest thing you ever have to do but remember there are people out here who can help and give you love and support. You are never as alone as you think.",oisin_berry,ul6h66
5,"thank you for your comments. i think its really good to hear from an outside perspective because i've been getting gaslighted so much to the point where i have no idea what is real and what isn't.  she's never made ""actual threats of suicide"" its always been said lightly as a joke but somehow that makes it worse because its hard to tell if she's being serious or not. Im not sure what to do but i just want to thank you again for your comments because somehow it feels like you've opened a door in my mind. your comments were validating and actually made me feel like a real person. I rarely feel like that so thank you, truly. I managed to get an appointment tomorrow to speak with a psychotherapist, she deals with BPD and family conflict so I pray she helps.  I want to help myself.  

I wish you the best as well.",ImpossibleBicycle249,ul6h66
6,"Ah I see, and yes I understand what that loss of reality is like. Its disorienting. 
Im really glad something clicked. Getting validation and feeling like a real human is more powerful than we might give it credit. 
Good luck with the appointment its so great you found some help!",oisin_berry,ul6h66
0,"Hello, are you me a few years ago?


It sounds like you are torn between pleasing your mother and pleasing yourself and that you are perhaps looking for affirmation from your husband as to who to please? Which is understandable.


I would do the thing that brings you joy.


My mother has constantly undermined me and my choices in life.
She says that one of her biggest regrets in life is not 'pushing' me hard enough at school. This is fucked up on quite a few levels. I dropped out of school before my GCSEs because I had the first of many breakdowns.


Throughout my life so far I have tried to please her by being 'academic' and failed and hated myself because I wasn't meeting her expectations. Instead I pursued art and I have done well in that which has culminated in me graduating with a First class degree with honors and I have been offered a teaching assistant position on my degree course.


Yes, this is not something I will make megabucks with but it brings me joy, because of my confidence and joy in what I do with my life it has allowed me to seek opportunities and branch out into things related to my degree that I also enjoy.


You should have seen her disappointment when I told her I was thinking of doing a painting and decorating course this summer. She doesn't seem to care about my actual happiness and seems more concerned about her ability to brag to the rest of the family about me.


So in short, disconnect from your mother's toxic and broken view of life. Talk to your husband about how you would like more positive affirmation about life choices because it's important to you that he's proud of you. Do what brings you joy, because happiness in my opinion is the only real end goal that matters in the world.


Sorry if I have rambled at you but this is something I feel I have personal experience with and I hope that I can give you guidance and help :)
