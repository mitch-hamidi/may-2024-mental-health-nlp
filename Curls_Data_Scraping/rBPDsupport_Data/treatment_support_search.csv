0,Experiences with RO-DBT vs traditional DBT for quiet BPD treatment,"I read a post on reddit that said that people with quiet BPD struggle to recover through traditional DBT and that RO-DBT can be more effective. However, when I research the differences between the two, I don't know which one would be most effective for me personally, so I would appreciate if people who have practiced RO-DBT shared their experience. If you've experienced traditional DBT as well, it'd be cool if you could explain how your experience with both compared and contrasted.",1687125296.0,False,3,0,hehim_vent_throwaway,None,14cwd38,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/14cwd38/experiences_with_rodbt_vs_traditional_dbt_for/

2,BPD w/ SUD,"1. I was diagnosed with BPD back in 2021 at the age of 32.
2. Tried to join a 52 week program on dialectical behavior therapy. The program was twice a week once for group & once for individual therapy. However, you had to be accepted into the program and at that time due to substance abuse, they felt the money spent (self pay) and active SUD I would not be a good candidate for their program. 
3. After that I found myself thinking well if I can’t even makes it into DBP then how the heck will their be any improvements. So fuck it! 
4. I have found been self isolating since given the news and not really put much into place with the expedition of medication management and meet with my psychiatrist once a month. 
5. I have not found self isolating to be such a bad thing till recently. Also, at the time mid Covid pandemic, and I submerged myself into continuing to grow my real estate brokerage. Business has been great! However, self love self care and therapy went to the back burner. In the meantime SUD has progressed. 
6. I am looking for a treatment center that has a detox and residential program that offers more of a deep dive into DBT but also allows for an hour or so each day before or after group to use my phone and computer. Dropping off the face of the earth when you are a small business owner is nearly impossible. Who is going to pay for the health insurance to stay in treatment? Often times the treatment is out of network or self pay so money needs to still come in. I have employees that are counting on me and their families. 
7. In my search for this type of facility it’s been very difficult some have been willing to accommodate but it’s going to be 4 in my search for this type of facility it’s been very difficult some have been willing to accommodate but it’s going to be $40,000 to $50,000 - others it’s an absolutely hard no - or they might offer the work accommodation but little or zero focus on DBT. 

Any suggestions on facilities to consider?

3,How can I help myself?,"First I want to apologize for the long post that you're about to read but I'm really losing my sanity at this point.

I (f 21) was dating a guy (20) for about two months, he was a virgin and I was his first ever , everything was going so so well , we are very compatible and I really liked him a lot and still do like him , he also liked me a lot , until..

Before we had sex for the first and last time ever he had talked to me about STDs and I told him that he has nothing to worry about because I have never had an STD , so two weeks later we have unprotected sex , and it was really really good , ten days later he started experiencing some symptoms like a burning sensation when he pees , white or clear discharge, his penis was red and swollen, and he was going crazy and he was very very anxious and scared (rightfully so) he went to a doctor and the doctor told him that it's probably gonorrhea and he told him to start with the medication that he prescribed to him after he got a test , the test came back negative, and I also did all the STDs tests and all of them came back negative as well . (For the record we are syrians and we live in syria , so we are very tight on money and the whole process of going to doctors and taking all the std tests was very dangerous because any kind of sexual activity before marriage is not okay here) .

This guy is now convinced that I gave him something and he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, and he keeps calling me reckless (which I know I am I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago but my parents refused to believe it and didn't get me medication or treatment) .

My problem is that I was also too ignorant to believe it (because mental health is not really a thing in Syria) and now I feel like I desperately want him to stay in my life because I didn't do anything wrong, and I feel like my world is collapsing, and I know that I need to go to therapy and get treatment but I don't have any money, therapy is very expensive here and I don't know how to cope anymore, I truly saw something in him , and I feel like shit for losing him as a friend and as a lover , I didn't want things to go that way at all , and I don't know what to do.",1715932579.0,False,1,0,Unfair_Solution_2317,None,1ctzrvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ctzrvj/how_can_i_help_myself/
4,Hey everybody Goodmorning! So what kind of therapy has helped you guys with Bpd? ,I was diagnosed with bpd about a year ago and my life has been very depressing up to this point. I make a lot of mistakes and I have disappointed a lot of people….. not to mention all the bridges I’ve burned. I want to change and I want to get better. After reading some stuff on the internet I was glad to see that Bpd can be more manageable or better yet “cured”. I just want to know what type of therapy and or other activities/ treatments worked for you guys.

5,Just got diagnosed.,"Hey guys. (Sorry for confusion I’m new here:))
I (24F) am in DBT outpatient treatment. Just finished 3 weeks of the PHP program. And now on IOP. Which is just 3 days a week for 3 hours a day. The PHP program was 9am-3pm Monday through Friday which I felt like I had a purpose and I was doing something. 
Anyways I guess what I need to let you all know is I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD when I was 16-17 after that went down a slippery slope of drugs (literally all of them) until I did acid at 20... and  thought I lost my freaking MIND lol (funny because having bpd you feel that way anyways) 
I always knew I was “off” or something. 
Fast forward 2 and a half years I was sober and fine.. so I thought. 
Here came the panic attacks, depression. Angry outbursts, quitting jobs, threatening to hurt myself. 
I knew I needed help or I was gonna go right back down the same bad road.
I found an (ACT) therapist that I’ve been seeing every Monday give or take for almost 2 years.. I think . I’ve also held down a job for a little over a year. At this job I had a breakdown that sent me to the doctors and that’s how I made it to the treatment center. I said all this to say now I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. .. idk what to do with that. 
Idk who that is but that’s not me. 
I have a loving boyfriend that doesn’t deserve to deal with all these emotions.

7,So i was diagnosed then undiagnosed,"A team of professionals assessed me for the duration of my psych ward stay (3ish weeks) and came to agree that I have quiet BPD (among CPTSD, Anxiety & depression ofc).

I was then in treatment with a psychologist/case manager after discharge who later told me quiet BPD isnt diagnosable and assessed that I dont in fact have BPD because apparently I'm not ""violent"" enough. 

But in later sessions he would go on to say things like ""thats very common in people with bpd"" & such, making me think that he might now believe i have BPD.

Would love some of y'all opinions and insight or advice if you have any.

8,need supplemental support,"hi all, this is my first post.

I have been in therapy for 10+ years, taken a DBT course, am on a mood stabilizer, and nothing seems to be helping.

Last night he told me I was not his foundation because he needs to spend the majority of his time taking care of me.

9,Family members ,"So my older brother had moved in with us a couple of months ago due to financial issues, keep in mind that I haven’t really talked to him in 25 years. We’ve had a very distant relationship due to my mother, which I’m realizing she’s the reason why us kids are so fucked up an mentally unstable. But when my brother was here he started confessing to me all these horrible things he has done, and one being that he used to poison my mom when he was younger cause she was so mean to him he says but he also mentioned that he used to hurt little animals so that way the animals would rely on him to fix them, he is 42 years old but has this petty mentality and if you do him wrong, he’s gonna get his revenge but make it more spicier than it should be. But I’m having a hard time with accepting the treatment I went through as a child the treatment I endured growing up, it’s not so much anything I did or have done where the guilt or shame is stemming from but it’s the way I was brought up, it’s the other peoples shame and guilt that has been stowed upon me from my own family. The people that were supposed to be close to me. After getting this bpd diagnosis I am finally having clarity over my life but I’m realizing that I need to let of things in the past, I need to build a relationship with myself, I want to fall in love with myself before I bring anyone else into my life, this diagnosis doesn’t define but it gives me a answer to why I am the way I am, but how I can help myself and build myself up to be that person I want be around, to be the change that I want to see in this world. Just because you have bpd it doesn’t mean you have to continue on with behaviors that you don’t like about yourself. Become aware of it and find a healthier solution to cope to express myself but implementing the solutions that are very uncomfortable to me because I didn’t like the person I was but now, now lol I’ve come so far an doing the inner work is paying off but I still have a very long way to go and quitting isn’t a option. Yes I have my meltdowns today was one of those days but I think what sparked it was having this crazy dream about my dad who isn’t here anymore and he passed away 6 years on April 22, 2018 an I to have this dream that I had, where I was being shown past memories of myself and where I’ve would’ve staying in abusing relationships an choose them because I want them to love me, I want them to stay, in this dream I choose myself on 3 different occasions with my dad an 2 of my exs, I choose myself and I walked away from all of these people with no hesitations. It makes me feel good that I’m able to see my hard work pay off. But also I just walked away from a codependent relationship in February so I am doing the things! I am trying to be the authentic version of myself but love myself during this time as well. I just wanted to share cause I don’t have anyone else to share it with. I really enjoy being alone now.

10,Should I stay in my messy relationship?,"I've been diagnosed with BPD since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and I've done a lot of different therapies for it. I thought I was getting better for the longest time because I thought I had my emotions and everything under control, especially in relationships. I've been seeing my boyfriend for roughly 2 years and I've noticed I've completely went off the rails. Any sense of emotional stability I've had before has completed disappeared. 2 years ago I was holding down a stable and really good paying job for 3 years and I think they liked me considering they trained me in every department and would always complement my work. I also had lots of friends and was very social, I even had friends that I was friends with for 9 years (there would be a few years in between where we wouldn't talk because of them moving or just different life pathways but always found our way back to each other). I also was in university and bought a car from the dealership and my credit score was really amazing too. I really felt like my life has direction at that point. That was until my dad got his second DUI and went into rehab and came out of rehab doing meth and completely flipping out. That's when I met my boyfriend. It was such a a rough time for me, I had to talk to the cops a lot and get a restraining order against my dad for awhile. My boyfriend was unlike anyone else I dated, he didn't try and force me to have sex and I waited awhile before hooking up with him, and even before we had hooked up he was there to support me through everything! I was so appreciative and really fell in love because I thought he was so compassionate. He had recently went through a break up so I had a sneaking suspicion I was a rebound and I just wanted to know where he and him stood. He promised me I wasn't a rebound and he hadn't talked to his ex for a few months. My BPD started flairing up and I went through his phone (I'm sorry I know it's bad but I developed this bad habit from my last ex being with him for a whole year and trusting him but seeing millions of girls messaging him till I finally had a hunch and checked and was mortified, I just didn't want to waste my time again) I found text messages between his friend and him saying that if he hooked up with me he'd basically be tunnel brothers with all his buddies (which is far from true, he thought I hooked up with both his friends but I only hooked up with his one other friend once when I was blackout at a party and I didn't even really want it to happen) it hurt my feelings to feel like he was talking about me like that to his friends and kinda made me feel like a whore. I ended up flipping and waking him up with a garbage bag full of his stuff and sent him home. We ended up talking it out and we started hanging again. But then whenever he got drunk, he'd call me his ex's name, and he called her and said he loved her and missed her. I was devastated once again, but now I felt like an easy rebound whore. So we once again fought and he convinced me it wasn't that way, just to go and hook up with her the one night I asked for space (he is extremely codependent). I was pissed and tried to convince myself I was done with him. But I'm stupid so I forgave him, I think I only did that because of all the trauma I was going through with my dad, I really wanted someone to be there for me and hold me and tell me everything was okay. He was back at my place again for awhile and then he disappeared to his ex's place for a whole week and swore on his life he didn't hook up with her and was just there to support her through a rough time (he only recently told me they did actually hook up). I spent the whole week crying at work and just being miserable. He begged me to stay with him and I did, which is something I've never done before. I've never ever ever let someone disrespect me like this before, but I felt so low and vulnerable. We were together for awhile after all that and it was so hard for me to not want to abandon him at any fight we had. We fought a lot and were pretty miserable together. I was really trying to break things off but he kept claiming he really wanted to be with me. He hooked up with a new girl he met and was hanging with secretly behind my back at his friends place for a month or two. What made me really mad is I would let him drive my car over there while I was at work and I bought an Xbox for him to use at my place and he was playing games with her while I was at work. Anyways he hooks up with her and she has BPD too. So off the hop she started tracking his location and everything, so he came clean to me about it and told me she was crazy and regrets doing it. I told him that he should just be with her and just leave me alone. She ended up needing help and he convinced me to go pick her up and help her get drugs. She ends up getting me and him into doing those drugs (we've done it before and were completely sober, just have a hard time saying no when it's right in front of me). We all ended up going on a 7 day bender and by the end of it I was all alone and the most mentally fucked I've ever been. They ended up dating. For a whole month he kept pressuring me to come over and give me drugs to drive them around and he even pressured me into a threesome. I only did it because I'm stupid and just did kinda want to be high and see him. They were absolutely vile to me while I was there and I finally got the back bone to block them and sober up. She would make millions of tiktoks about how she fucked him in the bed beside me to put me in my place and how she wants to beat me up now that I didn't want to be their bitch. She even threatened to send a whole gang of people to my house if I didn't send her money at one point. I was nothing but nice to her, swear on my life! She wanted to put me in my place because I warned her that he can be cheaty and to watch out! And she claimed I was trying to break them up. She still to this day posts about me and it's been a year since him and her were last together. Anyways, I was dating someone and doing shitty but alright. Sober, university drop out, bluey watching, chain smoking, loser on medical leave from work. My ex got me up and I dropped everything to meet up with him and to hear how shit his life was without me (hopefully) and it was. He GOT HER PREGNANT!!! And was absolutely MISERABLE! I was rolling. I wanted to laugh in his face and go back to eating cupcakes and watching bluey buuuutttt I self sabotaged my life and decided I wanted revenge on the girl for being a dick to me so I broke up with my boyfriend ( I held him back anyways, he deserves way better then a dumpster fire like me) and I hooked up with him while she was pregnant and behind her back and threw it in her face and then laughed at the tiktoks of her balling her eyes. I know I'm horrible, I really wasn't thinking right, I was kinda off the rails and sick of feeling like everyone gets to shit on me and have no repercussions, if I could go back in time I would have never met up with him. I didn't want to get back together but I ended up hooking up with him long enough that we did (the sex is the best I've ever had for some reason and he really makes me feel safe because of being there for the stuff with my dad). Getting back together with him made all my friends drop me, they were already mad at me for being too depressed and reclused for awhile.I was an ass to him though, constantly mad about him even being with a girl that was so cruel to other girls like that (even though I kinda was cruel to her by taking him back for revenge for all the shit she did to me). We were once again miserable together but I had quite my other job and now we were miserable and broke. my mom got us a job together and we started to work and save up for an apartment (I'm good at saving, he blew my money and his). I ended up having to borrow the money from my grandma for first and last ($3000, which I still have to pay her back for) I was also the only one allowed on the lease because of my good credit score and before we moved in, while I was working over time, he was looking at the girls onlyfans. Turns out he used his first paycheck to subscribe and look at her shit. It was a big blow up fight and he told me he only wanted to see if she was posting their videos they made together. We already had the apartment lined up so I forgave him and told him to just be honest with me and to never do it again. By that point I was so angry and resentful towards him, I was miserable everyday. He refused to cuddle with me or be affectionate with me at all or even have sex with me. I started becoming an angry violent alcoholic and we started to go at each other. I fucked his teeth up and he left me all bruised up. Our apartment was disgusting, he never helped me clean or cook or do laundry, he just played videogames and ignored me. He also brought his dog that he got with him and that girl together to our apartment and it wasn't house trained so it peed on everything. The dog peed on the couch I bought so much that I had to pay to throw it out. It peed on my Tv remote, laptop, bed and pillows, like literally everything. I dislike dogs because my parents would get aggressive rescues when I was a child that would attack me and I grew up to find them loud, obnoxious, and gross. I was the only one cleaning up after his dog. I found him on onlyfans again buying a bunch of girls content when he couldn't pay his phone bill that was in my name since he had no credit to get a new phone ( I got him a brand new phone and a phone plan), and he was even short on rent most of the time. He literally would beg them to meet up and everything. I was officially numb and done. I tried for a whole week to break up with him sobbing and begging for me not too, he begged me to give him one more month and I agreed. But then his dad died. I was such a a cunt to him though when his dad was dying because of the onlyfans stuff and I dislike dogs and his mom has 13 dogs and her house is covered in piss, shit, dirt, and dog hair. The dogs literally pee on everything. So I tried to support him from a distance, even though I drove him to the hospital and made sure to buy his dad blanket and slippers and soup when he couldn't eat the hospital food. But when it came time for us to wait out his death at his mom's place, I really didn't want to be there for him. I wanted to be able to come during the day but then spend the night at my parents place which was 10 minutes away. But he made me stay and we fought a lot. After his dad past, since we took so much time to take care of him we ended up losing our jobs. I instantly applied for welfare to make sure we could still pay rent, he on the other hand didn't. So I had to borrow money from my mom to pay his half of the rent. I also had to start going to the food bank and he refused to come with me even though I was anxious. I had to make him apply for welfare to help me because he refused to let me have my friends move in for us to be able to pay rent. Eventually I had enough and broke up with him and instantly hopped into a new relationship. I spent the whole month away from him anxious and feeling like shit, he was absolutely miserable and missed me and called me crying everyday. I ended up finding out I was pregnant with his kid (break up sex 🙄) and so I got back together with him and ended up  misscarry on Valentine's day, which was not my worst Valentines day lmao. But since getting back together he's made major improvements and swears on his life he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and I hates himself everyday for what he did to me. He has made major improvements but now I'm so broken and fucked up, I've become just like him when he was treating me like garbage. We had to move into his mom's place since my dad started doing meth again and I have another restraining order against my dad. I just feel triggered constantly at his mom's place. So should I even bother staying with him at this point? He has changed a lot, but now I'm extremely toxic and miserable.

I will preface this by saying that I am in no way trying to offend anyone in this group. I know I am not diagnosed, but I am almost 100% certain that this is what I'm living with. I haven't been to a doctor since I was a child - let alone a specialized one - besides involuntary suicide-watch nights at my local hospital and the occasional urgent care for the flu. So it is safe to say I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I would really appreciate your guys' thoughts on this email that took me an hour and a half to write because I got sidetracked.
            Love you all! ❤️


--‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not really sure how to come out and say this, but here I am. I believe I have BPD +ADHD. I hope you're not offended by my self-diagnosing. I can assure you that I am not saying these things because I *want* to have these personality disorders. I have lived without doctor interference for my entire life, but I can't continue to do that, so I started looking into my symptoms and what they might present. 

Upon extensive research, I display most of the symptoms in the DSM 5. At first I believed it might be CPTSd, but I more resemble BPD+ADHD. This has caused my relationships with employers, family, and friends to plummet. It has been severely impacting my life and I need help before it's too late. It's taken me a few years to seek help because I thought that it would buffer itself out - but it hasn't. 

I have had an extremely traumatic life, beginning as a child and ongoing to today.
I feel like it would be a huge burden to unload all of my trauma on somebody - and I don't want to re-live any of the trauma myself - so this has caused me to stay dormant and struggle by myself. 

I understand that I need to get an actual psychological evaluation and I am in no way trying to negate that fact. I know I am no professional. I am just stating what I believe is true so that I can find somebody qualified to help me. 

The best way to reach me is through E-mail or a scheduled phone call. 

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this, and I hope that together, we can figure this thing out so I can function like a somewhat normal human being.

They blamed my “unhealthy attachment to women” as “mommy issues for being adopted” and claimed that I acted out and had behavioral issues. While I did have severe attachment issues, RAD is usually given to kids who are violent, constantly rebelling, and have no attachments at all. I never once was violent towards my parents or even threatened them, and my “acting out” was me texting my girlfriend at the time behind their back because I knew the consequences if they found out. My parents were also heavily involved in the church. I had good grades in school, never had issues with other kids besides typical teenage drama, never used any substances until I graduated (good ol’ MJ but nothing more). I did struggle with SH and my entire mood would be dictated around my girlfriend at the time, and I did feel as if I would pass away without her. However, those feelings never manifested through anger outwardly. 

 I was sent to the institute for attachment and  child development in Colorado, who’s notoriously known for mistreating and even taking the life of children. Just look up Candance Newmarker for reference, she was a victim to the same administration under a different name. The results of the treatment left me with years of trauma and it wasn’t until I was an adult when I got the BPD diagnosis and started doing therapy for it when I finally started healing. Therapy/meds for bpd has truly changed my life for the better, while therapy and meds from the RAD places made me even worse than I already was. 

I can’t seem to find any solid research on the differences between BPD and RAD and how detrimental it is to treat someone with BPD (who doesn’t have RAD) as if they had RAD. Does anyone have a similar experience or has studied this?",1713649446.0,False,1,1,GlassShake8689,None,1c91dsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1c91dsl/bpd_vs_rad/
16,Desperate- please read at least the first part,"TL;DR: I figured start with this part and if you want more you can keep reading. Need direction to BPD specialists who can assist me in finding a residential treatment center or at least ideas anyone has on reputable places. Only foreseeable options are treatment or death and I'm losing hope. Please help me if you can. Just a quick message even with a name of a therapist you know, no obligation to a deep conversation or need to caretake if that would be a concern of yours. 

Ok, so here's the thing... I'm 32, divorced with 5 kids. I've dealt with issues since serious trauma at 13, and have recently uncovered issues before that even. I've spent over a year in residential and inpatient treatment for eating disorders over the last decade and they have been temporary fixes. As issues have progressively gotten worse and gradually expanded to the point that my coping mechanisms, anxiety, and depression have all aided in my inability to handle life, let alone be a functioning member of society. I've alienated myself from most people because either I get hurt or hurt them. I'm terrified of what my BPD and other issues will do to my children but equally what my killing myself would do to them but I have absolutely no desire to torture myself with this life anymore. I am willing to give a facility a playbook of every way I can and have cheated the system and myself to 'keep myself safe', in effect either numbing or putting up walls. This will be stupidly hard and likely shatter me so I need to be sure I have the best possible place for me. 

All that being said, I'm no expert and there isn't exactly a guide out there to treatment places and who is best and worst and what kind of people they are most likely to be able to help. After hours of research online I can only conclude that every place will obviously talk themselves up and they all look mostly the same. I cannot do this on my own but if I can find someone who specializes in the field, they may be able to tell me which ones have at least shown the most promise or fit best with what I need. I'm from a town where anyone who says they 'specialize' in BPD also specializes in depression, grief, adolescents, etc. Hopefully, you see what I'm trying to say. To have someone who actually knows the personality disorder treatment community would be a priceless asset and who better to ask than those suffering themselves and who outwardly are working on things and speaking about their issues.

17,Should I leave or help a person with mental disorder?,"Someone that I love, suffered from a serious mental disorder, both BPD and DID. At this state, I don't know if I should go help him or not as they is no cure for this disorder but giving him endless of support is very important. We did have a strong connection between us. 
The problem is if I go help him to face this together, you don't know what will happen in the future. Uhmm I don't know how should I put my words in this. 

For now, I am still thinking if I should leave him or not but of course that's the most selfish decisions ever to be made. Yeah, you know why, because loving someone with mental disorder takes a lot of efforts. 

At the same time, I can't forgive myself the fact that he warned me about his illness two years ago but I just ignored it. (I'm sorry for my ignorance in understanding mental disorder) 

But I love him. He did left me hanging 7 years ago, and opened up to me about his illness just recently. He told me he couldn't tell me about it because he didn't want me to suffer with him and better for me to leave him.

19,I left because of fear and love,"I thought that I had recovered pretty well through therapy and medication but once I found myself having romantic feelings for someone again, I started to spiral and have outbursts. I just ended things after a year and a half because I’d rather end on good terms than burn everything to the ground. In no way did my partner deserve the kind of treatment I would give when I’d split or when the rage got the best of me. It’s breaking me apart to let go but I cannot keep going forward knowing that I am hurting my favorite human in the world, the person I’m supposed to cherish and protect. I was never physically abusive but I was dismissive and recently I had actually raised my voice, yelling at the poor person because I was drowning in my own emotions. I didn’t want to end things but I had to push them away to save them from me. I’d rather be alone than to keep hurting them and they would rather be alone than to keep being abused by me, which is entirely understandable because I know that my actions are in fact abusive. I love them so much but I feel like my love is volatile because the more I care, the worse I become. I just want to be able to love without poisoning the other person. I’ve tried so hard to do and be better but it seems fruitless. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just feel broken and like I’m meant to be alone because I’m too much for even me, so how is anyone else supposed to weather the storm? I’ve never been so well loved or taken care of and it’s almost everything I’ve wanted but I kept demanding more, kept finding things to be disgruntled about, and would be set off by the most insignificant things. We never had a defined relationship and that always stirred insecurities but my behavior didn’t help to create any confidence in the bond. I know they were trying so hard to meet my needs but my list kept growing or unresolved things kept coming up. I just want to be soft, to be loved, to feel safe but it seems like I am a poison to myself and everyone around me because I am filled with so much rage and grief. It has nowhere to go. I can’t keep doing this to people who try to love me and I’m so afraid of being alone forever but it doesn’t stop. I’m suffocating.

21,Not a good day ,"My mom started using the fact that I'm in bail (previous post explains why but before you immediately assume I'm the worst it was for accidently breaking a door at a hospital.  Nothing violent/sexual) to scare me all the time saying she regrets helping me out ""my friends say I shouldn't have"" (ftr my mom's ""friends"" are all her Mormon relatives who hate me for having long hair etc) and she kept saying I was a loser for not working when I DO have a job and it was my day off.  Even though it was my day off I was working on a level design project which, while in the form of a mod, is something I'm using to eventually use as a kind of resume but she wouldn't understand and thought I was just being lazy.  Then I freaked out and punched through the dry wall and went for a drive with my dogs.  Then my mom asked me to come back home.  My hand is super bruised which surprises me because when I was in jail I would punch the shit out of a concrete wall and it never bruised.  
I developed a plan with my therapist for my family to help me work on but every time I try to discuss it with my mom she pulls the ""your an adult man"" and ""embrace the suck"" type stuff and says I can't tell her what to do.  I feel heartbroken sometimes like my mom doesn't love me bases her whole life on peer pressure from the LDS Church and worries so much about how they will view her that she will throw me under the bus or if fear she will look bad.  

I don't know how the fuck my mom and more importantly the hospital think I'm going to be able to pay for my debt and that door I broke if I'm in jail and not working.

25,I subconsciously forgive the people who have hurt me ,"I think this is mostly because my memory has gone to shit. But i don’t hold grudges, i can’t hold grudges even if i wanted to. My parents for example, the biggest thing my parents have done to hurt me is lie to me about my biological dad, created a whole fake scrapbook to keep up with the lies, with false dates and names. I would not have found out the truth if The biological father (who i don’t have in my life because i chose not to) hadn’t found me and told me the truth himself. My parents made this all about them, my mom made excuses for herself and my dad felt betrayed and ignored me for weeks when the truth came out, he expected an apology from me. I never had a good relationship with my dad, i thought i hated him he was always angry at everyone, he was verbally abusive and strict af, i couldnt breathe around him. My mom stopped defending me because he would just yell at her and then she would yell at me saying she would never defend me again. Every terrible argument i had with my parents ended with me telling myself “remember this feeling remember how hurt you are-remember their words dont forgive them for this” But i always forgive even without an apology. I moved out almost 2 years ago and i feel safer, im not used to arguing and being yelled at anymore, but now ive become more sensitive to everything, i still see my parents from time to time and when they yell or bicker with me in the slightest i cry and i kind of start to tweak out. They look at me like im crazy and tell me i dont know how to handle discipline i dont need to cry over everything. I dont want to fucking cry but i cant help it and knowing that im making a fool of myself just bawling my eyes out makes me more angry with myself and my reaction to things. My mom has put me in mental hospitals just because she didnt know what to do with me anymore. After my first and only attempt to take my life she became reliant on mental hospitals to just take me away whenever things got bad. And that brought more trauma, so mucb happened to me in those places and she swore it was meant to help me. Then i was in a residential treatment center for 2 months, i had to live there, i didnt see the outside world at all. Thats when i got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and thats when i started to hate myself more. 
Theres so much i could say this isnt even half, now all i will ever be is my trauma its made me into such a complex person and i cant deal with myself anymore. I dont feel a strong love for my parents, i could move to a city far away and never talk to my entire family ever again and i would be fine, except my little siblings ofc id miss them. No matter what i can forgive my parents which is without saying because they’re all i have. But even past boyfriends , past friends who have destroyed me i can still talk to them because i dont remember the hurt i felt only the action, and i do forget sometimes, so people take advantage of that, the people in my life know that they can walk all over me and i wont hold it against them for too long.

28,I can’t afford DBT and I don’t know what to do.,"Hi all,

Hope you’re doing as well as you can today. Remember your best IS good enough.

Long rant to begin with?

I got diagnosed with BPD in November 2023. I was lucky and able to access three months of outpatient treatment through the public hospital. (In Australia for context).

I am middle aged. I have the BPD trait of impulse spending. I wised up to building “wealth” and had a small bit of savings after working on saving for 18 months. I have never owned property, always rented and now my minimum wage doesn’t cover rent (and I’m gracefully living with my elderly / ill father. I don’t know how long he’s got.)

I quit my job (3 weeks before BPD diagnosis) because of my abusive boss and his horrible daughter. They both made my life hell, I was working 12-14 hour days. He threatened all employees (not just me) but the threat of “we’re going to put you in a PIP and terminate you” was too much to bear. I am the extreme of sensitive and cry at the drop of a hat. It’s crap. It had some savings behind me, however, I was unemployed for months and they soon disappeared.

I was bullied as a kid for being poor. I was bullied in high school for being socially awkward / different / gay. I’ve never had a lot of “true” friends, and without my dad, i don’t really have someone to reach out to.

I used to be conventionally attractive and rather healthy in my teens. When I finished high school, I lost my first serious relationship where my BPD symptoms were all over the place. My fault 100%. I sometimes go back and write to apologise to them, but choose not to. It brings up too much.

In university I made many friends and for a good 10 or so years we connected, they were accepting of my quirks, life was ok.

Then COVID happened.

(We know how that panned out. Still panning out.)

I also lost friends because of different life paths and how that stuff goes. No one did any wrong, we just drifted apart.

Then when things got back to some sort of “normal”; I joined a queer affirming church (religion does play a part in my heart, however, I do not condone abuse, murder, exclusion, and extortion in the name of Religion.)

I’ve made some friends there. They all live rather far away and I haven’t been to church since my diagnosis.

I also got a new job in March and I am enjoying it. There are a few downsides, yet only one that irks me.

There is a woman I work with. She is approximately 10 years younger than me. She is one of those “sickly sweet types” (100% me issue, not her issue. I know this.)

So far she has stated:
- Her fiancé has bought her a 170,000 car
- She controls all finances and her fiancés money is put into her account. 
- She had her braces, current car, and all overseas travel paid for by her brother.
- She is about to marry a man who is about to inherit millions of dollars.

She’s definitely a bit of a BS artist; I think we all can be, as life is tough. However, ever since her arrival my BPD has flared up. I am poor. Always have been, always will be if I don’t change my life.

As DBT costs 21,000 AUD + and is often ran during the day (when I’m at work); I cannot access it. 

My executive disfunction is rife too.

I am not close to my siblings as they are generations older and have their own lives. My extended family isn’t close either; my mum was an only child and dad avoided his family due to trauma. I don’t have many friends and I can guarantee I am sh*t at being a friend.

I am so lonely, facing tough times because Australia is only for the rich; and I can’t move countries to try something different. I only work in admin and I suck at crafts (but enjoy them). I enjoy reading too.

If you’ve made it this far, you’re amazing! Thank you for reading my ranting.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help.

Hi redditors. I’ve never posted before. Thanks for reading and responding if you choose to do so. I’m sorry if the following triggers you or if you are struggling with the same brand of futile terrible I am. 

I’m at a point in my life where I’ve struggled so much and for so long that I’m just exhausted. I’m not angry or bitter or sad anymore; I just want it to be over. I’m tired of being confused all the time, completely disconnected from this thing called ‘life’ everyone seems to be switched into. I’m tired of being panicky and depressed and anxious all at the same time, almost all the time. Im tired of being at the mercy of my insane mood swings where I'm experiencing overlapping interchanges of all these conflicting emotions all day long. I'm tired of crying so often that it feels like my brain is going to explode in my own head and my eyes will just cease to function properly. I’m tired of being dismissed when I say I’m unwell (psychiatrist included) because ‘I’m doing so well’ - I don’t even know what this means or how you could conclude that from someone whose chronically unemployed, can’t finish uni or even leave the house or make eye contact with people without panicking. I feel like an absolute rotting turd most of the time despite what I’m putting out there (which feels to me like a shit show but to other people for some reasons seems completely normal).

People seem to consistently make this crazy assumption that I’m ‘intelligent and capable’ for some reason and therefore I don’t need help. They couldn’t be more wrong. I can’t accomplish basic tasks because I’m emotionally all over the place all the time and trying to do basic human things like pick what to wear in the morning sends me into shame spirals, suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I have no control over my emotions or impulses, I’m constantly floating away from my body and nothing feels real. I’m incapable of accepting any kind of affection or goodwill from others without completely self destructing and I don’t want to burden others so my relationships are nonexistent. 

I’ve dealt with thoughts, feelings, urges and attempts of suicide my entire life. Its pretty much always been a terrifying backup in the back of my mind ever since I can remember as a safety plan to escape the torture of life where I can always feel exactly how close I am to death. Some days feel a magnetism to it but a strong resolve to resist. Other days, I’m basically hanging on by a thread and not telling anyone so they don’t come and take me from my home against my will again. 

I just want the freedom to be able to make this decision on my own. I did not give consent to be born, and I don’t think it’s ethical to keep someone alive against their will when they are suffering chronically and there isn’t a solution. 

I just feel like there’s no way out. I don’t respond to medications and suffer from such severe side effects that my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe any more drugs. My old psychiatrist had me on 5 different meds and I was equally bad, maybe worse, but in a completely different way. Those who have had adverse reactions to medications will understand this. Being mentally ill or being on psychiatric medication is like choosing if you want death by drowning or self-immolation.

I do DBT group therapy, see a psychologist and psychiatrist but I still feel like absolute shit. Everyone seems to be going through the motions, ticking all the boxes, but I just feel like nothing has really shifted. No amount of bandaids is going to help me when I’m walking around absolutely raw with no fucking skin on my body. It’s excruciating to just be alive but because it’s not visible, and it’s a slow death, nobody cares and the state ‘has a responsibility’ to keep you alive. In my experience, everyone is all sad when someone kills them selves, but also calls them selfish because they’ve left so much pain in their wake. Being passed around a mental health care system that can’t really help you, is insanely expensive and practically useless makes me miss the days when I didn’t seek help, suffered in silence but could at least hold on to the hope that there was a possibility of getting better if I had the right help. Now I know that’s not even an option. 

I’m just doomed to relive this cycle of extreme pain, possible suicide, absurdity, exhaustion, sheer terror, panic attacks, extreme mood swings, paranoia, catatonia, confusion, dissociation, spontaneous stuttering, paralysis and fatigue, where I can’t seem to express myself clearly no matter how hard I try or connect with other people. 

I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop the anxiety, panic, negativity, paranoia and depression from seeping in. I fear my emotions, I fear my thoughts and the things in life I can’t control that are going to hurt me so I just live in a constant state of sheer paralysis, frozen in fear and bracing myself for impact.

The only thing that’s keeping me alive is the thought that my sister will have to deal with the trauma of my suicide. But it also seems like it should be unethical to keep a person in this much chronic pain alive. I can feel my body deteriorating, my mind is basically scrambled eggs at this point, and I feel like I’m at the mercy of an emotionally handicapped body that I have zero control over. I keep harming myself and those around me. I just want to die with a little bit of dignity but there doesn’t seem to be a way out.

Life seems to be one trauma after the next, and continued reluctant attempts to help myself that only end up in things getting worse. I was not made for this world. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Please let me go. I don’t want to hurt anyone but I’m so tired now.

36,Success and Struggles,"I really just needed to talk about things with others that may be able to relate.

Some BG:

So, I've had mental health issues as long as I can really remember. I was in and out of psych hospitals and treatment from my mid-teens until present (now almost 36). I am diagnosed with both MDD and BPD, and while things have improved a lot since I was younger, things are still a struggle a lot of the time. I'm learning that I'll never really react to the world as someone who's more 'neurotypical', and that's okay. I instead need to learn how to be more effective in managing how I deal with the ways I experience my world. I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, I have not been able to work for a long time now. I have a huge issue with being able to consistently get up and out of bed and in to work. After enough of that, well you get fired. And after losing enough jobs, you just kinda say it's not for you. :/

Well, after years  of not working outside the home, I had my first day of sorta work yesterday. I say sorta cus it's more of a side gig type thing my husband got me at his job. I'll go in on Saturdays, with my husband, and help out.

It was nerve wracking. It keyed me up for hours before and after. (I didn't sleep Friday, went in to work Sat, got home Saturday night and slept for like 4 hours, and now I'm awake again. FML) I had to be around people I only sort of know, and I don't really leave the house, like at all. I was scared of screwing up, and looking incompetent, and reflecting badly on my husband. I was afraid of talking to much (which I do when I'm nervous) I'm still not sure if everyone liked me or was faking it.

But, I did it. I fucking did it. And I'm (mostly) okay.",1630252030.0,False,3,1,this_is_lilmiss_kris,None,pdxoc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/pdxoc2/success_and_struggles/
37,UK i need help but where the fuck will help me it’s been 6 years,"Hi there 

UK ONLY PLS need help getting diagnosed for my BPD 

background:
I’m turning to help from you guys because I have nowhere else to get advice from on this . So I’ve struggled with MH since 2013 (age 13) - thought to have severe mood/emotional problems and anxiety , start visiting the GP being turned away constantly/promised referrals which fell through/put on years of waiting lists 
After a self harming incident in 2015 age 15) in which my mother finds out about, she books me an appointment with priv sector psychologist who mentions the possibility of bpd but still classified me as having depression.
See a few more doctors 2016-18 still trying to get referrals for an assessment at least and the day before I go to uni (2018) I finally had my assessment appointment booked in for then!!!
AND THEY CANCELLED IT ON THE DAY
(due to staffing reasons?!!!!!!!)
heartbroken I go to uni terrified 
Due to situational factors I don’t attempt to access mh resources at uni till October (2019).After  an a&e  visit after an attempt, a referral made to an ADULT assessment team was made by my GP. 
after a phone call a few days later (so exciting at this point) they say they’ll contact me for an appointment in 2-3 weeks however it is now March (6 months later basically) and nothing .... 
I spoke to a guidance counsellor at my uni and she said I need to hassle my gp which just isn’t gunna do anything at this point 

I’d just really appreciate if someone in the UK could please please please tell me how on Earth I’m able to get a proper diagnosis for my bpd?  I understand under 18 services are limited and more difficult - in an adult now and I really need to be diagnosed like I just NEED to know I need it confirmed by a doctor not by others telling me and my own research.

What do I do now , obvs quarantine is preventing all this but I need a plan for when this is over :( 

Where do I go ? What do I say ? 
I feel SO lost and deserted - it’s been 6 years I’ve been struggling with bpd symptoms, 2 attempts , 6 occasions of self harm and yet no one will help me 

I’m just completely lost 
Thanks so much for ur time reading 
Any any any advice and comments will be so appreciated !!!!!

38,Need someone to talk to,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439534.0,False,6,3,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ad08fd/need_someone_to_talk_to/
39,Sponsors?,"Hello, I have just started a partial hospitalization program and am taking my recovery from BPD more seriously. A friend, who is in 12 step, recommended I find someone like a sponsor for my journey and I think this is a great idea.

The biggest difficulty for me is that I do not have a space to meet potential sponsors. As with most PHP groups, we are not allowed to contact each other outside of group until we're both discharged. So, I have come to reddit. I was thinking perhaps this could be a thread to match each other, if we feel comfortable.

If you think you'd be a good match for me feel free to send a DM. If you don't think so, that's okay, and  I welcome you to post what you're looking for!

&#x200B;

For myself, I live in Seattle and would love to find someone local. I understand we're currently all at home for COVID, so I am happy to start virtually but I'd love to find someone who I could perhaps get coffee with sometimes, but this is not required. It is very important to me to find someone who is also professionally diagnosed and in treatment, especially if you are doing or have ever done PHP or IOP. At this point, I'd say my BPD is moderately managed and I am looking for support with someone who is also somewhat managed. My goal is remission, I hope yours is too!

Because this is a possible tigger I want to say that I am active in ageplay. If you are triggered by ageplay, dd/lg type dynamics, I will probably not be a good fit for you.",1586276492.0,False,5,1,xoxoaspey,None,fwne8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/fwne8a/sponsors/
40,FINALLY getting my diagnosis assessment and im scared of fucking it up,"Backstory: 24 years old, ive long known that there was something different about me, I grew up with a tough childhood, as did most if not all the people in this group. Finally went to the doctor sometime in my late teens and got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, the classic -.- im not saying that wasn't and still isn't true now but even back then, I knew that it was deeper than that. Since the age of roughly 15 I suspected BPD(now called EUPD), Attachment disorder or aspergers (now known as part of ASD)
That put me onto a natural interest in mental health and different disorders, the varying types of anxiety and personality disorders etc. This interest and build of knowledge also helped me immensly when it came to dealing with my mums own mental health crashes, my dads alcoholism and in turn, his eventual passing 6 years ago, my grandad 2 months later and my nan about a year after that. Life's just great, ain't it *insert eye roll here for full effect*

Cut back to the here and now, after several counsellors, different GP's, years worth of personal research and honestly just trying to find someone to believe me that it isn't just depression that I've been carrying around since I was like 4.

Well. Its finally happening!!!! I've got a video call apppintment happening in less than 3 weeks and I am so glad to finally be getting some answers and get on a track to treatments. I'm going to be tested for EUPD, CPTSD and she'll give me a brief screening for autism and if there is anything that comes from that I'll be redirected.

However, I am CRAP when it comes to actually explaining my symptoms and behaviours and thought patterns, things that have happened to me in the past, reactions I had to events or people when something happened etc... 
I'm going to preface the interview by telling her that I'm not very good with this sort of thing, especially as its going to be a video chat and not in person so I won't be able to gauge her reactions. Basically im terrified of messing up my chance to learn whats up with me by downplaying things or not wording things right.

Does anyone have any tips for diagnosis interviews, how to make sure you remember everything they will want to know about?? What kind of questions will they ask??

41,Venting," 

Im sitting here writing to myself again. Everything is falling apart. I feel weaker than ever. I feel like my mom hates me. She said that I am a shame to my father who abandoned me and that she has done nothing as a mother. I have never felt so much pain in my life. I sobbed like a toddler in front of her. Because she knows that I blame myself for my father leaving me. She knows how much I fear abandonment. So for her to confirm that even my abusive and alcoholic father would be ashamed of me hurt more than anything could ever. She said “look at you, I did nothing.”She feels like she failed as a mother and in result of that I am a failure of a daughter. We failed each other. after I told her how I felt and opened up to my struggles she didn’t respond to anything I said and only made an issue out of the fact that if anyone were to find out about what’s going on all the blame would be put onto her. While I opened up to her about my bpd diagnosis and how I feel on a daily basis she was only concerned about how it would make her look as a mother. She says every-time I have a breakdown its the same story and same excuses. Which is true because none of these issues have ever been truly addressed and worked on. I can sit here and provide reasons as to why but it would sound like excuses and manipulation so I give up. I failed and I am a shame just like my father to her. She says my father still controls me and its true. I just don’t know how to stop it. I want to get help but all outpatient treatment options have several week/month waitlists, and although I have signed up for them I feel like I don’t have that time. She wants change immediately. She wants me to go cold turkey and suddenly change my life around to happiness and butterflies. Because if other people can do it so can I. But I just don’t believe that. No matter how much I try I just cannot. 

She thinks that I purposely do things to disrespect her (smoking weed). I know that smoking weed is destructive, it is my addiction. She believes that addiction is a choice. She kept saying if I wanted to change I would. To her it is simple. She does not understand the complexity of my mind and the things it makes me do. She believes that I am purposely manipulative. She thinks I don’t want to put in any effort. She thinks I am choosing to be a victim but she doesn’t understand that trauma traps the person in a victim mindset. That a person with untreated trauma is constant living in the exact state of the time of trauma. They are stuck reliving the trauma if it is untreated. She doesn’t understand how it affects the brain. She doesn’t understand that not everyone is the same. That just because she was able to deal with all of her trauma (that was  much worse than mine) doesn’t mean that I can do the same. I am not the same as her, but she expects me to be. She doesn’t understand that my thought processes are corrupted and that in order for me to regain control of it I NEED therapy, I need to learn how to unlearn and rewire my brain to adopt healthy coping mechanisms and thought processes. She doesn’t believe that therapy can help you help yourself. She believes its all a business and that people use mental illness diagnosis as an excuse for their bad behaviour. She keeps telling me to help myself but I literally cannot do it on my own. She keeps telling me to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome. Dealing with my trauma alone will never work. I can accept that but she cannot. 

I am sick and she doesn’t understand that. Because she is angry at me and angry at herself. Angry at me because she thinks I don’t want to put in any effort and angry at herself for creating a child like me. 

I feel alone. And I feel like all of my negative thoughts about myself were confirmed by her. Because I don’t think that people understand to what degree people with BPD hate themselves. The self hate is debilitating and constant. Ever since I can remember I have absolutely hated everything about my being. And when you don’t care for yourself, you make decisions that reflect that. The self destruction I engage in is not intended to hurt others it is only intended to hurt myself, because I feel worthy of hurt and pain. When I am in these long periods of numbness it is true I lose my sense of empathy. All sense of any emotion. And it causes me to hurt her. Because I am unable to even consider her feelings. I am sick and I hate it. I hate what I do.

I understand her anger because it is the same way I feel about myself. I just wish she could understand me. I wish we could break the wall in-between us. But every time she says things out of anger it makes me want to build the wall higher and stronger.",1652030374.0,False,14,7,ImpossibleBicycle249,None,ul6h66,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ul6h66/venting/
42,I'm losing my mind and need guidance for the future,"This is my first post and I have a feeling it is going to be a long one. I also hope this is in the right place.

I am a high-functioning BPD sufferer. Only my close friends, brothers and Husband know that I have this condition. I have tried to speak with my Mum about this a few times but because it isn't depression (that she suffered with) and I can functionally live my life most of the time, she doesn't seem to fully take it on board. My Dad and Step-Mum don't understand in emotional disorders unless they can see it destroying your life, so again, not much help there. I have felt directionless for years, to give you an understanding see my more recent ideas for careers below:

Novelist (started 3 books, none completed)
Therapist (but who should really be taking advice from me?)
Baker ( I can make some amazing cakes and bakes, but in the UK if you bake from home then you have to have a kitchen that passes a health and safety check which won't happen whilst I am living in my Mum's house with 3 messy boys and when my Husband and I move out to a rented house I will still be stuck as a lot of tenency agreements state that you cannot conduct business from the house)
Working in recruitment ( Until I realised that it is sales and I hate sales)
Administration (I've worked in it before but I just get bored. Not enough variety and a lot of phone work.)

Recently I seem to be on a downward spiral and it is taking me for a spin. I have tried to get myself out but in recent years my lows have become more destructive and frequent than my highs. I am 26 years old and I have no clue what I am doing with my life. I have had so many career ideas that I don't know which are really ideas that I like and which are ideas that are a direct result or my manic episodes. I can feel my life slipping away and I feel like I am still going to be doing this well into my 30's and still have no direction.

Recently I decided that I would go back to university and study for my Masters in Human Resource Management with full CIPD training. Some of my friends work in this area and have told me I will be really good at it. I was accepted on to the course on Friday and I started to plan my next year holding down a part-time job whilst studying. My mum wasn't over the moon happy like I thought she would be (more dismissive but she did seem to think it was a good idea because it actually had career prospects) For the first few days it seemed like I was finally going to have some direction in my life but on Monday I went with my friend to an Emotional Therapy session and i left feeling confused and back at square one with my decision. During the session we had to think about decisions that we had recently made and rate our feelings of worry, anxiety etc about them. I spoke with my friend about my masters and she said she was happy for me and asked if I was happy but I wasn't. I wanted to want the Masters, I wanted to finally have a direction and a job that my Mum would be proud of but it would mean being in an office again and I don't deal very well with office environments because they are too rigid.

My friend and I have discussed, in the past, the possibility of me learning some Holistic Therapy treatments and going into business with her. I am a big believer in Holistic Therapy as it has helped me ground myself in the past and it pushed me through some very difficult times. I want to learn to give people the same comfort that I get from it, but it's not a stable income. 

When I was 13 my Mum went through a horrible divorce, depression and alcohol dependency. I was the eldest and the only girl so I had to look after her and my 3 brothers. She would tell me horror stories about the men she had been with and how they screwed her over. She would tell me that I would have to learn to look after myself because if I didn't I would be in the same position as her one day, no money and 5 mouths to feed. That time was really hard for me and I think it is my anchor point for all my messed up emotions now. 

When I met my Husband 11 years ago I found it hard to let him in. Maybe it was my severe abandonment issues, maybe it was my Mother's voice screaming in my head that he would be the same as any other man. It took a good 4 years before I started to tell him everything without the voices in my head telling me that if I told him all of my problem he would turn tail and run. He has been there through it all with me including my BPD diagnosis and trying to help keep my emotions in check. It also means that he has created his own coping mechanisms, for which I don't blame him. In this instance, instead of guiding me to the best idea he will tell me that he trusts my judgement and will support me in any decision I make. It's amazing that he says this but I need a more constructive answer. What can I expect from him after jumping from Idea to Idea and career to career for our whole relationship.

When I think about the future I never have a clear idea of the way forward and it normally brings on an anxiety attack so I try not to think about it. My brain throws up so many possibilities and I want to try them all but I know that I can't. I don't know which decision is right and I am so scared of making the wrong one that I don't seem to ever make a decision

Long story short though is I am stuck. Should I do my Masters and give in to my Mother's words of warning regarding men and stick myself back in an office job? Or should I go with the Holistic Therapy, something I am passionate about but doesn't have a stable income which could lead to future anxiety or downward spirals? Should I go with neither and sit here directionless again? I have had to take a sick day today because my brain is fried thinking about this and I am only 2 weeks into my new part time job. (Not a good start)

My Husband is always going on about how Reddit is the best place to post something like this and I know he's right so let me have it community because right now I am chasing my tail. Thank you so much for reading my post which is probably badly written and not correctly formatted,apologies for that. 

TL;DR - I am having a very hard time choosing a direction for my life (probably due to my BPD) and would like guidance and feed back from others. My choices right now is a Masters course or Holistic Therapy.",1499355650.0,False,2,1,TalaMaie23,None,6lmkfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/6lmkfe/im_losing_my_mind_and_need_guidance_for_the_future/
