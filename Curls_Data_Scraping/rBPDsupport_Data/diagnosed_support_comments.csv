1,"I was recently diagnosed myself, and I read quite a lot of self-help books. I take the reading or audio books and take notes of what things I feel may benefit me. In the beginning, it's quite difficult to accept, and it takes time for it to fully be comprehended in your mind. It's been almost 6 months for me now, and I'm in a lot better of a place. Focus on eating as healthy as you can, and possibly take vitamins and take medical medications they suggest you take. You may also take more sick days than others to focus on your mental health. As an employer, they legally have to accommodate these side effects. Figure out a creative hobby with your mind or hands, so writing, crafting, sewing, etc. Re- evaluate your core beliefs as those are important for having balance and stability in having this mental illness. Try either jouraling or mood assessing/tracking as sometimes there are patterns as to when ""attacks"" can happen. For example, I know an attack is happening when I wake up in the morning and I feel the weight of a rock or have immediate suicidal or harmful ideations, as those tend to be side affects of this disability. Also, know it may be a part of you, but it doesn't define you. It's categorized as a mood disorder due to having to mature too fast at a young age to support emotionally unstable environments. I was over sexualized by my family quite a lot due to my petite frame of body with curves. Try your best to avoid any stressful situations as best as possible. Pinterest and the internet have lots of good resources or the public library or thrift stores as well if struggling to find affordable items. The faster you accept it and ignore any feelings of outsider judgment, the faster you'll understand and accept who you are. I work as a sales associate and some customers. I've been really honest with them in certain conversations, mentioning I have bpd. It isn't talked about a lot because people with bpd also tend to have addiction problems at times because we reach out to certain negative aspects, hoping that can help us, but it never does. Therefore, most times, we are frowned and judged upon, but they never ask how we aquired it either, environmental,  genetically, or both. Find healthy coping skills and abilities. It takes time to find your fit, but just remember every body and mind is different.",Loud-Age-226,1bivucx

4,"Hey OP & all in the comments who are also feeling this way. I felt the exact same when I first was diagnosed, and honestly made me spiral quite a bit. So most important thing to do is be kind to yourself while you‚Äôre still absorbing this information. Think distractions that you enjoy and self affirmations (feels a bit weird the first few times but everyone with BPD has many good qualities in there). You‚Äôre not alone in this & you will start to feel normal again with time ‚ù§Ô∏è",xChloeDx,1bivucx
5,"Hey OP, I want you to know that things will get better. While it may be tough to come to terms with this at first, please remember that being embarrassed or ashamed doesn't make it any less a fundamental aspect of who you are. Despite initial discomfort, hold onto the fact that being authentic is always preferable over hiding behind facades. You deserve love and acceptance exactly as you are, flaws and all. While not everybody might immediately resonate with your unique qualities, trust me when I say that there will be others out there who genuinely admire and cherish every single thing about you - quirks included. So my advice would be to keep pushing forward, stay optimistic, and never lose faith in yourself. Remember, your worth isn't determined by how many people approve of you; rather, it's defined by the person looking back at you in the mirror. Believe in yourself and let your light shine brightly. Everything else will fall into place eventually.¬†",0x1Soul,1bivucx

1,"I am currently having a similar thing happening. First appointment he‚Äôs confident enough to tell me I have quiet/high functioning bpd. Talks to me about DBT therapy and all. Next appointment I feel super invalidated he tells me I could do dbt by myself cause I‚Äôm high functioning and I end up feeling super invalidated through the entire appointment. He did refer me for a social worker that follows you at home and first time they came they made me feel better. On the reference paper it said : light bpd. They told me that there is no such thing and the fact that I‚Äôm high functioning and I seem like I got my shit together doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt have it or that I can just deal with it all by myself. They were really encouraging and made me feel like it was ok and that being quiet bpd doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have it. I think for psychiatrists we are like ‚Äò‚Äôeasier‚Äô‚Äô patients if they compare us to other types of personality disorder or intense bpd so for us it probably sound a bit invalidating. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for the services they offer, but I do understand how you feel as I am currently living something similar and it made me question everything so much.

1,"BPD is a sadly stigmatized disorder, and it's disappointing that professional bias is a real thing.

If you're struggling with PTSD symptoms like flashbacks and dissociation, EMDR could be a highly effective treatment. One challenge in treating BPD for someone who has post trauma responses is ""staying present"" during treatment; trauma therapy like EMDR usually includes practicing skills specifically to help that.",TranZeitgeist,fu914t
2,"Usually for people with BPD the best course of action is to do DBT and get to a stable place and then do EDMR or other trauma work if its applicable (it sounds like it is). DBT is kinda like crisis management skills so you can tolerate the every day, and once you get that under control it's much easier to work on the less fun stuff. Doing any kind of work with trauma isn't something you want to start if you aren't at a stable place because it's a really difficult process and it can bring up old wounds and make you worse before it makes you better. You want to be able to cope with that before you bring it all up. 

I'm sorry that your therapists are being difficult. It's so frustrating how stigmatized BPD is unfortunatley. I don't know if your diagnosis is already officially on your file, if it's not, it may be prudent to delay mentioning BPD until a few sessions into treatment. Therapists without much  experience often have stereotyped images of a disaster client when they hear borderline. And honestly it may be best to look for a therapist without such views. As much as it sucks to be turned away by therapists, if someone thinks they wont be able to treat you properly, them not treating you is in your best interest.   

If you can, look for a therapist that does DBT because more than likely they will be willing and used to dealing with patients with BPD. A therapist with a trauma background is also ideal, and they usually go hand in hand.",,fu914t

I'll feel like I HAVE to do something, even if I know that something isn't a good thing for me to do. DBT has helped me so much as does the weekly therapy.

\- if I can't open up to someone (experiencing beyond normal stress), I know they're not the one for my. if I feel a connection with someone, I can open up (even though I still find it hard and difficult).  
\- I find dating pretty stressful (besides that it's also fun). I find it easier to talk about insecurities and other date-feelings, if I can explain where they are coming from. If I don't talk about it, hewill notice anyway, so I better try and tell.  
\- the longer I wait to tell, the harder it gets to start.  


I'd not tell them in the first week. Because there's a pretty big stigma, and I don't want them to run away based on a stige, before they know me a little.

These symptoms sound very much like BPD to me (but I'm not a psychiatrist, of course). You don't have to have every BPD symptom to be correctly diagnosed. 

Even if you don't have BPD, or are on the less severe side of the BPD spectrum, it might be valuable for you to explore treatments for BPD, such as DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy). They could help with the interpersonal difficulties you're dealing with.

It's actually rarer for men to be diagnosed with BPD, so if a trained psychiatrist thinks you have it, might be something to take seriously.

ETA: Also, you can literally change what you think through practice. Meditation changes how you think, for instance. Memorizing DBT skills like act opposite of emotion can change how you react in stressful circumstances.

I never recognized that there was anything wrong with me in the moment most times.

I got diagnosed after a breakup last year, just set up a session with a psychiatrist and went from there when I realized the way I was feeling probably wasn't normal to going through a breakup.

I think the most obvious signs were the self harming, extreme fear of abandonment, and feeling empty. I used to tell my mom I felt empty constantly.

I went to tons of counsellors and doctors, and when I was 15 we finally talked to a psychiatrist after my GP said she had suspicions that I was Bipolar. Turns out I am, didn‚Äôt know you could have both. 

Unfortunately the psychiatrist just bulldozed me the entire appointment. I barely spoke three sentences to him while he lectured my family and I about hormones and sleep. It was awful. 

I just tried to live with it because I felt like I‚Äôd never get a diagnosis after my experience.  When I was 18 my mom and I decided to try again because the symptoms were getting worse. That‚Äôs when I was diagnosed.

It felt so good to feel heard by someone. I felt like I was crazy and there was nothing that could be done about it. The suicidal thoughts and tendencies were constant at that point and I honestly don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve lasted much longer with the pain. 

We‚Äôre still trying to figure out what medications work for me. I knew it would be a long process. When I was 15 a friends mom with bipolar sat me down and explained that it could take a long time to find the right combination for me. It‚Äôs different for everyone and you just have to keep at it until you find what works best. That really helps me to this day when I‚Äôm feeling defeated over not finding the right meds.

Talk to your doctor OP. Get the process started. It‚Äôll be hard but worth it in the end. I never thought I‚Äôd get to the point I‚Äôm at today but I did because I didn‚Äôt give up. You can do this.",Late-Summer-1208,1ctio93

2. Idk if you have BPD or not. Neither does he. You need to see a professional. There are 9 traits involved, but it‚Äôs not like a depression checklist. You can‚Äôt be a little impulsive and check that box, it‚Äôs usually impulsive in several areas, AND impacts you ability to live a normal life. 

3. Even if you have BPD, it‚Äôs possible that you are experiencing worse symptoms because of your husband. He sounds super invalidating. Validation  is important because even with the intensity of feelings associated with BPD, the cause of those feelings IS VALID.

0,"You're chasing a label. Labels can be helpful for you to understand your problem. They can be helpful for other people to understand your problem. However, the box that you've been placed in by someone else is just that - it's a box. It's never usually as simple as someone having one problem and everyone's experience of mental health is unique. No two people with a labelled disorder are the same. 

Have you heard the statement ""all models are wrong, some are useful""? Well it's very true in the case of the DSM categorisations of disorders. Nobody is 100% BPD and 0% NPD because they share some traits. Nobody is 0% autistic. The DSM is actually more of a sensemaking framework than a categorisation framework. So there's not necessarily a right or wrong answer as to which pigeonhole a person fits into, it's just a way to try and make sense of the situation and help decide what to do next. 

Also, bear in mind that in a way the label gives you validation that you're right. In many cases NPD/BPD people were starved of validation from carers (especially parents) as children and many of their behaviours seek an outcome of validation, often from authority figures. Consider the idea that you could be seeking the validation of psychiatrists when actually it's more important that you recognise which patterns of thought are unhealthy and develop healthy coping strategies to manage them.

If you're being blocked from receiving treatment and going through a hard time I'm sorry for that. It can be difficult to know where to start with treatment. There are a huge number of resources online for  you to get started with helping yourself. If you're interested I can share some links. 

**TL;DR Drop the idea that a label is important unless it's stopping you from accessing treatment**",The_RealMe,gdqhxy
1,"It's great that you're getting a fresh evaluation and diagnosis, I can tell you attached you are to the label and how helpful it would feel to be validated.

Today, I would say that it is wrong and insensitive to people with a BPD diagnosis for you to claim a diagnosis you have not been given. The fact is that you might experience a different PD like OCPD or PD-NOS, it's also possible the feelings you shared are more related to other factors completely.

Good luck with the eval, you seem motivated to share and work with mental health professionals to validate your experience. Let us know how it goes",TranZeitgeist,gdqhxy

I understand if you don‚Äôt want to elaborate on ‚Äúdestroying our lives here‚Äù but I‚Äôll say my spouse and I would often talk past each other on what our lives look like or what we wanted them to look like.

5,"My wife was diagnosed earlier this year all you can really do is support them do not try and make her do therapy if she doesn't want to especially if she's having an episode but even though my wife was just diagnosed this year when I look back after she found out I realized that her trigger period is winter time this year's it's  been extremely bad for her worst since we have been together we can't fully you know comprehend what they're going through  when they are in an episode I've had her start sharing her intrusive thoughts I mean some of them are pretty hurtful and you're like fuck that hurt. Then they feel bad because they hurt you is what you have to understand is it's not on purpose. I have been reading stuff to but I find a lot of it you have to read between the lines it's not a one size fits all. If your someone who needs to talk about it and she doesn't then ask her if she would be ok if you talked to someone about everything don't just do it the reason I she that is because my wife doesn't like if I tell people about the stuff we talk about. Which is completely fine with me. Some people may not be ok with  not talking to people about it. It  takes alot of  mind work for yourself to be ok doing it by yourself and the way I I'm doing it may not be for everybody but you may have to talk to other people about it my wife personally doesn't like when I share certain things about it and that's fine that's her choice and I respect her choices but you also have to remember that this isn't meant to be rude but may come off that way but look at it as this when they're in an episode it's  kind of like walking through a minefield but you just have to be careful that you don't step on what's going to trigger them. my wife normally likes when I'm super clingy likes but when she's in an episode she fuckin absolutely hates it it's because you have to read between the lines and stuff cuz like you can go read about it all you want but you have to find what work for you guys not what works for everyone else. all reality triggers are different for everybody sometimes it might not even be something you did it could be a season my wife I find it's more of the season like I said earlier but it is difficult you have to just work through it. Just be open with her about how you feel but you need to makes sure you use "" I "" statements I found that help alot because if you don't make it clear they are your feels and that  they didnt do anything because it will cause their mind to start to run and they will begin to let their  worst intrusive thoughts run and it could actually make it a lot worse because in all reality it's basically a giant fear that you're not good enough for anyone and that eventually you'll leave them. they can love you as much as they want and you can love them as much as you want you just have to keep in mind that if you didn't do  anything wrong and it seems like they're pulling away then just know that you that's when you need to be there for them and you need to be the Rock while they're in their hard place you get what I'm saying but it is extremely worth it if you can figure out what works for you and the person you're with that has BPD. I mean you don't have to share everything that's just what I have asked for it helps me know kinda where I stand with her her and  I don't want to sit there and be wondering what's going through her head. Like sometimes they might want help working through shit other times you have to let them be strong from a far while still being close enough that they know your there.",whiplash0713,18xyztn

As for the video itself, I essentially agree with everything he is saying.  People without mental illness don‚Äôt understand how completely pervasive is it, and how MUCH it affects your life.  Social media makes people chronically sad, like the guy in the video said, so people think that they‚Äôre depressed.  Depression isn‚Äôt even genuine states of deep sadness, it‚Äôs the brains inability to function properly.  However, I don‚Äôt think people without actual depression will ever really fully understand that.

Technically, I am ‚Äúself-diagnosed‚Äù and I think that‚Äôs fine.  I may sound like a hypocrite because I agree with everything in the video, but I‚Äôm not of the same profile as the people he described as ‚Äúself-diagnosers.‚Äù  I‚Äôm not an e-girl, I try to stay off of social media, and I don‚Äôt tell anyone that I think I have BPD.  Even when I talk about it to myself, the key phrase is ‚Äúthink‚Äù.

I have included myself in the BPD community because I identify with all of the symptoms and heavily relate to the experiences of everyone else in this form.  I don‚Äôt claim to deal with BPD publicly, because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable claiming something I haven‚Äôt been formally diagnosed with, regardless of how much I believe I have it.

For me, this label helps me identify my bad behaviors and why I do things that make me feel like an insane person, and that‚Äôs enough for right now.  Someday I may decided to get a proper diagnosis, but for right now it‚Äôs not something I feel I need.

But since I‚Äôve gotten officially diagnosed, it‚Äôs all kind of hit me. BPD is a really heavy diagnosis. It‚Äôs difficult to know that some of your thinking is warped and faulty. It‚Äôs difficult to know that BPD is hard to treat and it might take awhile to get better. It‚Äôs difficult to hear just how painful BPD can be (although this can be validating at times). 

So I can say I‚Äôve been going through a similar feeling. I‚Äôve been feeling pretty guilty since my diagnosis and as if I‚Äôm a crazy person. I feel like I have nothing good to offer and that I‚Äôm going to destroy every good relationship that I get into. Also, since my diagnosis, I‚Äôve started to see things that I did in my past that were definitely a result of BPD, but I just didn‚Äôt know it at the time.

I think about this multiple times per day, every day, for years. 

Now that I've painted that grim pic... it doesn't have to significantly and constantly impact everyone around you. Therapy and mindfulness (as much as i HATE mindfulness) really really helps. 

It's impressive that you recognize the role your behaviors may have played in relationships of all kinds. It took me years to really own that.",Complete-Scar-2077,14jq1j9
4,"I'm sorry you're experiencing these feelings, but please know those loops are common - and both possible AND important (although difficult) to break. 

It's realistic, understandable, and okay to be unhappy with your behaviors when dealing with BPD. But with knowledge, practice, consistency, and time, those behaviors can and will change. All of the things about yourself that are bothering you and making you feel less-than, and that people have likely also made you feel less-than for, do not define you. Lacking a sense of self is common with BPD, but you do have a core self, and you can heal and change all of the other parts in time. 

It's hard to deal with a diagnosis, but I think knowing is better as long as you don't give into all the misinformation and stigma there is. I was misdiagnosed until I figured it out myself at 28, and the invalidation that came from not being able to recover with medicine or CBT and being told essentially that I'm just too hard on myself and didn't have reason to feel how I felt, was very damaging.  There is a valid reason you are the way you are, there are effective treatments, and it's totally possible for you to get better, learn to love yourself, and create a life worth living. I didn't have that information or guidance, and I still figured it out. I haven't met the DSM criteria, self harmed, or had suicidal thoughts for over a year and a half now. I promise you can get there too.

The thing is, you definitely weren't asking 4 abuse if it was thrown your way. Yes some symptoms make you hurt people, or mb just act like an ahole, but it doesn't automatically make you an ahole. I suggest you use that feelings as a motivation to better yourself, recognize patterns, unintentional manipulations, self hurting behavior, self sabotage and other stuff and try to fix it, control yourself and get therapy.

About bpd episodes I'd suggest you learn to recognize when they begin and distance yourself 4 about 30min just to calm down, so later you can talk rationally. You can scream, hit your pillow, cry, vent to people, do whatever you feel like doing. I prefer to distract myself. And later you can constructively talk about what happened.",Tashe4ka,14jq1j9

I'm sure she falls into the Type 1 category, where people dedicate themselves to professions that require empathy, often in the healthcare field.

What would have made a difference for me, besides an early diagnosis, would have been having my parents' understanding and seeing their willingness to learn. Perhaps if they had spoken with me and reassured me that they were there for me, even during my rebellious teenage years, things would have been different, and I would have felt supported.  
  
On the contrary, I had dysfunctional parents who constantly fought and yelled, a mother who lived in her own world, and an absent father. Being present for your daughter is crucial, and I understand it may be difficult when she goes through episodes due to her disorder. However, it's important to remember that she has no control over it right now, and the pain she feels is immeasurable. When something happens, just listen to her and remind yourself, ""My daughter is not herself right now."" Nonetheless, it's essential to set boundaries as part of our learning and growth process.

2,"It's a traumatising illness. You can have DBT, and for many, it helps manage ideations, emotional distress, emotional outbursts, and many other symptoms. It's not a case if you are cured. As humans, we rise, we fall, and fall many times, getting back up again with some sort of resilience. It's a very misunderstood disorder, and many form inaccurate judgments on bpd, which reinforce shame amongst us who suffer the daily pain and misery of sensitively and disregulated emotions. We only have ourselves to believe that we are not our mental health only. We are much more beyond that. We are deserving of love , compassion, and understanding. If loved ones can not tolerate us at our worst, then that is their choice. You learn the art of knowing that despite the negative traits/symptoms of bpd, it's a double-edged sword, we feel intensely, we love deeply, for we have lots to offer also, we aren't immune to LOVE, to be loved! It's important that we do not believe negative perceptions of us of this disorder that can increase our suffering. We have to create a loving relationship with ourselves. We can not rely on others for that. It is a difficult rd, one that is relentlessly trying, one that makes you feel very alone. Again, we can not rely on others' approval or acceptance. It's the patience, love, care, forgiveness, and  tolerance of ourselves that lesson suffering.

Have you spoken with your own boyfriend about how his reactions have been affecting you?

Dissocation can effect your life pretty severely and they are probably just trying to help you.

It scores for three things and each specific questions shows the specific they effect you. Amnesia which is pretty self explanatory, as well as depersonalization and derealization which is a disconnection from your sense of self/connection to reality, and last absorption factor which basically feeling like you loose yourself in things like watching shows or doing a task.

TLDR of this is please do not rely on a primary care physician for a mental health diagnosis. They are not qualified for these things and they want to treat the ""easy way"" by saying you're anxious/depressed so they can hand out medications that don't work like candy.

If you need help paying for meds, I do too, look at using apps like blinkhealth, goodRX, Cost Plus drugs, and even CVS has a discount card for medication. These services provide discounted prices for prescription medications. I‚Äôve used all of them. 

Also, this is a bit of advice you didn‚Äôt ask for but from a person with BPD to another. Staying off of social media has given my life a whole new meaning. Like I find myself enjoying my life and not comparing myself to others or becoming obsessed with people etc. Also try reading the book atomic habits, I know cheesy, but I just started it and it‚Äôs helping me.

1,"you sound like you really care about him and are also very self aware about your patterns and symptoms which is good. i completely relate to this as someone with bpd, the introspective kind, and i have more of a problem with over empathising and disregarding my own needs. because of how i grew up, im a lot more likely to walk on eggshells to keep the peace than to blow up and say or do things ill later regret. this means a lot of my needs go unnoticed unless i consciously speak up about them. a fair few if not most of my bpd episodes arise from fear of abandonment which is brought up when i feel as though one or several of my needs are being ignored, when in reality often times, i just haven‚Äôt communicated them. id say try and understand what you need from him and then tell him, as well as asking him what he needs and wants from you! from experience both living with bpd and loving someone with bpd-like episodes, usually all it takes to deescalate a conflict is an open, kind conversation where we both listen to each other and speak gently until we understand each others point of view and why the argument arose in the first place. the fact that you are asking how you can be a good partner is a good sign that you have the capability to be one! something ive learned is that staying silent and suppressing yourself because you think it will make you a better partner will not do the relationship any good. sometimes setting boundaries is very difficult if you‚Äôre used to ignoring yourself to stay safe, but once you are with a safe person, setting boundaries and speaking up about what you need from your partner is integral for a healthy connection so everyone feels heard and cared for and there is no built up resentment from lack of communication. good luck to you and your boyfriend and remember that while it‚Äôs great that you care so much about others, you also deserve someone who will listen to you and love you without you having to make yourself smaller ü´∂üèª",shawdybroken,1aw2hgb

7,"I'd suggest looking into DBT and CBT techniques, as well as grounding exercises. They can be super useful for managing stress and emotions.

The thing that actually helped me while practicing CBT and DBT is keeping myself busy, especially with the right and most beneficial things:

Consider trying out different hobbbies, even if you think you might lose interest in them later on. You can always try something new.

Try working out, or just joining classes like Pilates or spinning once a week at first .

Something i can also suggest is taking free online courses on topics that pique your curiosity can be incredibly rewarding and can be added to your CV.

One thing i do personally is that I make it a point to research any topic that catches my attention or that I'm not well-informed about. It could be as simple as looking up word definitions or diving into a whole study on a planet i once heard about in a tiktok video .

And when it comes to doing things solo, I recommend giving it a shot. Eating out alone can be a surprisingly enjoyable experience.

Pet sitting can also be a nice experience.

But you know what? People with BPD are incredibly strong and incredibly empathetic, imagine turning every small situation into a very big, life threatening one and still bouncing back from all this intensity like nothing ever happened?¬†


You also need to understand that having BPD is not something that you can control, most people with BPD have a lot of childhood trauma that is related to abandonment, so it's not your fault and I know that this may not help a lot , but it's important for you to tell your inner child that it's okay now and that you will be feeling better and getting the help that you and your inner child needed for a long time.¬†


One last thing about people with BPD, I said that they are incredibly empathetic right? If I didn't have BPD I wouldn't have been able to get through to you and feel what you're feeling and make you feel better, and that is something that normal people don't have , and I'd like to look at it as if it was a super power , because truly we are able to help others and make them feel better about everything.

1,"I‚Äôm finally at the diagnosis stage and I feel immense relief, but only because I‚Äôve been a few years in the shame and denial stage. 

My first introduction to the term BPD was when I was looking through my ex-husband‚Äôs garage for some of my things and found a book, ‚ÄúWalking on Eggshells: Living with a Borderline.‚Äù

I was like‚Ä¶fucking what? It was a bullet to the heart. Especially because he was an alcoholic with his own anger issues and all I ever wanted was to be safe. But also, as borderlines, we have so much empathy, so much that we feel everything, how could *I* be the monster? Because that‚Äôs how uninformed society largely views us, monsters.

So I hurt for a while and then denied and then ACCEPTED and started learning. But then I tried discussing it and people told me I didn‚Äôt have it because I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt that bad‚Äù (???? Again hurtful to everyone with the disorder) and I realized I was using the potential diagnosis to keep myself exactly how I was.

I wanted to grow and not hide behind a diagnosis of why I was the way I was and couldn‚Äôt change. 

But in the last month I found my way back to the diagnosis. I‚Äôm coming back to life after chemotherapy and my meltdowns (as I call them) have been very frequent. Feelings of emptiness that won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm doing everything I can over here. I‚Äôve got my meeting with therapists next month and I‚Äôd like to tell
you why, after all this time and all these years, this diagnosis is a relief:

There‚Äôs a reason for my constant emptiness and extreme empathy. It‚Äôs not just inherently who I am as a person. I was hurt. I get to say what happened to me as a child isn‚Äôt fair and wasn‚Äôt my fault.

I can finally, finally, after years of therapy, find a therapist who can HELP ME. it‚Äôs been so frustrating going to therapy and not having someone understand or suggest tools for someone without the disorder. I remember telling my fianc√©, ‚Äúno matter what I do, goals set accomplished etc., I always end up back here in this pit of self-loathing and emptiness.‚Äù

I get to work on self-esteem, identity, and not just repeat positive mantras in a mirror while every mirror-neuron on my body screams for death because I saw a rough news story. 

I‚Äôve done incredible things in my life, I beat cancer, this year, and I wondered how the hell I could
Still be so upset about little things. 

The shame hasn‚Äôt been removed, but layers and layers have been torn away for me. I get to really heal!! I‚Äôve been sitting in pain for my whole life, as have we all. We can do this. 

And also, love is possible. My fianc√© loved me as I was. He‚Äôs the most patient understanding person. Even if he never understands why I get so upset, he‚Äôs told me that he loves me because I‚Äôm a good person, and that he sees how upset I get and is kind of amazed at how well and frequently I‚Äôm able to bounce back from such massive upsets. He says I just need time to feel my feelings. I don‚Äôt know how the hell I found him but he‚Äôs real. And I‚Äôm going to practice the intense love I feel in my heart by finding ways to heal. 

Because‚Ä¶‚Ä¶BPD IS NOT A LIFE SENTENCE. We can heal. We will. It‚Äôs in our very nature to heal, to dive down under the muck and look under every rock. 

We just need the right tools. And society is becoming more and more trauma informed. 

We get told we need to love ourselves and practice self-compassion. What non-bpd people
Don‚Äôt realize is that WE DONT KNOW WHO THAT SELF IS, and we have mega trust issues. 

I learned recently that shame and guilt are something we can let go. A diagnosis hurts because we have this internal talk that constantly tells us we‚Äôre horrible people, and the diagnosis is like a big light that says, ‚Äúyou are!‚Äù But we‚Äôre not. A diagnosis means you have symptoms and behaviors indicative of someone who was very hurt, probably when very little, and developed these tendencies to survive. 

And you survived. Let‚Äôs keep going.",ImpressiveSell5404,1ctuiz2

8,"Hi, thank you for your response. One thing I strive for is to be as honest as I possibly can. I‚Äôve done mountains of research and reading about my disorders, and from what I‚Äôve learned about BPD, it is definitely possible to recover from BPD.  I‚Äôll include a link to the national library of medicine below if you‚Äôre interested.

However, I do believe that sometimes the language surrounding mental health and recovery can be a bit ambiguous, which doesn‚Äôt do well our BPD black and white thinking tendencies.

I do agree with you that we will always always feel the way we feel. We will always have triggers and huge emotions and many, many other things. But we can also develop tools to allow us to manage these things. 

I believe that‚Äôs why mental health and addiction use the word ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcure.‚Äù

I‚Äôm an alcoholic in recovery. I haven‚Äôt had a drink in two and a half years and the obsession to drink has been removed. But am I cured? Hell no.

I‚Äôm one drink away from the same cycle, always. What‚Äôs different is I have tools now instead of just drinking to numb myself. 

With BPD, I also have tools now and I hope to develop many, many more. For example, when I would dissociate, I found that human touch helped me. I told my fianc√© that when I‚Äôm having a meltdown, I need him to gently hold my hand. I don‚Äôt run away anymore, even though every cell in my body screams for me to run. That‚Äôs improvement. 

I still get massive intrusive thoughts out in public. I cry through them and center myself and resume activity. Self soothing techniques can be learned.

I understand, through tons of exploration, that I am extremely unsure of relationships and explain my fear of abandonment to people I‚Äôm close to. I tell them I need reassurance. 

And sometimes the world shits all over my safe little bubble of awareness and is just mean. I allow myself to be myself and hurt. It hurts, I know you hurt. 

But to say recovery isn‚Äôt possible for us seems against our very nature. We are resilient. How many people do you know that could overcome several massive core- shattering episodes A DAY, and still take another step forward?  There is no way we can just feel all the massive amounts of empathy we feel and NOT take action. I‚Äôll bet you‚Äôre one of the kindest people I could ever know. Maybe you never miss a sending a birthday card or compliment an old lady on her perfume and really mean it. 

We are the way we are. But we can learn do modify our behaviors, which are a set of patterns of reactions. Life is always going to life. Please try not to get stuck under your diagnosis. 

And if that‚Äôs how you feel, my friend, that‚Äôs how you feel. But I encourage you, perhaps not now but in a moment of darkness, to consider what opportunities for growth and creation your destruction has brought into the world.",ImpressiveSell5404,1ctuiz2

I did a year of DBT, and it really made a difference. I don't know how long the waiting list for DBT is, but maybe you could ask your doctor about an estimate?

3,"Hi, I recently had a conversation about how ADHD, autism and BPD can be DX together or separately.
I am AuDHD myself, my special person with ADHD & some other condition is figuring out if they are on the spectrum and or have BPD. And I am trying to help them through this, to find the right resources for this endeavor. 

BPD is different from autism as in:
- one could be irritated about a change of plans by the other person but the irritation would possibly stem in ASD from struggling to adapt to changes - whereas AFAIK with BPD it can trigger feeling abandoned/ fear of losing the FP

- in autistic people, there is no immediate fear triggered of  "" they don't love me, it's over"" and there would be no splitting 

- autistic people  without BPD can experience meltdowns or shutdowns when something doesn't make logical sense, when there is sensory overload, when it's hard to process something emotionally, when expectations aren't met, but it's usually regardless of a relationship, it's outside of relationship dynamics 

- during a meltdown, emotions can run high in autistic people in conjunction with the nervous system going haywire but during a shutdown it's polar opposite to the point of going non-verbal. The thought process during these moments is different from non-autistic  people suffering from BPD and splitting 

- autistic people can enjoy time alone, they actually need the space / their own bubble for regeneration and in that time there is a high chance they don't think of their partner no matter how much they love them 
- autistic people can break up relationships without going through extreme emotions during it 
- autistic people even with ADHD can be perceived as emotionally cold due to alexithymia / monotone voice / delayed cognitive processing of events & emotions/ - which I think is polar opposite to BPD 
- BPD come across as loving, full of feelings, dedicated, intense 
- it's ""thinkings"" in autistic people vs ""feelings"" in neurodiverse people 
- the internal experience for people with BPD is different from the internal experience for people who are autistic 
- one is born autistic but not with BPD. 
BPD is aquired due to traumatic life experiences 
- the executive functioning is usually impaired in autistic people 
- BPD is a treatable mental illness to the point of not fulfilling the DX criteria after getting help for it whereas autism is always there 

- autism has a biological base, the brain structure is different from people who are not autistic 
- autism means monotropism & bottom up thinking, a different way to perceive the world 
- autistic people with BPD would think bottom up vs non-autistic people with BPD who think top-down 
- autistic people without BPD can trust a loved one immediately, it's a tendency to be gullible and naive whereas non-autistic people with BPD  struggle with trust 

FYI Some of this info is from the book ""Unmasking autism"" by Devon Price.

It's ASD = a product of genes / nature 
vs
 BPD = a nurture / result of environmental factors,  traumatic experiences, lack of positive experiences,

There is also a possibility that ADHD vs hyper vigilance / sensory issues due to traumatic experiences have to be differentiated. 

AFAIK, the latter once can be treated with therapy vs lack dopamine in ADHD without traumatic experiences. 


Logically speaking, it's possible to be AuDHD or ADHD & BPD or AuDHD with BPD.",lostinspace80s,17izfmj

0,"It feels very isolating and the fear of losing friends alone can cause us to withdraw. People want to see behavioral changes to show respect of them and an effort to work on our personal things that impact them by being in relationship with us.

I did have some help from DBT treatment. The main, first thing to know is that we can experience intense levels of situational distress that triggers our vagus nerve and we won‚Äôt be able to think or communicate clearly until it‚Äôs calmed down. This is something happening in your body, it‚Äôs why you can feel possessed by an unhinged energy and then be completely apologetic afterward. Try to notice the signs in your body of feeling increased intensity/distress. If you can inform others it‚Äôs happening and that you need to take a break to calm back down, then your friends can help by being respectful of that and giving you your space. There are techniques that can help calm your vagus nerve back down. They include breathing techniques, using hot/cold temperatures, intense exercise, etc. It takes a lot of practice to get good at identifying your distress going up before snapping, it takes a lot of practice to get good at calming down, and also communicating effectively. The more you can seek guidance on those skills, the more you can tell your friends how they can support you in practicing them, the more people who are truly there for you can be in a way that‚Äôs healthy for everyone. Part of that process is your friends having boundaries for what they won‚Äôt tolerate in outbursts etc, and it‚Äôs your job to find the skills to use to prevent things from getting to that point where those mean behaviors come out to communicate. Find the sweeter voice that needs to be seen/heard and try to communicate from there before the harsher one comes out to protect you.

Be an advocate for yourself. Know you are not alone. Keep a community around you that loves and supports you or create one.

1,"I too got a recent diagnosis, and I wanna share some of the positive insights I‚Äôve recently gained.

- There are evidence based and effective treatment options for people with BPD. Meaning, the way you‚Äôre feeling and living can be helped. You CAN live a healthier, more stable life. 

- There is a community of people who feel lmk ist like you. All those times you‚Äôve felt like you‚Äôre broken/unfixable/isolated/alien‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not. So many people out there have some of the exact same symptoms/triggers/coping mechanisms as you. You‚Äôre not alone, and these life experiences have been seen by others. We are not doomed.

- When you do start learning how to use healthy coping mechanisms when triggered, once you come back down from the trigger, you‚Äôll feel so fucking proud of yourself. For me, I caught myself mid-split and was able to stop the cycle I always find myself in. Then, it happened again, but this time I caught myself earlier on. And sure I know I‚Äôll still experience the pain of BPD, but having control over my reactions gives me a lot of hope that I will live on solid ground again (hope that makes sense). 

- Kind of a side note, but since learning that my BOD came from trauma, it‚Äôs been affirming that what I went through was actually not okay, and my reactions and feelings are valid. I‚Äôm bigger than that trauma. And since I lived through that hell, I know I can survive. With therapy (started 2 weeks ago, so I‚Äôm currently riding the high of hope) I can take that strength I was forced to gain and build from there. I really believe people with BPD are much more capable than they can give themselves credit for.",wazzledazzle,uldyu8

(All of them have content on other platforms as well.)
* If you struggle with self-harm, this is an alternative list of things to try to avoid self harming, and it is a loooooong list. https://projectlets.org/alternatives-to-selfharm
* This bpd sub has been particularly supportive and validating, and I encourage you to ""let it out"" here.
* Therapy/new therapist if you have access. Same with psychiatrist if you have comorbid issues that require meds. 

Also, I understand people have reactions, but out of concern for your health, I just want to say that your partner's reaction to noticing that you ""messed with their 'stuff'"" is concerning to hear. I don't hear concern for you in ""now I can't even keep these here"" - however, I do hear them shaming you in what was relayed. (I do think it's better the weapons aren't in the house for some time but that's it's own thing)...AND It's no wonder you're having a ""reaction"" and probably having trouble regulating. Sometimes people don't realize they speak a certain way toward others, and sometimes ""we"" don't pick up on it b/c often we've been conditioned to accept ""less than."" I just thought, based on your post, it might be a useful conversation for you and your partner to have or revisit when you felt comfortable so that maybe the next bad situation doesn't go from bad to worse. üò¨ Shame and BPD don't generally mix well.

0,"BPD is Borderline Personality Disorder, not bipolar. Are you sure he's bipolar? EUPD and Borderline are the same thing. Can someone be bipolar and Borderline at the same time? Yes, because I am.  


I'm not trying to be a jerk, I just want to make sure we're using the same terminology.  


Regardless of your illnesses, what this all comes down to is triggers between the two of you. Do you know what they are? How do you cope in certain situations? What kind of techniques do you use to self-soothe? You mention he's on meds; are you on meds? Are either of you seeing a therapist? If he's in a bad spot, can you support him even if that means you might be triggered and could send you spiraling? Can he support you?  
 

Having a relationship with a normal joe and someone whose crazy is hard. When you have two crazies, it's even harder because its a constant check and balances. And while relationships can be hard even if you're ""normal,"" you're easily looking at twice the work when mental illness is involved. If you think he's beyond worth it and could be someone see a future with, make the commitment. And not to say he's ""too much,"" but if you feel you cannot support him if he relapses or if there are too many risks involved, let him go.   


And if you decide to stay, get couple's therapy even if you think you don't need it. My husband and I split up years ago due to my crazy and one of the conditions of us getting back together, suggested by me, was couple's therapy.

2,"What an amazing reply!!! And not a jerk at all! Thank you so much. Sorry, yes I do mean Borderline Personality Disorder. I get confused with acronyms lol! I agree it is something that needs to be weighted. Especially as we have children on either side to take into consideration. I am medicated on Concerta and Mephylenidate. Which has seen an awful amount of my impulsive and emotional behaviours balance out. So, I would say I am the more level headed out of the two, well as much as an ADHDian can be. 
I am triggered by violent episodes around me, I am noise and smell sensitive. One occasion I jumped out of a window during an argument years prior to meeting my ex. The noise vibrates through my skull and feels like physical torture. Although my ex is like a hot Brian Blessed (loud no matter the mood) it wasn‚Äôt until I bought up missing money did his voice become even louder and more aggressive in tone. So, that‚Äôs my trigger. His trigger from what I can gather is his addictions being found out (gambling and cocaine), he had lied for months about needing money which me being me was like a walking bank. Then when I pulled my funding (don‚Äôt want to be an enabler) he became even more defensive. So less about the addictions and more about the need to lie. Coming from a background of mental health I would like to think I can understand him and his motivations. I lie too when I have been impulsive on Amazon and it has taken a lot of therapy to be honest not just with others but with myself. Couples therapy sounds like an awesome plan, I already have a therapist for my ADHDitude but I wonder if he will think this is an attack on his feelings? How are you and your husband now? I really appreciate the reply and it has definitely given me plenty to think about. I honestly believe that someone with borderline personality disorder is more than worth the effort. For you to feel absolutely everything to such a great measure, love, happiness, you don‚Äôt half suffer a lot. BPD and ADHD aren‚Äôt dissimilar, merely the reaction to emotional stimuli.

There are help resources that I have on hand if things getthat aren't police.

His therapist has been helping a lot and there has been serious improvement, so no, we won't be looking for a new one because finding a good therapist is a nightmare and this one is actually helping.

He has coping skills in place and uses them, but he still shuts down, which isn't unreasonable during a major depressive episode. Our life shuts down because we are on watch to make sure he's safe, nothing more.

Again, I wasn't asking for what he can do, I'm asking for advice for what I can do to be more supportive in those moments of crisis because I feel helpless to make things better for him. Ideally, something that doesn't involve calling fascist attack dogs on a loved one.

You claim the therapist is ‚Äúgood‚Äù, yet again you‚Äôre here on Reddit trying to figure out what to do rather than asking her, and not following a safety plan.

1,"For me, it helped to have a diagnosis because I always knew something was very wrong with me but didn't have the vocabulary to describe the terrifying happenings of my brain. However, for the most part, a lot of therapy for mental illnesses is all very similar and uses similar techniques. Even neurotypical people respond well and have better lives when learning DBT techniques and mindfulness, for example. You might hear people mention the DBT workbook by Marsha Linehan. Whether you get diagnosed or not, I reccomend trying it out, because it has some good skills in it for basically anyone and is very helpful for people with DBT specifically. Mindfulness meditation is also very helpful, although keep in in mid that you don't have to meditate to be mindful. It can be a practice you have as you go about your idea. It's a state of mind, and can be very elusive, but it's easier to start with meditations. Body scans are especially good provided you don't have chronic pain. Hope this helps! Remember, you're the same person you always were, and there are many people with BPD who go on to love happy lives. In fact, some psychologists think that BOD may be an unborn sensitivity to others emotions and actions that can be a skill when you develop it in a positive environment. There's a possibility that the reason it effects people negatively is because they may never be taught to use it in positive ways or because they experience trauma that ""activates"" it in a negative way. There are positives to any mental illness, even though they don't outweigh the negative parts. In people with BPD, we tend to be more creative, sensitive, and empathetic, although it's different for everyone.

0,"I know how you feel. I've felt different most of my life. People generally treat me the same. Most people though just don't understand what our condition is or what we go through in our heads. Most people may try to help with certain situations but fail miserably at understanding, no matter how hard you try to explain, how you see or feel about things. But that's why communication is important. If they're willing to attempt to understand, I would try to explain it until they can at least understand even a little bit. 

Before being officially diagnosed I studied my symptoms starting back in middle school. My now deceased wife (passed of cancer) helped me a lot. She saw me at my absolute worst and still chose to be with me. I was able to talk to her about anything. It got to a point she'd be able to detect one of ""outbursts"" before it happened and helped me through. I learned a lot of coping skills and am a lot calmer of a person because of her. Currently, I have one friend I trust enough to talk to. 

If you have someone you can trust, my advise is talk to them about things. Even if all they do is listen. It helps. I've also found that being open about my condition helps me and helps others understand me. So I've recently started a podcast where I talk about my life and different situations I've been through as well as how I feel about certain topics. Even if I never grow an audience I'll continue doing the podcast because it's a way for me to get things off my chest (vent) and I'll be able to listen to episodes in the future to see how much I've changed compared to when I spoke about a situation and how I might handle it differently as opposed to when I went through it. 

I chose podcasting on purpose because I feel a blog would gain an audience faster, and whereas I do want to talk about it and put it out there, part of me is still a bit scared or nervous about how some people may view what I say. But either way, it's an outlet for me to relieve my stresses and vent; which does help.",RedConradcom,14h1jz1
1,"Hey, no matter what your symptoms and experience - you aren't alone! Remember that. 

BPD is complex, and every case is uniquely formed and expressed. People - including doctors - would often downplay my mental illness because I'm more of the ""quiet"" subtype with a high functioning presentation. It was misdiagnosed for many years because of that in combination with my not having an obvious history of abuse. But trauma is much more complicated than that. Having our mental illness and experience invalidated of course contributes to the overall issue.

If you meet the criteria, or even some of the symptoms that severely affect you, then they need to be addressed no matter what anyone thinks. No matter your situation, yes, your brain HAS been wired a certain way by your environment and experiences. And it can be rewired in time. DBT is a great place to start - if you can't do it formally, there are many books and resources online. I'd also highly recommend Dr. Daniel Fox's YouTube channel, as well as his Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook. His workbook is pretty unique compared to other ones out there; it's my favorite one I've come across. I'm going to be starting my own channel soon, but more for the peer support side and to share my personal experience with BPD and recovery - I'm not a doctor or licensed in any way and will still suggest there that people refer to his content for clinical information.

BPD is an isolating experience, but that's why peer support is so important. I haven't felt understood regarding the strength of my emotions by anyone in life besides those with similar issues. Keep reaching out. BUT be wary about info you come across, even within this subreddit. There are so many misconceptions, and they can be harmful to recovery. Have hope. I promise things won't always be as they are currently as long as you keep working towards change.

But don't expect a normal person to want to validate that negative cognitive distortion often. If you do trust him, you'll listen and believe he does miss you and it's only you. Write it down, look at it often, whatever it takes, but those are intrusive thoughts that will torture us. 

You in therapy yet? I'll save you a lil trouble, you need a personality disorder specialist and more specifically Dialectical Behavior Therapy. And i take a mood stabilizer, and and i personally think you should take up journaling. 

 I hope i didn't come off harshly. I don't mean to. But really,  i suggest i feel is like your only option. You don't want to be nagging or begging or scaring off the guy. Interpersonal relationships don't usually come easily to us. Message me if you like.

0,"Hi I‚Äôm 37 and have been living with BPD most of my life. Properly diagnosed when I was 24. First off, people with BPD can absolutely be good even amazing partners. We just have to work extra hard on our end to stay constantly aware of ourselves and how we perceive whatever current situation we are facing that is triggering us. The best possible skill you can learn is respect boundaries both your own and the boundaries of others. For us, a lot of it comes down to communication. How we convey and receive to and from our loved ones. We have to work extra hard to remind ourselves that we need to trust and know our partners love us. And on their end they have to also be willing to stay healthy and regulated as well as taking part in either personal or group therapy. The truth is‚Ä¶ we are a tall order. But we also, have the innate skill to love‚Ä¶ if we remind ourselves why we are doing this, it‚Äôs all out of love.
I myself am entrenched in a battle that is slowly degrading my partners will to keep going. 
I‚Äôve decided to take space after a big blow up. 
(This included splitting, devaluing, and the eventual ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù talk) and I‚Äôve been doing my best to calm myself physically and mentally while I let the emotions run it‚Äôs course. Im trying to be more observant rather than reactive. But I know deep down somewhere‚Ä¶ im losing someone I truly love and care about‚Ä¶ I honestly would not have revisited this BPD if it wasn‚Äôt for her. 
In that, makes her a great partner. But we are doing our best to keep ourselves healthy. And that comes first. Everything else, let them lay as they fall. And be ok in knowing you will be ok. Let it hurt. But do no harm.",Maximum_Primary6940,171nkeh
0,"""Being toxic"" talk has to stop for anybody because it's very invalidating. One of the core reasons people have BPD is growing up and living in an invalidating environment.

I know mood swings for Bipolar people last more like weeks to months rather than people with BPD it is more like minutes to hours.

You may not want the diagnoses and I respect that, but if you do experience any symptoms of BPD I highly recommend taking DBT. This therapy was primarily pioneered for people with BPD (symptoms). Honestly, Doctor's are unethically hesitant to give the BPD diagnoses anyways, which causes more problems than solves, and put their patients in DBT anyways without letting them know they have BPD traits because of the stigma.",,hyer7i
1,"I would advise anyone who suspects they have BPD to push for a professional diagnosis. Although some say it's being given a label, it has allowed me to come to terms with and understand my BPD. Do some research and see. There are 9 traits and 3 characteristics and although you don't have to have all, I think a true BPD can say yes to at least 5.",neve67cook,hyer7i
2,"What I explained to my bf is that I have BPD. And honestly even if you aren‚Äôt diagnoses w it yet you could say whoever diagnoses you (assuming it would be your psychiatrist) you could say that they‚Äôve looked into BPD symptoms and that their thinking you could possibly have it but just haven‚Äôt diagnosed you yet. If you bf cares/loves you then he will support you no matter what your going through. My bf has said this to me over & over again and I have BPD as well so ik exactly all of those symptoms your going through. What my bf did at the beginning of the relationship which was the smartest thing to do (and quite frankly no guy I‚Äôve dated ever cared enough to do this,) was that he actually took the time and looked up and educated himself about BPD. He watched a bunch of videos and read a few websites about the disorder and this has helped both of us out so much. The most your bf can do is just be there for you and try to understand/sympathize w you and reassure you that no matter what happens he will support you and be there w you every step of the way. And even tho sometimes hearing this over & over again will either make you sad/depressed, or just down right frustrated/irritated from hearing it over & over again constantly, honestly it‚Äôs the most he can do and I‚Äôve come to realize that and it‚Äôs helped so much that he‚Äôs done that. So I think you should just explain to you bf in the best way you can how your feeling, what BPD is and how it affects the way you feel and think and I‚Äôm sure he will be happy (maybe not happy but at least be more understanding) of why your feeling/acting the way you are in certain situations.",sophiebeanzee,hyer7i
3,"Thank you very much for even answering this despite me having no diagnosis. I appreciate this very much and I will try and talk to him as soon as I make up the courage. It's just hard because I still somewhat think yeah but what if I don't have it and it's just a toxic personality trait or something. That's what I'm scared of. But  thank you so much, this means a lot.",KyokoChan7,hyer7i
4,"Toxic people often don't care about how toxic they are to other people, so the fact that you even care works in your favor here. BPD is fickle because it's an irregularity in our internal voice. The voice tells us we're worthless or not good enough to the point where we can't often trust it. As a result, we can sometimes think we're more toxic or shitty than we actually are. But sometimes, we're just being shitty and we need to learn to recognize that too. If you think your emotional regulation is affecting your boyfriend, the best thing you can do is talk to him about it and try to start working with a therapist. Your bf can help ground you to a more reasonable self-image, while the therapist can help you with coping skills and emotional regulation. However, it's important to not shoehorn your boyfriend into being your therapist. He can't manage your emotions for you nor does he deserve to be a punching bag on the bad days. It's up to you to work to manage feelings and behaviors.",TwoSoxxx,hyer7i
5,"see that's exactly what I thought in the beginning. The only reason why my psychiatrist didn't diagnose me right away cause I was too much of underage to be diagnose I think the age limit was 18 + so we had to wait a couple of years and really try to dig deep into my brain to figure out if this is the right diagnoses to diagnose me w. So I completely understand how you feel. I think you'll do just fine explaining to him. If you wrote that out in your post just as well as you did, you'll have no issue at all explaining to him. My mom says this to me I'm a very good writer when it comes to explaining my issues and I'm really starting to believe it especially when someone reads it off to me, and maybe this is because it's a BPD thing, or maybe it's also because of the amount of bs I had to go through during my entire life and teen years especially. But usually if your pretty good at explaining something, you'll have no trouble at all talking to someone but I agree, it does require courage. I still haven't gotten the courage yet to talk to my sister & my dad about ongoing issues that have been happening here recently within the past couple of months, but having my supportive bf around and this group has def helped w feeling not alone, and being more validated. So I try to give back to others in this group when they're struggling w something, as they've done for me and prob would still do that for me which is extremely nice of everyone to do. And you know what? Even if it turns out you don't have BPD, hey that's ok. Ik it would still require more research of symptoms and digging in your brain to find out more info, but still even if you don't I would still tell him the issues your having and that your psych team is working hard to find the answers you need and I'm sure even then he'll still understand. Def been in your situation before and it's not fun at all, not knowing what's making you act/feel/think like this. If you ever need anyone to vent to feel free, always to dm me!!!

4,"First things first, DO NOT let the stigma around this condition get into your head.

Things to avoid:

- A particular subreddit that says it's for the loved ones of people with bpd. It's full of misinformation and anger, mainly from victims of abuse who are (understandably) looking for something to blame. Me mentioning it is going to make you want to go and look for it. Don't. 

- A book called 'walking on eggshells'. Some people find it useful, but I don't think it's helpful to anyone who has just been diagnosed.

- Forums, support threads and YouTube videos made by and for people who have not actually been diagnosed with BPD, or who have no professional qualifications/expertise in BPD. 

Essentially, there is a LOT of BS out there about this condition. Protect yourself and get into the habit of disregarding it. 

Things to seek out:

- Support forums, threads and YouTube videos by people talking about BPD who actually have the disorder or are experts in treating it. 

- Anything by Marsha Linehan and resources for dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT).

- Research showing that BPD is a highly treatable condition - you can get better!

- Resources for complex PTSD - the two conditions often overlap, and if you've experienced abuse or trauma then dealing with this is crucial to recovery. If this feels like you, you may want to consider long-term psychotherapy with a trauma specialist as well as DBT.

- On Instagram, perfectly_borderline and BPDmatters both have great accounts dedicated to positivity around BPD.

- Mindfulness. Apps like Headspace and Calm can help introduce you to this. You will find it hard at first but it can really, really help.

- Self-help books on self esteem and finding yourself, music playlists about loving yourself, affirmations. Working on liking yourself and self-development can really help with issues around lacking a sense of self and feeling like you don't know who you are. Surrounding yourself with positivity can really help lift your mood because we are so easily influenced emotionally.

- Journalling. Get those emotions out. If you're not into writing, try speech to text apps or another creative outlet like art. 

- Creating a crisis plan to share with people close to you. What will you do if you're feeling bad and what are helpful behaviours from others? Are there any alternatives to self-harm/impulsive behaviour/acting out of anger that you can put in place?

- Being kinder to yourself. Recognising that you have a disorder that centres on emotional regulation, what do you need to help with that? Is it not confirming whether you're able to attend social events until the last minute? Is it setting aside a day a week to do nothing, so you can recover from the stress of just being? Is it confirming to friends that you are going to typically be up to half an hour late because you struggle to get out the door and just accepting that? Is it talking to work and organising flexible hours, or working from home, or going part-time? You get the idea. Be nice to you!

0,"It‚Äôs really wonderful that you want people to read up on it but for the most part the best you can do is start with the DSM! It just has a really clear and to the point analysis of the main symptoms. 

Books are helpful but for people without mental illness a book with a big scary label on it like BPD might be too much for people to understand even they really do want to support you!
Educate yourself first and then teach your friends ways they can help you personally and then be willing to be helped! 

bpd is a highly varying disorder n the most you can do is try to make sure people understand the most important symptoms for *you*. 
For me it‚Äôs my black and white thinking. I imagine this is the same for a lot of us but I‚Äôve noticed this has been the hardest thing for my friends to understand. Teaching people that I struggle to work with grey areas or even acknowledge them sometimes was initially really hard but over time people have started being super helpful w my emotional range, emotional threshold and my general social ability. 

My FP/BF and I have worked on it HEAPS and he‚Äôs been super patient w me without compromising his own boundaries (which is super important for people w BPD to stay conscious of!). He‚Äôs been rly good w reminding me when I‚Äôm freaking out for no reason in a gentle and kind way.

Before we had a way of communicating w each other he often felt overloaded by my emotions n v often felt like he had a lot of pressure on his shoulders. Teaching him what an FP was and explaining the intensity of that scared him a lot and we had to find new ways to discuss my mental illness in a way that didn‚Äôt make my mental health feel like his responsibility! I also had to accept that just because I‚Äôm ill doesn‚Äôt mean I can get away with being toxic (which I was for a phase because I honestly went down the rabbit hole of ‚Äúyou know what‚Äôs wrong w me you should be able to accept it‚Äù)",bubobabis,i3qsu4

remember that you are doing the complete opposite and you‚Äôre being vulnerable with him even when it‚Äôs hard and you‚Äôre being so strong sharing your feelings with him and even trying to improve your relationship, honesty is the first step in having a healthy FP relationship 

I had an online FP once and to try to make it a little healthier we would set specific times we could talk or call especially on days that are busy, I noticed that having time stamps of a call or a video chat during my day would give me something to look forward to so I wouldn‚Äôt be on my phone 24/7 waiting for him to respond to me.

Also, having identities away from each other like separate friend groups and hobbies (although ik it‚Äôs so tempting to absorb their life and personality) helps in lessening any tension as he will feel like he is able to be independent and that will bring you closer.

If you‚Äôre in therapy or you are aware of any DBT skills I‚Äôve heard that DEAR MAN is a great skill to practice communication, especially in situations of conflict 

D- describe (clearly describe the facts of the situation with no judgement)
E- express (using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to express emotion)
A- assert (Clearly state what you want/ need with specifics)
R- reinforce (reward the other person if they respond well)
M- mindfulness (being mindful of your goal without being distracted by other issues)
A- appear confident (using clear words online etc)
N- negotiate (know your limits with the person)

It's not abnormal to expect your partner to not watch porn and there are people out there who don't do it, so don't let people convince you that your preference is unattainable; but on top of that if he admits to having an addiction, his priority should be to address and manage it, not name-call you for even bringing it up.",Aldreemer,18iraqj

I have BPD too and we often blame ourself for everything (I‚Äôm very self-loathing) and that feeds our BPD. I highly doubt he will change (just based off the way you explained his reaction and behavior).

If I were you and he showed no signs of wanting to compromise or change, I would ultimately LEAVE. It‚Äôs the smartest thing to do for your own health. Please put yourself as a priority. Love yourself more than you love anyone else. And as for your mother, I was raised by a narcissistic and sociopath ic mother and I believe that‚Äôs how I developed my BPD.

Or at least limit the consumption? And your mom has to have some very bad experiences herself to say something like this to you; it's not like you're witholding sex despite wanting to have it yourself, you have a genuine mental block and going against it would be forcing yourself. BPD makes it easy for others to make us place all the blame on ourselves, but it's not always right. I don't think you're wrong here. Try to have a calm, organized conversation with your boyfriend on how and why it makes you feel. Encourage him to learn more about how negatively such addiction can influence his own life and sexual satisfaction. If you don't feel it's possible to do without getting emotional, write it down and read out to him, or have him read it himself. Good luck, and really, dont downplay or doubt your feelings here.",Aldreemer,18iraqj
0,"Tbh if you don't have emotional disregulation it sounds like you might need to talk to your doctor about your diagnosis because that's the main issue with BPD. Perhaps they saw something in you that you haven't recognized, or perhaps they're wrong.

Also saying people with BPD quit their job because their bosses ""are mean to them"" sounds kind of disingenuous. Lots of people struggle with keeping jobs because they have a lot of bad mental health days and can't make it to work during crises, or for other reasons. Lots of people with BPD don't have trouble keeping a job, either. It's different for everyone and using language that implies immaturity is a bit insulting. 

Anyways, maybe see a different doctor if you feel this one just kind of pinned the label because they couldn't think of anything better.

I will say that not all people with BPD have emotional trauma, it's just really common in people who have emotional trauma. You don't need to fit every symptom to have a mental illness.",Cobalt-Royal,ujabxw
1,"I have very strong interpersonal issues and am very clingy. People cut me off a lot and I seek revenge often, if not always. I have intense impulsivity issues.  I physically cannot be alone and have that problem of having no interests and being always bored when I am alone. That was allegedly enough to clear the bar for BPD. 

The shrink diagnosed me after a few questionnaires, a chat with an ADHD specialist and 2 hours. I asked her at the last session (I believe the 9th or 10th) if she still stuck with her diagnosis, she said yes. She also tagged along ""possibly-clinical depression"" for good measure.

2,"That's fair. I'm also being a bit hard on you. Having a new diagnosis is always really hard, too.

Let's look at some questions regarding emotional disregualtion, because everything else does sound like BPD, but at the same time, it can always be due to other causes.

Maybe think these over and see if things start falling into place for you or if the BPD diagnosis still seems wrong ro you:

Have you asked anyone in your friends or family if they've noticed you have strong emotions?

How often do you lose your temper?

How often do you yell?

How often do you cry?

Do you get really excited about stuff to the point where you're yelling or jumping around?

How many times do you switch moods throughout the day? My neurotypical partner once told me he's usually in the same mood throughout the entire day and I was shocked. I have BPD and yeah. Different mood like... every hour? Every few hours? But each person is different. Like lots of neurological people can be moody.

Why do you think people cut you off?

In what ways do you seek revenge? I'm going to go ahead and say that's not a very healthy way of doing things. Doesn't necessarily say you have BPD but it does sound like it's related to a possible mental health issue.

These aren't necessarily ways to diagnose yourself or undiagnose yourself. They're just exploratory questions for you to see if you can understand yourself a bit more. But maybe they'll help you understand your doctor or dispute them if needed.

Hope this helps!",Cobalt-Royal,ujabxw

Deep breath.

You need to vent a bit somewhere safe. Even the odd primal scream in the woods might make you feel a bit better, not a cure but it might take the steam out a bit.

Other than that you really need someone to talk to where any fear of hospitalisation isn't present. No friends that might be that non-judgemental ear? Depending on where you are there are also some good help lines or PTSD charities that might be a good ear too.

The ideation to end it? Of course, I might be taking a risk here but I see that as a normal part of the process of being you. It doesn't always last and is really driven by a deep desire to NOT be you and you can only say that because of the memories you have that are negative. Again completely understandable. Just be aware that it can spiral downwards as a repetitive thought. That's very exhausting to have those thoughts every time you feel triggered or down.

Here's one key that applies to people having too many thoughts creating a desire to control or suppress them. Suppressing them can be the problem more than those thoughts actually exist being the problem. The tremendous desire to suppress them is probably more exhausting than having the thoughts in the first place! In other words, those thoughts are stressful when you're inside of them. They seem real and valid. If you manage to find a moment of peace and suddenly those thoughts come, look at them as if they are just a machine working in your head to try and make yourself feel in control. Let it go. It's going to happen anyway. The thoughts will come, and they will go. Allow them to go even if they seem stubborn and are sticking around. Put them in a place where you realise they are not who you really are. They are like a machine kicking off when the on button has been pushed. Kind of like a knee jerk reaction of the brain. You can practice this every day just by being aware of it rather than trying to control it. Be aware of it but it's really just babble in the background.

There is another part of you that isn't this. A deep and relevant part that can access something else other than thinking about bad thoughts.

With the PTSD you can try some of the trusted and true methods that bring your attention to the things around you. When you feel yourself going into a PTSD mode do things like look at the walls and their colour. Describe the light in the room. Use sensing as a way to connect with the reality of where you are rather than the thoughts in your head. Run cold water over your hands is another good one. It focuses your brain on the relevant and immediate world.

I make a sin wave with my hand, and say: Normal people's emotions are like this. I exaggerate the sin wave and say: My emotions are like *THIS*.

Edit: I'll actually add some context here. I have a BPD friend irl who understands why that one time when my SO asked for sex I actually just wanted to cry and cut myself, or that time when I started stabbing the butter because he wasn't using knives in it properly. And we can laugh about that to a certain extent. But no one without a mental disorder will ever understand. I hide my appointment letters when people come over, and I'm 'out' to a few people, but when they ask how I'm doing I make some shit up and feed them a bit about work or therapy or whatever but with the general feeling of 'Everything is great and my life is going well'. Because people don't want to know that it isn't.

Also, I find that if I talk about it with my SO too much, I end up using psychology terms too often and feeling like a crazy person. Words like 'dissociation' don't help. I use 'zone out' a lot instead to try to make it more relatable. Not sure if that helps.",,3fz33r

I've been incredibly blessed (or lucky, not sure which) to have a supportive family and boyfriend that I can talk candidly with about my inner struggles, therapy, etc. Then again, I'd probably talk about those to random strangers if given to chance (I have issues with boundaries and can't really judge when I'm being TMI).

They actually used different names when they talked - they used their middle names, because they thought it would keep people from finding out they were cheating on their spouses). At that time, I thought she had multiple personality disorder (or dissociative identity disorder?).  This was a period of about 5 years that I saw this come and go, and it was very weird.

And if you behave trustworthy, you will earn other people's trust, no matter what your DX.  Same goes for them. They need to earn your trust as well.",,3fz33r
0,"Been then dude, with a coworker as well. Except they wanted nothing to do with me romantically.



This is causing you distress. That‚Äôs a sign you need to try to let go. What I did first is deleted their number out of my phone as well as all our conversations, so I could never text them first (but they have my number so they can text me). That was a good first step as it decreased my ability to give into temptation. Of course, I still see them at work, which is hard. But I figured instead of going cold-turkey cold-shoulder (I‚Äôve also noticed they give me far less attention now, so I think they‚Äôre trying to get some distance), I would lessen my contact with them bit by bit. It‚Äôs helping so far. I think and obsess over them less. It‚Äôs still very difficult, but it‚Äôs gradually getting easier.

I don‚Äôt live in NYC but I asked if they knew of any clinicians in my city that they would recommend and they gave me a whole list.

1,"""NHS"" stands for ""National Don't Ask Don't Get Help Service"" (somehow). You have to find out exactly how the system works for your particular problem you're experiencing in your area. What's the process? Who runs that step in the process? Where are they located? What criteria do they expect me to meet to be eligible?

Then you need to ask and ask and ask until you get what you asked for. Particularly so for mental health.

GPs are generalists. They know a little about everything. One thing they know very little about, even those who say they're mental health experts, is borderline (aka emotionally unstable) personality disorder. Part of the reason for this is that the behavioural traits are so often hidden to everyone but a small group of close friends and relatives or the person's partner that it would never be evident to a stranger in a public setting.

In many NHS trusts the people you want a referral to are the ""complex needs service"". Find out if you have a version of that. If you're desperate for an official diagnosis that can usually only be issued by a psychiatrist and in some cases a clinical psychologist. Research the difference between the two. To make out how to make the process work for you you have to understand the process.

Alternatively you can book a video appointment with someone on Harley Street if you want a lot less hassle and a quicker answer.",The_RealMe,fsrwsn

0,"I'm not a parent. I want to be clear that my perspective is that of your daughter. My dad also did/does his best and I'm blessed to have a mom who is endlessly patient and giving (well... maybe not endlessly). My sister is also diagnosed BPD.

1) Therapy can be incredibly healing. My traumas don't come from my dad as much as other situations from my life. It's tempting to make that the line in the sand, but I encourage you to be aware that the ""as long as it's not therapy"" line might discourage your daughter from being as mentally healthy as possible.

2) You are aware of yourself enough to search for answers outside your own experience. That puts you *miles* ahead of other parents, even those without and diagnosed mental obstacles to overcome. Your daughter(s) are lucky to have a parent who cares to be a kind, loving, and capable parent.

3) I also happen to be high-functioning and high-anxiety. My teenage years were mostly small redirects from my parents. We set ground rules and agreed together on consequences if the rules were broken. Getting buy in from her is vital. My sister on the other hand is a wild child. Her BPD manifested in ways that made setting those boundaries next to impossible. My parents went through years of family and individual therapy to keep her as safe as possible. The bar went from ""high-acheiving"" to ""as long as she's a productive member of society"". As my parents learned to give her independence, she stumbled. But every time, my parents offered her love while not enabling her, and now she's stable.

4) Sorry this comment is so long. I hope you found it useful. Ultimately, violence = bad and clear boundaries with reasonable consequences = good. And of course, be mindful to offer praise. Remind them you love them frequently. Otherwise, it sounds like you've got this.",voteforpatty,gzchx0

To be clear, we both have therapists and psychiatrists. She is also shortly about to get much more help through a state funded service.

As I read your reply, I realized we do a lot of that. We've always kept an open policy, with no shame. If we issue an edict, policy, rule, etc. the kids know that if they feel part of it is unfair, we discuss it. We have actually taken their input and applied it from time to time. I was raised to ""believe"" that my opinion didn't matter, that they were infallible and if they weren't, I had no right to speak up. Beyond that, I don't understand the whole mystery of parenting. We tell our kids what to do, but we aren't afraid to tell them why.

Also in reading it, I think I realized the problem. It's me. I have a HUGE problem being a disciplinarian. I hate telling people what to do. And I hate making my kids unhappy.

Be careful where you dig on the internet as there are a lot of people who cast us as 'evil' or 'manipulative' and conflate that with a BPD thing.

Also very important to note, stating your needs and asking others to help you be safe and comfortable and to have those needs met is not manipulation.

0,"Hello Maivan,

That sounds very confusing and painful for you.  I'm sorry you're feeling this right now.

You say your boyfriend was there at the diagnosis and through the tough times, so I can imagine he has quite a good understanding of what you need and what triggers you.  I'm confused that he would just leave so coldly, knowing about the BPD, you must feel bewildered.

Maybe you could ask him to give you an honest explanation of why he left so that you can begin to process and heal?

My biggest advice when someone leaves... Stop looking at social media, pictures, stuff.  Anything that relates to them.  Have extreme self control and refuse the compulsion.  The longer we look at things, the more our brain tricks us into desperation that we need that person back.  It tricks us because love releases dopamine and it wants that hit.

Secondly, remember who you were.  What did you love doing?  I like going for woodland walks in the rain, knitting, eating nachos at the cinema on my own, singing on Smule, meeting up with friends for drinks, having random adventures like a train to the beach etc!

Try to incorporate sociability into your life regularly, even if this is just taking a trip to the shops.  It keeps me rational and helps me keep perspective of things.

Own your triggers and unhealthy coping and AVOID.  I like drinks with friends but I won't be doing that during a break up because I KNOW it's a binge excuse.

Take care of yourself.

 Also you can look up dialectical behavior therapy techniques and start doing some on your own, that‚Äôs what the woman who assessed me recently suggested until I can get into a therapist. 
 Other than that there‚Äôs all the distracting stuff that might help, regular exercise, hobbies etc. I know those aren‚Äôt always useful in the midst of an episode or breakdown though but at the least it can be ways to give your brain more dopamine which can be beneficial. 
 Another thing, I know this is not easy either, especially when your suspicious of how they really feel, but trying to talk to your boyfriend, trusted friends and or family can be helpful. If you can allow yourself to be vulnerable and open with them it can work as a sort of exposure therapy. 
 It all takes work and dedication because it seems so hard to control ourselves or our emotions but we can do it!

1,"Yeah I feel it too. Was diagnosed with unclassified schizophrenia when I was 20. Last year not long after my 25th birthday I was diagnosed with BPD. It did provide some clarity, as my whole life's behavior pretty much fit the typical description of BPD... Rage, suicidal depression (even a few attempts), addiction to self-harm, splitting (black and white, all or nothing thinking), dissociation, intense fear of abandonment (real or imagined)... These days I live in isolation, only talking to team speak buddies I've been gaming with for years (I guess I dig the somewhat anonymity of it)... I used to have a decent social life with several people I would call my friends, but I guess my drama scared them all away. I literally have no friends IRL. I feel unable to relate to anyone in my family, immediate or distant, and I don't trust them much. If I didn't need them right now, I'd cut ties (honestly I fantasize a lot about the idea of pseudo-suicide, where I could disappear without anyone attempting to search for me...)... I guess my lack of socialness stems from ""fear of abandonment"". I'm afraid if I get close to someone, and they get to know who I really am, they will run away like everyone else, so I don't even bother. Its lonely sometimes, other times I'm quite confident that I want nothing to do with humanity. Lately though I've been dealing with extreme and irrational anger.

Whether you believe me or not, that right there is a huge step in the right direction.  There is no 100% miracle drug and there are non-medication-related changes that are critical if you want to heal.

Hotheadnesses versus someone Cries a lot or someone with a mix of emotion based traits) than others, people who have a vice vs people who self harm versus people who do both, people who physically versus mentally self harm, etc etc. it can be very complicated but there are plenty of things most of us have in common. 
I'd recommend joining a community (which is basically what you're doing rn, this is a community, welcome :D ) and just checking out what other people say about their own issues, especially if they're alike to your own. 
I wouldn't recommend open forums about bpd (that include people who aren't bpd) because too often I personally find them crowded with misinformed prejudice that can be very hurtful.
The nice thing about bpd is that the bad parts of it are extremely treatable, especially via DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) and group therapy. You can also take meds for it, but there's no one medication for someone with bpd, so often people have different and unique assortments of medication that work for them, and some don't use meds at all.
Also, I haven't read too much about it so I'll let you do your own research, but ""complex PTSD"" may or may not be a related condition that could lend insight into bpd.

0,"I'm bipolar with bits of BPD.  I've been medicated for the bipolar for over a decade but recently switched my meds up a bit and it seems to be helping with some of the BPD. I also did weekly therapy for two years that helped and made a mental list of ways to handle intense emotions. Some things that I've found help are running, writing, painting and watching TV. Also, allowing myself to have emotions and knowing that they will pass is incredibly helpful. Romantic relationships are problematic for me and I can't see myself being in a functional one right now. However, I feel like I am getting better about feeling abandoned which is good. I'm starting DBT soon (just got off the wait list) so hopefully that will help.

1,"I'm BPD with Bipolar II-though I'm not quite sold on that second diagnosis yet. The DBT waiting lists around here are all 2+ years, and I definitely don't have the money for private therapy. What I've found the most helpful is 1-being single. Which sucks! I've been a chronic 'serial-reltionship(ist)' for my whole life, and it always stood in the way of getting better. Being single allows me to go through the wild ups and downs without taking it out on anyone, and without the guilt that causes. 2. I'm currenlty on 900mg Lithium and 300mg Wellbutrin, with 1 mg Lorazepam as needed. It took awhile for my psychologist and I to find the right meds and doses that work for me. And lastly 3. I've done so much research on BPD I could start my own library. I've got most of the books on the topic, have seen every documentary, have done all the DBT self help workbooks, and have even taken a 'loving kindness' course at a Zen Buddhist centre, as Zen Buddhism is a big part of DBT.

0,"I can tell that you genuine love your partner and I'm really happy you want to help.

First and foremost, if you want to be there for him, you need to be understanding and have a lot of patience like never before. Some may argue that you're his girlfriend not his punching bag or that you're not his therapist BUT THE THINGS IS WE DIDNT ASK FOR THIS EITHER. That's the number one thing. Never expect a person with bpd to be able to rationalize or not get carried away with their emotion because that's asking them to act normal a.k.a without bpd. So whenever he is in an episode, you need to figure out if he's the type that needs space or the type that you need to be pushy with. As his girlfriend, Im sure you know him better.

Next, we have a black and white mentality, an extreme one, and it can always change or be two things at once (the term is ""splitting""). Do you get me here? For example, there are times when Im so affectionate to my boyfriend but a single wrong statement or action (no matter how small) will turn the switch from ""god, i love you and i wanna marry you"" to ""i hate you so much. I knew i shouldn't have been in a relationship with you. I need to leave you asap. Good bye. Let's break up."" One way of dealing with this is to assure him that you understand, and overwhelm him with your love depending on his love language (actions, material, words, etc.) My boyfriend always gets me back to myself whenever he kisses me passionately or buys all the food I love haha. It's simple things like that which can mean a lot. 

There may be times he'll seem distant or want to break things up. Please know he DOESNT mean it. He's just having an episode. Assure him you're not going anywhere. In this situation, you're gonna have to learn from experience on which is the better route: talking to him until he's out of the episode or give him space until he comes back and apologizes. Which, judging from your post, is what he does. This will happen LOTS of times and I ask you to not get tired of it, please. And never doubt yourself or take it personally. My boyfriend used to blame himself or ask me if his love isnt enough and it broke my heart. Never ever take it personally, please. And never show your partner that you take it personally because later on, this will be a baggage for them and become another reason why you'll be better off without them.

That's all I can say for now but please dont shy away from asking advice or anything. You can tell me specific situations you need help with and I'll happily help out. Having bpd is so exhausting and destructive, which is why I admire people who actually loves us. Im here for you both.",bpdgal,eo07oc
1,"Holy shit, a lot of that is so similar to how he is too! That‚Äôs crazy! He will sometimes snap in a second from I love you to, him being the complete opposite over things that are small to me but big to him. I‚Äôve been with him three years, and I do see how patience has always always helped. Yesterday, we were fine and cuddling and then I said something about going home so my family can take care of me (I‚Äôve been sick the last couple months and been staying with him as he takes care of me, I feel guilty bc he spends his own money on medicine and shit for me since I haven‚Äôt had a decent pay check in months) and I wanted to get that stress of paying for my stuff off of him. He completely changed got really mad and I just reassured him I understood it was okay and I gave him the chance to just let all his emotions out. Then everything was fine again and he apologized. He always does, he will always feel bad about it later. There was another time he just needed space over a year ago and that was hard on me but I let him just do him for a few weeks until he texted me saying he needed me and missed me and stuff like that. It seems he feels over whelmed a lot with human interaction. He also gets tired of his best friends and family. Sometimes he will say he just wants to go away from everyone and start over. It hurts but I know it‚Äôs something he can‚Äôt really help. It does make it easier knowing it is BPD and that he‚Äôs not just doing this by choice if that makes sense. It‚Äôs hard I don‚Äôt really talk about it to those close to me bc from an outsiders perspective he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a good bf‚Äù but he is. He always has been.

1,"I know what you mean when you say ""I always thought it would make others view meas less capable.."".          
 That thought did run through my mind. If I tell them what I experience will it make them walk on egg shells around me or make me seem unstable as an employee? Reason 1.) Personally I want mental illnesses to be openly discussed and to have more awareness surrounding them so there is no stigma. Reason 2.) I leave work sometimes. I have all sorts of panic/ anxiety attacks that unfortunately can dictate my behavior and that effects my job. 

 The reason I want to openly share with my work is probably because my job is a very ""family vibe"" and open about our personal struggles. We try and ask each other at the beginning of the week, ""What you need to know to be able to work with me."" Which gives us the chance to say things like ""My cat got sick this past weekend and I am very anxious about the whole process. So if I seem off with you all at work, that's why."" 

This idea to open up is still in the beginning stages of how I want to go about it because I don't want to make things worse. But at the same time, why not tell them? I am not ashamed of my BPD. It has caused me a lot of pain, confusion, and perseverance.

""Fully-functional adult"" is a loaded and possibly misleading term. The ""adults"" I know just have more rationalizations for their shitty child-like behaviors, and very little insight and self-reflection. They allow themselves to get away with a lot of shit, and they fake a large portion of the rest.

Now, I've read any number of your posts, and they are contain a level of wisdom and insight that far surpass most of the ""adults"" I've met. I think you're already doing a good job, and you deserve credit for the work you've put in so far.

In terms of your symptoms resurfacing: 
Here's one of the things I've learned about having BPD. If thought X is causing behavior Y, there's a reason for that, rational or not. It's up to the individual to pick apart what their subconscious is trying to tell them (or maybe get the therapist to help).

Hey, maybe you just need more time to be where you're at, and that's really OK, because you've come a LONG way.

I'm currently experimenting with giving myself permission to be ""stuck"", and not feeling guilty about it. It's not a permanent state, and it's nice to just ""be"" once in a while. I'm getting some surprising results from turning the pressure off.",,3hg2e9
1,"I'm not sure I get exactly where you're coming from or what you're asking but my first thought is, are you sure you're not being *too* tough on yourself and expecting too much rather than the other way around? It sounds like you think your progress is slowing/reversing. But two years ago you were undiagnosed, and two years isn't really that long to undo the previous thirty something years of the disordered thoughts and patterns of bpd. What progress exactly are you worried about undoing?  That part was unclear to me. 

Just a thought and if I'm off base, thats ok too. 

If you are feeling unsure and stuck, I'd completely suggest more therapy. As far as I know, with bpd you don't just do dbt, be better, and move on with life as a ""normal"" person. Again sorry if I'm misunderstanding your questions.",standarddev,3hg2e9
2,"1: Kudos to you for recovering as far as you have!

Ok, second. I used to really resent and get angry when professionals told me that BPD is a life long illness and you're basically just doing maintenance on it, but I think they're right after years of therapy, intropection, etc blah blah.

To a certain degree, even if you don't meet all of the criteria anymore, it can be assumed that you are wired a certain way. Even if you have learned to manage your emotions, impulses, thoughts and behaviors better, there are still going to be some times where you slip up and act HUMAN. Living with this is kind of like a marathon and less of a sprint. 

Also, recovery is kind of like treating acne. You've got some crap on your face, right? And obviously there is a hormonal imbalance causing the breakout and your pores are clogged. So what do you do? You treat it with medication. And initially, when you start treating it, your face look even WORSE than not using medication, because you are bringing everything out from underneath your skin in order to get rid of it. But after awhile, things start to clear up. Sometimes you'll have breakouts again, but they are fewer and farther between because you are still treating a chronic problem. 

I hope that was helpful and not just tangential.

I guess if the things I think of as ""crutches"" are working, there's no good reason to stop.

Just last night I was cooking dinner and I kept getting ahead of myself and trying to do things I wasn't ready for yet (I was planning to bread some chicken and I kept trying to put the chicken in the oven prematurely because I was flustered and distracted). 

I had to completely stop what I was doing, close my eyes, and walk myself through why this was not a big deal and there was no need to say horrible things about myself just because I was fumbling a little through dinner.

5,">celebrating my small victories, cutting as much slack for myself as I would for a friend, validating myself

FWIW none of those things sound like crutches to me. They sound like healthy, adaptive behaviors. 

""Real"" adults use these behaviors all the time. The skills of emotion regulation, distress tolerance, radical acceptance, self validation etc. may have been taught to them better as children, or may come to them more naturally, or they may just need them less because their emotions and reactions aren't quite so intense... but small victories are worth celebrating. Being nice to yourself is great.

When I've said anything about autism she basically just says I'm neurodivergent and leaves it at that, although she has suggested that I take an ADHD assessment despite the fact that I was diagnosed with ADD twice before I was 17.

Stuff I mostly struggle with is who I told what (meaning I repeat myself a lot, I usually start stories with ""Did I tell you about x?"" To avoid that), keeping up with friends (sometimes weeks will go by without hearing from them but it'll feel like yesterday - I try to check my chats regularly for people I haven't caught up with in a while,  I never get movie/ show referances even when I've seen it multiple times (and if I haven't seen something in a while it's like watching it for the first time, only upside I see here lol), forgetting to feed my cats (don't worry, they remind me), forgetting to eat myself, or forgetting to take my meds, or doing those last 2 twice because I forget I already did them. 

There's probably a lot more, but I'm also crap at remembering stuff to give examples xD

Setting routines for stuff you forget has also been helpful for me

Best of luck with everything :)",Alcoholic-Pizza,ghd18e
4,Yeah I can relate most of my life is a blank I can't remember a lot of it and what I can remember is fuzzy and it doesn't help that I was gaslit most of my life I've had to ask my family about things that have happened I can only seem to remember the traumatic things which is like super fun(sarcasm) anyway idk if I can help beyond commiserating but I'm here if you need someone to talk to,,ghd18e
5,"I've had memory problems for a long time. My ex used to joke and say that its like being in ""50 First Dates"" being with me cause i'm so forgetful/forget things he shared with me or showed me. It was embarassing (and he also would use that against me so it was dismantling).

It scares me and I'm anxious I'm forgetting something a lot of times. It isn't TOO awful, but yeah its a problem and gets in the way of functioning sometimes.",,ghd18e
6,I have had trouble remembering my own address,,ghd18e
7,"So w/ the amnesia thing. Are you saying amnesia dissociation is a thing? Or are you saying that as two seperate things? If so it sounds like I could possibly have that. I relate to literally every memory issue you just listed on there. Esp when you said ""you don't remember places you've been to."" I went to SC beaches many years when I was young. I""m only 19 now but I stopped going when I was ;probably about 7 years old. As much as I loved that place, there are certain details of the area I just can't remember. Like for ex, my mom mentioned that there is this one shop that we pass by all the time on this street, she even remembers the street name, but I don't. And maybe part of it was because I was young and wasn't paying attention to things like that, but you would think if we've been to the same beach area quite a few times I would've at least remembered what the shop building looked like but I don't. But she was talking to me about it because we were thinking about going back this year and she asked if I remember the shop and what it looked like and I just for the life of me couldn't remember. And the same thing will happen for college/school related things. I'll study for tests all day, and then can't remember a thing I studied the day of the test. And while keeping in mind even tho I only studied a couple of days, at least that's what usually happens, I would still think I would be able to remember at least a little bit. And I think part of the issue is I stay up all the night before, or the night before that sometimes it would be two or three nights in a row pulling an all nighter because I have really bad time management skills, but anyways, I would stay up all night then I would be so tired the next morning and my brain was probably so tired that I just couldn't remember anything which is really frustrating esp if the quiz/test/exam is a big part of your grade which that happened to me several times through my last fall semester. Which is why I had to drop out. But what is dissociative insomnia? I haven't heard of that. Since you haven't heard of it, if you want I can't ask my therapist or psychiatrist about that. They seem to know their disorders pretty well.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
8,I have a feeling that I was sexually abused when I was young but don‚Äôt remember it.,,ghd18e
9,"Well that might be a trauma response. My therapist talked to me about trauma responses last Friday and that's what that sounds like. If you did have abuse during your childhood, your probably trying to co er it up. I think it's your brain's way of a coping w/ the trauma is what I'm trying to get at. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure that's what that is because that's how my therapist described what was going on w/ me. And you may have PTSD too because my therapist really does think I have that as we discussed last Friday as well. I say you might have PTSD because I know that is very much related to trauma response. I""m not trying to diagnose you wrongly, or just diagnosing you but it ius a suggestion tho. If you have a therapist/psychologist/psychatrist I would highly suggest bringing that up to them because when I brough it up it prety much clicked right away w/ my therpaist on why I was doing the things I was doing.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
10,"EXACTLY WHAT I GO THROUGH!!! So my therapist always ask if my dad and I or if my sister and I have had any arguments/fights/blow ups this week on Friday and I can never remember because I block it out. She told me that was most likely a coping mechanism thing. So that's probably what your doing too and you're probablt doing it unconscioulsy because I know I do it unconciously. And I'll forget so often that it'll be like ten mins after the argument even tho I'm still mad/frustrated whatever the negative feeling is, I'll ususally text my bf about it and I can't even remember all of the details of why I was mad in the first place.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
11,"Thank you! This was helpful knowing someone can relate to the issues I'm having. I also agree my memory is getting pretty terrible and the worst part about it is I'm only 19 and I have plenty of more years to go and I don't want it almost half gone by the time I'm in my 20's or 30's. I've mentioned it to my psychologist (or therapist? I've always been confused about what to call her) but anyways, she thinks its something related w/ BPD and I wouldn't be surprised either. I'll have to do some looking around to see if people w/ BPD have similar issues. But from the examples you gave literally EVERYTHING on this list I relate too. I hardly remember to feed my cat and the bad thing is she doesn't remind me when she needs to be fed. Thankfully my mom is there to help out w/ that part. But w/ other things, I try putting things down in my planner for college stuff that didn't work so I switched to setting reminders on my iPad/phone and that still didn't work because I have an issue where I ignore the reminder. It's like I see it so I acknowledge to myself that I see it but then I slide the notification up and then I end up either completely forgetting about it or not remembering until the night of when the assignment/paper and/or test/quiz/exam was due. Which can be extremely frustrating esp if it heavily impacts your grade. My therapist is usually good w/ coming up w/ solutions to my issues but this one we've been struggling w/ for quite a while. It would also happen during hs which is partially the main reason why I almost didn't graduate and I honestly probably wouldn't have if it weren't for my amazing counselor that I had there. But for the communicating w/ friends/family or just people that I'm close to I also have the same issue of ""Did I tell you about the time... or did I tell you this already?"" It's very frustrating and I feel bad for the person esp if I've said it a million times which will happen very often too. Although most of the people who I'm close w/ or talk to often have gotten used to it by now and know that I have this disorder so they're pretty understanding about it THANK GOD for that lol.  But for that situation I'm almost starting to wonder if I should write down the important stuff that I either want to tell, or have already told them so I don't have to constantly repeat myself. I also tend to forget things about important people esp when it comes to someone I'm dating. I'm trying my best atm not to forget the important things about the current bf that I have so I'm thinking I should write these things down. But I still have no solution for the college issue which sucks.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
12,"Thank you that means a lot!! And yes I know how you feel, it's weird like I said above this response, I'll block out fights and what not but I'll remember most of the negative things that happen in my childhood. Whenever I meet someone new, and most of the time I do this w/ a guy, and they ask me to tell me about myself, or what my life's story is, I always hate that question because there were so many stressful things that happened, most of them pretty traumatic unfortunately, and I always feel like that's all I can say my life was as a child and is now which really sucks I wish I could come up w/ something different but it's always so hard to.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
13,"Yea my exes would use that against me as well. Although of course I can't think of any examples where he used to do that to me but I know basically all of them but one did that to me. It was really frustrating. And when I was in school, all throughout grade school I would have a small friend group, all of them were girls, and they would talk during lunchtime or recess, and I would always zone out of the conversation because they would talk amongst themselves and they would never talk to me. I can't even think of one time where they actually sat down and had a real conversation w/ me which is pretty sad. And the only time it happened was when me and my best friend were alone at the lunch table and everyone else was absent or taking a test or doing whatever. But anyways something funny would happen and I would always ask what's so funny? and then because I would zone out I wouldn't remember what they said and they would always say the same shit to me, ""oh it's nothing, or nevermind"" and that pissed the lving daylights out of me. I was so angry and furious when they did that to me. And now my sister does that same sort of bs to me and because that's happened to me when I was younger I act like it's a big deal because it technically is since people did that to me, but she never understands no matter how many times my mom explains it to her. My mom used to do that as well but she doesn't anymore now because I told her what happened a couple of years ago and she understands why I act like that now. But my family does it to me too (family outside of intermediate family) and I don't talk to them about any mental health issues I have except for my cousin, well my one cousin. Sometimes I talk to my cousins sister, which would be my other cousin but I don't talk to her about the deep stuff.  I just really hate it honestly.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
14,"Ok so I don't have trouble memorizing my address, but if someone says take me to your house I wouldn't be able to do it. And while I agree w/ my parents part of the reason is because I""m on my phone all the time while I'm in the car, but even when I""m paying attention, I try to remember how to get home from where we are and I won't be able to do it. I only know how to get to 2 places out of many places in my town and it's really annoying which is why I""m worried about getting my license because even when I use GPS I stil struggle really really bad w/ directions esp since the GPS is always facing the opposite way your going most of the time so I always have to turn it around and when I don't remember to turn the map around that's when I get extremely  confused.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
15,"I mean it‚Äôs different for everyone so, but yes amnesia is a bpd symptom and it maybe suggests that you were dissociated at a time when you should have been making a memory.",,ghd18e
16,I'm so sorry to hear that! The uncertainty must be so difficult üò© I've forgotten a massive chunk of my abuse but it lasted until I was 14,jaycakes30,ghd18e
17,"Yea it def sounds like a coping thing your trying to do maybe w/out even realizing it. I love psychology I'm very much into it, in fact it's my maj in college rn. But look at the comment I posted on your last reply. That should help I hope!",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
18,Well not like but upvoted,sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
19,"This is very common even in those who don't have BPD. Your brain protects you by  'forgetting' the sexual abuse, but the trauma eventually resurfaces through nightmares, and/or flashbacks. Then you start piecing those together and get the memories back once you're emotionally ready to accept and deal with it.",kalamity23,ghd18e
20,"yeah I def know what you mean. I dissociate especially when there is more than one person speaking at a time. If I'm trying to interact with someone and there's too much going on I can't focus. I get easily overwhelmed and people don't really get it.  
I also used to dissociate when I was working retail jobs with artificial lighting and always caught myself zoning out staring to the only natural light source that would be in the establishment.  
I think its just a safe way for us to rescue ourselves when we're not content/overwhelmed. I've been more conscious of it and I've also figured out a way to work for myself and hold myself accountable.",,ghd18e
21,oh really it is? I had no idea it was a symptom of it. I'll have to ask my therapist about that to see if she knew that it was a symptom cause she said she also has bpd too. Where did you find out it was a symptom? Or did you find out from a doctor and they told you?,sophiebeanzee,ghd18e

23,It is extremely difficult esp knowing what your not going to remember the next day. And idk if you've seen my recent responses from other's comments above but it def plays a big part of my education stuff.  Which is extremly frustrating to deal with!!!,sophiebeanzee,ghd18e

26,"What strategy worked best for you? I'd love to know cause I notice the problem still continues to happen, more consistently now esp when I was in my first semester of college.

27,"Since I've been in therapy and addressed this coming up, I've been told/recommended to try and catch myself in those moments. When you notice yourself drifting/spacing/leaving your body and brain, to notice and then use a grounding technique. Taking a few deep breaths, redirecting your consciousness to your feet, noting the sounds around you perhaps. Grounding can work differently for everyone, but I hope you can find whats best for you.  
I also started using a meditation app just sitting down 12-15 minutes either in the morning or the evening helps stabilize me.  
PS. sorry I'm slow to respond.",,ghd18e
28,"Hey np I respond late too! Lol. But my therapist who lead a group called DBT mentioned the grounding skill. She mentioned the bringing yourself back to center she said it was called being in the present moment, I forget the exact name but I remember that phrase being mentioned. I never really tried it. I always claimed that those types of skills never really worked for me. But I thought that because I was actually afraid it wouldn‚Äôt work. I didn‚Äôt really know if it would work or not cause I never really tried it. But hearing it from someone else who was outside of my DBT group and saying it worked for them, I might actually consider trying it this time! What‚Äôs the meditation app you use? Is it Headspace? Cause I still have a subscription that app. I‚Äôve never used it. I paid for a subscription to it and then I checked it out cause I thought it was like a brain workout type of app but it was just the meditation stuff and at the time I wasn‚Äôt into meditation. But honestly even tho I‚Äôm not into meditation I might as well just try it. It couldn‚Äôt hurt plus I have a bf who‚Äôs very supportive in me with my mental health stuff so maybe I can get him to do it with me. But I think I might mention to my therapist p, current therapist that I have now that I need to work on those skills again. Maybe 5-10 mins each day or something like that.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e

0,"I've been scolded for this at jobs before. I also have a very distinct memory of a friend yelling at me in a restaurant because she was upset with me and I literally just sat there and stared at her, which made her more angry. Like you say, I had legitimately done something to upset her and I couldn't bring myself to apologize or even explain. It was like I was just blank. She was like ""Don't you have anything to say? Aren't you even going to stand up for yourself?"" And I just said ""no not really"". I feel so much better knowing someone else has gone through that and that it's likely a symptom of my BPD.

0,"I want to be honest with you, we can't change overnight and most of our changes can take up to months or years. What does your therapist think about you getting back together with her? He is right that you need to work on yourself and take care of yourself before you take care of her. I want to say (for my sake) that it would be okay to get back with her, unfortunately, if she's not truly open to getting the help she needs or willing to change dramatically, you'll be stuck in the same cycle all over again.

A suggestion you could propose is to be there for her as a friend and a supporter, but say you both have things that need to change before getting back together is a viable option. 

In my experience it takes something rattling my world to realize how badly I have fucked up. Biggest thing is, you cannot enable her, no matter what, friend or significant other. She needs to know what she is doing is not okay, and you won't stick around if she doesn't start taking accountability for what she is doing.

It's a long winding treacherous road my friend, be sure you are well prepared if you choose to stay with her, she will need your help.",Moklov,422lkj

0,"I understand. I had to deal with my family minimizing my mental health most of my life. 

You are suffering, and only having a diagnosis without professional help is not helping any. Your family cannot begin to understand what you are going through, and BPD actions are often seen as attention seeking or manipulative. What they can't see is what you're dealing with, and that your reactions aren't what you mean to put out. 

For now, the damage is done. You've apologized and tried to make it right - it sounds like they just don't understand. And to be fair? We suffer from a kind of insanity at times and it's difficult to interpret if you don't know much about BPD.

Give this a few days. And work on finding resources to help not just you but them too. It took years for my family to come around - and they were the source of my trauma. Trying to get my mother to understand and respect boundaries was an uphill battle. I would advise trying to find some books - a DBT skills workbook is a great place. There's also some great books to read, I would start with is ""Sometimes I Act Crazy: Living with Borderline Personality Disorder"" by Hal Straus and Jerold Jay Kreisman. Stay far away from BPD books that paint us in a negative light, like ""Walking on Eggshells"". Read the user reviews before purchasing.
