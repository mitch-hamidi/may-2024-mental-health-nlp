1,"I personally do not take any drugs. Drugs are a psychiatrists bread and butter. They all have side effects. Some horrible. I read about bpd in books, articles, facebook, reddit, you tube videos, etc. It has all helped me understand and work daily on my issues. Drugs were so harmful to me and I would never take another.",Murky_Comparison1992,17n8u9k
2,"They had me on 200mg daily and it really fuckin killed my spirit. Maybe coupled with a specific therapy its good but tranquilizing me didn‚Äôt fundamentally change anything fucked up about my head, only how much i could feel it / do about it. Which in a way made it more frustrating‚Ä¶ i couldnt get release. I might as well have been paralyzed for that time being.

BUT i have afrid and been relatively malnourished since i was a kid so it was superrrr beneficial for keeping weight on me because no other substance makes me eat and hold food down like that. I really miss that aspect i could eat so much and not get nauseous and it didnt hurt to sit down quickly from my ass being so goddamn boney you can hear a glass cracking sound affect when i bump into anything. Fuck honestly maybe ill start taking a low dose again i really dont enjoy falling apart like this lmfaoo",,17n8u9k
0," 1. Personally mood stabilizers were the medications with least side effects i ever had to take. I take (lamictal - lamotrigine 400mg) and I‚Äôve never had a side effect. But its better to talk to your doctor and see what would work for you. 

2. I‚Äôve gone through many doctors who diagnosed me with things like severe anxiety and depression but it always believed i had something else that isn‚Äôt explained by their diagnosis. Until i found a doctor that i really felt comfortable with and liked her so much. I‚Äôve seen her regularly for about 2 years now and it took her a year to diagnose me with bpd with therapy lots of tests (hormones tests, brain scans, adhd tests and  many other to eliminate other diagnoses). Also she took care of over all health like making sure i don‚Äôt have any deficiencies. 

Its a process but its worth it. When you find the right doctor and therapist for you it gets better and more comfortable ü´Çüíú",Informal-Loan3063,17sfn6l
1,"i cried reading this, my step mum is a mental health nurse and she struggled to help me through the diagnosis process. i‚Äôve known for years it‚Äôs BPD but being diagnosed is so difficult. i went through the same of so many doctors and it‚Äôs painful knowing it isn‚Äôt just depression and anxiety is so hard. thank you and i am so proud of you x",Conscious-State8918,17sfn6l
2,The problem is some people do have depression and anxiety with bpd so doctors just rush through the first diagnosis which is terrible for patients. Like yes i do have them but thats not all. I‚Äôve gone through 5 different doctors until i found one i really like mainly because she looked very deep for a diagnosis and did lots of testing and she usually takes care of my health in general and she told me even vitamin or mineral deficiency might mess me up emotionally so she monitors my overall health regularly. I know she is doing her job but i am honestly so grateful for her for doing it so perfectly. I pray and hope and wish you find a doctor that you are comfortable with cuz its the most important step.

Have you ever heard of.....?

I was wondering if I could bounce something off of you...?

I came across something online and was wondering if I could get your thoughts?

0,"For those who are saying to use different cleansers etc., that‚Äôs fine but not enough. 

The thing about lithium is that it can cause hormonal acne, which means the only thing that can really target it is prescribed medication. 

Furthermore, lithium breakouts and skin issues tend to last 6 months- 1 year as your body adjusts. You‚Äôll want stronger, longer lasting methods to deal with your skin. 

Book an appointment with your dermatologist and take pictures of your skin when breaking out. They can prescribe something that will treat the issue at a level that over the counter cleansers and face masks just cannot. ",ooooq4,b4wron
1,"I started to break out because it made my skin super dry. I'd suggest to start washing with a soap like Cetaphil or CeraVe, also if Neutrogena has a natural line that works amazing (at least for me). Use a lotion that's for normal to dry, vs just dry, because mine got greasy as well. Lithium is weird because it made my skin dry, but if I got too carried away my skin got greasy. Lol

As for the make up, go ahead! I used a moisturizing primer before putting on any kind of foundation. Don't get discouraged though, if your face still breaks out or doesn't get better. Some makeup (especially foundation) still made my skin dry and I broke out. Just experiment with different types. And remember to wash your face before you put your make up on and when you take it off. Also wash your make up brushes often. I didn't think to do that for a long time, and when I did start, my face looked so much better. 

Good luck! Hope this helps!",Tibbersbear,b4wron
2,I've been on lithium since august - it has been a lifesaver with my suicidal thoughts/moods.  I haven't had any skin issues...maybe since I'm older (ish) lol   Has anything else changed with your routine?  Might be hormonal change from the lith?,,b4wron
3,"I already have enough doctor appointments in my future though :( 

But for real thank you for the advice. I‚Äôm going to try sticking to my skin routine first and moisturizing everyday because I have an upcoming surgery, and zero free time until then. But if there‚Äôs no improvement, and once I‚Äôm not so poor, I‚Äôll have to find a dermatologist. ",LegendaryCatfish,b4wron
4,"This helps a lot! I have some expensive skin care stuff from winning ulta gift cards, and I got discouraged and haven‚Äôt been moisturizing as much. Maybe if I start up again it will help. I have been avoiding mirrors as much as possible, so you inspired me to suck it up for a minute and my skin is definitely dry. 

So watch out dbt group, I‚Äôm going to be glam as hell next time I show up hahah",LegendaryCatfish,b4wron
5,"I‚Äôm 30 and I‚Äôve never had acne like this. I had a hysterectomy but that was in May. I got some acne on my chin then but it cleared up pretty quickly, and when I used to get my period I broke out on my chin too. The new pimples are all over my cheeks. 

I did look it up because I remembered my friend was in the psych hospital with me years ago and lithium made him break out really badly. Apparently it‚Äôs a pretty common side effect, but it doesn‚Äôt happen to everyone.

You must be one of the lucky ones lol",LegendaryCatfish,b4wron
6,"Just keep it in the back of your head. 

Appointments suck I feel you. Plus the derm is never cheap. But my self esteem plummeted with lithium because of the breakouts. The prescribed medication was the only thing mitigating them enough for me to keep taking lithium. 

The breakouts associated with lithium can be more long term (6-24 months, mine was 2 years) hence why I drove home the whole idea of making an appointment now since it can take awhile to get into seeing a dermatologist. 

Feel free to dm me to get info on any of the prescribed topical medication I used and their copay cost. Or just about anything else skin related and lithium related. 

This part of lithium sucks and I‚Äôd be more than welcome to help out or offer support given that I was there. ",ooooq4,b4wron

0,"I don't know that either of these 2 points will bring you real comfort but

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

As you said, suicide hurts others, it's a painful grief, and still it's an outcome and a choice. And while you're here not choosing to die, perhaps a different team or treatment will eventually click. Do you make art or journal?",TranZeitgeist,i2asxt
1,"I feel you. I'm in a extremely bad place right now, things and situations are eating me alive from inside out, I can't control my horrible thoughts and paranoia, it's hurting a lot and it feels like I'm broken and empty and never going to recover. I know I've been there before and recover but every time this comes back it seems impossible and hurt even more, I don't want to live in this cycle. I can't eat properly, I can't think, I can't do things that I like, and don't know how much time it's gonna take. 
The only reason I don't kill myself right now is because my family will not ever recover, I don't even consider the possible happy and joyful things I could live if I didn't kill myself.
So, I feel you, that's all fucked up, it's too much for a person to endure, wish I could take this from me and from you.
If you wanna reach, we could talk everyday, know that you're not alone in this hurtful situation.
Sending love from here.",lun44tic,i2asxt

3,"Hi, Thank you for your thoughtful reply. 

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out. This hope is difficult to hold on to when you're constantly told to just go to therapy when it's clearly not addressing your current level of distress at all.",sarahthehumanperson,i2asxt
4,"Hi there, 
I don't want to say the cliched line 'I'm sorry you're going through that' which seems to be the standard automated response to someone sharing their pain, because it never makes me feel any better. I'll just say thank you for validating my experience and sharing yours. Sometimes things just suck and there's not a lot we can do about it. We don't need to be going through the exact same thing but just being able to be honest about how terrible things are and meeting in the middle through our mutual suffering is enough. I don't want to minimise how unique your situation is, but I will say that I definitely share a sense that I'm living purely out of obligation to my family and also that it feels pretty much impossible for me to feel any positive emotions, enjoy anything or relax completely without self-judgment, fear or paranoia setting in. I'm very inconsistent because of my moods (and I avoid interaction if I'm acutely anxious, depressed or angry), but would be happy to chat to someone with shared experience. Most people feel really overwhelmed by the weight of all this stuff.",sarahthehumanperson,i2asxt
5,"Hi there, thank you for your reply, validation and empathy. ditto.",sarahthehumanperson,i2asxt
6,"thank you so much for your kind words. yeah, we definitely don't need to be facing the exact sames things to validate the struggles and feelings of others. it's 'comforting' in a certain way to know that you're not alone at all and is not the only human ever to experience this kind of pain, it's too much to handle.
hope you feel better in the next days <3",lun44tic,i2asxt
0,"I am not sure why your doctor is prescribing clonazepam if you are having issues with everything feeling blunted.  By definition, that is what benzos do - slow down your nervous system.  I was on clonazepam (klonopin) for years for sleep, and I never realized how much it was dulling all the good emotions until I tapered off.  It was also causing me major depression and anxiety (and many other issues, which I never realized until I tapered off of it).  I was still prescribed klonopin when I got married 3 years ago, and I can tell you I ""love"" my husband so much ""more"" now than I ever did while on klonopin.  I couldn't believe how much I was missing by taking this medication.

Do you have the option of seeing another doctor?  For starters, an addict, even a clean one, is never supposed to be prescribed a benzo, as it can easily set off cravings for past addictions, especially alcohol.  (Benzos work on the exact same receptors as alcohol, so taking one can set off cravings for another, even if it has been years).  Additionally, your doctor has you on klonopin and adderall?  WTF?  She is stimulating your nervous system and slowing it down at the same time.  Yes, I know people who have been on this combo (I was once one of them), and considering how much damage klonopin did to my nervous system, I often wonder if being prescribed a stimulant at the same time is part of the reason my nervous system is completely fried from my prescribed dose of klonopin.

(Not only that, the dangers associated with long term benzo use are numerous.  These drugs were never safety tested past 4 months use.)

Please look into the ashton manual - the guide written by a doctor who helped hundreds of patients off of benzos who were physically dependent.  ( I don't know how long you have been on benzos, but I hope you don't have dependency issues yet!).  It also talks about what benzos do to the body, and the long term damage they cause.
