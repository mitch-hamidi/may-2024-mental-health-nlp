I completed a DBT program back in March and I am forgetting so much. If you're in the US, you may want to check out your local NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter. They often have peer led support groups. They aren't DBT specific but you're likely to run into our people and it's free. I believe there are online options as well.",Alainasaurous,17hg4nh

2,"It's a traumatising illness. You can have DBT, and for many, it helps manage ideations, emotional distress, emotional outbursts, and many other symptoms. It's not a case if you are cured. As humans, we rise, we fall, and fall many times, getting back up again with some sort of resilience. It's a very misunderstood disorder, and many form inaccurate judgments on bpd, which reinforce shame amongst us who suffer the daily pain and misery of sensitively and disregulated emotions. We only have ourselves to believe that we are not our mental health only. We are much more beyond that. We are deserving of love , compassion, and understanding. If loved ones can not tolerate us at our worst, then that is their choice. You learn the art of knowing that despite the negative traits/symptoms of bpd, it's a double-edged sword, we feel intensely, we love deeply, for we have lots to offer also, we aren't immune to LOVE, to be loved! It's important that we do not believe negative perceptions of us of this disorder that can increase our suffering. We have to create a loving relationship with ourselves. We can not rely on others for that. It is a difficult rd, one that is relentlessly trying, one that makes you feel very alone. Again, we can not rely on others' approval or acceptance. It's the patience, love, care, forgiveness, and  tolerance of ourselves that lesson suffering. 
                 It is dam well hard. Please be KIND and gentle to yourselves! üôè",,1blvdvy

0,"Dissocation is a criteria/common symptom of BPD and that scale is usually used to see what type of dissocation you are experiencing to help you with it. Like it's not usually used as it's own diagnostic tool or anything. I do have a dissociative disorder along with BPD and my therapist used that to see what symptoms were effecting my life the worst and how to help me the best. Dissocation can effect your life pretty severely and they are probably just trying to help you.

It scores for three things and each specific questions shows the specific they effect you. Amnesia which is pretty self explanatory, as well as depersonalization and derealization which is a disconnection from your sense of self/connection to reality, and last absorption factor which basically feeling like you loose yourself in things like watching shows or doing a task.

If this doesn't makes sense I can try and answer more questions if you have them.

Also some doctors don't really know much about dissocation so that may be why they didn't ask you to take it before,",ZoogieBear,164xo6o
1,"Thank you so much for responding, so helpful. Neither my psychiatrist or care coordinator explained anything - sort of a ‚Äúthere‚Äôs your homework, do that‚Äù attitude without any explanation so this is genuinely so good to know. 

Dissociation is something I‚Äôve experienced for as long as I can remember, but I didn‚Äôt realise it was so strongly associated with BPD, sure when I‚Äôm having a ‚Äúbad day‚Äù mentally, it‚Äôs way worse but I never really connected the dots between the two. 

My I received my initial diagnosis, it was during COVID season so imagine that will also be a factor in why I‚Äôve not taken it previously, as everything was a telephone appointment. 

Depersonalisation and derealisation are terms I‚Äôve heard previously however not clearly understood but your explain really does help. 

My score on the DES was 40, if I‚Äôve calculated it correct from a small Google search (add all % together and divide by 28) however I‚Äôm reluctant to see what this would mean ahaha. 

Thank you so much for sharing your experience of this with me, massively appreciated x",Ghostieeefizz,164xo6o
2,"In BPD dissociation is caused by high stress and emotional response so it's something they look into.

0,"r/BPD and r/borderlinepdisorder are the bigger subs, and r/bpdmemes is popular for memes.

When you're working with your therapist, what do you notice that makes it feel hard to share honestly? Maybe something in the way they look or react when you've shared in the past? When do you feel most comfortable being open?

Ultimately, if the goals you want to work on are being ignored, that seems like a problem.",TranZeitgeist,g5dvfe
1,"First off, the reason you're withholding information because, for one reason or another, you do not feel safe expressing how you feel. I've had tremendous difficulties expressing ""negative"" emotions such as anger and criticism towards a therapist. It's my experience that these always stem from our past experiences as children. Maybe it was not safe to express these emotions, maybe we were hit, gaslighted, guilt-tripped, shamed, or neglected when it comes to the expression of these emotions. So that's where the root of the problem is and it would be a good place to look for deeper understanding. It's very good that you have identified this problem. Therapy is about compatibility, sometimes changing a therapist helps. Sometimes the gender of the therapist makes a huge difference, we are projecting our relationship with our mother towards a female therapist, and our relationship with our father towards a male therapist. A good therapist is strong and encourages you to openly express your emotions, no matter how strong or ""negative"" (arbitrary label, no emotion is ever wrong or negative). My therapist openly told me not to hold back my anger because she identified that as a child I had to hide my ""bad"" emotions in order to prevent from being further emotionally abandoned by my parents. In a healthy family dynamic, all emotions are allowed to be expressed and relationships are genuine and honest. You need to find a way to recognize your true, forbidden emotions and finding an outlet for them. Often art is great at this.Here are a few resources to support communities:[https://www.facebook.com/groups/372949050115079](https://www.facebook.com/groups/372949050115079)[https://discord.gg/MyMCTq](https://discord.gg/MyMCTq)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5\_k5mlP0u0Q7C6IYpkPjHA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_k5mlP0u0Q7C6IYpkPjHA)

Please feel free to pm me if you need to :) Lastly, I want to add that emotions are what matter in therapy, banter is useless. Meaning, you can talk and analyze all day, but getting in touch with your emotions is where the real money is.",,g5dvfe
2,Thank you this is so helpful. I‚Äôve linked it to not being able to be assertive (from interpersonal affective ness in DBT) that I‚Äôm willing to compromise my objectives (getting real benefit from therapy) with ‚Äòpreserving‚Äô the relationship with him. I worry that as I am so sensitive to criticism/emotional intensity that he would be too. We had a much better session after I wrote that post and tried to be more authentic but it was hard. He said that every time I‚Äôm experiencing intense emotion I doubt and want to quit therapy. I messaged prior to the session saying I had used phone coaching to my skills group about my urges to quit therapy and he responded saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm glad you sorted your ambivalence towards therapy cos it makes my job a lot easier - looking forward to seeing you‚Äô and that made me really offended. I told him in the session and he said it was great I told him and it was a lighthearted joke to lighten the mood as he could hear my distress. It felt good being more authentic,lilmissclingy,g5dvfe
0,"I would change therapists. It shouldnt be like that. you can find someone that specializes in BPD, or at least has some experience in the field. You can go on psychology today and filter you choices using ur insurance & selecting BPD (in the issues section). Ive gone through a few therapists. One of them who actually was a bpd specialist, was still awful and my sessions w him reminds me of your situation. He wanted me to tell him how we should go about things, give suggestions about how to heal myself, without really giving a lot of suggestions himself. Hed let me sit in silence for extended period of time without saying anything to me (which i hated). I didnt feel like i was really going anywhere w him, and thats not how therapy is suppose to be. Not all therapists are equal, and not all therapists are gonna be good for you just bc they are for some else. Although it is a professional relationship, its still a relationship. So you gotta find one you like. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è",veyondalolo,hia96v
1,"How long have you been going to this therapist? Could it be possible maybe they aren‚Äôt the best fit anymore? I know anytime i was consistently doing therapy it would sometimes take a couple different ones but I found one who was able to help me. Also, I know it seems silly, but telling your therapist that you feel this way could help, they might understand exactly where you‚Äôre coming from. Like figuring this out could be the first step to figuring out everything else. You may click with this therapist like 100 but something is holding you back. Bottom line don‚Äôt feel silly for asking, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre there! I believe you can do it.

1,"When I did therapy we went through something called a 'pot form' it literally represents boiling pots, starting with cold water until the pot is boiling over in 5 stages. The analogy didn't give me much but the process of thinking through what happened and what lead to each stage was really revealing for me. I don't get angry often at all, but I do get overly anxious and in my head about things- over thinking. And by writing down the stages of the escalation I was able to see where I was religiously starting to escalate and could make a change to cause it to stop, for me watching something super light hearted or changing music is a biggy. Recognising what the stages were and what each escalation looked like meant I could cut it off before it got into 'too late to go back territory', since I realised this I have not once gone into the higher levels. Ultimately, once you recognise your levels, you can make a choice to stop escalating...if you know how.",chiarodiluna,1bxmt25

0,"Hi I‚Äôm 37 and have been living with BPD most of my life. Properly diagnosed when I was 24. First off, people with BPD can absolutely be good even amazing partners. We just have to work extra hard on our end to stay constantly aware of ourselves and how we perceive whatever current situation we are facing that is triggering us. The best possible skill you can learn is respect boundaries both your own and the boundaries of others. For us, a lot of it comes down to communication. How we convey and receive to and from our loved ones. We have to work extra hard to remind ourselves that we need to trust and know our partners love us. And on their end they have to also be willing to stay healthy and regulated as well as taking part in either personal or group therapy. The truth is‚Ä¶ we are a tall order. But we also, have the innate skill to love‚Ä¶ if we remind ourselves why we are doing this, it‚Äôs all out of love.
I myself am entrenched in a battle that is slowly degrading my partners will to keep going. 
I‚Äôve decided to take space after a big blow up. 
(This included splitting, devaluing, and the eventual ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù talk) and I‚Äôve been doing my best to calm myself physically and mentally while I let the emotions run it‚Äôs course. Im trying to be more observant rather than reactive. But I know deep down somewhere‚Ä¶ im losing someone I truly love and care about‚Ä¶ I honestly would not have revisited this BPD if it wasn‚Äôt for her. 
In that, makes her a great partner. But we are doing our best to keep ourselves healthy. And that comes first. Everything else, let them lay as they fall. And be ok in knowing you will be ok. Let it hurt. But do no harm.",Maximum_Primary6940,171nkeh

Then they feel bad because they hurt you is what you have to understand is it's not on purpose. I have been reading stuff to but I find a lot of it you have to read between the lines it's not a one size fits all. If your someone who needs to talk about it and she doesn't then ask her if she would be ok if you talked to someone about everything don't just do it the reason I she that is because my wife doesn't like if I tell people about the stuff we talk about. Which is completely fine with me. Some people may not be ok with  not talking to people about it. It  takes alot of  mind work for yourself to be ok doing it by yourself and the way I I'm doing it may not be for everybody but you may have to talk to other people about it my wife personally doesn't like when I share certain things about it and that's fine that's her choice and I respect her choices but you also have to remember that this isn't meant to be rude but may come off that way but look at it as this when they're in an episode it's  kind of like walking through a minefield but you just have to be careful that you don't step on what's going to trigger them. my wife normally likes when I'm super clingy likes but when she's in an episode she fuckin absolutely hates it it's because you have to read between the lines and stuff cuz like you can go read about it all you want but you have to find what work for you guys not what works for everyone else. all reality triggers are different for everybody sometimes it might not even be something you did it could be a season my wife I find it's more of the season like I said earlier but it is difficult you have to just work through it. Just be open with her about how you feel but you need to makes sure you use "" I "" statements I found that help alot because if you don't make it clear they are your feels and that  they didnt do anything because it will cause their mind to start to run and they will begin to let their  worst intrusive thoughts run and it could actually make it a lot worse because in all reality it's basically a giant fear that you're not good enough for anyone and that eventually you'll leave them. they can love you as much as they want and you can love them as much as you want you just have to keep in mind that if you didn't do  anything wrong and it seems like they're pulling away then just know that you that's when you need to be there for them and you need to be the Rock while they're in their hard place you get what I'm saying but it is extremely worth it if you can figure out what works for you and the person you're with that has BPD. I mean you don't have to share everything that's just what I have asked for it helps me know kinda where I stand with her her and  I don't want to sit there and be wondering what's going through her head.

He explained that the nature of the therapy that we‚Äôre doing (image rescripting where I insert him into a bad memory and he protects me until my ‚Äúadult self‚Äù learns how to) can bring up all sorts of feelings and emotions and it was really helpful to look at it biologically 

Nothing was off, no boundaries crossed, I told him I am scared to ever leave therapy because I don‚Äôt ever want to be without him, I said a lot of things that I really realised are my abandonment issues and not about him specifically. We spoke about my issues with men and people pleasing and being scared of rejection. It all makes so much sense why I feel this way about him! 

I obviously still have conflicted feelings, and I think it doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs ‚Äômy type‚Äô but I think it‚Äôs also like the ultimate test in a way for me to really work though some shittttt.

I‚Äôm really grateful for everyone‚Äôs responses, but I do just want to say that it‚Äôs not a bad thing ever to tell your therapist your feelings - even if they‚Äôre uncomfortable, even if they‚Äôre feeling about fancying them. If they are a good therapist they should understand",Tiny_Lime5707,1c432s3

12,"Idk why you‚Äôre getting downvoted for this like this isnt the most normal ‚Äòbpd‚Äô behavior I‚Äôve read about all month. You have a crush on your presumably attractive and kind therapist which is enhanced x100 because of of your condition. That is ‚Äònormal‚Äô for the type of brain you have so no I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy. 

 I WOULD think it‚Äôs a dumb decision on your part to not try to snap out of the infatuation rq and address that for as long as you‚Äôre seeing this therapist, you‚Äôre probably not doing therapy. Like you‚Äôre going there but really just to fawn around him probably. You‚Äôre distracted from your mission. Plus if you‚Äôre not getting treatment the way you should then you‚Äôre likely to fuck up anything with him. Lets see how you can best play your cards here. 

I say you switch therapists and on your way out (last session maybe) you can tell him it‚Äôs because you have a crush on him. That way, its either mortifyingly embarrassing because he rejects you and then you never have to see him again OR the universe pulls a wild card and he gives you the green light BECAUSE you are no longer gonna be a patient. He would only ever take you up on this if you werent a patient. If you tell him while you‚Äôre a patient, he may refer you to go to someone else and you may feel too broken to be proactive about finding a new therapist.

18,Honestly my feelings have become really strong over the past week and I just had my first experiences of image rescripting in therapy where my therapist said for me to imagine him in a memory years ago to start to create a different association to it. I have realised that what I‚Äôm feeling is probably an aftermath of that and I think I‚Äôm just going to tell him everything. I really don‚Äôt want to be unethical and get him in to trouble - he‚Äôs a very good therapist and I don‚Äôt actually want to cross boundaries it‚Äôs just my head running away with it. I totally appreciate your replies and know what you‚Äôre saying but I think it‚Äôs something I actually need to address rather than try be sneaky about,Tiny_Lime5707,1c432s3

I made a list of things I can do to try to distance/ ground myself, i‚Äôll list them here in hopes they help you. 

- work out for at least 10 minutes 
- drink something hot 
- shower
- listen to music

- go out for a drive",Excellent_Radio36,1bwfly7

It‚Äôs going to be excruciating and I wish there was a way any of us could save you from that but unfortunately that‚Äôs life and that‚Äôs particularly life with BPD.

0,"Hi! I am currently dealing with the aftermath of a break up myself and a possible reconciliation. 

The break up is the result of his splitting and me not understanding what has been going on, why he thinks the way he thinks. My relationship was mirroring your situation until push came to shove and I couldn't make sense of it all anymore and couldn't see his love for me anymore during his last split. 

I am AuDHD and he has strong traits for BPD. I realized yesterday that he most likely has undiagnosed BPD and that everything he says and does when feeling safe and secure is meant true from his heart. That his love is true and deep. 
However, I let him know that I am finally beginning to understand everything, the big picture and all. And that I forgive him. And that I will be there for him. 
But it's hard for him to see the love I have for him. 
It's hard for him to trust me due to trauma from childhood. I let him know I want us to be ok again, that I want to find a way to continue our relationship. He wanted to see me spontaneously yesterday after breaking up with me earlier this week and I couldn't (parental obligations, I couldn't go meet him, and still under shock myself, processing it all emotionally). He sent me FB request when I was asleep, and I didn't have a chance to see it because he deleted it. Thinking I ignored it. Today, he says we both broke up when I said I want to see him again. When I said I don't want to break up so many times, it still didn't get through to him. I still let him know today that I hope we can be together again. I never wanted to break up. 


He didn't ask me to read about BPD. I did. Because I love him. But I also would have read about it if he gave me links and books about it. Because as an autistic woman I need to collect fragments to be able to see the bigger picture and to be able to make sense of how someone behaves. It took me until Friday night to connect the dots. To see what he is dealing with himself. To see when he gets mean due to fear of abandonment it's BPD speaking, not him. It took me 9 months to see it.

Another thing that I was confronted with is my lack of showing emotions at time, but as an autistic person it's hard to do so. Alexithymia and delayed emotional processing can come across as not caring enough sometimes. And that can be amplified when it's perceived as a BPD person.¬†",lostinspace80s,1ckn7ae

4,"I can absolutely encourage you to sit down comfortably with your FP when they are relaxed. And read together about BPD. And watch YT videos about it together. Because then you two have a chance to talk about it and get ideas what aspect to talk about. It's good to hear about other people's experiences, it's like collecting scientific evidence or data that what you say and how you think and act is actually true and makes sense because it's confirmed by others who go through splitting and all. It's helping because it helps shift the perspective on things in a good way. At least that's how it works out for me, with reconciliation on the horizon and a positive outlook. It's easier to look at what others experience with the same condition or neurotype because there is no emotional attachment that could alter the perception. PS my special person has it in common too with you regarding sensory overload and energy depletion from socializing. I assume for BPD people being drained from socializing is from the constant fear of rejection and trying to make everyone happy even if it goes against own needs? Whereas for ASD people it's due to having to process all small fragments of interactions and such that flood the brain unfiltered. Different reason, similar outcome.

If you need help paying for meds, I do too, look at using apps like blinkhealth, goodRX, Cost Plus drugs, and even CVS has a discount card for medication. These services provide discounted prices for prescription medications. I‚Äôve used all of them. 

Also, this is a bit of advice you didn‚Äôt ask for but from a person with BPD to another. Staying off of social media has given my life a whole new meaning. Like I find myself enjoying my life and not comparing myself to others or becoming obsessed with people etc. Also try reading the book atomic habits, I know cheesy, but I just started it and it‚Äôs helping me.

0,"I have these same issues and it is really difficult. All that's been slowly helping me is working on it 24/7. If I ever notice an anxious thought about my partner cross my mind at anytime, I notice it, think about it, remember they are a person who deserves respect, and fully try to put myself in their shoes. If they say something that makes me feel hurt, I say I need a minute, leave the room and remember they aren't trying to hurt me. They didn't wake up planning ways to make me feel upset, they are simply a person with many complex thoughts and emotions of their own. Obviously this takes a lot of time to start working, I still have many times I lose control and can't stop words coming out of my mouth. I definitely reach a point of clarity faster and do it less though. 
Taking time to stop throughout the day to do check-ins. Remind yourself you're currently safe, your partner is trustworthy, your partner is also a complex person, and your partner loves you.

0,I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Bpd 2 years ago. At that time I didn‚Äôt even know what bpd was but it took me one year of seeing the same psychiatrist and lots and lots of test until i got a diagnosis it‚Äôs definitely a process but it‚Äôs the right direction and it is worth it. My bpd was masked by my depression and severe anxiety which were the initial diagnosis i got from other psychiatrist. Ive been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for 2 years now and i can tell you it gets better. When you get a diagnosis they can help you with means that are specifically tailored to your needs and medication would help if you are considering them. And you don‚Äôt have to tell anyone or choose the right people to talk to about it unless you feel ready to avoid any negativity. I can‚Äôt say you will 100% feel better there are days where i feel like i am exactly the same or even worse and its a journey with lots of ups and downs. but overall it does get better over time and DBT is a great help you should consider. It takes consistency and effort and though it‚Äôs hard it will help you in your life. Consider talking to a psychiatrist about Bpd and make sure to be with a therapist you are comfortable with.

7,"I'd suggest looking into DBT and CBT techniques, as well as grounding exercises. They can be super useful for managing stress and emotions.

The thing that actually helped me while practicing CBT and DBT is keeping myself busy, especially with the right and most beneficial things:

Consider trying out different hobbbies, even if you think you might lose interest in them later on. You can always try something new.

Try working out, or just joining classes like Pilates or spinning once a week at first .

Something i can also suggest is taking free online courses on topics that pique your curiosity can be incredibly rewarding and can be added to your CV.

One thing i do personally is that I make it a point to research any topic that catches my attention or that I'm not well-informed about. It could be as simple as looking up word definitions or diving into a whole study on a planet i once heard about in a tiktok video .

And when it comes to doing things solo, I recommend giving it a shot. Eating out alone can be a surprisingly enjoyable experience.

Pet sitting can also be a nice experience.

Your partner deserves bodily autonomy. There are many reasons why he may have wanting his first time after surgery to be alone. All of those reasons are valid. I‚Äôm sorry you felt hurt by this, but we should respect his body and space. 
Please take some time to consider the responses you‚Äôve received on this post. I would recommend trying to pause before you react to allow yourself time to think about what is triggering an emotional response. Process your feelings then try to discuss them in a kind, respectful way. You cannot manipulate or guilt him over sex. We have to remember that no one deserves to ever feel any type of pressure or negativity surrounding sex. 

Additionally, in the future, please mark posts of this nature as NSFW.

I think he probably didn‚Äôt think much of it and neither should you. He had sex with you because he wanted to and what happened before has nothing to do with you, so while I understand why you might get upset, you really shouldn‚Äôt waste time because it all sounds like a chill situation!

0,"Hey OP! I know this struggle so well, and you are definitely not alone.

Something that helped in my circumstances was a couple of things:

1. Knowing I had BPD and learning about it; knowing a lot about why I‚Äôve done what I‚Äôve done (basically that ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment)
2. Coming to understand that obsessively friending, then unfriending, or sending a message and then deleting the message or following up with my thoughts one after the other in multiple messages after initial message and the like, is‚Äìhow I see it‚Äì something of a subform of *splitting*
3. Choosing and learning to believe people when they say this or that about you (positives only; but taking less than positive things is a diff convo)
4. Identifying the feelings you get in the moment when you do those things, naming it and reflecting on the why. What‚Äôs triggering that response? When it happens, write it down (eg, ‚Äútoday I friended Elly again, then unfriended her. At this moment I was feeling anxiety because‚Ä¶ and then delve into that further). This sometimes helped with my spirals
5. When you see the pattern and the triggers, it was then about processing after that and then learning to catch myself before I deleted a message or sent additional texts or unfriended
6. Always, always, always remember that practice and learning better habits is NOT linear! Give yourself grace if it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôre able to catch every time
7. Realizing that part of my personal trigger for this was obsessing about the ‚Äúam I being annoying, do they like me, etc‚Äù and that by hyper focusing on that made me super twitchy and to get rid of that anxiety I decided to ‚Äúun-do it‚Äù. I began practicing the ‚ÄúI friended them/ sent that message, now I‚Äôm going to focus on something else, and if it‚Äôs important enough, or they specifically ask me to, I will leave it alone.‚Äù The urge began to stick after a while. To this day, I still wonder if I‚Äôm being annoying or if someone doesn‚Äôt like me but it‚Äôs manageable most of the time now. But then that leads to:
8. Wherein you can‚Äôt control what other people think of you, but you can control how you put yourself out there with your actions and decisions.

OP, you‚Äôve noticed this is something you do that you don‚Äôt find helpful or healthy, and you mentioned your loved ones are or seem to be getting annoyed by the consistent back and forth, right? Don‚Äôt let that destroy you! You‚Äôve taken a great step by even having the reflection that this is not how you want to keep behaving and then reaching out.

There‚Äôs no quick fix to BPD, there‚Äôs either remaining stagnant and drowning in it, or taking the process of overcoming certain aspects one step at a time and making progress down the path you want to walk.

I know you mentioned that you aren‚Äôt comfortable sharing your diagnosis with your loved ones, but perhaps in the future that will change. And I really think it could potentially help, and them; them, so that they can understand it‚Äôs not just you being annoying or too much on purpose, but that there‚Äôs an actual reason for it and you‚Äôre actively working on making it better because you care for them and (I hope more importantly) about yourself. And it‚Äôd potentially help you because when a person takes ownership of things like this, you‚Äôre giving yourself the power over how you feel, and taking it away from others (or at least how we perceive that).

Off topic example of owning it to keep the power in your hands: I had the crown/tooth next to my front tooth fall out and it‚Äôs unrepairable. I could get an implant but that will be hella expensive and around a year plus long wait. I am super self conscious about my teeth as is since I didn‚Äôt take care of them in childhood and it‚Äôs haunting my ass now. But I figured, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll just wear a mask everywhere‚Äù. I hated that. So this last Tuesday when I went to campus for class I was wearing a mask and made a decision for myself. (Helps if there‚Äôs one person you feel a semblance of safety with at first when practicing this; it doesn‚Äôt have to be your FP or BFF 5eva). I spoke up right before class began (like a minute or seconds before), and started off with a little joke announcement ‚ÄúSo I know we‚Äôre all judgment free in this class, except when it comes to Professor A‚Äôs dad jokes (insert snorts of laughter) but I wanted to sort of tell you all this‚Äù, and proceeded to basically say ‚ÄúMy tooth fell out, I‚Äôm not sick (as I took off my mask) and I don‚Äôt want to wear this mask so here‚Äôs my adorable smile minus one teephers‚Äù. And I actually showed the class while sitting all chill-like in my seat. I further added, ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm announcing this but I‚Äôm doing it because it gives me the power to own it on my terms since I can be self conscious about it, so there you have it!‚Äù Lots of nods and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs awesome‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love that!‚Äù were the responses.

And wow that‚Äôs long. Anyway:

**Tl;dr** OP has made a significant step by 1) taking note of this behavior and wanting to change it as well as 2) seeking support in my opinion.

0,"I have the exact same feelings and I had the exact same feelings when I first got diagnosed.


But you know what? People with BPD are incredibly strong and incredibly empathetic, imagine turning every small situation into a very big, life threatening one and still bouncing back from all this intensity like nothing ever happened?¬†


You also need to understand that having BPD is not something that you can control, most people with BPD have a lot of childhood trauma that is related to abandonment, so it's not your fault and I know that this may not help a lot , but it's important for you to tell your inner child that it's okay now and that you will be feeling better and getting the help that you and your inner child needed for a long time.¬†


One last thing about people with BPD, I said that they are incredibly empathetic right? If I didn't have BPD I wouldn't have been able to get through to you and feel what you're feeling and make you feel better, and that is something that normal people don't have , and I'd like to look at it as if it was a super power , because truly we are able to help others and make them feel better about everything.

1,"I‚Äôm finally at the diagnosis stage and I feel immense relief, but only because I‚Äôve been a few years in the shame and denial stage. 

My first introduction to the term BPD was when I was looking through my ex-husband‚Äôs garage for some of my things and found a book, ‚ÄúWalking on Eggshells: Living with a Borderline.‚Äù

I was like‚Ä¶fucking what? It was a bullet to the heart. Especially because he was an alcoholic with his own anger issues and all I ever wanted was to be safe. But also, as borderlines, we have so much empathy, so much that we feel everything, how could *I* be the monster? Because that‚Äôs how uninformed society largely views us, monsters.

So I hurt for a while and then denied and then ACCEPTED and started learning. But then I tried discussing it and people told me I didn‚Äôt have it because I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt that bad‚Äù (???? Again hurtful to everyone with the disorder) and I realized I was using the potential diagnosis to keep myself exactly how I was.

I wanted to grow and not hide behind a diagnosis of why I was the way I was and couldn‚Äôt change. 

But in the last month I found my way back to the diagnosis. I‚Äôm coming back to life after chemotherapy and my meltdowns (as I call them) have been very frequent. Feelings of emptiness that won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm doing everything I can over here. I‚Äôve got my meeting with therapists next month and I‚Äôd like to tell
you why, after all this time and all these years, this diagnosis is a relief:

There‚Äôs a reason for my constant emptiness and extreme empathy. It‚Äôs not just inherently who I am as a person. I was hurt. I get to say what happened to me as a child isn‚Äôt fair and wasn‚Äôt my fault.

I can finally, finally, after years of therapy, find a therapist who can HELP ME. it‚Äôs been so frustrating going to therapy and not having someone understand or suggest tools for someone without the disorder. I remember telling my fianc√©, ‚Äúno matter what I do, goals set accomplished etc., I always end up back here in this pit of self-loathing and emptiness.‚Äù

I get to work on self-esteem, identity, and not just repeat positive mantras in a mirror while every mirror-neuron on my body screams for death because I saw a rough news story. 

I‚Äôve done incredible things in my life, I beat cancer, this year, and I wondered how the hell I could
Still be so upset about little things. 

The shame hasn‚Äôt been removed, but layers and layers have been torn away for me. I get to really heal!! I‚Äôve been sitting in pain for my whole life, as have we all. We can do this. 

And also, love is possible. My fianc√© loved me as I was. He‚Äôs the most patient understanding person. Even if he never understands why I get so upset, he‚Äôs told me that he loves me because I‚Äôm a good person, and that he sees how upset I get and is kind of amazed at how well and frequently I‚Äôm able to bounce back from such massive upsets. He says I just need time to feel my feelings. I don‚Äôt know how the hell I found him but he‚Äôs real. And I‚Äôm going to practice the intense love I feel in my heart by finding ways to heal. 

Because‚Ä¶‚Ä¶BPD IS NOT A LIFE SENTENCE. We can heal. We will. It‚Äôs in our very nature to heal, to dive down under the muck and look under every rock. 

We just need the right tools. And society is becoming more and more trauma informed. 

We get told we need to love ourselves and practice self-compassion. What non-bpd people
Don‚Äôt realize is that WE DONT KNOW WHO THAT SELF IS, and we have mega trust issues. 

I learned recently that shame and guilt are something we can let go. A diagnosis hurts because we have this internal talk that constantly tells us we‚Äôre horrible people, and the diagnosis is like a big light that says, ‚Äúyou are!‚Äù But we‚Äôre not. A diagnosis means you have symptoms and behaviors indicative of someone who was very hurt, probably when very little, and developed these tendencies to survive. 

And you survived. Let‚Äôs keep going.",ImpressiveSell5404,1ctuiz2

You'll never be able to trust yourself in relationships. Because the right trigger will ruin everything. I don't mean to be a downer, but it time to be honest about BPD!!

7,"Hi, thank you for your response. One thing I strive for is to be as honest as I possibly can. I‚Äôve done mountains of research and reading about my disorders, and from what I‚Äôve learned about BPD, it is definitely possible to recover from BPD.  I‚Äôll include a link to the national library of medicine below if you‚Äôre interested.

However, I do believe that sometimes the language surrounding mental health and recovery can be a bit ambiguous, which doesn‚Äôt do well our BPD black and white thinking tendencies.

I do agree with you that we will always always feel the way we feel. We will always have triggers and huge emotions and many, many other things. But we can also develop tools to allow us to manage these things. 

I believe that‚Äôs why mental health and addiction use the word ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcure.‚Äù

I‚Äôm an alcoholic in recovery. I haven‚Äôt had a drink in two and a half years and the obsession to drink has been removed. But am I cured? Hell no.

I‚Äôm one drink away from the same cycle, always. What‚Äôs different is I have tools now instead of just drinking to numb myself. 

With BPD, I also have tools now and I hope to develop many, many more. For example, when I would dissociate, I found that human touch helped me. I told my fianc√© that when I‚Äôm having a meltdown, I need him to gently hold my hand. I don‚Äôt run away anymore, even though every cell in my body screams for me to run. That‚Äôs improvement. 

I still get massive intrusive thoughts out in public. I cry through them and center myself and resume activity. Self soothing techniques can be learned.

I understand, through tons of exploration, that I am extremely unsure of relationships and explain my fear of abandonment to people I‚Äôm close to. I tell them I need reassurance. 

And sometimes the world shits all over my safe little bubble of awareness and is just mean. I allow myself to be myself and hurt. It hurts, I know you hurt. 

But to say recovery isn‚Äôt possible for us seems against our very nature. We are resilient. How many people do you know that could overcome several massive core- shattering episodes A DAY, and still take another step forward?  There is no way we can just feel all the massive amounts of empathy we feel and NOT take action. I‚Äôll bet you‚Äôre one of the kindest people I could ever know. Maybe you never miss a sending a birthday card or compliment an old lady on her perfume and really mean it. 

We are the way we are. But we can learn do modify our behaviors, which are a set of patterns of reactions. Life is always going to life. Please try not to get stuck under your diagnosis. 

And if that‚Äôs how you feel, my friend, that‚Äôs how you feel. But I encourage you, perhaps not now but in a moment of darkness, to consider what opportunities for growth and creation your destruction has brought into the world.",ImpressiveSell5404,1ctuiz2

0,"short answer: extremely open and frequent conversations about behaviors, a little bit of grace and maturity. 

long answer: I was diagnosed with BPD at 19, but it's been suspected since 16. now I'm married, in a ""normal"" healthy relationship. I no longer meet the DSM 5 requirements. I'm not going to pretend that I don't still really struggle at times, because I do. 

what has helped me the absolute most, is that my husband is smart, and a logical thinker. I entered our relationship telling him that I have BPD, he looked up unbiased information about BPD, read a few studies, joined a Facebook group I was in so he could see how other people with BPD act and feel. another thing in the same vein as seeing and hearing about how people with BPD act, he would come to therapy with me! he actually suggested multiple times ""maybe we should bring this up on your next session?"" or ""could you schedule a session, you're not doing well."" and as hard as that is to hear, if you force yourself through that anger and sadness, and go to the session or make an earlier appointment, you tend to see more results. as people with BPD, we don't normally feel outside of this very moment, so you gotta strike while the iron is hot and what not. 

another thing is being held accountable for your reactions, but not necessarily your thoughts. the way you react to thoughts are solely your responsibility, but the reason why you had the thought in the first place isn't on you. example: early in the relationship I had a flashback to how my ex abused me, and the way I reacted towards him wasn't okay. at the end of the day my husband isn't my abusive ex boyfriend. we can see how that connection is logical, but they have no idea. this is where a little grace comes in. your partner has to be a little lenient ""yes the way you acted wasn't okay, but we talked through it now. I understand a bit better now. next time xyz."" for me personally, making plans on how to do something makes me think about it a lot, it gets ingrained in my head and then when a situation like that happens again, it's one of my first thoughts. 

my last tip that I tell everyone, even if they don't have BPD, is to not ask questions you want a genuine answer to. what if the answer is hurtful, you set yourself up. what if the answer isn't as good as you scripted, you set up those expectations. I'm talking about questions like do you think this person is pretty, what was your first impression of me, what would you do if I died, etc. yes the answer of those are sweet and give us satisfaction but more likely than not you already know what you want the answer to be. you want them to say no that person isn't cute because 9/10 it's someone who looks the exact opposite of you, but you want them to say yes so you have a reason to split. 

it takes a lot from both people. I've spent plenty number of nights sobbing in my husband's lap because he wouldn't let me react the way I normally do, and it feels like a genuine pain, I'm having to sit with those thoughts and feel through them instead of splitting and avoiding the feeling altogether. he has spent many hours secretly upset with my reaction and waiting for me to calm down so he can get reassurance that I still love him. there's going to be fuck ups. you're going to have your feeling hurts, so will your partners. there's going to be days where you feel like you haven't gotten any better but your partner has seen amazing improvement and is so proud of you. just for the love of everything holy, talk to each other. if there needs to be a code word you use as that fire starts, so that you can walk away from the conversation until you're better, so be it! I use the word pomegranate. this is possible and I wish you nothing but luck. I hope you show yourself a little grace in this process as well. no one else could ever imagine how having a disorder that feels like second degree burns over most of your body feels.",kaprioara,1c63vle

1,"I'm sorry that you're in so much pain right now. As a licensed clinician with BPD (although I've been in remission for a few years now), I can't stress how beneficial seeking professional support can be in the long run. Sure, therapy can be expensive *if you're only looking at self-pay therapists*. Many group practices offer pro-bono services. Community mental health centers offer free or low-cost services and always accept Medicaid/Medicare. 99% of all private practice therapists offer a sliding scale fee so that the fee for services aligns with your income to make therapy more affordable and reduce financial barriers when services are needed. My main point here is that you don't have to do this alone. It's okay to ask for help and there is help out there if you ask.",bornforthis23,15sgmbj

0,"Oh man, I struggle with this too. My top advices are to check the adhd women communities around here because that‚Äôs a topic I see come up a lot for them too, and then of course the obligatory ‚Äúask a therapist go to therapy‚Äù etc for more professional management.

From my own situations, it varied, so I‚Äôll share what happened incase any of it can be insightful.

Back when I was able to drink coffee, that gave me the boost to take on physical tasks, especially cleaning. I would focus on one area at a time in parts. Picturing a goal image of the result for how I wanted a room to look was also a motivator for me. Organizing things almost became like an art project in a strange sense.

When I lived with a partner in the past many years back, there came a point where they also fell into the ‚Äúparent‚Äù and ‚Äúall the cleaning alone‚Äù role and I wasn‚Äôt really picking up the slack. Eventually the guilt started to weigh with me, and it was embarassing when guests came over and I could not claim that I had cleaned any of my apartment, that the partner did all the work. I felt the pressure of being a lousy person for that. To be honest however, once we became long distance is when I really started my first large efforts in keeping my space somewhat clean and not overly cluttered for my own mental health. Also being able to say I cleaned or organized something on my own was pretty empowering. Not burdening my partner also made me feel better. It was not an easy habit to break initially though. Once ways are set it‚Äôs tough to change, but it is not impossible. 

Keep in mind that over burdening someone with tasks instead of balancing your share can put a huge unspoken strain on a relationship, which can and will take its toll in the long run. If it matters, you will want to put as much mental force into fixing this as you can, and not wait for a point of no return in regards to how things will last this way. I‚Äôm sorry if that‚Äôs scary, but it also a reality that needs to be considered. 

The most recent time I ran into this problem was last year with a different partner I did not live with. However, this time I was admant that my disorganized room was my problem and diswayed them from cleaning for me to avoid old habits. Unfortunately since this was not a shared space and it was my room, it stayed pretty messy until after we broke up. That weirdly gave me the motivation to fix it all myself again, on top of having friends start to come over. My room now looks like an instagram-ready bedroom with all the lights and decor I added since I had the funds for it. This ex learned of it later and was impressed and pretty proud of me!  I‚Äôve maintained it for many months since. I guess a good motivator in this case was getting to implement aesthetics I enjoyed, so maybe that might help you as well?

0,"I see you and I can somewhat relate. It used to be rather severe - the rage and depressive episodes consuming me because of triggers which reminded me of my perception that I have no control and these cycles keep perpetuating.

DBT is helpful but also it is all so super exhausting, that conscious constant continous inner fight. Sometimes I just want to be and sometimes I just be for 2 days too longs and then spiral with letting go of each thing and just never getting back up in weeks or months.

It now comes in for a day or two and I can recognize the early early signs. Once I do or my healthy support structure reminds me of certain things we've written down that happens, I begin to increase my selfcare practices.

Especially two things. HRB and Neurographica. They require very little effort from me and they both make a physiological difference.

I have a free app for the Heart Rhythm Breathing, so all I do is place my finger on the camera and follow the ball inflation and deflation which assists me in breathing Rhythmically. That changes my coherence, makes the nervous system counter the cortisol production. If I am declining, I fit in 4 to 5 sessions of 10 to 20 minutes in just lying down on the grass or bed whoever you are able to or sit anywhere and breath through a session focusing on getting my breathing in Rhythm.

It also shows you your HRV (Heart rate variability) scores which can tell you how depressed and far gone you are and will start picking up the deeper you're able to hold your Rhythms.

Check out Dr Alan Watkins he explains about HRV Rhythm breathing and coherence with regards to performance, but it can be used like this.

Neurographica is also absolutely wonderful and a proven therapy method by Pavel Pascarev that Stimulates the brains neuroplasticity and helps with rewiring.

They've been saving my life, especially is those times when I feel like I just cannot! It's easy, it does not require big effort from me and it is something I can do anywhere on my phone and if practiced enough without anything and as that begins making a difference in my energy and reasoning brain, I regain the ability to do the other practices, like go back to the gym or get some sun and take daily walks, listen to good hormone inducing music etc.

I hope you can find the tools that work for you.üôè",barely_parenting,ywe7vy

1,First I'm just going to say the other comment that persons an a- hole and secondly there's a reason that people with BPD and narcissists and other relationships together it's like an attraction to each other you know like one wants complete control over the other and the other has a strong fear of being abandoned so basically a narcissist can do whatever the f*** they want and that person will sit there and still love them and that's why they always end up together but what you need to focus on is yourself and not what he's doing because you know in your mind that he's just doing it to keep that control my suggestion is once you get whatever it is that's so important that you need to get from his house is that you just go no contact you guys can't be friends anymore like cuz it won't work he'll always just keep that a little bit of control over you and this cycle will just keep repeating like I'm not sure what your situation is but like if the stuff that's there is not that important then just let it go hopefully that helped,whiplash0713,18xe6w4

0,"(Basically everything below should start with ""If you haven't already / didn't already know,"" because I don't know your level of knowledge here)

I have BPD myself. Candidly, yes he's probably going to rage-break-up again, if he isn't practicing skills. Unchecked BPD is like pb&j with self-destructive breakups followed by desperate remorse.

That's to say, it is his responsibility to seek help and intervention. Does he do DBT? Practice a healthy lifestyle to his best ability? Looked at meditative hobbies or even things like Buddhism? (Which is what saved my life, personally) Does he have a psychiatrist? Medication? Things he enjoys and could cultivate? Have substance use concerns or other addictions? Does he have other hobbies besides you?

I really hope the answer are all yes, and things are improving. But, I don't get the sense that's true right now.

On his end, just to give context, it takes constant vigilance for someone with BPD to monitor and adjust their behavior using their DBT skills, or similar. It's an unrelenting demand to ""be better"" for yourself and your loved ones, and it *is* laborious and painstaking. However, it is his deal to manage it, at the end of the day, hard as it is. It's just our lot in life, because if we don't, it's a self-destructive mess. But, doesn't change the points above, and it's worth noting that BPD is actually extremely treatable in the sense that fairly moderate changes can lead to big improvements, the key is him practicing practicing practicing. It is more than possible for him to make strides; he is not stuck this way, not inherently.

However, on your end, you'll have to chose whether you can handle it (*particularly* if he isn't making efforts). The flightiness, splitting, the emotional whiplash, and often, the harsh words borne of humiliated rage. The breaking up.

You have every right in the world to take care of yourself and get some respite in the form of breaking up, at *least* for now. More than rights, even, you have just as much responsibility for your own wellbeing as he does.

I really want to stress that if he brings up suicide or self-harm, etc., when or if you decide to go this route, you should not allow this to shift your sense of personal responsibility. This may not come up at all, hopefully. But, if he's in life-threatening danger, call someone else for help, do not bear the burden yourself. (Someone else like his family members or siblings or friends, if you can). It's common to suggest calling the police, I personally don't advocate for this.

Lastly, it's very important that you know that none of this is about you. As in, if he does break up with you in that destructively impulsive way, it has nothing to do with how good of a partner you are or having failed him in some way. It absolutely sucks and hurts but I urge you to remember that it is not you, but rather it is your partner having a flare-up of the BPDemon in his brain. He's feeling agony too, which makes the whole thing so terrible for everyone. But it isn't you, your failings, your selflessness, or your loyalty, it is him and the thing that's lodged in our brains.

Very last thing: I recommend a book called *I Hate You Don't Leave Me*, it discusses BPD and support and it's nature, etc., and it would give both of you more insight.

Very very last thing: Do some research on Favorite Person, that may apply to you and give insight.

VVV last thing: I guess I should say here too that despite all my practical discussion about personal responsibility, I want to note just that... it really does suck having BDP, and the people in my life that I am closest to are those who have continued to be there for me. I have gotten so so much better, through a lot of work, and it is in part because these certain people did not truly leave me. That means everything to someone with this disorder/illness.

I signed him up for dialectic behavioral therapy and he was attending group sessions and individual sessions. They stopped taking his insurance and this crushed him. He feels nothing will work at this point. 

He is already bringing up suicide and not wanting  to be here anymore. It‚Äôs hard to hear but I try my best to be supportive. His older brother committed suicide and he always says he‚Äôs mad his brother beat him to it. In the same breath he tells me I am the only reason he doesn‚Äôt do it.

Your ex is trash. You, my sweetie, are a fighter, and I applaud you for how far you've come into your recovery. My husband is a recovering addict himself, and he's doing so good. Be proud of yourself. Someone out there is gonna find you and treasure you because you did the work to get yourself together. Be proud of that.",InkBlotArt,1bteb6r
3,"Hey I‚Äôve been exactly where you are. My BPD was so severely attached to my abusive ex boyfriend. After I left the relationship the second time he did the same. 

TRIGGER WARNING : DIRECT MESSAGE 

‚ÄúHopeless friendless broke no school no job, a family that hates you, a guilt that that kills you, no inherent value that you see yourself causing you to f*** the most trash and ugly people cause that‚Äôs the best you can do‚Äù 

I had just been disowned by my family after my first attempt (he broke up with me 2 weeks after my attempt cause I was ‚Äúasking for too much‚Äù, AKA general reassurance cause he was out with the girl he had been cheating on me with throughout the relationship). 
Favourite people are hard to deal with cause detaching from them is irrational. He continued to be my fp until I returned to my original city and met with him again. I had just gotten out of another relationship and was insanely low so reached out. Seeing him again sealed it for me. 
Growing into a person he didn‚Äôt recognize confirmed that he was in my past forever. When we met I was afraid I would regress into the patterns I held before but seeing that he had not changed in the slightest (even getting worse in areas) confirmed that no, I can‚Äôt and refuse be treated that was again. 
This being said I was the exact same as you. He had a new gf like 2 weeks after me and was plastering her everywhere (not to mention the more personal, not NSFW, photos of them just being happy together he would send me directly on a regular basis). It hurt cause why could they be happy but we couldn‚Äôt. Let me promise you they are not happy. And if they are they won‚Äôt be long term unless this guy is the best actor on the planet. I feel like it‚Äôs common knowledge now that people cannot hid who they are for prolonged periods of time without slipping up. Think of how poorly he treated you, she will almost definitely experience the same at some level. 

Looking to the future, finding a healthy FP to replace this one so that you can move past his behaviour. Not looking for a replacement but finding someone positive to focus your energy on is definitely the way to go. 
I took a hiatus from dating after my whole experience with that EX which is what worked for me, looking at what exactly I gravitated towards in past relationships and what to avoid but most importantly looking at how I acted in the relationship which I could improve upon. 

Favourite people are fun to have when it picks the right person. My current partner is my favourite person in the whole world but compared to past favourite people, he‚Äôs actually helping me become who I want to be indirectly. Positive influences are so undervalued.",Gooseteeth9039,1bteb6r

Very BPD.) They called the cops to come to my place do a wellness check on me. It‚Äôs not a light matter.

And not contacting help in a period of crisis can be negligent and possibly be held liable. If y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want to contact the police at all, then he needs to make sure he keeps his shit together. If he doesn‚Äôt have a safety plan, he needs one asap.

There are help resources that I have on hand if things getthat aren't police.

I've at no point mentioned that he might harm others because he wouldn't. If that were a risk, he wouldn't be in my life.

His therapist has been helping a lot and there has been serious improvement, so no, we won't be looking for a new one because finding a good therapist is a nightmare and this one is actually helping.

He has coping skills in place and uses them, but he still shuts down, which isn't unreasonable during a major depressive episode. Our life shuts down because we are on watch to make sure he's safe, nothing more.

Again, I wasn't asking for what he can do, I'm asking for advice for what I can do to be more supportive in those moments of crisis because I feel helpless to make things better for him. Ideally, something that doesn't involve calling fascist attack dogs on a loved one.

You claim the therapist is ‚Äúgood‚Äù, yet again you‚Äôre here on Reddit trying to figure out what to do rather than asking her, and not following a safety plan.

You are also unwilling to hold those accountable whose responsibility it is to actually help him and make positive changes for the community, and enable a therapist who for some reason has not addressed this with him, and are unwilling to talk with her about it or get a new one.

2,"I read it at the time I was diagnosed and still own the book. I felt like I was reading about myself specifically. It helped me realize I am not alone, I hate my boyfriend and that I have codependency issues. I was blessed enough to be given a copy of CODEPENDENT NO MORE at an AA meeting.  Very good read, had a test at the beginning to see if you think you are codependent and then the book tells you how to handle it. Both helped me accept my diagnosis as I was scared shitless to have a Cluster B Personality Disorder. Fortunately enough it's the most treatable of the PD and DBT (DIALECTICAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY), a similar approach to CBT ( COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY), but with mindfulness and meditation added. DBT s created to treat BPD directly and I'll say it works if your work it. I have a very good therapist. They say that Borderlines are the most likely to go for help as we desperately want to stop the suffering. Now a days I'm deep into my therapy, I go weekly, take medications for my co-morbid ( or CO-occuring) disorders like ADHD, OCD, MAD, GAD and traits of Bipolar. I believe I was improperly diagnosed Bipolar II before BPD. This happens to alot of us. One girls OLD videos on YouTube helped me relate, Sammy Grimm. And now I listen to any MedCircle info I can get my hand on. Also on YouTube is Dr. Fox (PD expert focusing on BPD), and the HEALTHYGAMERGG. I do short, guided meditations on YouTube as well, I use THE HONEST GUYS. Esp @ bed time. Also Binaural Beats. 

But back to your question here, the book was very helpful to me and I suggest it to any BPD person, male or female. I've also joined all the Cluster B sub's, NPD, HPD, SPD as well bc it's easy to share traits. Dr. Ramani can be found through MedCircle, here and on YouTube speaking about Narcissistic PD alot. I find it very interesting bc I don't want to give that manipulative vibe. I learned about gaslighting and have in the past been very guilty of this. I've learned about lying, it's basically controlling someone else's reality to self preserve. But I'm no more important or deserving then the next and that's not fair just bc I'm good at it. That's gross fr. 

I have a FP (Favorite Person), we are engaged and have a very healthy relationship where I do not devalue him and realize he is just s human being and not to be put on a pedestal. He wants what's best for me and helped me stop driving recklessly, acknowledge my substance abuse, stop stealing, cheating and being so impulsive. Got to take time to think about consequences for the next 48 hours before doing any of these things. I think I'm even ready to go back to work when our son goes back tho school. I have a sheet for IF I FEEL LIKE USING.... and a sheet for IF I FEEL LIKE KILLING MYSELF RN.... They have helped allot. I once kept a suicide kit. But I'm too impulsive for this and got rid of it. üòê

I realize you didn't ask for all this but I talk alot, too much really, and couldn't stop myself here. Hope something helps you.

0,"I know how you feel. I've felt different most of my life. People generally treat me the same. Most people though just don't understand what our condition is or what we go through in our heads. Most people may try to help with certain situations but fail miserably at understanding, no matter how hard you try to explain, how you see or feel about things. But that's why communication is important. If they're willing to attempt to understand, I would try to explain it until they can at least understand even a little bit. 

Before being officially diagnosed I studied my symptoms starting back in middle school. My now deceased wife (passed of cancer) helped me a lot. She saw me at my absolute worst and still chose to be with me. I was able to talk to her about anything. It got to a point she'd be able to detect one of ""outbursts"" before it happened and helped me through. I learned a lot of coping skills and am a lot calmer of a person because of her. Currently, I have one friend I trust enough to talk to. 

If you have someone you can trust, my advise is talk to them about things. Even if all they do is listen. It helps. I've also found that being open about my condition helps me and helps others understand me. So I've recently started a podcast where I talk about my life and different situations I've been through as well as how I feel about certain topics. Even if I never grow an audience I'll continue doing the podcast because it's a way for me to get things off my chest (vent) and I'll be able to listen to episodes in the future to see how much I've changed compared to when I spoke about a situation and how I might handle it differently as opposed to when I went through it. 

I chose podcasting on purpose because I feel a blog would gain an audience faster, and whereas I do want to talk about it and put it out there, part of me is still a bit scared or nervous about how some people may view what I say. But either way, it's an outlet for me to relieve my stresses and vent; which does help.",RedConradcom,14h1jz1
1,"Hey, no matter what your symptoms and experience - you aren't alone! Remember that. 

BPD is complex, and every case is uniquely formed and expressed. People - including doctors - would often downplay my mental illness because I'm more of the ""quiet"" subtype with a high functioning presentation. It was misdiagnosed for many years because of that in combination with my not having an obvious history of abuse. But trauma is much more complicated than that. Having our mental illness and experience invalidated of course contributes to the overall issue.

If you meet the criteria, or even some of the symptoms that severely affect you, then they need to be addressed no matter what anyone thinks. No matter your situation, yes, your brain HAS been wired a certain way by your environment and experiences. And it can be rewired in time. DBT is a great place to start - if you can't do it formally, there are many books and resources online. I'd also highly recommend Dr. Daniel Fox's YouTube channel, as well as his Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook. His workbook is pretty unique compared to other ones out there; it's my favorite one I've come across. I'm going to be starting my own channel soon, but more for the peer support side and to share my personal experience with BPD and recovery - I'm not a doctor or licensed in any way and will still suggest there that people refer to his content for clinical information.

BPD is an isolating experience, but that's why peer support is so important. I haven't felt understood regarding the strength of my emotions by anyone in life besides those with similar issues. Keep reaching out. BUT be wary about info you come across, even within this subreddit. There are so many misconceptions, and they can be harmful to recovery. Have hope. I promise things won't always be as they are currently as long as you keep working towards change. 

And congrats on being free of sh for so long, that's fantastic and you should be incredibly proud of yourself!",SarruhTonin,14h1jz1

3,"My podcast is on multiple platforms. Links can be found at [Show.RedConrad.com](https://TheRedConradShow.wordpress.com). But I do use explicit language (I talk as I normally do amongst friends). And because of what's said, some stories in part and others in full require a subscription. The subscription is more or less an attempt to keep certain things from minors.",RedConradcom,14h1jz1
0,30 years?!? What!!!??? My therapist said 4!,itstimetobeatbpd,cm425j
1,"First of all, it's important to recognise that there is a huge difference between symptom-free and being well enough to live a life where your symptoms are manageable and you can be happy. Forget the thirty years and focus on this year - what is affecting you the most right now? Take that to therapy, take the meds, and try to keep you mind on now. Mindfulness can be helpful with this - there are loads of free resources on YouTube as well as apps like Headspace.

Secondly, it's very difficult (and I would say unethical personally) to put a number on recovery. Different people respond differently to treatment and some people commit to therapy and making changes more than others. You could speak to a different medical professional and get a very different answer. That's not saying that you shouldn't listen to your psych, *you absolutely should follow their advice*, but don't let that number stop you from committing to treatment or give up hope because of it. Take it one day at a time.

So not only are you having to care for a little human and teach them how to be the best they can be, you‚Äôre having to teach yourself these things too. And some days, it‚Äôs so hard not to emotionally react or react to things in a negative way, but you have to remember to apologize to your kids when you do, even if they are little bitty and explain why it was wrong. I also get SUPER overstimulated relatively quickly, so some days are absolutely draining and it feels like my kids are attacking me and my mental (kids are just really fuckin good at knowing how to press your buttons). I‚Äôll say since becoming a parent, I‚Äôve taught myself a lot about regulating emotions and finding constructive ways to teach my kids in all kinds of ways, but not every day is it gonna be easy.

Mostly it triggers me when he cries because he wants something and this for 10 minutes.

I do feel so much more attraction and just like I‚Äôd be able to really love a women but just like you said that connection feels way too intense. I can say learning more about what you have does send you into a rabbit hole I don‚Äôt think anyone deserves to go down we‚Äôre all worthy of love and I know it feels hard like you won‚Äôt connect or like you are so manipulative or selfish when indeed you just require more than others. We require people that actually desire us not who we let our brain think is the one. I‚Äôm not sure if I needed to actually feel the heartbreak I‚Äôm feeling to snap out of it and realize that I am sometimes the cause of my failed relationships or more so the BPD talks are the reasons I let that consume me on top of not loving myself I see that it leads me to seek validation from others that aren‚Äôt even on my level.

maybe try breaking it up into digestible chunks? Like finding a new therapist who is younger that you feel you could relate to. this new one would be more educated on the illness and give you proper coping mechanisms for when you are overwhelmed and frustrated. the second is that i would definitely suggest giving him space. from his perspective what he saw was probably very scary and stressful to see especially if you don‚Äôt have a reliable way to calm yourself down. he got scared and he doesn‚Äôt know what to feel. it doesn‚Äôt mean he hates you but you do need to seriously step back and think about how your actions could be perceived by others.

2,"I‚Äôm really sorry to hear you are going through a very difficult time. BPD sucks! But it can be treated! I‚Äôve gone through MANY therapists and honestly finding one whom understands BPD and utilizes DBT / CBT practises, REALLY helps. 

Whenever you find yourself in these situations where you feel an episode incoming, take a moment to breathe and collect yourself before doing anything impulsive and potentially destructive - becoming mindful of your actions and present will help you when you‚Äôre in a high emotional state. You may want to do something action based to let out these feelings but think about how you channel them. Speak to those around you that you‚Äôre noticing your emotions heightening, that the state you‚Äôre in will not be logical.

We BPD folk put so much onto others and our emotions and that baggage gets so heavy on our loved ones that it can become overbearing.

That being said, it sounds like their statement is a little passive-aggressive or at least inappropriately reactionary. In other words, maybe they let their emotions run them on that. That's on them. Their reaction is NOT on you. The fact that there was that reaction/verbiage from a professional is concerning. I will cautionly state that not all therapists are good therapists (something like up to 30% actually cause harm), so this is a good time to keep good notes. Personally, if this happened to me, I would probably let them know how their reaction left me feeling in our next session since I'm sure there will be a conversation. I would be very interested and observant of what position they take and how they handle it.

It took me a few medications to find the right one for me. Don‚Äôt be scared to speak up if something is uncomfortable or you‚Äôre uncertain about a side effect. It‚Äôs not a medication that works right away. It takes about 3-6 weeks for the medication to start working. Be patient with the medication and be patient with yourself.

1,"How you react to any medication will vary depending on the person, but personally I find medication really helpful. To be more specific, my mood swings are much less extreme, and I find myself able to function better. They don't cure BPD, obviously, but in my personal experience, medication can make it easier to manage symptoms. The medication I'm on also has very few side effects, so I don't feel like there's a negative trade off for me, other than the negative feelings I sometimes get about needing them.

One note I want to make is that sometimes it may take a while to find medicine that works well for you. So if you do decide to try it and it doesn't seem to work, don't give up! Also, if there are any particular side effects you're worried about (for example, I wasn't okay with weight gain or a risk of high blood sugar), make sure to tell your doctor and they should work with you.

(ETA words)",torgoboi,clb2xk
2,"I definitely think it can be helpful. Be aware that the first kind you try may not be right for you, and that it may take some time to find medication that really helps and has no side effects/side effects you can live with. 

Typical side effects include impact on your sleep (either feeling tired/sleeping a lot or not being able to sleep) impact on your appetite (can go either way, hunger or eating less) to, nausea and headaches, dry mouth. Most side effects are not too horrendous and go away after a few months. 
 
On the plus side, find the right drug and dose and it can have a huge impact on your wellbeing. So I'd say if your doctor thinks it might help, go for it.",Literally_-_Literary,clb2xk

Anyway, fluoxetine is helpful if you don't want to think much, like if you're in a rut you can't get out of. If that's the case, try taking it every morning. If it's not, then take it at night.

9,"Here's another alternative I used. I meditated for 3 hours a day in January. I would sit and  repeat and contemplate  things  like neuroplasticity (the whole process) and cortisol's impact on the brain & how that can lead to mental illness. Facts. I would repeat and meditate on facts. I'd repeat CBT methods to myself as well as other ways of repairing cortisol damaged parts of the brain. I'd think about and repeat to myself ways of repairing neural pathways that were thinned out and how they worked. I meditated on these facts over and over because I wanted to give less resources to my emotional neural pathways. It worked like a charm. I also spent that whole month doing new things to stimulate new neural pathways. To be honest, it needs maintenance and since I haven't kept it up, I've been a bit much to handle still. I'm a bad person to live with still, but this  whole year my bad decisions have been reduced by like 60% or so and to me, that's as big as the moon landing.

A bad/toxic/unhealthy relationship really exasperates my symptoms and behaviours and can really set you back in learning how best to cope and manage your bpd. 

My advice is to learn your triggers, identify the parts of you that are hurt, and allow yourself to feel worthy of love as an imperfect person.

Wasn't a great experience, I was drinking a lot and on a medication that worsened my anxiety, I acted like a paranoid weirdo and people noticed lol.

I worked there for like 3 weeks. But I'm 100% convinced they remember and still judge me.

Also when I start feeling insecure in my relationship, that's the #1 thing that leads to splitting & delusions. It's so weird. Because when I'm not in a bad spot mentally, I can talk to my partner about it and be like ""yeah sometimes I become delusional and believe that you hate me, would be happier with someone else, think I'm a burden etc"" and he reassures me that he loves me and isn't against me in any way.

I think it's a good idea for him to talk to a therapist, but I'm wondering if couples therapy could also be a viable option. A couple's therapist doesnt try to get two people back together, but rather their focus is on the best outcome for both people, whether the two people stay together or break up. It sounds like you're both very kind to each other, so you have a good base to start out with.

I have been in a similar place to you before where I *needed* to be talking to my FP at all times or I'd lose it. Time with your FP can be very addictive and right now you're taking that drug like a junkie. Try to wean yourself off time talking to your FP slowly to prepare for the coming change. Communicate openly with your FP about your plan, why you're doing it, and ask their help with slowly reducing communication time. Find out what kind of communication time you'll have after their job moves back to the office, and make that amount the goal for you to reduce down to. Look for ways to stay occupied when you're not talking to your FP. Maybe think of ways to surprise them when you do get to talk to them next. Perhaps if you're artistically inclined you could work on art as a gift for your FP. 

It's hard, but I believe in you. You'll feel a lot more functional and whole and when you are more independent you will have a more healthy relationship that you can feel extra proud of. 

I'm also in an LDR and it's been hard especially since you can't see your partner in real life but it's really valuable to me to still have a healthy relationship and when I do get to talk to him I have a whole day's worth of events to tell him all about!",sparrowlion,vhwiek

0,"I'm not a parent. I want to be clear that my perspective is that of your daughter. My dad also did/does his best and I'm blessed to have a mom who is endlessly patient and giving (well... maybe not endlessly). My sister is also diagnosed BPD.

1) Therapy can be incredibly healing. My traumas don't come from my dad as much as other situations from my life. It's tempting to make that the line in the sand, but I encourage you to be aware that the ""as long as it's not therapy"" line might discourage your daughter from being as mentally healthy as possible.

2) You are aware of yourself enough to search for answers outside your own experience. That puts you *miles* ahead of other parents, even those without and diagnosed mental obstacles to overcome. Your daughter(s) are lucky to have a parent who cares to be a kind, loving, and capable parent.

3) I also happen to be high-functioning and high-anxiety. My teenage years were mostly small redirects from my parents. We set ground rules and agreed together on consequences if the rules were broken. Getting buy in from her is vital. My sister on the other hand is a wild child. Her BPD manifested in ways that made setting those boundaries next to impossible. My parents went through years of family and individual therapy to keep her as safe as possible. The bar went from ""high-acheiving"" to ""as long as she's a productive member of society"". As my parents learned to give her independence, she stumbled. But every time, my parents offered her love while not enabling her, and now she's stable.

4) Sorry this comment is so long. I hope you found it useful. Ultimately, violence = bad and clear boundaries with reasonable consequences = good. And of course, be mindful to offer praise. Remind them you love them frequently. Otherwise, it sounds like you've got this.",voteforpatty,gzchx0

To be clear, we both have therapists and psychiatrists. She is also shortly about to get much more help through a state funded service.

As I read your reply, I realized we do a lot of that. We've always kept an open policy, with no shame. If we issue an edict, policy, rule, etc. the kids know that if they feel part of it is unfair, we discuss it. We have actually taken their input and applied it from time to time. I was raised to ""believe"" that my opinion didn't matter, that they were infallible and if they weren't, I had no right to speak up. Beyond that, I don't understand the whole mystery of parenting. We tell our kids what to do, but we aren't afraid to tell them why.

Also in reading it, I think I realized the problem. It's me. I have a HUGE problem being a disciplinarian. I hate telling people what to do. And I hate making my kids unhappy.

You see, that's quite silly. But isn't your  worse case scenario too much? I think so.

 The most likely scenario is he has known that friend for years and talks to them often.

Then not even a month ago I found that his ex had sent him a Snapchat a year ago on an account that I didn‚Äôt know existed.

2,"I can really relate as I have been in a relationship with someone like your mom and even been like your mom or parroted those beliefs of you should be able to do things because I can. It is a highly narcissistic way of thinking. It isn't correct and the person saying that lacks empathy or can't deal with THEIR emotions. Please understand that. You are not incorrect.

In my case the person who was telling me these things I kept trying to explain to her that the more she pushed the further locked in my mental crisis prison I would get. It was horrible. I empathize so much with your pain and anger and self hatred. I tried and tried to change myself that way and its exhausting and soul crushing. 

From your post it sounds like your mom is very mentally damaging for you to be around. Is there a reason you are stuck being around her? Is there any way you can get out or away from her influence? You clearly have a lot of pain to process and this is only  making it worse. She probably will not listen to you. 


In my case the only thing that soothed that intense self loathing was that, miracle of miracles, the person who was pushing and gaslighting me ended up validating the harm they did to me apologizing and reaffirming that I did not deserve it (up to that point they insisted I deserved it). I have been locked in cycles with her for a long time. And the way out was that I swallowed my pride and apologized and took responsibility for the damage I had done her, and listened to her even though I didn't agree with her perspective, and she actually opened up about how much my behavior hurt her or just the pain she was feeling, and then I was able to follow that up by sharing the same, how much her behavior had impacted me. We still have to separate to heal and protect ourselves but I have never felt ANYTHING like that moment of validation. It showed me how powerfully mind destroying gaslighting is to someone with a vulnerable mind. I began to imagine what it would be like to be around people who did not gaslight me at all, even if I was simply alone. I imagined how different life might feel. 

It inspired me to decide with a heavy heart I have to cut off contact further with my parents if they keep gaslighting me and leave a job that is confusing where I have bad boundaries.
 I have thought I can tolerate it and explain or just put my feelings aside. But there will come a breakthrough point when you realize how much your peace matters and that nothing in the world is worth mental chaos because it will destroy your soul and everyone around you will be affected. 

All that is to say I hope you can find a way to unentangle from your mom even if you still care or love her. Don't be surprised if things begin to feel a lot different. The stuff you are saying here is very heavy and dangerous. That amount of shame and self blame will eat you alive. It isn't that you have BPD and are bad as much as your BPD may be allowing you to emotionally stay in a destructive situation.

4,"Oh no this is very clear now that you shared this information. It sounds like you are in a mind trap where she is able to exploit your guilt and shame to make you useful for herself as she probably can't face her own inability to care for herself.  

I also struggle with oversharing my issues with unfit people, an early childhood pattern. That you can recognize it is a great step. Maybe you can find another outlet or somewhere to receive validation as it seems you are experiencing a strong amount of manipulation and gaslighting yourself from her and she is projecting. If you are paying her bills and she is threatening to kill herself if you leave that is an abusive domestic situation and you may need more serious help to extract yourself don't take it lightly. There are domestic violence shelters and places that could help you begin the process when and if you are ready.

0,"Hello, are you me a few years ago?


It sounds like you are torn between pleasing your mother and pleasing yourself and that you are perhaps looking for affirmation from your husband as to who to please? Which is understandable.


I would do the thing that brings you joy.


My mother has constantly undermined me and my choices in life.
She says that one of her biggest regrets in life is not 'pushing' me hard enough at school. This is fucked up on quite a few levels. I dropped out of school before my GCSEs because I had the first of many breakdowns.


Throughout my life so far I have tried to please her by being 'academic' and failed and hated myself because I wasn't meeting her expectations. Instead I pursued art and I have done well in that which has culminated in me graduating with a First class degree with honors and I have been offered a teaching assistant position on my degree course.


Yes, this is not something I will make megabucks with but it brings me joy, because of my confidence and joy in what I do with my life it has allowed me to seek opportunities and branch out into things related to my degree that I also enjoy.


You should have seen her disappointment when I told her I was thinking of doing a painting and decorating course this summer. She doesn't seem to care about my actual happiness and seems more concerned about her ability to brag to the rest of the family about me.


So in short, disconnect from your mother's toxic and broken view of life. Talk to your husband about how you would like more positive affirmation about life choices because it's important to you that he's proud of you. Do what brings you joy, because happiness in my opinion is the only real end goal that matters in the world.


Sorry if I have rambled at you but this is something I feel I have personal experience with and I hope that I can give you guidance and help :)

0,"Sorry to hear that. But I am going to be honest with you. Now is the time to validate yourself. Sometimes no one will but you. So here is what you can validate. You made the effort to find help for yourself. You got out of bed. You may have even made yourself breakfast. Start with validating the little things. 

Another thing is cope ahead. Think of all of the possibilities (like the bad therapist) and what you might do if you run into bad situations and how you might cope with them well. If someone invalidates you then validate yourself and remember you're worth it. If the price is too high try again or ask if they are willing to meet in the middle. 

If it comes down to it reddit has r/dbtselfhelp with so many resources and worksheets to practice. And you can always continue your search another day after a cup of hot cocoa or an activity that soothes you.

1,What you're feeling is normal. And sex can he a form of intimacy for most couples. If you have boundaries on this it's okay to have them if they are healthy. Ask your partner if their feelings fit the facts of the current situation. Imo it sounds like it doesn't fit the facts and they are comparing their past to the present and haven't fully recovered and healed. Maybe they might need a bit of therapy. They have to want therapy though as in cases of rape it is traumatic. Any trauma whether little or big is still trauma and needs to be worked through in order to live the best life possible.

Makes sense, in my opinion. He doesn't want to change, he just wants to keep holding onto you, like you said. I think he will only get better at hiding. He also showed some narcissistic behaviors, to avoid taking responsibility he blames you, and instead of working with you he avoids and 'escapes' with fantasy casual relationships - flirting, sexting, imagining what he would 'have' if not for the relationship with you.

I can't say if your conditions or the cultural expectations are fair or not, but he chooses not to respect them, and doesn't seem to want to compromise and work with you. His 'expectations' are also not very fair; he seems very sketchy and self absorbed, and make me upset to read

>he is not meeting up with these people (again, it's the idea that it's not cheating if is not physical)

The only difference is the opportunity, and with a history of cheating, why *wouldn't* he give into the desire if the opportunity came up (when it comes up, TBH).

I have various personality disorders and PTSD, and yes, I probably will be on medication for the rest of my life (I‚Äôm 34 now and I started when I was 16). To be honest, I can‚Äôt even imagine life without them. They make me better. Why would I stop taking something that makes me better? Work on removing that medication stigma, and try to accept that medication can be a good thing.

Everyone is having a horrible time at the moment, and I think it‚Äôs especially hard for those of us with mental illness to endure. We‚Äôre lonely, claustrophobic, anxious, and some of our coping strategies have been removed. It‚Äôs natural that you‚Äôre feeling extra poorly at the moment. Let yourself accept that things are going to be really rubbish for a little while, but don‚Äôt forget that this will end. And you will have good days again.

I was very lucky around six or seven years ago and was offered ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy), and it changed my life. I still struggle, of course. I bloody posted here last week because I cut myself! It was the first time in two years, though, and of course I‚Äôm struggling with the lockdown like everyone else. But on the whole, it has allowed my recovery. It‚Äôs very peculiar because it forces you to lean into your trauma and accept it, rather than fight it (which is what we‚Äôve spent all our lives doing, right?). But it works. There‚Äôs also a programme here called STEPPS which is used for those with PDs who aren‚Äôt as far into their recovery. Have a look into both these therapies/programmes and see if someone near you might offer them (when lockdown is over).

1,"Join support groups, keep up with forums like this, research even more into it for your own good and peace of mind. 

Growing up and before getting diagnosed with my own stuff, I really enjoyed researching the shit out of things that interested me. Mental health being one of them. I knew something was up with me very early on and THANK GOODNESS for the internet because before all this met neutrality went down and internet life was actually bearable and relatively ‚Äúfresh‚Äù, I was able to explore my mind and wackiness through research and actually allowing myself to feel and think the things I did. I just didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I‚Äôd read, watch videos, and ask google more and more to kinda get a sense of what I was going through, for my own peace of mind... because if I at least understood and accepted what I was going through, than that‚Äôs okay and enough. Because no one actually knows what we‚Äôre thinking or feeling unless we physically and vocally do so.. 

It became my own sacred secret. And that was okay and is okay for me because I also learned fairly quickly that the human condition alone is a very complex one, let alone one that is naturally made with an imbalance (which is also okay), so I‚Äôd just have to make sure that I was keeping it in check the best way that I could without letting fear, shame or guilt get in the way. 

Granted, that‚Äôs a bit harder now with having to grow up and transition to full blown adulthood. But it‚Äôs a great concept and sort of ‚Äúlight‚Äù to look to. You are who you are because that‚Äôs how youre biologically made. But you get to decide how you treat yourself and how you want to show up in your life, day to day. Even if it‚Äôs something unique each day. Just as long as you  work towards building a balance, a blue print to how you yourself need to survive and thrive. 

That includes letting go and REALLY not giving a fuck about what people think about you. Do what‚Äôs right for you so long it doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone or offend anyone. 

Honor yourself. Love yourself with your flaws and all. Because at the time of death that is all we have, ourselves. 

You have FULL reign over your body. Over your mind. Over your heart. Just because it‚Äôs been a tough fight, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to lose. 

Idk if you watch Naruto or anime at all, but if there‚Äôs one think I‚Äôve gotten so far from Naruto is that each day, each moment brings a new challenge. Whether it be mental, physical or spiritual. Whether we‚Äôre ready or not, equipped enough or not. The important part is to show up and fight. Give your best and your all, regardless if you win or lose. 

Life is a win/lose game. It‚Äôs a matter of what we learn from it and how we use it to keep going. Because dude, as crazy as some days may feel living with this, we also experience some pretty dope amazing things! That wouldn‚Äôt be the same if we were normal! 

Kinda like Hannah Montana too üòÇ best of both worlds! 

Make the most out of it love! Even if it hurts like fucking hell sometimes. It‚Äôs okay. We don‚Äôt like a lot of thing, but we still get through it because we have to. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid or ashamed. You‚Äôre you and you are trying! And that is enough!

Also, don‚Äôt give up on trying to find a good match in terms of healthcare and therapy. I‚Äôve yet to find a good match, and even though it‚Äôs made things relatively worse in some aspects, I don‚Äôt wanna give up. And you shouldn‚Äôt either. You deserve to live a full life.",betsyletsy,fxe0xe

Currently, I am looking for a group therapy workshop to handle these emotions and to not feel so alone. Since I have been unsuccessful thus far I have turned to reddit to reach out to those feeling the way I do so I can mitigate this pain. ",alicialee2093,3o43zk

1,"The thing about any serious mental health problem is that it basically puts your life on hold until it's been resolved/recovery.

I've had to accept that my life is going to proceed at a slower pace than other's simply because I have this enormous thing to deal with as well. Although I'm younger than you (25) I've also thought about having kids in the future and when I would like to do that. I recently broke up with my LT boyfriend and that felt like a massive step back in regards to how I thought my life should proceed.

Right now recovery is my top priority. I finally moved out my mother's house a year ago. I'm at university. I have not worked for years because of BPD. I'll be starting an 18 month MBT course in the new year. 

I'm just about holding it together right now, with a fuck load of support.

What I'm trying to say is that life is a ladder. We cannot just jump straight to the top, even if we can just about see it from where we are now. We have to take each step at a time, at our own pace, while constantly checking to make sure it's the right step.

1,"Hi so i understand being reluctant to start therapy again especially if you do that thing where you tell your therapist what you think they want to hear (been there). If you are in dbt therapy though, you will fill out a card each day with things like emotions and actions, so your therapist can go over that and you will be less likely to forget what's happened and you guys have real concrete things to talk about. That was scary for me at first, having a record of all my maladaptive coping behaviors but it has actually helped bring to the forefront things I  really need to work on and started showing patterns of why I do the things I do. 

I've been in therapy since I was thirteen and I feel like dbt has been great so far because it is so focused on what is happening now and concrete strategies to use going forward, as opposed to just talking about my past and hoping the therapist likes me. ",standarddev,3gjjkx

Suicidal ideation sucks balls, as does being suicidal in general. Can you discuss starting DBT with your therapist? CBT is fine enough and might be able to help you a bit, but DBT is the one designed specifically for BPD.

As far as the urge so self harm, just try to keep things from building up if you can. I say this because I recently had some relapse with self harm after a couple weeks of feeling frustrated with my ex fp for not making any effort. I think if I had exercised more instead of staying in it could have been avoided. Be aware of your tirggers, talk to people you're close to about them. I've made the mistake of not rly disclosing my fear of ababdonment so when ppl stopped responsing theres no way they could have known how much pain that would bring me.

1,"Ok so! Ive started doing this and its helped me so much. It kind of started when my therapist told me that i need to mind my inner child as if theres literally a child there that needs to be minded. So when i feel rejected and you can feel it physically hurting inside, ill go ‚Äúhey. Im here, youre ok.‚Äù And kind of mind myself as if im someone else. It probably sounds nuts but its really helped. Also by treating yourself like youre talking to a child, you stop blaming yourself for shit, you stop talking down to yourself all the time. You turn yourself into your own parent and do what your parents didnt do for you. Its hard and it feels weird dont get me wrong, but it kind of helps me realize i dont need anyone to validate me or constantly reassure me that theyre not leaving me. Because the thing about constantly asking someone else to reassure all the time is that, youll usually feel like youre a burden on them and it probably does put pressure on them to mind you instead of minding themselves. And also, no matter how many times someone else reassures you, youre probably not going to feel any better, and if you do itll be for a very short time. You are great and you have to believe that youre great. It takes alot of work to get through the constant fear of abandonment. But trying to reparent yourself helps, i think.

0,"Are you in DBT? They would probably suggest a lot of Opposite Action and Radical Acceptance. 

Opposite Action is when you have a destructive emotion come up, you figure out what that emotion is urging you to do, and then do the opposite thing. It‚Äôs basically rewiring your brain to not give into the emotional impulses. Examples of opposite action in your case might include deleting his contact info so you can‚Äôt reach out to him, setting yourself up at work so you can‚Äôt make eye contact, spending time with people other than him when you miss him. 

Radical Acceptance basically means that when we no longer have any other active choices to reduce our suffering, we need to accept the reality before us. It sounds like you are out of options to engage in a healthy relationship with this man. Accepting reality means accepting that the beginning part of your relationship that you are mourning is gone and is not coming back. Once you radically accept this, your suffering will lessen. 

Other skills that will help short term when your feeling really rough: 

 self-soothing, which uses your 5 senses to relax you. Example: sight- look at art you enjoy in happy colors or count tiles, sound- listen to your favorite podcast or playlist, smell- brew some (decaf) coffee or tea, touch- change the sheets on your bed, taste- slowly savor some comfort food you really enjoy. 

Distraction: this is only works if you engage in it until you are calm, and then use other skills like opposite action or radical acceptance. Basically you do activities you enjoy that reduce the distressing emotions. NO sad or romantic movies! Do things that don‚Äôt remind you of your guy. 

Hope this helps.

 So I don‚Äôt know if I have the best advice but I would suggest a few things. One is that there is a web site https://www.nyp.org/bpdresourcecenter that‚Äôs an online resource center for bpd and I‚Äôm sure they have suggestions on there and there‚Äôs also a crisis number I think, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs different from a suicide hotline or not. 
 Also you can look up dialectical behavior therapy techniques and start doing some on your own, that‚Äôs what the woman who assessed me recently suggested until I can get into a therapist. 
 Other than that there‚Äôs all the distracting stuff that might help, regular exercise, hobbies etc. I know those aren‚Äôt always useful in the midst of an episode or breakdown though but at the least it can be ways to give your brain more dopamine which can be beneficial. 
 Another thing, I know this is not easy either, especially when your suspicious of how they really feel, but trying to talk to your boyfriend, trusted friends and or family can be helpful. If you can allow yourself to be vulnerable and open with them it can work as a sort of exposure therapy. 
 It all takes work and dedication because it seems so hard to control ourselves or our emotions but we can do it! That‚Äôs all the advice I can think of off the top of my head, I hope some of it works and I hope you can get into to see someone soon.

Whether you believe me or not, that right there is a huge step in the right direction.  There is no 100% miracle drug and there are non-medication-related changes that are critical if you want to heal.  

One of those changes is learning to just be okay with yourself.  Try to notice when you're beating yourself up and find something to distract you.  Then focus on trying to accept yourself as you are.  You're not good, you're not bad, you're just you.  After awhile, it becomes habit.

1,"I can't be of much help because my brain operates in the exact same way -- I had a nearly identical experience when I first started dating my current bf.

But even after months of dating, the knowledge that he was just TALKING to one or two other people while we were together during that first week was excruciating.

0,"I don't know that either of these 2 points will bring you real comfort but

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out.

I don't want to minimise how unique your situation is, but I will say that I definitely share a sense that I'm living purely out of obligation to my family and also that it feels pretty much impossible for me to feel any positive emotions, enjoy anything or relax completely without self-judgment, fear or paranoia setting in.

1,"Also, this was for me personally when I was your age. I'd make a lot of dicey sexual decisions and my bpd, being neglected and abused as a child up untill my late teens played a huge role in making bad decisions that I didn't even want to make. I hurt more people than I am proud of, and I didn't even want to sleep with them or hook up with them. 

What worked for me was trying to make it as not about sex as possible. I think being this way makes things feel like it is a lot more than what reality is. And that included sex for me.

I was just making very bad decisions... And as much as other people had their role and responsibility in it. I am responsible for choosing poorly and making bad decisions. Whether I have bpd or not. We all are... It's just much harder with bpd because of splitting and other issues it causes",Intelligent-Fun4320,1cfsqxh

I think he has BPD too and I think that maybe he truly loves me, and just slept with other people to make me jealous or to feel something.

It's crazy how similar you are to me, minus the Christian background and not being accepted by your parents. I'm a lesbian but my parents told me before I ever even knew what being gay was that I would be accepted and my parents had no religious affiliations. But a lot of what you described growing up and how your felt is how I felt. I haven't had any drug problems or weight problems but I think it's mostly because my mom and all her brothers had drug addictions so I've always been really careful with that. But I have put myself in debt over $20,000 twice with my shopping addiction. I've also been asked a lot if I've ever been sexually abused but don't have any memory of anything. I'm sure I have BPD but I haven't been diagnosed. I've been misdiagnosed bi polar also but always knew that was wrong because my mood swings are caused by outer circumstances not chemical imbalance and because my sister is bi polar so I've seen manic episodes and I don't have those. My new therapist doesn't believe in diagnosis so I don't have any diagnosis she's just working on each thing I want to work on one at a time.

0,"No, it is not. Generally getting diagnosed young is a good indicator (things become more difficult as you get older, but with the correct treatment is not even chronic).

I'll use myself as example: 21 old male, 1.5yr on therapy. According to DSM:

\- **Fear of abandonment.** It is still there, it still makes me fuck up some relationships but I've improved.

\- **Unstable relationships.** My last relationship was the one that has lasted me the longest in my life (a few months lol, not too much), but I was able to express myself in a more effective way which has deffntly helped. Friendships are also healthier and I don't split on them a lot. I'm also able to leave now unhealthy relationships in a rational way.

\- **Unclear or shifting self-image.** Gone from 0 self image at all to being able to put a biography on tinder lol. Jokes apart there is still work to do but it got really better.

\- **Impulsive, self-destructive behaviors.** Stopped stealing, using drugs and alcohol. Sometimes I fuck up but I'm able to manage my impulses better.

\- **Self-harm.** Almost gone (at least cuts, burns, etc).  I still get suicidal thoughts time to time but honestly nothing more than ""fuck off I'd be better dead"", didn't feel in real danger in a while. 

\- **Extreme emotional swings.** Still get them but emotions are not as intense (I miss that lol) and I switch less between anxious/sad.

\- **Chronic feelings of emptiness.** Not gone. I think this is one of the harderst to overcome. 

\- **Explosive anger.** I can manage better my impulses while angry, still get very angry sometimes but I don't shout ugly stuff and I'm breaking less things.

\- **Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality.** Gone worse, specially when I'm at street.

&#x200B;

As you see it's not much but a noticeable change within a year. My black/white thinking also improved and I'm more functional now, but there is still a lot of hard work. Group therapy with a good terapist and other people like us has helped a lot. I've seen very severe patients get better and that feels hopeful. Having this said, if your psych thinks that BPD/your case is chronic just look for the right one, this doesn't only require a lot of hard work from you, also a qualifyed therapist.",normieuser1,i18jve
1,"There's no professional disagreement, tbh. A bit of left over stigma and ignorance, maybe. Borderline is not a lifelong diagnosis. Its a ""good prognosis diagnosis"", a ""hope bearing diagnosis"". The majority of people with BPD can expect symptoms to improve with or without treatment. With treatment the average number of clinical symptoms drops from an average of 5+ to an average of 3+. Some features, for example emotion regulation, are harder to treat than others, like distress tolerance and self harm. After remission, rates of relapse are actually fairly low and most improvement comes in the first few years following diagnosis.

That's not to say everyone recovers, but most people can expect a stable few relationships and opportunity to work. Some complicating factors that lead to longer lasting symptoms or failure to remit include more severe trauma history, comorbid diagnoses like bipolar mood disorder or substance use disorder.

Any professional who believes BPD is not treatable is one to be avoided.",TranZeitgeist,i18jve

0,"This is probably terrible advice but I have a few suggestions to bring it up subtley, one could be to simply leave a page up about it on the pc or phone or whatever, while she's around and go make a cup of tea or something, perhaps ask her to close the page/ lock the phone/ some subtle excuse, that way you're not accusing or bringing it up, and let them discover it by themselves. Another way would perhaps send her a link and be like ""oops meant to send that to someone else"". Or ask her if she was having problems with -some random sympton on the list-

Obviously it comes from the hopelessness after letting the episodes get to me. Plus my friends never having similar experiences can leave me isolated because it can be hard to share with them the intensity of it and them not judge me or feel sorry for staying. But meditation has been helping me a lot with letting things go and reviving the loving and supportive energy I know he needs. The more I educate myself and try to put my self love first. The quicker he diffuses and apologizes. I also try not to let him dwell in shame but rather to focus on solutions when he‚Äôs out of the fog. So I‚Äôm trying to become an example rather than try and fix him. It takes a lot of the pressure off of him which I feel can trigger the episodes. Also I ask the universe for guidance, strength and grace as often as I need and she never disappoints. If I don‚Äôt receive then I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. Also setting space while reassuring him I‚Äôm not leaving him helps. I know it hurts to reads those posts misinformed folks express. It annoys me when I look for help and the internet reads run, get out while you can. But people are just hurt they lost someone they hoped they‚Äôd have forever. Especially if it got dangerous so they had no other option than to leave. It‚Äôs hard to stay away from a dangerous situation when you have a lot of sympathy for it so people turn cold to protect themselves from a relapse. It‚Äôs easier to be angry than to feel hopeless. Anger= can‚Äôt be rejected. Plus western medicine is not as far along as people give it credit. This line also helps me

6,"Actually, reddit hates all cluster b personalities. Narcs, socio/psychopaths, us. I think they confuse hpd with bpd often, so them, as well. They just aren't aware. As soon as someone is lacking the slightest bit of empathy, someone has to point out npd or aspd. üôÑ

I realize the seriously problematic issues of cluster b's, especially in relation to crime with sociopathy. Obviously not everyone with it is a criminal or violent person, but it is a concern.

However, most of them have been played up by media portrayals and people who assume their loved ones are the only example of people with bpd ever. It's tiring. I have ""quiet"" bpd, so people just think I'm naive and younger than I am... Until they really get to know me. Not that many people do. I'm careful about getting close to others.

It kills me that people will advocate for ""mental illness"" - - i.e. Anxiety and depression, until they are blue in the face. But other conditions, that are often comorbid conditions are overlooked and demonized.

8,"Theres no excuse for being abusive, disordered or not.",,gyq3ao
9,"I didn't mean to make it sound that way.

What i was trying to say was that people with bpd can be abusive as much as anyone else can.

Pointing fingers at people with bpd is not helpful for either side as it enables harmful stereotypes, and making the coping with the trauma about the abuser is simply not a good way to cope. There's a reason trauma therapy exists and there's a reason why victims of abuse are not split up into groups by the mental health problems of their abuser. And there is a reason trauma therapy groups are led by professionals. 

If you want to simply be informed about why people with bpd share certain behaviours, looking in a subreddit that makes the abuse about the mental illness of the abuser the core of the sub, will not be helpful but harmful. In many cases, the victims will share their own personal view, which aren't accurate to the mental illness sometimes but to their abuser. Looking for information in a place where many people gather who are struggling with trauma unsupervised, will not make anyone informed. 

You're right, being abusive is not right. Neither is labeling a group of people as abusers because they have the same mental illness
And many of the people i have seen on the subreddit simply need trauma therapy with professional supervision, to understand that coping with trauma is about you and not about the abuser
Sorry for the confusion I'm having trouble to put into words what i mean when i get heated in the brain (also im not native English speaker so some of the things i say might sound weird) 

Anyway tl;dr 
It's not okay to abuse anyone 
It's not okay to reduce a person to their mental illness
Coping with trauma should be supervised by professionals 
People who were traumatised by someone with a mental illness shouldn't give advice about how to handle a person with the same mental illness 
People with mental illness shouldn't be reduced to the mental illness

0,"I have this problem too. Avoidance is a bitch of a downward spiral!

It's easier for me to be motivated at work. I still have a hard time pushing myself to clean up around the house or do other ""boring"" tasks like paying bills. At work, I tell myself ""I just have to show up."" and ""It's never been my brains or creativity, it's being dependable. That's the easy part, Annie. Just do that."" Positive mantras are really helping me. 

Self-awareness about the *reason* you struggle with motivation might help too. Literally this week I was thinking to myself ""and why do I despise cleaning so much?"" and I realized: it's because I was always in trouble when I was cleaning as a kid. And trouble meant yelling. And crying. Big, long fights with my parents. 

So I decided to stop framing it that way. Reframing was huge for me for this - maybe reframing the tasks may help? I also put on Sims music while I'm cleaning so I feel like a sim - it helps take me psychologically out of the task and pretend like I'm just a machine algorithm completing a task, and I'll do something else when I'm done.

I don't know how long and hard you've been struggling with any of this, or what exactly you've been through...

And I'm not much of talking people out of informed decisions about things they really want. Especially this kind. I also don't know where you're from and its regarding laws, over here in the Netherlands, you have to have been through *every* available, applicable therapy there is before the doctors will let you start on the euthanasia track. This can take years, which is the purpose, because sometimes people meet a someone, or learn a something in those years that changes them for the rest of their lives.

Like knowing love is still possible, a nice job is still possible, a better life *is* possible. Some things might require you to migrate, travel, forgive and forget, learn, letting go. Leave your comfort zone.

Friend I met in therapy stopped living for himself, became a full-time volunteer for the things he believes in. The change he wanted to see in the world. Our government understands thanks to his shrinks, gives him the welfare he deserves and leaves him the fuck alone to do whatever. Has been doing that for about 15 years, met a lady friend he liked so much, he contemplated getting a vasovasostomy. Turns out she was infertile (childhood disease or something?), so they adopted instead. They all make each other so fairy tale happy, he's started pinching himself to check he's actually awake.

In case there's nothing any one can do to change your mind 'for the better', really, it's all subjective, I'd like to know the day of your birthday so I can think about you, send you some good vibes and all that shit while you're going through the process. If that's okay with you?

Lady friend I met in therapy didn't tell anyone the date of her euthanasia so no one got to say goodbye, I'm happy for her, though still somewhat upset because I'm very fond of closure. Sorry if I'm projecting onto you.

If anything though? Why not postpone one year, and have your last year be a bucket list year, a year of 'happiness' (I just cringed at my own words, but it translates to doing at least one thing that makes you happy every day, document it, and look back upon it at the end. What you'll have are 356 pics of things you did that you don't regret to look back on), before you die painlessly in a freak accident (assuming your insurance doesn't cover ending your own life willingly in whatever way).

Maybe, on some beach around the equator, or a snowy mountaintop, you find the one person (or thing or whatever, really) that'll make life bearable, worth it. The thing that'll change your mind and heart.

Sorry, I tried to keep this short but I keep going on... In the end, it's your life, your decision, even if it's 'our loss'.

3,"Please reconsider. Two years ago I was you. I hadn't planned the way you had, rather I was sitting with a knife dug into my leg, ready to slice my femoral artery. My cat calmly stepped onto my lap and I realized I couldn't just leave her alone in the world. Now, two years later, I've turned my life into one I want to live. Do I still think about suicide? Sure. But I assure you, if you do this, you will never know what your life could have been. Please PM me if you need to talk. ",someborderlinegirl,4xv8ch
4,"Hi! I've had the police called on me twice in one day last week for welfare checks;  I am a veteran of suicide ideation. After over a decade of struggling with BPD, 5 years of which was treated as depression (with therapy going nowhere) and only 1 with a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with BPD I am SLOWLY turning around. Getting better is SO slow. I have planned my death the exact way you have but for some reason I'm always enticed by a better tomorrow. If you die, you are letting the demons win. And I totally understand about being tired and looking forward to not wanting to wake up; BPD is so bloody exhausting and making it through each day is terrifyingly hard that permanent sleep sounds blissful. Please just hang on. I'm not better by any large measurable means but my GP and psychiatrist have seen a marked change in me but let me tell you it's been slow and you need to hang on. Don't be discouraged by slow progress. I am new to reddit and I have found it a tremendous resource for meeting people especially on this forum. ",jennaau23,4xv8ch

8,"You're a really small part of this universe and there's so much you don't know and you now that you know you are ready to end it all, why don't you forget who you are? Just be a little something in this world and see everything that's beautiful as a little something. You are no one and have no identity, just some senses. And when the sky is clear and the sea washes up on your feet, just forget who you are. i think I am stoned. I  think I have BPD too but have not been to a psychiatrist for it yet

9,"What did you do to turn it around?

I feel like I'm in the deepest hole and I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking at the light. ",Toxic_Processor,4xv8ch
10,That's the thing. I talk to people all the time. I have help - but I still feel the same. ,Toxic_Processor,4xv8ch
11,I got a therapist who specialized in BPD. I started being honest with myself about my limitations. I threw away all my self harm implements. I found a partner who valued me even knowing about my diagnosis. Reddit is a great place. Meet people. Use them as resources. Please don't let a pit in your way be the time when you give up. Please. ,someborderlinegirl,4xv8ch
