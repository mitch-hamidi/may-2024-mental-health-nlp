I completed a DBT program back in March and I am forgetting so much. If you're in the US, you may want to check out your local NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter. They often have peer led support groups. They aren't DBT specific but you're likely to run into our people and it's free. I believe there are online options as well.",Alainasaurous,17hg4nh

2,"It's a traumatising illness. You can have DBT, and for many, it helps manage ideations, emotional distress, emotional outbursts, and many other symptoms. It's not a case if you are cured. As humans, we rise, we fall, and fall many times, getting back up again with some sort of resilience. It's a very misunderstood disorder, and many form inaccurate judgments on bpd, which reinforce shame amongst us who suffer the daily pain and misery of sensitively and disregulated emotions. We only have ourselves to believe that we are not our mental health only. We are much more beyond that. We are deserving of love , compassion, and understanding. If loved ones can not tolerate us at our worst, then that is their choice. You learn the art of knowing that despite the negative traits/symptoms of bpd, it's a double-edged sword, we feel intensely, we love deeply, for we have lots to offer also, we aren't immune to LOVE, to be loved! It's important that we do not believe negative perceptions of us of this disorder that can increase our suffering. We have to create a loving relationship with ourselves. We can not rely on others for that. It is a difficult rd, one that is relentlessly trying, one that makes you feel very alone. Again, we can not rely on others' approval or acceptance. It's the patience, love, care, forgiveness, and  tolerance of ourselves that lesson suffering. 
                 It is dam well hard. Please be KIND and gentle to yourselves! 🙏",,1blvdvy

0,"Dissocation is a criteria/common symptom of BPD and that scale is usually used to see what type of dissocation you are experiencing to help you with it. Like it's not usually used as it's own diagnostic tool or anything. I do have a dissociative disorder along with BPD and my therapist used that to see what symptoms were effecting my life the worst and how to help me the best. Dissocation can effect your life pretty severely and they are probably just trying to help you.

It scores for three things and each specific questions shows the specific they effect you. Amnesia which is pretty self explanatory, as well as depersonalization and derealization which is a disconnection from your sense of self/connection to reality, and last absorption factor which basically feeling like you loose yourself in things like watching shows or doing a task.

If this doesn't makes sense I can try and answer more questions if you have them.

Also some doctors don't really know much about dissocation so that may be why they didn't ask you to take it before,",ZoogieBear,164xo6o
1,"Thank you so much for responding, so helpful. Neither my psychiatrist or care coordinator explained anything - sort of a “there’s your homework, do that” attitude without any explanation so this is genuinely so good to know. 

Dissociation is something I’ve experienced for as long as I can remember, but I didn’t realise it was so strongly associated with BPD, sure when I’m having a “bad day” mentally, it’s way worse but I never really connected the dots between the two. 

My I received my initial diagnosis, it was during COVID season so imagine that will also be a factor in why I’ve not taken it previously, as everything was a telephone appointment. 

Depersonalisation and derealisation are terms I’ve heard previously however not clearly understood but your explain really does help. 

My score on the DES was 40, if I’ve calculated it correct from a small Google search (add all % together and divide by 28) however I’m reluctant to see what this would mean ahaha. 

Thank you so much for sharing your experience of this with me, massively appreciated x",Ghostieeefizz,164xo6o
2,"In BPD dissociation is caused by high stress and emotional response so it's something they look into.

It also helps in the bpd symptom of dissociation to have a scale of the dissociation you experience (like do you experience dr dp or not which is ""quite"" high on the scale) things like that.",AntYrbis,164xo6o

0,"r/BPD and r/borderlinepdisorder are the bigger subs, and r/bpdmemes is popular for memes.

When you're working with your therapist, what do you notice that makes it feel hard to share honestly? Maybe something in the way they look or react when you've shared in the past? When do you feel most comfortable being open?

Ultimately, if the goals you want to work on are being ignored, that seems like a problem.",TranZeitgeist,g5dvfe
1,"First off, the reason you're withholding information because, for one reason or another, you do not feel safe expressing how you feel. I've had tremendous difficulties expressing ""negative"" emotions such as anger and criticism towards a therapist. It's my experience that these always stem from our past experiences as children. Maybe it was not safe to express these emotions, maybe we were hit, gaslighted, guilt-tripped, shamed, or neglected when it comes to the expression of these emotions. So that's where the root of the problem is and it would be a good place to look for deeper understanding. It's very good that you have identified this problem. Therapy is about compatibility, sometimes changing a therapist helps. Sometimes the gender of the therapist makes a huge difference, we are projecting our relationship with our mother towards a female therapist, and our relationship with our father towards a male therapist. A good therapist is strong and encourages you to openly express your emotions, no matter how strong or ""negative"" (arbitrary label, no emotion is ever wrong or negative). My therapist openly told me not to hold back my anger because she identified that as a child I had to hide my ""bad"" emotions in order to prevent from being further emotionally abandoned by my parents. In a healthy family dynamic, all emotions are allowed to be expressed and relationships are genuine and honest. You need to find a way to recognize your true, forbidden emotions and finding an outlet for them. Often art is great at this.Here are a few resources to support communities:[https://www.facebook.com/groups/372949050115079](https://www.facebook.com/groups/372949050115079)[https://discord.gg/MyMCTq](https://discord.gg/MyMCTq)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5\_k5mlP0u0Q7C6IYpkPjHA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_k5mlP0u0Q7C6IYpkPjHA)

Please feel free to pm me if you need to :) Lastly, I want to add that emotions are what matter in therapy, banter is useless. Meaning, you can talk and analyze all day, but getting in touch with your emotions is where the real money is.",,g5dvfe
2,Thank you this is so helpful. I’ve linked it to not being able to be assertive (from interpersonal affective ness in DBT) that I’m willing to compromise my objectives (getting real benefit from therapy) with ‘preserving’ the relationship with him. I worry that as I am so sensitive to criticism/emotional intensity that he would be too. We had a much better session after I wrote that post and tried to be more authentic but it was hard. He said that every time I’m experiencing intense emotion I doubt and want to quit therapy. I messaged prior to the session saying I had used phone coaching to my skills group about my urges to quit therapy and he responded saying ‘I’m glad you sorted your ambivalence towards therapy cos it makes my job a lot easier - looking forward to seeing you’ and that made me really offended. I told him in the session and he said it was great I told him and it was a lighthearted joke to lighten the mood as he could hear my distress. It felt good being more authentic,lilmissclingy,g5dvfe
0,"I would change therapists. It shouldnt be like that. you can find someone that specializes in BPD, or at least has some experience in the field. You can go on psychology today and filter you choices using ur insurance & selecting BPD (in the issues section). Ive gone through a few therapists. One of them who actually was a bpd specialist, was still awful and my sessions w him reminds me of your situation. He wanted me to tell him how we should go about things, give suggestions about how to heal myself, without really giving a lot of suggestions himself. Hed let me sit in silence for extended period of time without saying anything to me (which i hated). I didnt feel like i was really going anywhere w him, and thats not how therapy is suppose to be. Not all therapists are equal, and not all therapists are gonna be good for you just bc they are for some else. Although it is a professional relationship, its still a relationship. So you gotta find one you like. Good luck ❤️",veyondalolo,hia96v
1,"How long have you been going to this therapist? Could it be possible maybe they aren’t the best fit anymore? I know anytime i was consistently doing therapy it would sometimes take a couple different ones but I found one who was able to help me. Also, I know it seems silly, but telling your therapist that you feel this way could help, they might understand exactly where you’re coming from. Like figuring this out could be the first step to figuring out everything else. You may click with this therapist like 100 but something is holding you back. Bottom line don’t feel silly for asking, that’s why they’re there! I believe you can do it. You might be discouraged but just remember a lot of our power comes from within ❤️Be open to everything.

1,"When I did therapy we went through something called a 'pot form' it literally represents boiling pots, starting with cold water until the pot is boiling over in 5 stages. The analogy didn't give me much but the process of thinking through what happened and what lead to each stage was really revealing for me. I don't get angry often at all, but I do get overly anxious and in my head about things- over thinking. And by writing down the stages of the escalation I was able to see where I was religiously starting to escalate and could make a change to cause it to stop, for me watching something super light hearted or changing music is a biggy. Recognising what the stages were and what each escalation looked like meant I could cut it off before it got into 'too late to go back territory', since I realised this I have not once gone into the higher levels. Ultimately, once you recognise your levels, you can make a choice to stop escalating...if you know how.",chiarodiluna,1bxmt25

0,"Hi I’m 37 and have been living with BPD most of my life. Properly diagnosed when I was 24. First off, people with BPD can absolutely be good even amazing partners. We just have to work extra hard on our end to stay constantly aware of ourselves and how we perceive whatever current situation we are facing that is triggering us. The best possible skill you can learn is respect boundaries both your own and the boundaries of others. For us, a lot of it comes down to communication. How we convey and receive to and from our loved ones. We have to work extra hard to remind ourselves that we need to trust and know our partners love us. And on their end they have to also be willing to stay healthy and regulated as well as taking part in either personal or group therapy. The truth is… we are a tall order. But we also, have the innate skill to love… if we remind ourselves why we are doing this, it’s all out of love.
I myself am entrenched in a battle that is slowly degrading my partners will to keep going. 
I’ve decided to take space after a big blow up. 
(This included splitting, devaluing, and the eventual “break up” talk) and I’ve been doing my best to calm myself physically and mentally while I let the emotions run it’s course. Im trying to be more observant rather than reactive. But I know deep down somewhere… im losing someone I truly love and care about… I honestly would not have revisited this BPD if it wasn’t for her. 
In that, makes her a great partner. But we are doing our best to keep ourselves healthy. And that comes first. Everything else, let them lay as they fall. And be ok in knowing you will be ok. Let it hurt. But do no harm.",Maximum_Primary6940,171nkeh

Then they feel bad because they hurt you is what you have to understand is it's not on purpose. I have been reading stuff to but I find a lot of it you have to read between the lines it's not a one size fits all. If your someone who needs to talk about it and she doesn't then ask her if she would be ok if you talked to someone about everything don't just do it the reason I she that is because my wife doesn't like if I tell people about the stuff we talk about. Which is completely fine with me. Some people may not be ok with  not talking to people about it. It  takes alot of  mind work for yourself to be ok doing it by yourself and the way I I'm doing it may not be for everybody but you may have to talk to other people about it my wife personally doesn't like when I share certain things about it and that's fine that's her choice and I respect her choices but you also have to remember that this isn't meant to be rude but may come off that way but look at it as this when they're in an episode it's  kind of like walking through a minefield but you just have to be careful that you don't step on what's going to trigger them. my wife normally likes when I'm super clingy likes but when she's in an episode she fuckin absolutely hates it it's because you have to read between the lines and stuff cuz like you can go read about it all you want but you have to find what work for you guys not what works for everyone else. all reality triggers are different for everybody sometimes it might not even be something you did it could be a season my wife I find it's more of the season like I said earlier but it is difficult you have to just work through it. Just be open with her about how you feel but you need to makes sure you use "" I "" statements I found that help alot because if you don't make it clear they are your feels and that  they didnt do anything because it will cause their mind to start to run and they will begin to let their  worst intrusive thoughts run and it could actually make it a lot worse because in all reality it's basically a giant fear that you're not good enough for anyone and that eventually you'll leave them. they can love you as much as they want and you can love them as much as you want you just have to keep in mind that if you didn't do  anything wrong and it seems like they're pulling away then just know that you that's when you need to be there for them and you need to be the Rock while they're in their hard place you get what I'm saying but it is extremely worth it if you can figure out what works for you and the person you're with that has BPD. I mean you don't have to share everything that's just what I have asked for it helps me know kinda where I stand with her her and  I don't want to sit there and be wondering what's going through her head.

I (female 20’s) tried to see a male therapist even though I have trauma and fear from men and it was a disaster. My therapist now is a woman in her 60’s and the dynamic is SO much better for healing.

I emailed my therapist about what I am feeling and that I know I’m being “inappropriate” and I don’t want to actually do anything that would jeopardise therapy but I felt I needed to be honest about my confusing feelings 

He was really understanding. He was very proud of me for emailing because he knows how hard it must have been to do that. I had a session on Thursday with him and I was so nervous but honestly it helped! 

He explained that the nature of the therapy that we’re doing (image rescripting where I insert him into a bad memory and he protects me until my “adult self” learns how to) can bring up all sorts of feelings and emotions and it was really helpful to look at it biologically 

Nothing was off, no boundaries crossed, I told him I am scared to ever leave therapy because I don’t ever want to be without him, I said a lot of things that I really realised are my abandonment issues and not about him specifically. We spoke about my issues with men and people pleasing and being scared of rejection. It all makes so much sense why I feel this way about him! 

I obviously still have conflicted feelings, and I think it doesn’t help that he’s ’my type’ but I think it’s also like the ultimate test in a way for me to really work though some shittttt.

I’m really grateful for everyone’s responses, but I do just want to say that it’s not a bad thing ever to tell your therapist your feelings - even if they’re uncomfortable, even if they’re feeling about fancying them. If they are a good therapist they should understand",Tiny_Lime5707,1c432s3

I am going to speak to him about it at our next session and explain that I don’t want to actually act on anything but I have to be honest about what has been happening.

12,"Idk why you’re getting downvoted for this like this isnt the most normal ‘bpd’ behavior I’ve read about all month. You have a crush on your presumably attractive and kind therapist which is enhanced x100 because of of your condition. That is ‘normal’ for the type of brain you have so no I don’t think it’s crazy. 

 I WOULD think it’s a dumb decision on your part to not try to snap out of the infatuation rq and address that for as long as you’re seeing this therapist, you’re probably not doing therapy. Like you’re going there but really just to fawn around him probably. You’re distracted from your mission. Plus if you’re not getting treatment the way you should then you’re likely to fuck up anything with him. Lets see how you can best play your cards here. 

I say you switch therapists and on your way out (last session maybe) you can tell him it’s because you have a crush on him. That way, its either mortifyingly embarrassing because he rejects you and then you never have to see him again OR the universe pulls a wild card and he gives you the green light BECAUSE you are no longer gonna be a patient. He would only ever take you up on this if you werent a patient. If you tell him while you’re a patient, he may refer you to go to someone else and you may feel too broken to be proactive about finding a new therapist. 

Good luck and lmk if you needa talk.",,1c432s3

17,"Ok yeah, then lets just frame this in a way where OP is not likely to follow through at all and remain in this same situation for much longer.  

Hey OP switch therapists because its the RIGHT THING to do and then forget about your FP forever. 

Except she definitely already fckn knows that & has heard it over and over. She’s having her cake right now and it doesn’t feel like shes gonna change anything unless she feels like she can eat it too. If you have better advice then give it to OP because i’m the only one here",,1c432s3
18,Honestly my feelings have become really strong over the past week and I just had my first experiences of image rescripting in therapy where my therapist said for me to imagine him in a memory years ago to start to create a different association to it. I have realised that what I’m feeling is probably an aftermath of that and I think I’m just going to tell him everything. I really don’t want to be unethical and get him in to trouble - he’s a very good therapist and I don’t actually want to cross boundaries it’s just my head running away with it. I totally appreciate your replies and know what you’re saying but I think it’s something I actually need to address rather than try be sneaky about,Tiny_Lime5707,1c432s3

If you have a good relationship with your parents make more time for them it’s so grounding to be at home after a breakup even without bpd. Do you have any hobbies or interests you started doing less after being in that relationship? Force yourself to do them! Even if it’s just for 5 minutes. It’s really great you’re going to therapy that’s the perfect outlet. Write things in your notes, texts you won’t send. Rearrange your room!!!

1,"Hello! I also recently got diagnosed with BPD, although I never had an FP, I tend to be very obsessive over every thought. 
I made a list of things I can do to try to distance/ ground myself, i’ll list them here in hopes they help you. 

- work out for at least 10 minutes 
- drink something hot 
- shower
- listen to music
- clean something 
- cook something
- journal 
- play a relaxing game
- go out for a drive",Excellent_Radio36,1bwfly7
2,"I know exactly how you feel. This was me last May- my ex was abusive but he was still my FP and my world crumbled when his dog attacked me and I went no contact. All I can really tell you is not to run away from the feelings because it’ll take so much longer to heal than if you just let yourself feel. It’s going to be excruciating and I wish there was a way any of us could save you from that but unfortunately that’s life and that’s particularly life with BPD. Here’s the good news: you will be ok. It’s been almost a year and I won’t lie, it still hurts sometimes but it’s far and few between and I have new people in my life who are absolutely amazing. If you ever need someone to talk to who understands, my messages are always open. Hang in there, I promise you it’ll get brighter again ❤️ 

Edit to say: one action piece of advice I have is to give yourself time limits when the pain and grief become too much. I would literally set a timer for 10, 15, 20 minutes and let myself sob and fall apart and then I would get up, take a shower or hot bath, put on a comfort show, put on my comfiest clothes and just allow myself to rest.",greybenson23,1bwfly7

0,"Hi! I am currently dealing with the aftermath of a break up myself and a possible reconciliation. 

The break up is the result of his splitting and me not understanding what has been going on, why he thinks the way he thinks. My relationship was mirroring your situation until push came to shove and I couldn't make sense of it all anymore and couldn't see his love for me anymore during his last split. 

I am AuDHD and he has strong traits for BPD. I realized yesterday that he most likely has undiagnosed BPD and that everything he says and does when feeling safe and secure is meant true from his heart. That his love is true and deep. 
However, I let him know that I am finally beginning to understand everything, the big picture and all. And that I forgive him. And that I will be there for him. 
But it's hard for him to see the love I have for him. 
It's hard for him to trust me due to trauma from childhood. I let him know I want us to be ok again, that I want to find a way to continue our relationship. He wanted to see me spontaneously yesterday after breaking up with me earlier this week and I couldn't (parental obligations, I couldn't go meet him, and still under shock myself, processing it all emotionally). He sent me FB request when I was asleep, and I didn't have a chance to see it because he deleted it. Thinking I ignored it. Today, he says we both broke up when I said I want to see him again. When I said I don't want to break up so many times, it still didn't get through to him. I still let him know today that I hope we can be together again. I never wanted to break up. 


He didn't ask me to read about BPD. I did. Because I love him. But I also would have read about it if he gave me links and books about it. Because as an autistic woman I need to collect fragments to be able to see the bigger picture and to be able to make sense of how someone behaves. It took me until Friday night to connect the dots. To see what he is dealing with himself. To see when he gets mean due to fear of abandonment it's BPD speaking, not him. It took me 9 months to see it. Your boyfriend needs to read on Reddit what people with BPD experience internally. In order to understand. In order to have cognitive empathy for you. In order to make sense of you and the relationship dynamics.",lostinspace80s,1ckn7ae

2,"It might also help to read about experiences of ASD people in conjunction with therapy. In order to be able to put his  actions into a healthier context, for example the need to isolate once in a while for regenerating and resetting the brain after peopling, long conversations, sensory overload and sensory input. Another thing that I was confronted with is my lack of showing emotions at time, but as an autistic person it's hard to do so. Alexithymia and delayed emotional processing can come across as not caring enough sometimes. And that can be amplified when it's perceived as a BPD person. ",lostinspace80s,1ckn7ae
3,"I have done a lot of reading about ASD, mainly because I suspected I was autistic at one point but also I’ve continued to read up on it since I’ve been with my partner. I actually share a lot of the same experiences with them so I feel like I don’t struggle that much to understand them but they do struggle to understand me… I also need time to regenerate energy to socialize and have sensory overload.",sleepy_pastel_boi,1ckn7ae
4,"I can absolutely encourage you to sit down comfortably with your FP when they are relaxed. And read together about BPD. And watch YT videos about it together. Because then you two have a chance to talk about it and get ideas what aspect to talk about. It's good to hear about other people's experiences, it's like collecting scientific evidence or data that what you say and how you think and act is actually true and makes sense because it's confirmed by others who go through splitting and all. It's helping because it helps shift the perspective on things in a good way. At least that's how it works out for me, with reconciliation on the horizon and a positive outlook. It's easier to look at what others experience with the same condition or neurotype because there is no emotional attachment that could alter the perception. PS my special person has it in common too with you regarding sensory overload and energy depletion from socializing. I assume for BPD people being drained from socializing is from the constant fear of rejection and trying to make everyone happy even if it goes against own needs? Whereas for ASD people it's due to having to process all small fragments of interactions and such that flood the brain unfiltered. Different reason, similar outcome. Good luck to both of you & hit me up if you got more questions about AuDHD or autism. ",lostinspace80s,1ckn7ae

Usually for me, my outbursts are a result of bottling up and me not being mindful of that. Look up willing hands and half smile. Relax your body and lean back before discussing a conflict or issue, your body will send a signal to your brain that you’re safe. 

I can’t emphasise how much practice matters. Not just during a conflict, but consistently, every day. Take a thought and practice communicating to yourself without getting worked up. Do it for your child, you want to do better than your parents.

Now, I still struggle with my BPD symptoms like mood swings, but they at a level I can control. That’s the goal - Management. I used to struggle a lot of suicidal tendencies, impulsive behavior and such but again, these are now thoughts that I sometimes have, but am able to control due to my medication. The medication gives me time to react and think about my decisions before I act on them. Before? I used to act then figure what the hell I needed to do to clean up the mess I made lol. I mention my struggles because I want you to know medication isn’t an end all be all, but it is 100% something I recommend to everyone considering getting on them especially pairing meds with DPT and CBT. It’s very helpful in the recovery process.

If you need help paying for meds, I do too, look at using apps like blinkhealth, goodRX, Cost Plus drugs, and even CVS has a discount card for medication. These services provide discounted prices for prescription medications. I’ve used all of them. 

Also, this is a bit of advice you didn’t ask for but from a person with BPD to another. Staying off of social media has given my life a whole new meaning. Like I find myself enjoying my life and not comparing myself to others or becoming obsessed with people etc. Also try reading the book atomic habits, I know cheesy, but I just started it and it’s helping me.

1,"I know from my own experience that I need a LOT of attention and closeness from my partner, so I could never do that. If you know from experience that you need that as well, then you shouldn’t. But if you think that this can actually work and you are realistic about it, then it’s a challenge worth taking! Being in a relationship is amazing if your needs are being met, but if they aren’t, then it can feel like the worst thing, you can end up feeling abandoned all the time. If you don’t have a lot of need for attention and closeness, then I think it can work. Also, it depends on how long this distance and lack of communication from his side is going to last. If it’s only for a month or two then you can wait it out, but if this is going to be the situation for years, then you really have to weigh the pros and cons.",NewsBrilliant927,1au6ex7
2,"I’d highly suggest looking into attachment styles if you haven’t. Most people with BPD have anxious (or disorganized) attachment, and they often attract people with avoidant attachment, which it sounds like this person has.

0,"I have these same issues and it is really difficult. All that's been slowly helping me is working on it 24/7. If I ever notice an anxious thought about my partner cross my mind at anytime, I notice it, think about it, remember they are a person who deserves respect, and fully try to put myself in their shoes. If they say something that makes me feel hurt, I say I need a minute, leave the room and remember they aren't trying to hurt me. They didn't wake up planning ways to make me feel upset, they are simply a person with many complex thoughts and emotions of their own. Obviously this takes a lot of time to start working, I still have many times I lose control and can't stop words coming out of my mouth. I definitely reach a point of clarity faster and do it less though. 
Taking time to stop throughout the day to do check-ins. Remind yourself you're currently safe, your partner is trustworthy, your partner is also a complex person, and your partner loves you. 
Writing down your anxious thoughts with no filter to read back later is also really helpful, I kind of hate it thought because it makes me feel guilty reading it over when I'm in a better state of mind, but it helps me realize just how ridiculous they can be.",Soular_corpse,1ceaegv

0,I’ve been diagnosed with Bpd 2 years ago. At that time I didn’t even know what bpd was but it took me one year of seeing the same psychiatrist and lots and lots of test until i got a diagnosis it’s definitely a process but it’s the right direction and it is worth it. My bpd was masked by my depression and severe anxiety which were the initial diagnosis i got from other psychiatrist. Ive been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for 2 years now and i can tell you it gets better. When you get a diagnosis they can help you with means that are specifically tailored to your needs and medication would help if you are considering them. And you don’t have to tell anyone or choose the right people to talk to about it unless you feel ready to avoid any negativity. I can’t say you will 100% feel better there are days where i feel like i am exactly the same or even worse and its a journey with lots of ups and downs. but overall it does get better over time and DBT is a great help you should consider. It takes consistency and effort and though it’s hard it will help you in your life. Consider talking to a psychiatrist about Bpd and make sure to be with a therapist you are comfortable with. Sorry for the long comment just wanted to share with you things i found helpful and my experience and i am here for you if you need to talk about anything 💜🫂.

7,"I'd suggest looking into DBT and CBT techniques, as well as grounding exercises. They can be super useful for managing stress and emotions.

The thing that actually helped me while practicing CBT and DBT is keeping myself busy, especially with the right and most beneficial things:

Consider trying out different hobbbies, even if you think you might lose interest in them later on. You can always try something new.

Try working out, or just joining classes like Pilates or spinning once a week at first .

Something i can also suggest is taking free online courses on topics that pique your curiosity can be incredibly rewarding and can be added to your CV.

One thing i do personally is that I make it a point to research any topic that catches my attention or that I'm not well-informed about. It could be as simple as looking up word definitions or diving into a whole study on a planet i once heard about in a tiktok video .

And when it comes to doing things solo, I recommend giving it a shot. Eating out alone can be a surprisingly enjoyable experience.

Pet sitting can also be a nice experience.

0,"OP- I’m locking comments on this post. 

Your partner deserves bodily autonomy. There are many reasons why he may have wanting his first time after surgery to be alone. All of those reasons are valid. I’m sorry you felt hurt by this, but we should respect his body and space. 
Please take some time to consider the responses you’ve received on this post. I would recommend trying to pause before you react to allow yourself time to think about what is triggering an emotional response. Process your feelings then try to discuss them in a kind, respectful way. You cannot manipulate or guilt him over sex. We have to remember that no one deserves to ever feel any type of pressure or negativity surrounding sex. 

Additionally, in the future, please mark posts of this nature as NSFW.

3,"I guess just like with all bodily modifications, he probably felt uncomfortable and anxious about how his modified body part will act in situations like cumming. Will it hurt? Will there be blood? Will he even be able to?

I guess he probably wanted to try it out at his own pace and in private not because he doesn’t love or want you or trust you but because imagine he can’t cum? How would that make you feel? Probably like YOU can’t make him cum which would be wrong. Or imagine there’s blood or something.

I think he probably didn’t think much of it and neither should you. He had sex with you because he wanted to and what happened before has nothing to do with you, so while I understand why you might get upset, you really shouldn’t waste time because it all sounds like a chill situation!

I had years of relationships that enforced the idea that the only reason I was worth keeping around was that I was good at sex and I based all my self worth around being a nymph.

We’ve talked about it today and we are in a much better place and he was very sweet and understanding about it and I obviously I’m not happy that I felt so emotional over something that’s about his body, but I do think there is some validity to what I was feeling. I don’t make him tell me every time he has an orgasm and we have a very fluid and adventurous sex life. This issue is something that triggered me most likely due to past relationships, and my partner, and I have reached a great understanding about the issue.

0,"Hey OP! I know this struggle so well, and you are definitely not alone.

Something that helped in my circumstances was a couple of things:

1. Knowing I had BPD and learning about it; knowing a lot about why I’ve done what I’ve done (basically that “aha!” moment)
2. Coming to understand that obsessively friending, then unfriending, or sending a message and then deleting the message or following up with my thoughts one after the other in multiple messages after initial message and the like, is–how I see it– something of a subform of *splitting*
3. Choosing and learning to believe people when they say this or that about you (positives only; but taking less than positive things is a diff convo)
4. Identifying the feelings you get in the moment when you do those things, naming it and reflecting on the why. What’s triggering that response? When it happens, write it down (eg, “today I friended Elly again, then unfriended her. At this moment I was feeling anxiety because… and then delve into that further). This sometimes helped with my spirals
5. When you see the pattern and the triggers, it was then about processing after that and then learning to catch myself before I deleted a message or sent additional texts or unfriended
6. Always, always, always remember that practice and learning better habits is NOT linear! Give yourself grace if it’s not something you’re able to catch every time
7. Realizing that part of my personal trigger for this was obsessing about the “am I being annoying, do they like me, etc” and that by hyper focusing on that made me super twitchy and to get rid of that anxiety I decided to “un-do it”. I began practicing the “I friended them/ sent that message, now I’m going to focus on something else, and if it’s important enough, or they specifically ask me to, I will leave it alone.” The urge began to stick after a while. To this day, I still wonder if I’m being annoying or if someone doesn’t like me but it’s manageable most of the time now. But then that leads to:
8. Wherein you can’t control what other people think of you, but you can control how you put yourself out there with your actions and decisions.

OP, you’ve noticed this is something you do that you don’t find helpful or healthy, and you mentioned your loved ones are or seem to be getting annoyed by the consistent back and forth, right? Don’t let that destroy you! You’ve taken a great step by even having the reflection that this is not how you want to keep behaving and then reaching out.

There’s no quick fix to BPD, there’s either remaining stagnant and drowning in it, or taking the process of overcoming certain aspects one step at a time and making progress down the path you want to walk.

I know you mentioned that you aren’t comfortable sharing your diagnosis with your loved ones, but perhaps in the future that will change. And I really think it could potentially help, and them; them, so that they can understand it’s not just you being annoying or too much on purpose, but that there’s an actual reason for it and you’re actively working on making it better because you care for them and (I hope more importantly) about yourself. And it’d potentially help you because when a person takes ownership of things like this, you’re giving yourself the power over how you feel, and taking it away from others (or at least how we perceive that).

Off topic example of owning it to keep the power in your hands: I had the crown/tooth next to my front tooth fall out and it’s unrepairable. I could get an implant but that will be hella expensive and around a year plus long wait. I am super self conscious about my teeth as is since I didn’t take care of them in childhood and it’s haunting my ass now. But I figured, “Ok, I’ll just wear a mask everywhere”. I hated that. So this last Tuesday when I went to campus for class I was wearing a mask and made a decision for myself. (Helps if there’s one person you feel a semblance of safety with at first when practicing this; it doesn’t have to be your FP or BFF 5eva). I spoke up right before class began (like a minute or seconds before), and started off with a little joke announcement “So I know we’re all judgment free in this class, except when it comes to Professor A’s dad jokes (insert snorts of laughter) but I wanted to sort of tell you all this”, and proceeded to basically say “My tooth fell out, I’m not sick (as I took off my mask) and I don’t want to wear this mask so here’s my adorable smile minus one teephers”. And I actually showed the class while sitting all chill-like in my seat. I further added, “I know it’s weird I’m announcing this but I’m doing it because it gives me the power to own it on my terms since I can be self conscious about it, so there you have it!” Lots of nods and “that’s awesome’s” and “I love that!” were the responses.

And wow that’s long. Anyway:

**Tl;dr** OP has made a significant step by 1) taking note of this behavior and wanting to change it as well as 2) seeking support in my opinion.

0,"I have the exact same feelings and I had the exact same feelings when I first got diagnosed.


But you know what? People with BPD are incredibly strong and incredibly empathetic, imagine turning every small situation into a very big, life threatening one and still bouncing back from all this intensity like nothing ever happened? 


You also need to understand that having BPD is not something that you can control, most people with BPD have a lot of childhood trauma that is related to abandonment, so it's not your fault and I know that this may not help a lot , but it's important for you to tell your inner child that it's okay now and that you will be feeling better and getting the help that you and your inner child needed for a long time. 


One last thing about people with BPD, I said that they are incredibly empathetic right? If I didn't have BPD I wouldn't have been able to get through to you and feel what you're feeling and make you feel better, and that is something that normal people don't have , and I'd like to look at it as if it was a super power , because truly we are able to help others and make them feel better about everything.


So please accept yourself and love yourself and remember that acceptance is a very important part of your healing journey , and know that we are all here for you.",Unfair_Solution_2317,1ctuiz2
1,"I’m finally at the diagnosis stage and I feel immense relief, but only because I’ve been a few years in the shame and denial stage. 

My first introduction to the term BPD was when I was looking through my ex-husband’s garage for some of my things and found a book, “Walking on Eggshells: Living with a Borderline.”

I was like…fucking what? It was a bullet to the heart. Especially because he was an alcoholic with his own anger issues and all I ever wanted was to be safe. But also, as borderlines, we have so much empathy, so much that we feel everything, how could *I* be the monster? Because that’s how uninformed society largely views us, monsters.

So I hurt for a while and then denied and then ACCEPTED and started learning. But then I tried discussing it and people told me I didn’t have it because I “wasn’t that bad” (???? Again hurtful to everyone with the disorder) and I realized I was using the potential diagnosis to keep myself exactly how I was.

I wanted to grow and not hide behind a diagnosis of why I was the way I was and couldn’t change. 

But in the last month I found my way back to the diagnosis. I’m coming back to life after chemotherapy and my meltdowns (as I call them) have been very frequent. Feelings of emptiness that won’t go away. I’m doing everything I can over here. I’ve got my meeting with therapists next month and I’d like to tell
you why, after all this time and all these years, this diagnosis is a relief:

There’s a reason for my constant emptiness and extreme empathy. It’s not just inherently who I am as a person. I was hurt. I get to say what happened to me as a child isn’t fair and wasn’t my fault.

I can finally, finally, after years of therapy, find a therapist who can HELP ME. it’s been so frustrating going to therapy and not having someone understand or suggest tools for someone without the disorder. I remember telling my fiancé, “no matter what I do, goals set accomplished etc., I always end up back here in this pit of self-loathing and emptiness.”

I get to work on self-esteem, identity, and not just repeat positive mantras in a mirror while every mirror-neuron on my body screams for death because I saw a rough news story. 

I’ve done incredible things in my life, I beat cancer, this year, and I wondered how the hell I could
Still be so upset about little things. 

The shame hasn’t been removed, but layers and layers have been torn away for me. I get to really heal!! I’ve been sitting in pain for my whole life, as have we all. We can do this. 

And also, love is possible. My fiancé loved me as I was. He’s the most patient understanding person. Even if he never understands why I get so upset, he’s told me that he loves me because I’m a good person, and that he sees how upset I get and is kind of amazed at how well and frequently I’m able to bounce back from such massive upsets. He says I just need time to feel my feelings. I don’t know how the hell I found him but he’s real. And I’m going to practice the intense love I feel in my heart by finding ways to heal. 

Because……BPD IS NOT A LIFE SENTENCE. We can heal. We will. It’s in our very nature to heal, to dive down under the muck and look under every rock. 

We just need the right tools. And society is becoming more and more trauma informed. 

We get told we need to love ourselves and practice self-compassion. What non-bpd people
Don’t realize is that WE DONT KNOW WHO THAT SELF IS, and we have mega trust issues. 

I learned recently that shame and guilt are something we can let go. A diagnosis hurts because we have this internal talk that constantly tells us we’re horrible people, and the diagnosis is like a big light that says, “you are!” But we’re not. A diagnosis means you have symptoms and behaviors indicative of someone who was very hurt, probably when very little, and developed these tendencies to survive. 

And you survived. Let’s keep going.",ImpressiveSell5404,1ctuiz2
2,"**Person with BPD here. I used to have hope. Now I think BPD = Hopelessness. Why?** Hop**e is the sword that cuts the borderline. Because the extreme emotional pain never goes away. Yes, DBT will teach you to mask how you feel inside but will never address the pain and horrible damage we will cause. Suffering in silence is what you will be taught. You'll never be able to trust yourself in relationships. Because the right trigger will ruin everything. I don't mean to be a downer, but it time to be honest about BPD!! What I do: stay away from people. Keep relationships surface. This is the only way not to cause more pain!**",topher3702,1ctuiz2

7,"Hi, thank you for your response. One thing I strive for is to be as honest as I possibly can. I’ve done mountains of research and reading about my disorders, and from what I’ve learned about BPD, it is definitely possible to recover from BPD.  I’ll include a link to the national library of medicine below if you’re interested.

However, I do believe that sometimes the language surrounding mental health and recovery can be a bit ambiguous, which doesn’t do well our BPD black and white thinking tendencies.

I do agree with you that we will always always feel the way we feel. We will always have triggers and huge emotions and many, many other things. But we can also develop tools to allow us to manage these things. 

I believe that’s why mental health and addiction use the word “recovery” instead of “cure.”

I’m an alcoholic in recovery. I haven’t had a drink in two and a half years and the obsession to drink has been removed. But am I cured? Hell no.

I’m one drink away from the same cycle, always. What’s different is I have tools now instead of just drinking to numb myself. 

With BPD, I also have tools now and I hope to develop many, many more. For example, when I would dissociate, I found that human touch helped me. I told my fiancé that when I’m having a meltdown, I need him to gently hold my hand. I don’t run away anymore, even though every cell in my body screams for me to run. That’s improvement. 

I still get massive intrusive thoughts out in public. I cry through them and center myself and resume activity. Self soothing techniques can be learned.

I understand, through tons of exploration, that I am extremely unsure of relationships and explain my fear of abandonment to people I’m close to. I tell them I need reassurance. 

And sometimes the world shits all over my safe little bubble of awareness and is just mean. I allow myself to be myself and hurt. It hurts, I know you hurt. 

But to say recovery isn’t possible for us seems against our very nature. We are resilient. How many people do you know that could overcome several massive core- shattering episodes A DAY, and still take another step forward?  There is no way we can just feel all the massive amounts of empathy we feel and NOT take action. I’ll bet you’re one of the kindest people I could ever know. Maybe you never miss a sending a birthday card or compliment an old lady on her perfume and really mean it. 

We are the way we are. But we can learn do modify our behaviors, which are a set of patterns of reactions. Life is always going to life. Please try not to get stuck under your diagnosis. 

And if that’s how you feel, my friend, that’s how you feel. But I encourage you, perhaps not now but in a moment of darkness, to consider what opportunities for growth and creation your destruction has brought into the world.",ImpressiveSell5404,1ctuiz2

I'm glad that you have a good support system. I'm quiet BPD too and it's not easy. Nobody even remotely understands us and there's such a strong stigma.


Would you say your suicidal thoughts appeared around the time you got your diagnosis? It happened to me with autism and it was (is) horrible. 


When it reaches that point, I generally don't involve my close social circle, I ask the psychiatrist for an emergency meeting (sucidal ideation can be a side effect of the treatments) so that they can readjust, and of course request an emergency session with my therapist. I'm not sure what yours have you on at the moment but sometimes a small increase in dosage or adding a new molecule has been a life saver for me.

0,"short answer: extremely open and frequent conversations about behaviors, a little bit of grace and maturity. 

long answer: I was diagnosed with BPD at 19, but it's been suspected since 16. now I'm married, in a ""normal"" healthy relationship. I no longer meet the DSM 5 requirements. I'm not going to pretend that I don't still really struggle at times, because I do. 

what has helped me the absolute most, is that my husband is smart, and a logical thinker. I entered our relationship telling him that I have BPD, he looked up unbiased information about BPD, read a few studies, joined a Facebook group I was in so he could see how other people with BPD act and feel. another thing in the same vein as seeing and hearing about how people with BPD act, he would come to therapy with me! he actually suggested multiple times ""maybe we should bring this up on your next session?"" or ""could you schedule a session, you're not doing well."" and as hard as that is to hear, if you force yourself through that anger and sadness, and go to the session or make an earlier appointment, you tend to see more results. as people with BPD, we don't normally feel outside of this very moment, so you gotta strike while the iron is hot and what not. 

another thing is being held accountable for your reactions, but not necessarily your thoughts. the way you react to thoughts are solely your responsibility, but the reason why you had the thought in the first place isn't on you. example: early in the relationship I had a flashback to how my ex abused me, and the way I reacted towards him wasn't okay. at the end of the day my husband isn't my abusive ex boyfriend. we can see how that connection is logical, but they have no idea. this is where a little grace comes in. your partner has to be a little lenient ""yes the way you acted wasn't okay, but we talked through it now. I understand a bit better now. next time xyz."" for me personally, making plans on how to do something makes me think about it a lot, it gets ingrained in my head and then when a situation like that happens again, it's one of my first thoughts. 

my last tip that I tell everyone, even if they don't have BPD, is to not ask questions you want a genuine answer to. what if the answer is hurtful, you set yourself up. what if the answer isn't as good as you scripted, you set up those expectations. I'm talking about questions like do you think this person is pretty, what was your first impression of me, what would you do if I died, etc. yes the answer of those are sweet and give us satisfaction but more likely than not you already know what you want the answer to be. you want them to say no that person isn't cute because 9/10 it's someone who looks the exact opposite of you, but you want them to say yes so you have a reason to split. 

it takes a lot from both people. I've spent plenty number of nights sobbing in my husband's lap because he wouldn't let me react the way I normally do, and it feels like a genuine pain, I'm having to sit with those thoughts and feel through them instead of splitting and avoiding the feeling altogether. he has spent many hours secretly upset with my reaction and waiting for me to calm down so he can get reassurance that I still love him. there's going to be fuck ups. you're going to have your feeling hurts, so will your partners. there's going to be days where you feel like you haven't gotten any better but your partner has seen amazing improvement and is so proud of you. just for the love of everything holy, talk to each other. if there needs to be a code word you use as that fire starts, so that you can walk away from the conversation until you're better, so be it! I use the word pomegranate. this is possible and I wish you nothing but luck. I hope you show yourself a little grace in this process as well. no one else could ever imagine how having a disorder that feels like second degree burns over most of your body feels.",kaprioara,1c63vle

As a licensed clinician with BPD (although I've been in remission for a few years now), I can't stress how beneficial seeking professional support can be in the long run. Sure, therapy can be expensive *if you're only looking at self-pay therapists*. Many group practices offer pro-bono services. Community mental health centers offer free or low-cost services and always accept Medicaid/Medicare. 99% of all private practice therapists offer a sliding scale fee so that the fee for services aligns with your income to make therapy more affordable and reduce financial barriers when services are needed. My main point here is that you don't have to do this alone. It's okay to ask for help and there is help out there if you ask.",bornforthis23,15sgmbj

Also, you’re required to have health insurance off your attending college in the US (can’t speak for any other country) so you can also find therapists that are in-network with your insurance. DM me if you have any other questions, I’d be happy to assist you with this to the best of my ability.",bornforthis23,15ubg01

0,"Oh man, I struggle with this too. My top advices are to check the adhd women communities around here because that’s a topic I see come up a lot for them too, and then of course the obligatory “ask a therapist go to therapy” etc for more professional management.

From my own situations, it varied, so I’ll share what happened incase any of it can be insightful.

Back when I was able to drink coffee, that gave me the boost to take on physical tasks, especially cleaning. I would focus on one area at a time in parts. Picturing a goal image of the result for how I wanted a room to look was also a motivator for me. Organizing things almost became like an art project in a strange sense.

When I lived with a partner in the past many years back, there came a point where they also fell into the “parent” and “all the cleaning alone” role and I wasn’t really picking up the slack. Eventually the guilt started to weigh with me, and it was embarassing when guests came over and I could not claim that I had cleaned any of my apartment, that the partner did all the work. I felt the pressure of being a lousy person for that. To be honest however, once we became long distance is when I really started my first large efforts in keeping my space somewhat clean and not overly cluttered for my own mental health. Also being able to say I cleaned or organized something on my own was pretty empowering. Not burdening my partner also made me feel better. It was not an easy habit to break initially though. Once ways are set it’s tough to change, but it is not impossible. 

Keep in mind that over burdening someone with tasks instead of balancing your share can put a huge unspoken strain on a relationship, which can and will take its toll in the long run. If it matters, you will want to put as much mental force into fixing this as you can, and not wait for a point of no return in regards to how things will last this way. I’m sorry if that’s scary, but it also a reality that needs to be considered. 

The most recent time I ran into this problem was last year with a different partner I did not live with. However, this time I was admant that my disorganized room was my problem and diswayed them from cleaning for me to avoid old habits. Unfortunately since this was not a shared space and it was my room, it stayed pretty messy until after we broke up. That weirdly gave me the motivation to fix it all myself again, on top of having friends start to come over. My room now looks like an instagram-ready bedroom with all the lights and decor I added since I had the funds for it. This ex learned of it later and was impressed and pretty proud of me!  I’ve maintained it for many months since. I guess a good motivator in this case was getting to implement aesthetics I enjoyed, so maybe that might help you as well?

0,"I see you and I can somewhat relate. It used to be rather severe - the rage and depressive episodes consuming me because of triggers which reminded me of my perception that I have no control and these cycles keep perpetuating.

DBT is helpful but also it is all so super exhausting, that conscious constant continous inner fight. Sometimes I just want to be and sometimes I just be for 2 days too longs and then spiral with letting go of each thing and just never getting back up in weeks or months.

It now comes in for a day or two and I can recognize the early early signs. Once I do or my healthy support structure reminds me of certain things we've written down that happens, I begin to increase my selfcare practices.

Especially two things. HRB and Neurographica. They require very little effort from me and they both make a physiological difference.

I have a free app for the Heart Rhythm Breathing, so all I do is place my finger on the camera and follow the ball inflation and deflation which assists me in breathing Rhythmically. That changes my coherence, makes the nervous system counter the cortisol production. If I am declining, I fit in 4 to 5 sessions of 10 to 20 minutes in just lying down on the grass or bed whoever you are able to or sit anywhere and breath through a session focusing on getting my breathing in Rhythm.

It also shows you your HRV (Heart rate variability) scores which can tell you how depressed and far gone you are and will start picking up the deeper you're able to hold your Rhythms.

Check out Dr Alan Watkins he explains about HRV Rhythm breathing and coherence with regards to performance, but it can be used like this.

Neurographica is also absolutely wonderful and a proven therapy method by Pavel Pascarev that Stimulates the brains neuroplasticity and helps with rewiring.

They've been saving my life, especially is those times when I feel like I just cannot! It's easy, it does not require big effort from me and it is something I can do anywhere on my phone and if practiced enough without anything and as that begins making a difference in my energy and reasoning brain, I regain the ability to do the other practices, like go back to the gym or get some sun and take daily walks, listen to good hormone inducing music etc.

1,First I'm just going to say the other comment that persons an a- hole and secondly there's a reason that people with BPD and narcissists and other relationships together it's like an attraction to each other you know like one wants complete control over the other and the other has a strong fear of being abandoned so basically a narcissist can do whatever the f*** they want and that person will sit there and still love them and that's why they always end up together but what you need to focus on is yourself and not what he's doing because you know in your mind that he's just doing it to keep that control my suggestion is once you get whatever it is that's so important that you need to get from his house is that you just go no contact you guys can't be friends anymore like cuz it won't work he'll always just keep that a little bit of control over you and this cycle will just keep repeating like I'm not sure what your situation is but like if the stuff that's there is not that important then just let it go hopefully that helped,whiplash0713,18xe6w4

0,"(Basically everything below should start with ""If you haven't already / didn't already know,"" because I don't know your level of knowledge here)

I have BPD myself. Candidly, yes he's probably going to rage-break-up again, if he isn't practicing skills. Unchecked BPD is like pb&j with self-destructive breakups followed by desperate remorse.

That's to say, it is his responsibility to seek help and intervention. Does he do DBT? Practice a healthy lifestyle to his best ability? Looked at meditative hobbies or even things like Buddhism? (Which is what saved my life, personally) Does he have a psychiatrist? Medication? Things he enjoys and could cultivate? Have substance use concerns or other addictions? Does he have other hobbies besides you?

I really hope the answer are all yes, and things are improving. But, I don't get the sense that's true right now.

On his end, just to give context, it takes constant vigilance for someone with BPD to monitor and adjust their behavior using their DBT skills, or similar. It's an unrelenting demand to ""be better"" for yourself and your loved ones, and it *is* laborious and painstaking. However, it is his deal to manage it, at the end of the day, hard as it is. It's just our lot in life, because if we don't, it's a self-destructive mess. But, doesn't change the points above, and it's worth noting that BPD is actually extremely treatable in the sense that fairly moderate changes can lead to big improvements, the key is him practicing practicing practicing. It is more than possible for him to make strides; he is not stuck this way, not inherently.

However, on your end, you'll have to chose whether you can handle it (*particularly* if he isn't making efforts). The flightiness, splitting, the emotional whiplash, and often, the harsh words borne of humiliated rage. The breaking up.

You have every right in the world to take care of yourself and get some respite in the form of breaking up, at *least* for now. More than rights, even, you have just as much responsibility for your own wellbeing as he does.

I really want to stress that if he brings up suicide or self-harm, etc., when or if you decide to go this route, you should not allow this to shift your sense of personal responsibility. This may not come up at all, hopefully. But, if he's in life-threatening danger, call someone else for help, do not bear the burden yourself. (Someone else like his family members or siblings or friends, if you can). It's common to suggest calling the police, I personally don't advocate for this.

Lastly, it's very important that you know that none of this is about you. As in, if he does break up with you in that destructively impulsive way, it has nothing to do with how good of a partner you are or having failed him in some way. It absolutely sucks and hurts but I urge you to remember that it is not you, but rather it is your partner having a flare-up of the BPDemon in his brain. He's feeling agony too, which makes the whole thing so terrible for everyone. But it isn't you, your failings, your selflessness, or your loyalty, it is him and the thing that's lodged in our brains.

Very last thing: I recommend a book called *I Hate You Don't Leave Me*, it discusses BPD and support and it's nature, etc., and it would give both of you more insight.

Very very last thing: Do some research on Favorite Person, that may apply to you and give insight.

VVV last thing: I guess I should say here too that despite all my practical discussion about personal responsibility, I want to note just that... it really does suck having BDP, and the people in my life that I am closest to are those who have continued to be there for me. I have gotten so so much better, through a lot of work, and it is in part because these certain people did not truly leave me. That means everything to someone with this disorder/illness.

1,"Thanks so much for this response it really means a lot to me. I am graduating with my masters in social work and I have a degree in psychology. I have looked into bpd and actually diagnosed him before he got an official diagnosis. 

I signed him up for dialectic behavioral therapy and he was attending group sessions and individual sessions. They stopped taking his insurance and this crushed him. He feels nothing will work at this point. 

He is already bringing up suicide and not wanting  to be here anymore. It’s hard to hear but I try my best to be supportive. His older brother committed suicide and he always says he’s mad his brother beat him to it. In the same breath he tells me I am the only reason he doesn’t do it. 

It’s hard we are 27 and I want to start building my life with him and he’s struggling with age regression and finding himself. I tried to get him to attend therapy and try medication he says he will but I’m not sure if he really will. I really love this man and it sucks I don’t want to lose him. I’m hoping we can work it out with the space I am providing him and I hope it doesn’t end in a break up.

One thing I’ve learned is just because I am doing something (therapy, CBT skills, managing my temper even if they don’t, etc) doesn’t mean they have to do those things. Those boundaries I’m working to set with myself are FOR ME, so I can do my best to remain respectful of the person I love (as well as stay in a version of myself I won’t be ashamed of).They ARE NOT rules for our relationship nor is it a method of controlling the other. No matter how infuriating it is to be doing so much work in a moment you’re hoping to see it reflected and aren’t. That’s a reflection of them and their pain. 

My point being, maybe try to focus on your own growth and boundaries and the actionable steps to strengthen both.

3,"Hey I’ve been exactly where you are. My BPD was so severely attached to my abusive ex boyfriend. After I left the relationship the second time he did the same. 

TRIGGER WARNING : DIRECT MESSAGE 

“Hopeless friendless broke no school no job, a family that hates you, a guilt that that kills you, no inherent value that you see yourself causing you to f*** the most trash and ugly people cause that’s the best you can do” 

I had just been disowned by my family after my first attempt (he broke up with me 2 weeks after my attempt cause I was “asking for too much”, AKA general reassurance cause he was out with the girl he had been cheating on me with throughout the relationship). 
Favourite people are hard to deal with cause detaching from them is irrational. He continued to be my fp until I returned to my original city and met with him again. I had just gotten out of another relationship and was insanely low so reached out. Seeing him again sealed it for me. 
Growing into a person he didn’t recognize confirmed that he was in my past forever. When we met I was afraid I would regress into the patterns I held before but seeing that he had not changed in the slightest (even getting worse in areas) confirmed that no, I can’t and refuse be treated that was again. 
This being said I was the exact same as you. He had a new gf like 2 weeks after me and was plastering her everywhere (not to mention the more personal, not NSFW, photos of them just being happy together he would send me directly on a regular basis). It hurt cause why could they be happy but we couldn’t. Let me promise you they are not happy. And if they are they won’t be long term unless this guy is the best actor on the planet. I feel like it’s common knowledge now that people cannot hid who they are for prolonged periods of time without slipping up. Think of how poorly he treated you, she will almost definitely experience the same at some level. 

Looking to the future, finding a healthy FP to replace this one so that you can move past his behaviour. Not looking for a replacement but finding someone positive to focus your energy on is definitely the way to go. 
I took a hiatus from dating after my whole experience with that EX which is what worked for me, looking at what exactly I gravitated towards in past relationships and what to avoid but most importantly looking at how I acted in the relationship which I could improve upon.

As someone with BPD, I was throwing a narcissistic fit at my family via text about a year ago and implied I want to kill myself. (I wouldn’t kill myself. So this is emotional manipulation. Very BPD.) They called the cops to come to my place do a wellness check on me. It’s not a light matter. 
If you really want to take a different action than you have been with your boyfriend, you need to tell him you are going to call the cops and have him 51/50’d the next time he threatens to kill himself. no leniency bc that is what keeps this going.

And not contacting help in a period of crisis can be negligent and possibly be held liable. If y’all don’t want to contact the police at all, then he needs to make sure he keeps his shit together. If he doesn’t have a safety plan, he needs one asap. I’d honestly get a new therapist as well in that case because that would be a failure on their part.

There are help resources that I have on hand if things getthat aren't police.

I've at no point mentioned that he might harm others because he wouldn't. If that were a risk, he wouldn't be in my life.

His therapist has been helping a lot and there has been serious improvement, so no, we won't be looking for a new one because finding a good therapist is a nightmare and this one is actually helping.

He has coping skills in place and uses them, but he still shuts down, which isn't unreasonable during a major depressive episode. Our life shuts down because we are on watch to make sure he's safe, nothing more.

Again, I wasn't asking for what he can do, I'm asking for advice for what I can do to be more supportive in those moments of crisis because I feel helpless to make things better for him. Ideally, something that doesn't involve calling fascist attack dogs on a loved one.

8,"Then use those resources. You are on Reddit asking for advice on a serious topic, then complain about getting realistic answers simply because you don’t like cops. You stated “he will occasionally enter a depressed state and discuss ending his own life”, that is concerning and a desire for self harm. You claim the therapist is “good”, yet again you’re here on Reddit trying to figure out what to do rather than asking her, and not following a safety plan. Or at least following one that needs to severely be updated. Yikes. He still needs coping skills for when he’s “shutting down”, if he had the skills and knew when/how to use them, he wouldn’t have to rely on others to “make sure he’s safe”. You claim that you’re unsure that he’s safe with himself or not and need to watch him to make sure, yet simultaneously in denial and unwilling to actually address that he at times is a danger to himself or others and needs more resources and professional support. You are also unwilling to hold those accountable whose responsibility it is to actually help him and make positive changes for the community, and enable a therapist who for some reason has not addressed this with him, and are unwilling to talk with her about it or get a new one. You COULD hold the people who can actually help him accountable, yourself included. You could even help him communicate these struggles to someone. Or you can disregard any advice and continue with what you’re doing. Idc either way.

1,"I dunno, dude. I haven’t read “Walking on Eggshells” because I fooking HATE that expression.",MaMakossa,15fnt30
2,"I read it at the time I was diagnosed and still own the book. I felt like I was reading about myself specifically. It helped me realize I am not alone, I hate my boyfriend and that I have codependency issues. I was blessed enough to be given a copy of CODEPENDENT NO MORE at an AA meeting.  Very good read, had a test at the beginning to see if you think you are codependent and then the book tells you how to handle it. Both helped me accept my diagnosis as I was scared shitless to have a Cluster B Personality Disorder. Fortunately enough it's the most treatable of the PD and DBT (DIALECTICAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY), a similar approach to CBT ( COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY), but with mindfulness and meditation added. DBT s created to treat BPD directly and I'll say it works if your work it. I have a very good therapist. They say that Borderlines are the most likely to go for help as we desperately want to stop the suffering. Now a days I'm deep into my therapy, I go weekly, take medications for my co-morbid ( or CO-occuring) disorders like ADHD, OCD, MAD, GAD and traits of Bipolar. I believe I was improperly diagnosed Bipolar II before BPD. This happens to alot of us. One girls OLD videos on YouTube helped me relate, Sammy Grimm. And now I listen to any MedCircle info I can get my hand on. Also on YouTube is Dr. Fox (PD expert focusing on BPD), and the HEALTHYGAMERGG. I do short, guided meditations on YouTube as well, I use THE HONEST GUYS. Esp @ bed time. Also Binaural Beats. 

But back to your question here, the book was very helpful to me and I suggest it to any BPD person, male or female. I've also joined all the Cluster B sub's, NPD, HPD, SPD as well bc it's easy to share traits. Dr. Ramani can be found through MedCircle, here and on YouTube speaking about Narcissistic PD alot. I find it very interesting bc I don't want to give that manipulative vibe. I learned about gaslighting and have in the past been very guilty of this. I've learned about lying, it's basically controlling someone else's reality to self preserve. But I'm no more important or deserving then the next and that's not fair just bc I'm good at it. That's gross fr. 

I have a FP (Favorite Person), we are engaged and have a very healthy relationship where I do not devalue him and realize he is just s human being and not to be put on a pedestal. He wants what's best for me and helped me stop driving recklessly, acknowledge my substance abuse, stop stealing, cheating and being so impulsive. Got to take time to think about consequences for the next 48 hours before doing any of these things. I think I'm even ready to go back to work when our son goes back tho school. I have a sheet for IF I FEEL LIKE USING.... and a sheet for IF I FEEL LIKE KILLING MYSELF RN.... They have helped allot. I once kept a suicide kit. But I'm too impulsive for this and got rid of it. 😐

I realize you didn't ask for all this but I talk alot, too much really, and couldn't stop myself here. Hope something helps you.

Should we have felt a lot better. I understand there were likely times where she just wanted hang out with her friends—socializing is a normal, healthy part of life.

I may be coming out on top with an even better therapist this time! Hopefully, that'll happen for you, too! I mean, that's the point, right?

0,"I know how you feel. I've felt different most of my life. People generally treat me the same. Most people though just don't understand what our condition is or what we go through in our heads. Most people may try to help with certain situations but fail miserably at understanding, no matter how hard you try to explain, how you see or feel about things. But that's why communication is important. If they're willing to attempt to understand, I would try to explain it until they can at least understand even a little bit. 

Before being officially diagnosed I studied my symptoms starting back in middle school. My now deceased wife (passed of cancer) helped me a lot. She saw me at my absolute worst and still chose to be with me. I was able to talk to her about anything. It got to a point she'd be able to detect one of ""outbursts"" before it happened and helped me through. I learned a lot of coping skills and am a lot calmer of a person because of her. Currently, I have one friend I trust enough to talk to. 

If you have someone you can trust, my advise is talk to them about things. Even if all they do is listen. It helps. I've also found that being open about my condition helps me and helps others understand me. So I've recently started a podcast where I talk about my life and different situations I've been through as well as how I feel about certain topics. Even if I never grow an audience I'll continue doing the podcast because it's a way for me to get things off my chest (vent) and I'll be able to listen to episodes in the future to see how much I've changed compared to when I spoke about a situation and how I might handle it differently as opposed to when I went through it. 

I chose podcasting on purpose because I feel a blog would gain an audience faster, and whereas I do want to talk about it and put it out there, part of me is still a bit scared or nervous about how some people may view what I say. But either way, it's an outlet for me to relieve my stresses and vent; which does help.",RedConradcom,14h1jz1
1,"Hey, no matter what your symptoms and experience - you aren't alone! Remember that. 

BPD is complex, and every case is uniquely formed and expressed. People - including doctors - would often downplay my mental illness because I'm more of the ""quiet"" subtype with a high functioning presentation. It was misdiagnosed for many years because of that in combination with my not having an obvious history of abuse. But trauma is much more complicated than that. Having our mental illness and experience invalidated of course contributes to the overall issue.

If you meet the criteria, or even some of the symptoms that severely affect you, then they need to be addressed no matter what anyone thinks. No matter your situation, yes, your brain HAS been wired a certain way by your environment and experiences. And it can be rewired in time. DBT is a great place to start - if you can't do it formally, there are many books and resources online. I'd also highly recommend Dr. Daniel Fox's YouTube channel, as well as his Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook. His workbook is pretty unique compared to other ones out there; it's my favorite one I've come across. I'm going to be starting my own channel soon, but more for the peer support side and to share my personal experience with BPD and recovery - I'm not a doctor or licensed in any way and will still suggest there that people refer to his content for clinical information.

BPD is an isolating experience, but that's why peer support is so important. I haven't felt understood regarding the strength of my emotions by anyone in life besides those with similar issues. Keep reaching out. BUT be wary about info you come across, even within this subreddit. There are so many misconceptions, and they can be harmful to recovery. Have hope.

1,"First of all, it's important to recognise that there is a huge difference between symptom-free and being well enough to live a life where your symptoms are manageable and you can be happy. Forget the thirty years and focus on this year - what is affecting you the most right now? Take that to therapy, take the meds, and try to keep you mind on now. Mindfulness can be helpful with this - there are loads of free resources on YouTube as well as apps like Headspace.

Secondly, it's very difficult (and I would say unethical personally) to put a number on recovery. Different people respond differently to treatment and some people commit to therapy and making changes more than others. You could speak to a different medical professional and get a very different answer. That's not saying that you shouldn't listen to your psych, *you absolutely should follow their advice*, but don't let that number stop you from committing to treatment or give up hope because of it.

0,"I’m a mom and step mom with BPD. It’s HARD, I’ll tell you that. Especially if you have any generational trauma you’re trying to break free from. So not only are you having to care for a little human and teach them how to be the best they can be, you’re having to teach yourself these things too. And some days, it’s so hard not to emotionally react or react to things in a negative way, but you have to remember to apologize to your kids when you do, even if they are little bitty and explain why it was wrong. I also get SUPER overstimulated relatively quickly, so some days are absolutely draining and it feels like my kids are attacking me and my mental (kids are just really fuckin good at knowing how to press your buttons). I’ll say since becoming a parent, I’ve taught myself a lot about regulating emotions and finding constructive ways to teach my kids in all kinds of ways, but not every day is it gonna be easy.

Mostly it triggers me when he cries because he wants something and this for 10 minutes.

1,Honestly I agree I’m pansexual now and I haven’t been able to really date a women since figuring out my diagnoses. I do feel so much more attraction and just like I’d be able to really love a women but just like you said that connection feels way too intense. I can say learning more about what you have does send you into a rabbit hole I don’t think anyone deserves to go down we’re all worthy of love and I know it feels hard like you won’t connect or like you are so manipulative or selfish when indeed you just require more than others. We require people that actually desire us not who we let our brain think is the one. I’m not sure if I needed to actually feel the heartbreak I’m feeling to snap out of it and realize that I am sometimes the cause of my failed relationships or more so the BPD talks are the reasons I let that consume me on top of not loving myself I see that it leads me to seek validation from others that aren’t even on my level.

maybe try breaking it up into digestible chunks? Like finding a new therapist who is younger that you feel you could relate to. this new one would be more educated on the illness and give you proper coping mechanisms for when you are overwhelmed and frustrated. the second is that i would definitely suggest giving him space. from his perspective what he saw was probably very scary and stressful to see especially if you don’t have a reliable way to calm yourself down. he got scared and he doesn’t know what to feel. it doesn’t mean he hates you but you do need to seriously step back and think about how your actions could be perceived by others.

Whenever you find yourself in these situations where you feel an episode incoming, take a moment to breathe and collect yourself before doing anything impulsive and potentially destructive - becoming mindful of your actions and present will help you when you’re in a high emotional state. You may want to do something action based to let out these feelings but think about how you channel them. Speak to those around you that you’re noticing your emotions heightening, that the state you’re in will not be logical.

We BPD folk put so much onto others and our emotions and that baggage gets so heavy on our loved ones that it can become overbearing. You have to learn to be your own world, so that the ones we hold onto, won’t feel sooo devastating when they can’t handle us anymore.",Pleasant_Chain_3152,1cmsjc7

One that you already know you will not repeat (by changing the location of your notes master copy or at least creating a new draft to no one). It sucks and I get the humiliation and anticipation of the fallout and repair. 

That being said, it sounds like their statement is a little passive-aggressive or at least inappropriately reactionary. In other words, maybe they let their emotions run them on that. That's on them. Their reaction is NOT on you. The fact that there was that reaction/verbiage from a professional is concerning. I will cautionly state that not all therapists are good therapists (something like up to 30% actually cause harm), so this is a good time to keep good notes. Personally, if this happened to me, I would probably let them know how their reaction left me feeling in our next session since I'm sure there will be a conversation. I would be very interested and observant of what position they take and how they handle it. If they are anything less than professional about their actions (take accountability, apologize, and make space for constructive conversation and understanding), I'd seriously consider looking around for a better therapist. I would like to be clear, I'm not advocating to run out and get a new therapist or quit without trying to work through it. Just don't sell yourself short, either. Your therapist is the front line to showing you how people should treat you (even during adversity) and what good boundaries look like and work like.

To be more specific, my mood swings are much less extreme, and I find myself able to function better.

The medication I'm on also has very few side effects, so I don't feel like there's a negative trade off for me, other than the negative feelings I sometimes get about needing them.

One note I want to make is that sometimes it may take a while to find medicine that works well for you. So if you do decide to try it and it doesn't seem to work, don't give up! Also, if there are any particular side effects you're worried about (for example, I wasn't okay with weight gain or a risk of high blood sugar), make sure to tell your doctor and they should work with you.

I would sit and  repeat and contemplate  things  like neuroplasticity (the whole process) and cortisol's impact on the brain & how that can lead to mental illness. Facts. I would repeat and meditate on facts. I'd repeat CBT methods to myself as well as other ways of repairing cortisol damaged parts of the brain. I'd think about and repeat to myself ways of repairing neural pathways that were thinned out and how they worked. I meditated on these facts over and over because I wanted to give less resources to my emotional neural pathways. It worked like a charm. I also spent that whole month doing new things to stimulate new neural pathways. To be honest, it needs maintenance and since I haven't kept it up, I've been a bit much to handle still. I'm a bad person to live with still, but this  whole year my bad decisions have been reduced by like 60% or so and to me, that's as big as the moon landing.

But hold out for a really special person, they must be compassionate and kind, understanding and have a gentle and loving nature. I’ve spent the last 15 years consecutively in and out of relationships with very little time being single. A bad/toxic/unhealthy relationship really exasperates my symptoms and behaviours and can really set you back in learning how best to cope and manage your bpd. 

My advice is to learn your triggers, identify the parts of you that are hurt, and allow yourself to feel worthy of love as an imperfect person.

I worked there for like 3 weeks. But I'm 100% convinced they remember and still judge me.

Also when I start feeling insecure in my relationship, that's the #1 thing that leads to splitting & delusions. It's so weird. Because when I'm not in a bad spot mentally, I can talk to my partner about it and be like ""yeah sometimes I become delusional and believe that you hate me, would be happier with someone else, think I'm a burden etc"" and he reassures me that he loves me and isn't against me in any way.

I think it's a good idea for him to talk to a therapist, but I'm wondering if couples therapy could also be a viable option. A couple's therapist doesnt try to get two people back together, but rather their focus is on the best outcome for both people, whether the two people stay together or break up. It sounds like you're both very kind to each other, so you have a good base to start out with.

Then I cry, he yells about it, I cry more, he yells more. Frequently, if this continues too long I lose my shit and act like a full on crazy person :(

We’re in counseling now to work on our communication. A few things she has suggested: if one of you requests a break to think things over & calm down, the other person needs to respect that. I shut down & can’t respond with all that I want to say so she has suggested that if there is something I need to say to him but am afraid to bring up I should write him a letter. I am allowed to ask that I am to think about a topic before giving my answer so that I am less likely to appease by giving the answer that I think he wants.

I have been in a similar place to you before where I *needed* to be talking to my FP at all times or I'd lose it. Time with your FP can be very addictive and right now you're taking that drug like a junkie. Try to wean yourself off time talking to your FP slowly to prepare for the coming change. Communicate openly with your FP about your plan, why you're doing it, and ask their help with slowly reducing communication time. Find out what kind of communication time you'll have after their job moves back to the office, and make that amount the goal for you to reduce down to. Look for ways to stay occupied when you're not talking to your FP. Maybe think of ways to surprise them when you do get to talk to them next. Perhaps if you're artistically inclined you could work on art as a gift for your FP. 

It's hard, but I believe in you. You'll feel a lot more functional and whole and when you are more independent you will have a more healthy relationship that you can feel extra proud of.

0,"I'm not a parent. I want to be clear that my perspective is that of your daughter. My dad also did/does his best and I'm blessed to have a mom who is endlessly patient and giving (well... maybe not endlessly). My sister is also diagnosed BPD.

1) Therapy can be incredibly healing. My traumas don't come from my dad as much as other situations from my life. It's tempting to make that the line in the sand, but I encourage you to be aware that the ""as long as it's not therapy"" line might discourage your daughter from being as mentally healthy as possible.

2) You are aware of yourself enough to search for answers outside your own experience. That puts you *miles* ahead of other parents, even those without and diagnosed mental obstacles to overcome. Your daughter(s) are lucky to have a parent who cares to be a kind, loving, and capable parent.

3) I also happen to be high-functioning and high-anxiety. My teenage years were mostly small redirects from my parents. We set ground rules and agreed together on consequences if the rules were broken. Getting buy in from her is vital. My sister on the other hand is a wild child. Her BPD manifested in ways that made setting those boundaries next to impossible. My parents went through years of family and individual therapy to keep her as safe as possible. The bar went from ""high-acheiving"" to ""as long as she's a productive member of society"". As my parents learned to give her independence, she stumbled. But every time, my parents offered her love while not enabling her, and now she's stable.

4) Sorry this comment is so long. I hope you found it useful. Ultimately, violence = bad and clear boundaries with reasonable consequences = good. And of course, be mindful to offer praise. Remind them you love them frequently. Otherwise, it sounds like you've got this.",voteforpatty,gzchx0

To be clear, we both have therapists and psychiatrists. She is also shortly about to get much more help through a state funded service.

As I read your reply, I realized we do a lot of that. We've always kept an open policy, with no shame. If we issue an edict, policy, rule, etc. the kids know that if they feel part of it is unfair, we discuss it. We have actually taken their input and applied it from time to time. I was raised to ""believe"" that my opinion didn't matter, that they were infallible and if they weren't, I had no right to speak up. Beyond that, I don't understand the whole mystery of parenting. We tell our kids what to do, but we aren't afraid to tell them why.

Also in reading it, I think I realized the problem. It's me. I have a HUGE problem being a disciplinarian. I hate telling people what to do. And I hate making my kids unhappy.

 When you say, ""he has other friends, clearly you are not enough, so just ghost him and isolate”, you are assuming he will reject you once he gets to know you. Perhaps he will. Perhaps he won't.
What is the best case scenario? 
He is completely interested in you only and wants to only spend time with you every second of the day but he has these pesky other people who talk to him and it's hard to keep them away. He even started using bug spray on them. He has different fly swatters that are color coded for each friend and he slaps them with those when he can't find the spray.

It is a highly narcissistic way of thinking. It isn't correct and the person saying that lacks empathy or can't deal with THEIR emotions. Please understand that. You are not incorrect.

In my case the person who was telling me these things I kept trying to explain to her that the more she pushed the further locked in my mental crisis prison I would get. It was horrible. I empathize so much with your pain and anger and self hatred. I tried and tried to change myself that way and its exhausting and soul crushing. 

From your post it sounds like your mom is very mentally damaging for you to be around. Is there a reason you are stuck being around her? Is there any way you can get out or away from her influence? You clearly have a lot of pain to process and this is only  making it worse. She probably will not listen to you. 


In my case the only thing that soothed that intense self loathing was that, miracle of miracles, the person who was pushing and gaslighting me ended up validating the harm they did to me apologizing and reaffirming that I did not deserve it (up to that point they insisted I deserved it). I have been locked in cycles with her for a long time. And the way out was that I swallowed my pride and apologized and took responsibility for the damage I had done her, and listened to her even though I didn't agree with her perspective, and she actually opened up about how much my behavior hurt her or just the pain she was feeling, and then I was able to follow that up by sharing the same, how much her behavior had impacted me. We still have to separate to heal and protect ourselves but I have never felt ANYTHING like that moment of validation. It showed me how powerfully mind destroying gaslighting is to someone with a vulnerable mind. I began to imagine what it would be like to be around people who did not gaslight me at all, even if I was simply alone. I imagined how different life might feel. 

It inspired me to decide with a heavy heart I have to cut off contact further with my parents if they keep gaslighting me and leave a job that is confusing where I have bad boundaries.
 I have thought I can tolerate it and explain or just put my feelings aside. But there will come a breakthrough point when you realize how much your peace matters and that nothing in the world is worth mental chaos because it will destroy your soul and everyone around you will be affected. 

All that is to say I hope you can find a way to unentangle from your mom even if you still care or love her. Don't be surprised if things begin to feel a lot different. The stuff you are saying here is very heavy and dangerous. That amount of shame and self blame will eat you alive. It isn't that you have BPD and are bad as much as your BPD may be allowing you to emotionally stay in a destructive situation. 

All the best to you.",oisin_berry,ul6h66
3,"thank you so much. Im really happy that you’re doing much better now that you have zero contact. i wish i could leave too but she relies on me for so much. i help pay her bills and she’s threatened to kill herself before. and i never realized how messed up it is until now. and you’re right she did emotionally neglect me my whole life. 
i’m just gonna try to cut back on speaking about any of my issues to her until we’re in the presence of a mediator like a therapist because i don’t see the value in communicating with her anymore. everything i say to her is “manipulation.” i’m going to focus on staying productive and healthy as much as i can. thanks again!",ImpossibleBicycle249,ul6h66
4,"Oh no this is very clear now that you shared this information. It sounds like you are in a mind trap where she is able to exploit your guilt and shame to make you useful for herself as she probably can't face her own inability to care for herself.  

I also struggle with oversharing my issues with unfit people, an early childhood pattern. That you can recognize it is a great step. Maybe you can find another outlet or somewhere to receive validation as it seems you are experiencing a strong amount of manipulation and gaslighting yourself from her and she is projecting. If you are paying her bills and she is threatening to kill herself if you leave that is an abusive domestic situation and you may need more serious help to extract yourself don't take it lightly. There are domestic violence shelters and places that could help you begin the process when and if you are ready. 

You got this and deserve to experience a more free life no matter what you have done! Sometimes we can't help people we love except by helping ourselves.

You can have compassion for your mom and what she's been through and still choose to save yourself. It may be the hardest thing you ever have to do but remember there are people out here who can help and give you love and support. You are never as alone as you think.",oisin_berry,ul6h66

Im not sure what to do but i just want to thank you again for your comments because somehow it feels like you've opened a door in my mind. your comments were validating and actually made me feel like a real person.

0,"Hello, are you me a few years ago?


It sounds like you are torn between pleasing your mother and pleasing yourself and that you are perhaps looking for affirmation from your husband as to who to please? Which is understandable.


I would do the thing that brings you joy.


My mother has constantly undermined me and my choices in life.
She says that one of her biggest regrets in life is not 'pushing' me hard enough at school. This is fucked up on quite a few levels. I dropped out of school before my GCSEs because I had the first of many breakdowns.


Throughout my life so far I have tried to please her by being 'academic' and failed and hated myself because I wasn't meeting her expectations. Instead I pursued art and I have done well in that which has culminated in me graduating with a First class degree with honors and I have been offered a teaching assistant position on my degree course.


Yes, this is not something I will make megabucks with but it brings me joy, because of my confidence and joy in what I do with my life it has allowed me to seek opportunities and branch out into things related to my degree that I also enjoy.


You should have seen her disappointment when I told her I was thinking of doing a painting and decorating course this summer. She doesn't seem to care about my actual happiness and seems more concerned about her ability to brag to the rest of the family about me.


So in short, disconnect from your mother's toxic and broken view of life. Talk to your husband about how you would like more positive affirmation about life choices because it's important to you that he's proud of you. Do what brings you joy, because happiness in my opinion is the only real end goal that matters in the world.


Sorry if I have rambled at you but this is something I feel I have personal experience with and I hope that I can give you guidance and help :)
 ",saint_maria,6lmkfe
0,"Sorry to hear that. But I am going to be honest with you. Now is the time to validate yourself. Sometimes no one will but you. So here is what you can validate. You made the effort to find help for yourself. You got out of bed. You may have even made yourself breakfast. Start with validating the little things. 

Another thing is cope ahead. Think of all of the possibilities (like the bad therapist) and what you might do if you run into bad situations and how you might cope with them well. If someone invalidates you then validate yourself and remember you're worth it. If the price is too high try again or ask if they are willing to meet in the middle. 

If it comes down to it reddit has r/dbtselfhelp with so many resources and worksheets to practice. And you can always continue your search another day after a cup of hot cocoa or an activity that soothes you.

i went manic- did stupid shit. than i found this guy. he was amazing.. he had he's own problems but together we found solutions to how to deal with our emotions and actions. Making compromises.   
It's not easy and it takes a lot of practice before you get the hang of it.  
breathing techniques work a lot for me- it sounds stupid but it really help to stabilize what your feeling. i used to dissociate for hours a day- but with help- therapy and a lot of self thinking and sharing my emotions with my partner or the friends i trust.. even tho lots of my ''friends'' i feel like i could never talk about my problems as i'm so unsure if they will use it against me.

1,What you're feeling is normal. And sex can he a form of intimacy for most couples. If you have boundaries on this it's okay to have them if they are healthy. Ask your partner if their feelings fit the facts of the current situation. Imo it sounds like it doesn't fit the facts and they are comparing their past to the present and haven't fully recovered and healed. Maybe they might need a bit of therapy. They have to want therapy though as in cases of rape it is traumatic. Any trauma whether little or big is still trauma and needs to be worked through in order to live the best life possible.

0,">I do want to end things

Makes sense, in my opinion. He doesn't want to change, he just wants to keep holding onto you, like you said. I think he will only get better at hiding. He also showed some narcissistic behaviors, to avoid taking responsibility he blames you, and instead of working with you he avoids and 'escapes' with fantasy casual relationships - flirting, sexting, imagining what he would 'have' if not for the relationship with you.

I can't say if your conditions or the cultural expectations are fair or not, but he chooses not to respect them, and doesn't seem to want to compromise and work with you. His 'expectations' are also not very fair; he seems very sketchy and self absorbed, and make me upset to read

>he is not meeting up with these people (again, it's the idea that it's not cheating if is not physical)

The only difference is the opportunity, and with a history of cheating, why *wouldn't* he give into the desire if the opportunity came up (when it comes up, TBH). He already has a pattern to emotionally disengage from you sometimes, flirt and cover it up with the idea that you are to blame. I don't like it.",TranZeitgeist,rcs7y9
1,"In my recently personal experience - It's nothing but repeat pain. It's not worth your time or your effort, he might change for a while but he's going to keep making excuses to do it, and your feelings will fall to the wayside over and over again.

0,"Hey. I’m in the U.K. so can’t help with therapists in your area etc, but the ones you’ve seen sound appalling, and shouldn’t be practising. 

I have various personality disorders and PTSD, and yes, I probably will be on medication for the rest of my life (I’m 34 now and I started when I was 16). To be honest, I can’t even imagine life without them. They make me better. Why would I stop taking something that makes me better? Work on removing that medication stigma, and try to accept that medication can be a good thing.

Everyone is having a horrible time at the moment, and I think it’s especially hard for those of us with mental illness to endure. We’re lonely, claustrophobic, anxious, and some of our coping strategies have been removed. It’s natural that you’re feeling extra poorly at the moment. Let yourself accept that things are going to be really rubbish for a little while, but don’t forget that this will end. And you will have good days again.

I was very lucky around six or seven years ago and was offered ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy), and it changed my life. I still struggle, of course. I bloody posted here last week because I cut myself! It was the first time in two years, though, and of course I’m struggling with the lockdown like everyone else. But on the whole, it has allowed my recovery. It’s very peculiar because it forces you to lean into your trauma and accept it, rather than fight it (which is what we’ve spent all our lives doing, right?). But it works. There’s also a programme here called STEPPS which is used for those with PDs who aren’t as far into their recovery. Have a look into both these therapies/programmes and see if someone near you might offer them (when lockdown is over).

Please take care of yourself.",Unusualbellows,fxe0xe
1,"Join support groups, keep up with forums like this, research even more into it for your own good and peace of mind. 

Growing up and before getting diagnosed with my own stuff, I really enjoyed researching the shit out of things that interested me. Mental health being one of them. I knew something was up with me very early on and THANK GOODNESS for the internet because before all this met neutrality went down and internet life was actually bearable and relatively “fresh”, I was able to explore my mind and wackiness through research and actually allowing myself to feel and think the things I did. I just didn’t tell anyone. I’d read, watch videos, and ask google more and more to kinda get a sense of what I was going through, for my own peace of mind... because if I at least understood and accepted what I was going through, than that’s okay and enough. Because no one actually knows what we’re thinking or feeling unless we physically and vocally do so.. 

It became my own sacred secret. And that was okay and is okay for me because I also learned fairly quickly that the human condition alone is a very complex one, let alone one that is naturally made with an imbalance (which is also okay), so I’d just have to make sure that I was keeping it in check the best way that I could without letting fear, shame or guilt get in the way. 

Granted, that’s a bit harder now with having to grow up and transition to full blown adulthood. But it’s a great concept and sort of “light” to look to. You are who you are because that’s how youre biologically made. But you get to decide how you treat yourself and how you want to show up in your life, day to day. Even if it’s something unique each day. Just as long as you  work towards building a balance, a blue print to how you yourself need to survive and thrive. 

That includes letting go and REALLY not giving a fuck about what people think about you. Do what’s right for you so long it doesn’t hurt anyone or offend anyone. 

Honor yourself. Love yourself with your flaws and all. Because at the time of death that is all we have, ourselves. 

You have FULL reign over your body. Over your mind. Over your heart. Just because it’s been a tough fight, doesn’t mean you’re going to lose. 

Idk if you watch Naruto or anime at all, but if there’s one think I’ve gotten so far from Naruto is that each day, each moment brings a new challenge. Whether it be mental, physical or spiritual. Whether we’re ready or not, equipped enough or not. The important part is to show up and fight. Give your best and your all, regardless if you win or lose. 

Life is a win/lose game. It’s a matter of what we learn from it and how we use it to keep going. Because dude, as crazy as some days may feel living with this, we also experience some pretty dope amazing things! That wouldn’t be the same if we were normal! 

Kinda like Hannah Montana too 😂 best of both worlds! 

Make the most out of it love! Even if it hurts like fucking hell sometimes. It’s okay. We don’t like a lot of thing, but we still get through it because we have to. 

Don’t be afraid or ashamed. You’re you and you are trying! And that is enough!

Also, don’t give up on trying to find a good match in terms of healthcare and therapy. I’ve yet to find a good match, and even though it’s made things relatively worse in some aspects, I don’t wanna give up. And you shouldn’t either. You deserve to live a full life.",betsyletsy,fxe0xe

Right now recovery is my top priority. I finally moved out my mother's house a year ago. I'm at university. I have not worked for years because of BPD. I'll be starting an 18 month MBT course in the new year. 

I'm just about holding it together right now, with a fuck load of support.

What I'm trying to say is that life is a ladder. We cannot just jump straight to the top, even if we can just about see it from where we are now. We have to take each step at a time, at our own pace, while constantly checking to make sure it's the right step.

If you are in dbt therapy though, you will fill out a card each day with things like emotions and actions, so your therapist can go over that and you will be less likely to forget what's happened and you guys have real concrete things to talk about. That was scary for me at first, having a record of all my maladaptive coping behaviors but it has actually helped bring to the forefront things I  really need to work on and started showing patterns of why I do the things I do.

Suicidal ideation sucks balls, as does being suicidal in general. Can you discuss starting DBT with your therapist? CBT is fine enough and might be able to help you a bit, but DBT is the one designed specifically for BPD. 

I really hope you're feeling a bit better now. And congratulations on your wedding! Your friend doesn't sound very understanding; can you talk to her about how you're feeling at all?",,3h5dc5
1,Thanks for responding. My therapist rescheduled for next Friday unfortunately. A lot has been going on but I saw my psychiatrist today and they adjusted my medicine. I'm hoping my therapist will work with me on DBT since she isn't specialized it in but they told me she'd be willing to learn it along with me. ,PiffTheFairyMuffin,3h5dc5
2,"Next Friday is far away, but when you weigh that against the idea of her putting in the effort to help you with DBT then it's not the worst. That sounds pretty good. I take it there's not the option to see someone who already specialises in it? Or you have a decent enough relationship with your therapist to not want to find someone else?

How is the meds adjustment going? I know it's early days but somtimes the side effects can come on quickly and that's not so fun, but even worse to suffer in silence. ",,3h5dc5
3,"I've never seen her before, she's the therapist I was assigned after I was discharged from the partial hospitalization program. She isn't a specialist or anything in DBT of BPD, so I'm hoping she works with me okay. My psychiatrist upped my Zoloft, decreased my seroquel, and decreased my trazadone. ",PiffTheFairyMuffin,3h5dc5
0,"Um, you really should just exit this whole thing you have going on and focus on yourself for a bit. You don't need to give someone an excuse to leave a relationship, really. And being threatened with a break-up is such nasty manipulative behavior. 

Your families shouldn't really play into your decision to leave a toxic relationship. Either they will support you or they won't, you'll see whose side they're on.

0,"If you havent already try doing some mandala or zentangle art. Its a great way to meditate while doing a task. I really need to take my own advice and get back into it.

As far as the urge so self harm, just try to keep things from building up if you can. I say this because I recently had some relapse with self harm after a couple weeks of feeling frustrated with my ex fp for not making any effort. I think if I had exercised more instead of staying in it could have been avoided. Be aware of your tirggers, talk to people you're close to about them. I've made the mistake of not rly disclosing my fear of ababdonment so when ppl stopped responsing theres no way they could have known how much pain that would bring me. Rly just speaking from my own relapse. 

Oh and if you havent already I always reccomend checking out dr Daniel fox on youtube and looking into DBT workbooks.",The1wholoves2much,hhqd1s
1,"Ok so! Ive started doing this and its helped me so much. It kind of started when my therapist told me that i need to mind my inner child as if theres literally a child there that needs to be minded. So when i feel rejected and you can feel it physically hurting inside, ill go “hey. Im here, youre ok.” And kind of mind myself as if im someone else. It probably sounds nuts but its really helped. Also by treating yourself like youre talking to a child, you stop blaming yourself for shit, you stop talking down to yourself all the time. You turn yourself into your own parent and do what your parents didnt do for you. Its hard and it feels weird dont get me wrong, but it kind of helps me realize i dont need anyone to validate me or constantly reassure me that theyre not leaving me. Because the thing about constantly asking someone else to reassure all the time is that, youll usually feel like youre a burden on them and it probably does put pressure on them to mind you instead of minding themselves. And also, no matter how many times someone else reassures you, youre probably not going to feel any better, and if you do itll be for a very short time. You are great and you have to believe that youre great. It takes alot of work to get through the constant fear of abandonment. But trying to reparent yourself helps, i think. I dont know if youre seeing a therapist as well though, but id definitely recommend it. OH also! Get a weighted blanket. I got one recently and have found it so unbelievably comforting. Its like a big hug.",Kuraaku1,hhqd1s

I would hate to see you push her away because of this, I did it to my FP when she lost custody of her kids. Just remember she is grieving. Your feelings are valid.

Everyone is different and things generally feel like tidal waves crashing in around you when you first get your diagnosis. There are plenty of 'recovery' therapies and it can be completely manageable even if it never goes away. It is and will be okay. You are still the same person you were before your diagnosis. You are beautiful, amazing, and worthy of love. It sounds like your ex was quite toxic and made you feel worse about yourself through his behavior, which in turn makes your symptoms much worse. He is not worth the time or effort if that is the type of person he is. I have been there, it is probably better to just walk away. My best advise to you is to take some time away from dating anyone. Concentrate on yourself for a while. Take a yoga class, start painting, find something you love that makes you happy. Get into therapy and build yourself up as a person.

0,I think what this has to do with BPD is that I am convinced I have to control my moods into order to accomplish tasks. People say you have to do things even if you don't feel like it but that feels really impossible. My ex said she could not fathom the way I thought about things and that you really just have to force yourself to do shit until you feel better. Instead of trying to feel better to do things. To me that sounds like a fast track to a total meltdown or anger explosion. I just wish my moods had less control over everything in my life.,oisin_berry,um6ynj
0,"Are you in DBT? They would probably suggest a lot of Opposite Action and Radical Acceptance. 

Opposite Action is when you have a destructive emotion come up, you figure out what that emotion is urging you to do, and then do the opposite thing. It’s basically rewiring your brain to not give into the emotional impulses. Examples of opposite action in your case might include deleting his contact info so you can’t reach out to him, setting yourself up at work so you can’t make eye contact, spending time with people other than him when you miss him. 

Radical Acceptance basically means that when we no longer have any other active choices to reduce our suffering, we need to accept the reality before us. It sounds like you are out of options to engage in a healthy relationship with this man. Accepting reality means accepting that the beginning part of your relationship that you are mourning is gone and is not coming back. Once you radically accept this, your suffering will lessen. 

Other skills that will help short term when your feeling really rough: 

 self-soothing, which uses your 5 senses to relax you. Example: sight- look at art you enjoy in happy colors or count tiles, sound- listen to your favorite podcast or playlist, smell- brew some (decaf) coffee or tea, touch- change the sheets on your bed, taste- slowly savor some comfort food you really enjoy. 

Distraction: this is only works if you engage in it until you are calm, and then use other skills like opposite action or radical acceptance. Basically you do activities you enjoy that reduce the distressing emotions. NO sad or romantic movies! Do things that don’t remind you of your guy. 

Hope this helps.

2,"It sounds like you were very hurt and emotionally dysregulated. When you combine that with a lack of knowledge of skills that can help you, it’s unfortunately common to cause some destruction. I’ve been there. Most people have, even ones that don’t have BPD. The best thing you can do is move forward with your therapy and to learn and practice effective skills. I use an app called “DBT diary card” that logs skills the way a formal DBT program would. One big  benefit is that they have a coaching and reference section to help you learn skills on your own. Maybe that will help you while you get the ball rolling in therapy?",fashlatebloomer,ewiap5

0,"Hey there, I’m sorry to hear how hard it is for you to get professional  help, that’s ridiculous and I’d love to see the mental health profession advance and do better. It’s flawed in many ways. 
 So I don’t know if I have the best advice but I would suggest a few things. One is that there is a web site https://www.nyp.org/bpdresourcecenter that’s an online resource center for bpd and I’m sure they have suggestions on there and there’s also a crisis number I think, I don’t know if it’s different from a suicide hotline or not. 
 Also you can look up dialectical behavior therapy techniques and start doing some on your own, that’s what the woman who assessed me recently suggested until I can get into a therapist. 
 Other than that there’s all the distracting stuff that might help, regular exercise, hobbies etc. I know those aren’t always useful in the midst of an episode or breakdown though but at the least it can be ways to give your brain more dopamine which can be beneficial. 
 Another thing, I know this is not easy either, especially when your suspicious of how they really feel, but trying to talk to your boyfriend, trusted friends and or family can be helpful. If you can allow yourself to be vulnerable and open with them it can work as a sort of exposure therapy. 
 It all takes work and dedication because it seems so hard to control ourselves or our emotions but we can do it! That’s all the advice I can think of off the top of my head, I hope some of it works and I hope you can get into to see someone soon. Remember that this disorder lies to you and that you are loveable and people care about you, I promise :)",,ftxj8c
1,"Also I want to say your worthwhile and I want you to believe that. Don’t tolerate shitty behavior or deceit from anyone. Don’t be afraid to go out on your own and seek healthy relationships.

No matter what your shitty parents did or said or what your shitty so’s have done or what your brain tells you. The people that mistreat you, that’s about them not you.

Whether you believe me or not, that right there is a huge step in the right direction.  There is no 100% miracle drug and there are non-medication-related changes that are critical if you want to heal.  

One of those changes is learning to just be okay with yourself.  Try to notice when you're beating yourself up and find something to distract you.  Then focus on trying to accept yourself as you are.  You're not good, you're not bad, you're just you.  After awhile, it becomes habit.  Then you can work on learning to like yourself and grow from there.

1,"I can't be of much help because my brain operates in the exact same way -- I had a nearly identical experience when I first started dating my current bf. After a week of seeing each other every day, I finally asked whether we were exclusive. I realize to most people, that's super fast. But even after months of dating, the knowledge that he was just TALKING to one or two other people while we were together during that first week was excruciating. Despite the fact that he definitively committed after a week, it would still throw me into a fit of rage. 

I think that if it begins impacting your DBT practice, it may be time to discuss it. Again, all I can offer is support via an ""I've been there, stay strong!"" since my brain thinks the exact same way!

0,"I don't know that either of these 2 points will bring you real comfort but

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

As you said, suicide hurts others, it's a painful grief, and still it's an outcome and a choice. And while you're here not choosing to die, perhaps a different team or treatment will eventually click. Do you make art or journal?",TranZeitgeist,i2asxt

3,"Hi, Thank you for your thoughtful reply. 

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out. This hope is difficult to hold on to when you're constantly told to just go to therapy when it's clearly not addressing your current level of distress at all.",sarahthehumanperson,i2asxt

I don't want to say the cliched line 'I'm sorry you're going through that' which seems to be the standard automated response to someone sharing their pain, because it never makes me feel any better. I'll just say thank you for validating my experience and sharing yours. Sometimes things just suck and there's not a lot we can do about it. We don't need to be going through the exact same thing but just being able to be honest about how terrible things are and meeting in the middle through our mutual suffering is enough. I don't want to minimise how unique your situation is, but I will say that I definitely share a sense that I'm living purely out of obligation to my family and also that it feels pretty much impossible for me to feel any positive emotions, enjoy anything or relax completely without self-judgment, fear or paranoia setting in. I'm very inconsistent because of my moods (and I avoid interaction if I'm acutely anxious, depressed or angry), but would be happy to chat to someone with shared experience.

What worked for me was trying to make it as not about sex as possible. I think being this way makes things feel like it is a lot more than what reality is. And that included sex for me.

But a lot of what you described growing up and how your felt is how I felt. I haven't had any drug problems or weight problems but I think it's mostly because my mom and all her brothers had drug addictions so I've always been really careful with that. But I have put myself in debt over $20,000 twice with my shopping addiction. I've also been asked a lot if I've ever been sexually abused but don't have any memory of anything. I'm sure I have BPD but I haven't been diagnosed. I've been misdiagnosed bi polar also but always knew that was wrong because my mood swings are caused by outer circumstances not chemical imbalance and because my sister is bi polar so I've seen manic episodes and I don't have those. My new therapist doesn't believe in diagnosis so I don't have any diagnosis she's just working on each thing I want to work on one at a time.

0,"No, it is not. Generally getting diagnosed young is a good indicator (things become more difficult as you get older, but with the correct treatment is not even chronic).

I'll use myself as example: 21 old male, 1.5yr on therapy. According to DSM:

\- **Fear of abandonment.** It is still there, it still makes me fuck up some relationships but I've improved.

\- **Unstable relationships.** My last relationship was the one that has lasted me the longest in my life (a few months lol, not too much), but I was able to express myself in a more effective way which has deffntly helped. Friendships are also healthier and I don't split on them a lot. I'm also able to leave now unhealthy relationships in a rational way.

\- **Unclear or shifting self-image.** Gone from 0 self image at all to being able to put a biography on tinder lol. Jokes apart there is still work to do but it got really better.

\- **Impulsive, self-destructive behaviors.** Stopped stealing, using drugs and alcohol. Sometimes I fuck up but I'm able to manage my impulses better.

\- **Self-harm.** Almost gone (at least cuts, burns, etc).  I still get suicidal thoughts time to time but honestly nothing more than ""fuck off I'd be better dead"", didn't feel in real danger in a while. 

\- **Extreme emotional swings.** Still get them but emotions are not as intense (I miss that lol) and I switch less between anxious/sad.

\- **Chronic feelings of emptiness.** Not gone. I think this is one of the harderst to overcome. 

\- **Explosive anger.** I can manage better my impulses while angry, still get very angry sometimes but I don't shout ugly stuff and I'm breaking less things.

\- **Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality.** Gone worse, specially when I'm at street.

&#x200B;

As you see it's not much but a noticeable change within a year. My black/white thinking also improved and I'm more functional now, but there is still a lot of hard work. Group therapy with a good terapist and other people like us has helped a lot. I've seen very severe patients get better and that feels hopeful. Having this said, if your psych thinks that BPD/your case is chronic just look for the right one, this doesn't only require a lot of hard work from you, also a qualifyed therapist.",normieuser1,i18jve
1,"There's no professional disagreement, tbh. A bit of left over stigma and ignorance, maybe. Borderline is not a lifelong diagnosis. Its a ""good prognosis diagnosis"", a ""hope bearing diagnosis"". The majority of people with BPD can expect symptoms to improve with or without treatment. With treatment the average number of clinical symptoms drops from an average of 5+ to an average of 3+. Some features, for example emotion regulation, are harder to treat than others, like distress tolerance and self harm. After remission, rates of relapse are actually fairly low and most improvement comes in the first few years following diagnosis.

That's not to say everyone recovers, but most people can expect a stable few relationships and opportunity to work. Some complicating factors that lead to longer lasting symptoms or failure to remit include more severe trauma history, comorbid diagnoses like bipolar mood disorder or substance use disorder.

Any professional who believes BPD is not treatable is one to be avoided.",TranZeitgeist,i18jve
2,"you definitely need to find out what will work for you. it does affect every aspect of your life...and CAN be lifelong, but if you have the determination to want to be better, you can most definitely break bad coping skills!",TacoBellBeech,i18jve

It still exists but those days and cycles of mania and suicidal tendencies are in the past.",pippopipperton,i18jve
4,"In my experience, it is life-long.  I no longer take prescription meds, so it can get easier to regulate mood swings as you get on in years.  However, it would be easy enough to get back to being a full-time mess.  I feel as if I navigate freighter instead of a skiff.  It takes a lot of effort to keep going and getting back on course when adrift seems to take longer.  Slow and steady wins the race, though.",holdonwhileipoop,i18jve
5,"No there’s new research saying it can be treated them brought into remission. No personality disorder is a long term thing, it’s only was seen like that BEcsuee they didn’t have a cure or could become aware of how to treat it, so no disorder is incurable In my opinion!",,i18jve
6,"For me it is.. I’ve been in therapy for over 10 years & I’m worse with my impulsive thoughts. I distract myself during the day and keep a constant cannabis high to cope with all of my intense emotions. I’m the most sensitive and anxious person. My therapy is once a week & I’ve done every therapy there is. I’ve been eligible for TMS for a while now and if nothing gets better & if im not pregnant, I’ll be doing that just to get a handle on the depression side of things. I’ve had to compromise with my mental health. I can choose the anger and anxiety or the depression & end of my life. People get mad when I choose the latter so I’m sticking with the angry anxious socially isolated and coping all the time way of living and everything sucks regardless. There’s not going to be an end to this mental fight for me unless I give up but I can’t do that I guess. I’m 20 and have the emotional intelligence of someone who is 5,000 years old but when it comes down to those moments, I can’t cope. I always have to depend on a lover to feel wanted. Love having daddy issues as well. I know BPD isn’t like this for everyone, but some cases can be severe and lifelong. Never stop working on yourself.",kushxxxkitty,i18jve
0,"This is probably terrible advice but I have a few suggestions to bring it up subtley, one could be to simply leave a page up about it on the pc or phone or whatever, while she's around and go make a cup of tea or something, perhaps ask her to close the page/ lock the phone/ some subtle excuse, that way you're not accusing or bringing it up, and let them discover it by themselves. Another way would perhaps send her a link and be like ""oops meant to send that to someone else"". Or ask her if she was having problems with -some random sympton on the list- 

These are probably all terrible, but all avoid any confrontation. Idk about her but when someone throws a suggestion like this at me, a kind of mental wall goes up stopping any reasonable thought through, this would get around that. I hope you find something that works",Alcoholic-Pizza,ghgs8u
1,"What you should do is understand that bpd is often misdiagnosed because the symptoms fit those of other conditions. This also means that some people who are diagnosed with bpd don’t actually have it. If you think she has bpd, don’t straight up say that. Try to suggest therapy for certain mental health stuff she might struggle with like mood swings or very low lows. You could start seeing the same therapist or just pull them aside and communicate your worries. But if she doesn’t want to go, you can’t make her.",misseselise,ghgs8u

4,DBT therapy is usually what they put first for people with BPD and Bipolar disorder. And you are right. She is going to have to want the help and you can't force her into it. I've heard of people walking out of getting help and hating their partners or loving their partners more. It all depends on the case. It's hard on both parties. I feel more so on the person who does not have the bpd because sometimes they may feel completely invalidated for a full week or more before being able to talk about their feelings or what may be going on in their lives with their partner. But definitely try for therapy. The changes are not over night and take time but if it works it's nice working with someone who is skillful.,Chilly_Grimorie,ghgs8u
5,"You need to think of yourself dude. I know it’s hard. As someone with BPD I know that these mood swings can *really* hurt your feelings, even if she doesn’t intend to. Mood swings in general can do this, not just ones from BPD. But sometimes it’s just not worth it.",misseselise,ghgs8u

Then I had to do therapy for 6 or 7 months before they confirmed the diagnosis. It’s really not easy to get a diagnosis to prevent as much misdiagnosis as possible. So she must really understand her struggles and truly want help in order for this to be successful.,misseselise,ghgs8u

1,"As someone with BPD it’s very aggravating and hurtful to see these posts. 
I can’t help but think these people who view people with BPD, blame BPD because the person does too.

For example if the partner without BPD tries to talk about their feelings or something that took place and the partner with BPD blames it on their diagnosis. This could form the opinion that they’re expressing. Or they’re just misinformed. 

I’ve known other people with BPD and have never seen them in the terrible light that I see on some of these posts. Honestly most people with BPD I’ve met are genuinely caring and loving.",foreveryoung94,gyq3ao
2,"To all: I understand and that's very relatable. For me to cope with feeling like a monster I either:

a) Own I have BPD so I'm not a slave to the impression that gives people. By having a ""what's your point everyone has dark traits"" attitude towards people they have no power over you.

b) I don't cling to any permanent identity because the world and ourselves is constantly changing so either our identity is never final or we are already complete over and over again.",,gyq3ao
3,"I seen that thread as well, it wasn’t a good feeling reading all of that :/ I’m guessing the ppl that had bpd in their lives didn’t try to control their symptoms?

Sure, anyone can say they're an expert but like, half of these people on there need some therapy too,,",grauaeugig,gyq3ao
5,"I am in love with a person with BPD and it’s easier for people to paint things as black and white rather than understand being human is complex. I’m constantly looking for information on how to help and be of support. I can’t say I’ve never fallin into ignorant thinking that he’s evil lol. Obviously it comes from the hopelessness after letting the episodes get to me. Plus my friends never having similar experiences can leave me isolated because it can be hard to share with them the intensity of it and them not judge me or feel sorry for staying. But meditation has been helping me a lot with letting things go and reviving the loving and supportive energy I know he needs. The more I educate myself and try to put my self love first. The quicker he diffuses and apologizes. I also try not to let him dwell in shame but rather to focus on solutions when he’s out of the fog. So I’m trying to become an example rather than try and fix him. It takes a lot of the pressure off of him which I feel can trigger the episodes. Also I ask the universe for guidance, strength and grace as often as I need and she never disappoints. If I don’t receive then I wasn’t paying attention. Also setting space while reassuring him I’m not leaving him helps. I know it hurts to reads those posts misinformed folks express. It annoys me when I look for help and the internet reads run, get out while you can. But people are just hurt they lost someone they hoped they’d have forever. Especially if it got dangerous so they had no other option than to leave. It’s hard to stay away from a dangerous situation when you have a lot of sympathy for it so people turn cold to protect themselves from a relapse. It’s easier to be angry than to feel hopeless. Anger= can’t be rejected. Plus western medicine is not as far along as people give it credit. This line also helps me

6,"Actually, reddit hates all cluster b personalities. Narcs, socio/psychopaths, us. I think they confuse hpd with bpd often, so them, as well. They just aren't aware. As soon as someone is lacking the slightest bit of empathy, someone has to point out npd or aspd. 🙄

I realize the seriously problematic issues of cluster b's, especially in relation to crime with sociopathy. Obviously not everyone with it is a criminal or violent person, but it is a concern.

However, most of them have been played up by media portrayals and people who assume their loved ones are the only example of people with bpd ever. It's tiring. I have ""quiet"" bpd, so people just think I'm naive and younger than I am... Until they really get to know me. Not that many people do. I'm careful about getting close to others.

It kills me that people will advocate for ""mental illness"" - - i.e. Anxiety and depression, until they are blue in the face. But other conditions, that are often comorbid conditions are overlooked and demonized.

Either you're for mental health or you're not. Pick one.",carnuatus,gyq3ao

8,"Theres no excuse for being abusive, disordered or not.",,gyq3ao
9,"I didn't mean to make it sound that way.

What i was trying to say was that people with bpd can be abusive as much as anyone else can.

Pointing fingers at people with bpd is not helpful for either side as it enables harmful stereotypes, and making the coping with the trauma about the abuser is simply not a good way to cope. There's a reason trauma therapy exists and there's a reason why victims of abuse are not split up into groups by the mental health problems of their abuser. And there is a reason trauma therapy groups are led by professionals. 

If you want to simply be informed about why people with bpd share certain behaviours, looking in a subreddit that makes the abuse about the mental illness of the abuser the core of the sub, will not be helpful but harmful. In many cases, the victims will share their own personal view, which aren't accurate to the mental illness sometimes but to their abuser. Looking for information in a place where many people gather who are struggling with trauma unsupervised, will not make anyone informed. 

You're right, being abusive is not right. Neither is labeling a group of people as abusers because they have the same mental illness
And many of the people i have seen on the subreddit simply need trauma therapy with professional supervision, to understand that coping with trauma is about you and not about the abuser
Sorry for the confusion I'm having trouble to put into words what i mean when i get heated in the brain (also im not native English speaker so some of the things i say might sound weird) 

Anyway tl;dr 
It's not okay to abuse anyone 
It's not okay to reduce a person to their mental illness
Coping with trauma should be supervised by professionals 
People who were traumatised by someone with a mental illness shouldn't give advice about how to handle a person with the same mental illness 
People with mental illness shouldn't be reduced to the mental illness

0,"I have this problem too. Avoidance is a bitch of a downward spiral!

It's easier for me to be motivated at work. I still have a hard time pushing myself to clean up around the house or do other ""boring"" tasks like paying bills. At work, I tell myself ""I just have to show up."" and ""It's never been my brains or creativity, it's being dependable. That's the easy part, Annie. Just do that."" Positive mantras are really helping me. 

Self-awareness about the *reason* you struggle with motivation might help too. Literally this week I was thinking to myself ""and why do I despise cleaning so much?"" and I realized: it's because I was always in trouble when I was cleaning as a kid. And trouble meant yelling. And crying. Big, long fights with my parents. 

So I decided to stop framing it that way. Reframing was huge for me for this - maybe reframing the tasks may help? I also put on Sims music while I'm cleaning so I feel like a sim - it helps take me psychologically out of the task and pretend like I'm just a machine algorithm completing a task, and I'll do something else when I'm done.

2,"Suicide, PAD, or euthanasia? Bc the only one worth it is euthanasia, I've heard PAD can still be traumatising in your last moments (causing doubt and feelings of being judged, not actually being helped) , and suicide will not always lead to an end, let alone ensure painlessness.

I don't know how long and hard you've been struggling with any of this, or what exactly you've been through...

And I'm not much of talking people out of informed decisions about things they really want. Especially this kind. I also don't know where you're from and its regarding laws, over here in the Netherlands, you have to have been through *every* available, applicable therapy there is before the doctors will let you start on the euthanasia track. This can take years, which is the purpose, because sometimes people meet a someone, or learn a something in those years that changes them for the rest of their lives.

Like knowing love is still possible, a nice job is still possible, a better life *is* possible. Some things might require you to migrate, travel, forgive and forget, learn, letting go. Leave your comfort zone.

Friend I met in therapy stopped living for himself, became a full-time volunteer for the things he believes in. The change he wanted to see in the world. Our government understands thanks to his shrinks, gives him the welfare he deserves and leaves him the fuck alone to do whatever. Has been doing that for about 15 years, met a lady friend he liked so much, he contemplated getting a vasovasostomy. Turns out she was infertile (childhood disease or something?), so they adopted instead. They all make each other so fairy tale happy, he's started pinching himself to check he's actually awake.

In case there's nothing any one can do to change your mind 'for the better', really, it's all subjective, I'd like to know the day of your birthday so I can think about you, send you some good vibes and all that shit while you're going through the process. If that's okay with you?

Lady friend I met in therapy didn't tell anyone the date of her euthanasia so no one got to say goodbye, I'm happy for her, though still somewhat upset because I'm very fond of closure. Sorry if I'm projecting onto you.

If anything though? Why not postpone one year, and have your last year be a bucket list year, a year of 'happiness' (I just cringed at my own words, but it translates to doing at least one thing that makes you happy every day, document it, and look back upon it at the end. What you'll have are 356 pics of things you did that you don't regret to look back on), before you die painlessly in a freak accident (assuming your insurance doesn't cover ending your own life willingly in whatever way).

Maybe, on some beach around the equator, or a snowy mountaintop, you find the one person (or thing or whatever, really) that'll make life bearable, worth it. The thing that'll change your mind and heart.

Sorry, I tried to keep this short but I keep going on... In the end, it's your life, your decision, even if it's 'our loss'.
