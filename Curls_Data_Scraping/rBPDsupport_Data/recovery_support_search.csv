0,BPD Recovery and support,"Hi everyone, I'm new to BPD recovery and I got diagnosed a few weeks back. Right now I'm looking into DBT and setting basic mindset changes. 

  
In your experiences, what are some tips you would give to someone who is trying to recover from BPD? Anything really works to be honest, I'm determined to beat BPD I'm just unsure of where to start.

1,MBT + Psychotherapy BPD recovery,"I know lots of people who went down the DBT route. I have been in MBT + Psychotherapy combination treatment for some time and things are going great. Life is much easier now I'm aware and despite the odd wobble I'm happy. My friends notice a huge difference and so does my partner. ( hes seen me at my worst ) Me stable has become the new norm and we are doing things we never could have done before I got help. 
I would recccomend MBT to anyone struggling with internal emotions (wether you realise you are or not) every day I'm repairing the damage I caused to others before treatment. Particulary loved ones that suffered as a result. There is hope out there. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't change, you can and if you want to you will.

3,I’m struggling today ,"Hey, I’m just looking for some positive reinforcement and just a pep talk/ pick me up. Im fragile so I won’t cope with “tough love” xx I’m in recovery for BPD (I know it will never go) but I’ve been no contact with my fp for almost a year now apart from a few months ago when he tried to reach out to me. I stupidly keep looking on line at his girlfriend (of 2 plus years now) and she plasters their amazing life all over social media. I shouldn’t look and trust me I know and I shouldn’t have punished myself. But I compare myself to them, he’s still my fp I’m still deeply attached and it took everything not to respond when he tried to reach out. When we were “together” it was a situationship, I was in active addiction, I was harming myself and I got into swinging just to impress him. He kept going with me knowing all this and then eventually decided to settle down with this other person. He always said things that I felt made me inferior, I don’t have kids and I rent my home and he said these were signs of weakness and not having my life together and I’d never get him as I don’t have kids. (She does and he’s step dad of the year there) anyway; I have made incredible progress with 520 days clean and sober, in therapy, just trying to live but I do silly things like look online at them and remind myself I don’t have the kids, the fun personality, any hobbies that are my own. Etc. I’m struggling, I just need to hear someone else has been here. How did you get out? Why won’t I get over this? I wish karma would get him but it’s fairly obvious that’s never going to happen.

4,Not really sure how to proceed,"Long story short, I’ve been seeing this therapist for a few months. She’s nice but she comes off as kind of a ditz and crosses boundaries. As an example, our first session: At the end of the meeting, she said that she usually closes with a hug but I don’t have to if it crosses my boundaries. Well I told her I love hugs and so we did. My mental health has slowly been on the decline as of late and I’ve been splitting a lot on my boyfriend. I’m really in need of support and have therapy every Tuesday at 3pm. Well these past couple sessions, while we normally meet in person, she’s told me she’s had to travel for meetings, so we will have to do telehealth, which is okay and I’m willing to do that. She just sent me an email, granted it’s enough time for me to shift around my plans, to let me know that she isn’t going to be able to make our meeting but we can reschedule for later on in the week or for three weeks out, because she had to change her travel plans. Then she summated by saying “I wasn’t sure about my decision but I’m so glad I made it.” I’m not sure why but that sounded incredibly selfish to me and made me really upset. I did not have a good holiday, I had a long day of dysregulation, splitting and sleeping to cope with deeply embedded feelings from complex ptsd. So…I’ve about had it with this therapist and I’m wondering if I need to find a new one. Feel free to ask me to elaborate. My brain is in recovery at the moment, but this made me so angry and I feel so alone right now, even though my boyfriend tries to be supportive.",1703572565.0,False,4,1,st00pidfuknut,None,18r1xo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18r1xo2/not_really_sure_how_to_proceed/

7,Just blew up and fucked things up ,"Would go to the normal BPD sub but I was banned for a no good reason. 
So basically I have BPD, ADHD, and some other things. I am not medicated for the ADHD due to my psychiatrist being a piece of shit. Today I looked at my grades (I’m in college) and I’m failing two of my classes because I’m unable to focus and get work done, I procrastinate a lot and I put my boyfriend above everything because he’s my ‘favorite person’. I am so fed up with being misunderstood and not listened to by my psychiatrist and I’m feeling incredibly impulsive, like criminally impulsive if you get what I’m getting at. I am so angry. I blew up on my mom and boyfriend and I’m at work right now so they are not with me but I was spamming them with texts and calls telling them I’m going to do something impulsive or hurt myself. My boyfriend is now mad at me and won’t talk to me because I scared him which is totally reasonable. I know I’m a bad person sometimes. But I am just so angry that they won’t put me on a stimulant to help me. I had anorexia but I’ve been in recovery for a year now and my eating disorder therapist cleared me for a stimulant but my psychiatrist won’t talk to her and she keeps putting me on diff meds like lithium and qelbree. I never took the lithium because I’ve been on too many mood stabilizers and anti psychotics and I don’t wanna turn into a zombie again. I’m not taking the qelbree because it’s not a stimulant. I’ve taken adderal before, and it helped so much. I would only take it on school days though because I like being frenzied when I’m sewing or working on my creative stuff. I don’t know what to do anymore, it feels like my world is crashing down around me and I’m starting to get those minor hallucinations and my mom said that I’m acting deranged right now. Which I think I am because of the things I said. I Can be so mean when i go thru episodes like this and I say some really fucked up shit. I just can’t keep living like this. Does anyone experience the same thing? Have any suggestions? Should I just continue to self medicate? I feel like I’m going crazy. Trust me the texts I sent were very very bad. I feel so guilty now. I want to punish myself. But I’ve made it so far (I used to self harm daily and had many attempts but I’ve been clean from those for a year now) I can’t fall back into those habits. I don’t know what to do. Yes I’m trying to get a new psychiatrist.

8,Struggling with being lied to,"(TW) . 


When my husband and I met. I expressed that due to my being a recovering addict. That a big part of my step by step process to recovery is to not be with anyone who uses. It’s just a major trigger for me (not just because of my sobriety but because of a very abusive relationship I was in). So dating someone who is recovering as well is just something I mentally am not ready for. My now husband was involved in a lifestyle that had led me to believe he may be using drugs. I asked him about it to which he swore up and down he’d never have done. That from his childhood. He just grew to an understanding drugs are life destroying  and he’d never touch them. (His parents were addicts) I  told him good because I can’t enter a relationship with you if you’re newly sober, using etc. I’m not stable enough on my own sobriety journey to do so. (I explained more in depth but it’s a very touchy and trigger subject for me to talk about) Well. Fast forward. We’re now newly weds and he comes to me with a confession. That he lied to me and was in fact only 2 weeks sober when we met. He told me he didn’t tell me because he didn’t want to lose me. But at the time of the conversation we had only just met, we hadn’t even began dating yet. There have been multiple situations in our relationship where I felt like he may be doing drugs. But because he said he’s never touched them. I ignored my gut feelings and moved past them. This feels catastrophic to me. Like it’s the end of the relationship. There are other factors as well. But being lied to is always been my biggest problem when it comes to people. Once I’ve been lied to. I cut ties. But it isn’t that simple as we’ve just gotten married.. I feel very trapped and hurt. It feels like he’s intentionally waited until we got married to drop this on me. Especially bc he’s become so open about it all as if he’s been that way the whole relationship. I’m constantly having to tell him I’m not comfortable with the conversation as it is very triggering. But he just doesn’t seem to get it. Ultimately I feel like my choice was taken from me. If I had known I would’ve gladly remained in his life as his friend. But I wouldn’t have dated him. Let alone married him.  Which makes me feel like a horrible person for saying. But I expressed that to him when we met and he chose to withhold the fact he’s recovering from me as a response. He said he didn’t know how to tell me after I said I wouldn’t date him and that he didn’t want to lose me either and just be friends. I feel like I don’t know him anymore.

9,Trigger self harm,"UK.

Hey how’s everyone doing with social isolation? I can’t remember how long it’s been. Only two weeks since the schools shut here and today I have cut myself for the first time in a good few years - at least two I think. I’ve been sinking into depression for about a week but today it feels more serious. I’m looking after my children (5 and 2) during the day while my husband works from home. He’s on his lunch break and told me to come upstairs for a break by myself, and I’ve cut my arm with a razor blade from a shaving razor. This is how I’ve always done it. I feel much more stable now I’ve done it. It’s not deep and I’m not in danger.
But in the back of my mind I’m worried about how to explain to my husband and my children, and I should probably feel ashamed and that I let them down, but I don’t really. 
I’ve been in recovery for six years but still live with the impulse to self harm most days. I guess I’ve surprised myself by going through with it today. 
I’m talking nonsense I know. I just needed to tell someone who doesn’t know me. Thanks.",1585918415.0,False,3,1,Unusualbellows,None,fu7w67,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/fu7w67/trigger_self_harm/
10,Time to let the Cat_Banana_Hat out of the bag,"*deep breath*

So last week, many of you saw a big altercation between myself and a user in another sub. I know that I handled myself well and I'm proud of the way I represented all of us. 

Since then, I've been trying like hell to pretend it never happened, to ignore it and continue with my recovery. 

However, I have this feeling like it's not going away. I feel like I became notorious overnight in this corner of reddit, and I have no earthly clue how to deal with this. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need help or support that you think I can provide. I'm not talking about that at all, I promise. It's more that.. frankly, I don't know what I'm doing half the time, and I feel fraudulent that some people think I've got things figured out or under control. 

I love to share what works for me, and I have a way of explaining things that others with BPD can easily understand. That's fantastic and I'm happy to help. 

Just so long as we're all clear that I'm just another regular old user with BPD.

Thanks for listening, and if you have no idea what I'm talking about, sorry to have wasted your time!",1438885175.0,False,8,13,Cat_Banana_Hat,None,3g17fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/3g17fn/time_to_let_the_cat_banana_hat_out_of_the_bag/
11,Just found out 2 days ago I have BPD,"I’m gonna rant and ramble so hold on to yer britches everyone! 

So— clearly I’ve had BPD my whole life but as of 2 days ago I was finally able to acknowledge that this is what has been afflicting me. My mother has it, it’s been passed down, I get it. I’m going to therapy next week and I’m excited to get onto the path of recovery. I have a verrrry addictive personality and have dabbled in self harm terribleness. All this to say— I’m here reaching out to others with this same disorder because I’m going through a breakup right now. 

My partner and I are both not exactly the most stable of individuals and together it’s just like tossin gasoline on a fire. He and I have broken up and gotten back together often over the 4 year span of our relationship. The only difference is now he knows I have this disorder so he can leave me and feel justified in doing so which is a terrible feeling. Also every time he says he’s moving out it’s like it’s driving a knife into my heart (so nice I can say this stuff to y’all and ya get it that I’m not being dramatic i just legit feel like I’m dyyyying). 

Now that I’m aware of my disorder I’m trying my hardest to not manipulate him into staying with me. I bounce between despair and hope constantly. He says he’s considering leaving but also may not leave and he’s not sure yet. He barely talks to me, he won’t touch me and I feel like crap and super alone. 

I guess I’m just having a confusing ass time in my life at the moment and instead of explaining what BPD is for hours on end to ppl I thought I’d just see what nuggets of wisdom y’all can throw my way at this time.

12,Sponsors?,"Hello, I have just started a partial hospitalization program and am taking my recovery from BPD more seriously. A friend, who is in 12 step, recommended I find someone like a sponsor for my journey and I think this is a great idea.

The biggest difficulty for me is that I do not have a space to meet potential sponsors. As with most PHP groups, we are not allowed to contact each other outside of group until we're both discharged. So, I have come to reddit. I was thinking perhaps this could be a thread to match each other, if we feel comfortable.

If you think you'd be a good match for me feel free to send a DM. If you don't think so, that's okay, and  I welcome you to post what you're looking for!

&#x200B;

For myself, I live in Seattle and would love to find someone local. I understand we're currently all at home for COVID, so I am happy to start virtually but I'd love to find someone who I could perhaps get coffee with sometimes, but this is not required. It is very important to me to find someone who is also professionally diagnosed and in treatment, especially if you are doing or have ever done PHP or IOP. At this point, I'd say my BPD is moderately managed and I am looking for support with someone who is also somewhat managed. My goal is remission, I hope yours is too!

Because this is a possible tigger I want to say that I am active in ageplay. If you are triggered by ageplay, dd/lg type dynamics, I will probably not be a good fit for you.",1586276492.0,False,2,1,xoxoaspey,None,fwne8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/fwne8a/sponsors/
13,"I’ve had to leave another BPD group because my boyfriend found my posts there (Venting, would appreciate some support)","**EDITED: UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM** 
I was mostly using it as a safe place to vent, where I could lay out the emotions that my couldn’t control and the irrational thoughts and reactions that I was trying to work out of. 

Several days ago he quoted something I’d written in my last post, and it really hurt. There are other things happening in my brain that I’m really struggling with (I also have OCD and bipolar and am in the never ending anorexia-recovery-battle that I’m steadily losing ground to) and some of the things he does, on purpose or not, are terribly triggering. 

We run another r/ together, but I’m really thinking about trying to block his profile so I can keep my privacy. This, on top of the fact that his adult children and mother have been stalking my social media, so I’ve had to delete all of my platforms. This is a new reddit account because I tried going without for a month and went especially stir-crazy


**UPDATE**
Hi y’all. I thought it would be quicker to answer some things here than individually. I really appreciate the insight and the thoughtful responses. I agree this particular behaviour (creeping my r/bpd posts) of his is toxic. I disagree in saying the whole relationship is poisoned. 

- I knew already that he was also in that bpd group, his daughter also has bpd and he says it’s been helpful to listen to other borderlines talk openly 
- His kids and his mum hate me + the fact I exist outright. We have a pretty big age gap and they have decided to be disgusted and mean. He has addressed them about it, but things aren’t really progressing. Them stalking me has been a problem since the beginning
- We have conflicting coping methods: I clean and put away and throw away and recycle compulsively; he’s a mid-grade hoarder and has been for 25 years 
- I’ve been steadily increasing the doses of my OCD/mood stabilizers to keep myself level in spite of his intensity and it only works so much
- We live in a place far away from my friends (not purposefully, my bffs are in different provinces and countries) but it’s also very rural with a mostly-senior population. I don’t have any peers here, and that definitely contributes to my daily down moods. 
- Again, this was much less of a problem and much more manageable when the world was still open",1593280838.0,False,17,7,theunfairness,None,hgy71i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/hgy71i/ive_had_to_leave_another_bpd_group_because_my/
14,Person ive been dating for 2 months heard his first meltdown on the phone yesterday and im having such a BPD response to it,"It happened. The one thing I was so scared of and he heard the whole thing. The crying, the scream, the muttering to myself to ""stop it"". He heard me punch the wall. He heard the hyperventilating whilst I was trying to calm down and pull myself together. He called me back after I hung up the phone because I couldn't keep myself contained and I was so embarrassed that he was having to deal with all the shit I was putting on him. He text me asking for me to talk to him when I didnt answer his 2 call attempts. He picked up when I called him back a few minutes later apologising for hanging up in the first place. He stayed on the phone through more crying, more hyperventilating, through the exasperated, pathetic attempts at explaining why this happens as if im just daring him to say that this ""isn't what he signed up for"" and walk away. Telling him just how humiliating it feels to have every fiber of yourself feel as though it is dependant on validation and reassurance from everyone just so I dont spiral. I had to explain how I start to feel all the urges of self harming and being self destructive were coming flooding back. Every pause, every break in my rambling, I felt the silence stab me in my gut. The knife twisting as I felt almost incapable of shutting up as my mouth poured out more and more stuff for him to use as excuses to leave this behind.

The phone call ended with me saying I had to prepare for a zoom recovery meeting in a couple of hours and had to get myself together. I felt humiliated, numb, empty, like all I wanted to do was just not have to be alive anymore. 

I messaged him later that day saying thank you for listening and for being patient with me and he said no worries. Aside from asking him where I could find something online and getting no reply until today, ive heard nothing and its driving my anxiety and abandonment issues through the fucking sky, let alone the ceiling. I messaged once more early this afternoon asking how he was doing today and nothing.

I'm trying all I can to remain calm and rationalise the facts to myself but with every passing hour its getting harder and harder to not give in to the assumption that, thats it. 
Fact 1, hes a stoner and I already know that it gets to his memory sometimes
Fact 2, he is notoriously bad at speedy replies and his friends have confirmed this for me as well

Please tell me I have nothing to worry about, I cant concentrate on anything as a distraction, I feel like im slipping in and out of dissociation, I didnt eat yesterday and am only now sitting down to try and eat a frozen pizza because I know my body needs something. How do I stop getting so dependant on other peoples validation because I cannot keep dating if I cant control this. I can handle the meltdowns, but this??

15,"[F,21]Just Diagnosed. Feeling Hopless in Need of Encouragment","My bf just ended our 3 and a half year relationship. He always accused me of being negative, manipulative, only seeing my perspective, over emotional, crazy, always thinking im right. He cheated on me and lied alot and was disrespectful. So i always saw his problems as much more severe. I didnt agree with his accusations besides being over emotional and sensitive. But now that ive been diagnosed ive been reading articles, looking into resources, and now  perspectives of boyfriends with BPD girlfriends, I see how he could see me that way.....

So, i just sent him a really long text explaining everything i now see, saying how although i had good intentions my actions came across negativley( i just got diagnosed about a week before the break up, so alot of this is just coming to realization). I said at the beginning of the text i wasnt sending it in hopes of being back together or reciving a response from him, but he didnt respond. And im starting to see just how severe my disorder is... cuz now im crying, wishing i never opened up to him and sent it, cus i thought he would at least aknowlege that I am realizing everything. And i know this is my BPD speaking... cuz i shouldnt care if he responds or not. Im acting out of emotions right now and assuming he must hate me or think im crazy or doesnt want anything to do with me. 

Needless to say, this realization is making me feel hopeless. I didnt realize how bad i was until now. I thought i was mild and a year of therapy could fix it. Is recovery likely?? Reading others posts make me feel like ill never get better. 

Please, I need encouragment that ill get through this, i dont have a supportive family and ive always gone to him for support and hes not here anymore,

16,FRUSTRATION STATION,"Hey all. Thanks for having me here. 

I'm (27 FtM) struggling to prioritize in my life. Having finally gotten some self awareness on the borderline patterns of attachment, obsession, and trying to break out of this cycle of centering my life around unattainable or unavailable people, living in fantasy worlds, being super self absorbed, venting and only talking to people when I want attention, validation etc. that is keeping me from moving forward, gaining skills, etc. Everyone is so frustrated with me and I have had to come to terms with being emotionally abusive/neglectful to my ex, neglectful at my jobs and of my pets and self. 

It feels very awkward and unnatural and forced to try to be consistent in friendship, my habits, life. I never have had serious addictions besides social media and other peoples approval. 

Im exhausted. But I know I do have habits and can form new ones because I definitely have bad ones like laying in bed all morning or spending a lot of time in my head. 
Its just that every single day my mood is different even on mood stabilizers and I'm used to doing what I feel like impulsively based on mood, or what I'm forced to do. Which is a surefire way to spin out of control or feel hopeless. I need to develop my OWN locus of control and discipline and its just shitty that my moods are the enemy when they so badly crave validation after decades of gaslighting and being blamed for their intensity and destructive power. 

Im wondering for those who are actively recovering...what has really really helped you out of old coping mechanisms? What were you able to commit to?

I am PDA autistic and have ADHD or bipolar, still waiting on a psych evaluation, but one of my biggest struggles is finding something to be consistent with that doesn't end up trashed by demand avoidance or getting bored/splitting on it. 

Every kind of routine or demand outside of my fixations ends up feeling like swallowing pills or pinching your nose to eat something nasty until I just stop. 

 Everyone says to fight depression, meditate find hobbies and get outside yourself find something to do for others, exercise. 
But I legitimately feel my habits and mental copes are like gravity or a black hole and getting out of them or making changes in life exhausts me and I collapse back into them. 

I guess this is just what recovery is like. But I've tried Codependents Anonymous, talk therapy, astrology, divination, meds (except ADHD meds about to start those), being more social, creative expression. At the end of the day my brain always finds a way to invalidate destroy or get convinced that thing ""isn't it."" The only thing I come back to is taking pictures on my phone (never organized) and writing long rants on the internet. Im so bored of my SELF. And analyzing myself and recounting my past trauma.. everyone else seems to somehow find something to do, or to love, or commit to,, even when we have the same diagnosis and experiences. 
Ughhhhhhhhhh. 

Is it really possible to form an identity and learn how to commit? 

I'm so tired from fighting myself. 

It feels like a normal life is just within reach if I could follow the steps (apply for jobs, show up to jobs, budget the money, move put of home state, take care of my body, cook and eat, have a creative routine, go on a run, care for my pet, evaluate which relationships are good to have around, spend time in nature, set boundaries, learn time management, learn emotional regulation) so I can get to a place where I feel stable enough to really connect with others and not sabotage everything or get hurt because I picked someone wrong.

 But those steps feel so impossible when I keep proving to myself over and over that I will not stick with anything, I will sabotage everything, and every single day I have a new idea about my next big project or career path or what ever. 

How do you build trust with yourself or anyone else without consistent effort? 
The only way I feel motivated is to get a FP or romantic interests approval, or extreme outside pressure and fear of punishment. 

Im just so frustrated I could scream for days. 

Does it get better? And how! Does DBT help with this? 

Consistency is literally the key to unlocking life, and I feel like someone tossed it into a vat of concrete Im supposed to chip away at with my fingernails.

I am trying really hard to recover from my eating disorder. It has been a year since I am in therapy and take medication. Even though I am on the path of recovery, I am still sick. My day-to-day existence is still challenging. I have been victim of many misconceptions people have about my disease. Today, I want to break those misconceptions. 

First of all, I have gone to my family doctor before my eating disorder went out of control. I’ve told my doctor I was worried about the relationship I had with food. I’ve told her that every time I felt angry, sad or anxious about something, I ate. I’ve told her that I often got up at night to eat things I didn’t allow myself to eat at daytime. I’ve told her that I was sometimes craving for junk food. I’ve told her that I was often eating so much that I felt a pain in my stomach. I’ve also told her that I was constantly checking my weight because I was worried that I was weighing more than my friends. Those are the common symptoms of an eating disorder. My doctor didn’t take me seriously. She didn’t consider my eating behaviors as a problem. Actually, she told me it was quite common among teenagers to like junk food and to eat “too much”. 

For a couple of years, back in high school, my eating behaviors remain the same. I was stealing money from my mother’s purse to buy junk food. I was hiding food in places where my mother could not find it such as my room’s closet. I had drawers filled with wrappers. 

Then, it got worse. Two years ago, I had convinced myself that I had some kind of virus and that I couldn’t digest food anymore. For a week, I had stopped eating. My close ones were worried but they didn’t question my behavior because I had convinced them I had a virus. When I started to eat again, food disgusted me so much that I felt like I couldn’t keep it: I had to throw it all away. And that is what I started to do.  At first, I told my parents that I was throwing up because of the virus. But, it kept getting worse. I could barely eat with them. And when I did, I ate a ridiculously small amount of food. I was throwing up after each meal. And I had started to skip meals. In a matter of a few months, I had lost a lot a weight (something like 25 pounds). At one point, I couldn’t concentrate at school anymore. I was feeling weak. I was feeling anxious around others. At that time, all I wished for was to disappear completely. I told my parents I needed to go to therapy. I knew something was wrong but I didn’t know what it was. My first therapist diagnosed me with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), related to a sexual assault I had been victim of a couple of years before.  Then, I was diagnosed with Depression. Then, I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, they found out I had an eating disorder: I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. Finally, after a suicide attempt and a stay at the hospital, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 

I have found it really difficult to hear about the final diagnosis because I knew that this one was accurate. When my therapist first described to me the symptoms of BPD, all I could think was: «It is me. It is all me. Is it all that I am? Am I a disease?» For those of you who don’t know much about BPD, there are nine specific symptoms to this illness but you only need to have five of them to be diagnosed with it. First of all, BPDs fear abandonment. That’s why BPDs make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Because of that fear of abandonment, BPDs have unstable relationships. BPDs relationships are often intense and short-lived. Also, BPDs have unstable self-image. BPDs may feel good about themselves for a short period of time and then hate themselves. BPDs often don’t know their needs and desires. They may change values, goals, and even sexual identity. Because of their unclear self-image, BPDs engage in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm, risky sex, alcohol or drug abuse, binge eating. Those self-destructive behaviors can lead to suicidal behavior. BPDs also have intense emotional swings. They are described as hypersensitive. In fact, Marsha Linehan, the psychologist whom invented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is now used to treat people with BPD, says: 
“People with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.” BPDs also experiences chronic feelings of emptiness due to their unstable self-image and their lack of self-confidence. BPDs can also struggle with intense anger and can have trouble controlling it. More frequently, BPDs direct their anger towards them. Finally, BPDs can experience episodes of paranoia where they feel suspicious about other’s motives and out of touch with reality.  That feeling can lead to out of body’s experiences. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, I knew I had to tell my close ones. The impact of the symptoms on my life was so important: I could not pretend that they did not exist anymore. My therapist had warned me that the reactions to my diagnosis could be quite inadequate due to all the misconceptions people have about mental illnesses. Unfortunately, people often see BPD’s desperate calls for help as attention seeking. For example, that is often the way people feel about self-harm and suicidal behavior. Another common misconception is that people think that all BPD sufferers are extroverts. People think all BPDs express their intense emotions at the exact moment they feel them. In fact, some of us keep a lot of those emotions to ourselves. Sometimes, it is because we are not sure how to express those feelings. Sometimes, it is because we don’t even know how we feel: there are so many emotions trapped inside of us that ask to be released.  If you know someone suffering from BPD or from any other mental illness, you have to know there is no magic way to cure for those illnesses. The person who suffers from a mental illness has to be ready to recover and that feeling can only come from her. There is nothing you can do except stand by her side while she is trying her best to recover.  

I hope that my statement will help to demystify BPD and Bulimia Nervosa among some of you. And, I hope that those of you who suffer from any mental illness will feel less lonely. I also hope it will encourage you to speak up to stop the stigmatization of mental illnesses.

18,Does this ever get any easier,"Tonight I ruined any chance of a friendship with my favorite person on this planet. I screamed at him in public for not answering my calls because I was so sure his not answering meant that he was ignoring me and hated me and thought I was a piece of shit. 

And then I pull stuff like that and it turns out I am a piece of shit. 

I just want this to stop and it isn’t going to.",1595240490.0,False,15,4,killbot500,None,huivqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/huivqi/does_this_ever_get_any_easier/
19,I'm thinking that motherhood is probably a bad idea,"I've pretty much always assumed/expected I'd have a husband and kids.  I would like to have that family with love and security and laughs and support.

However, after having had my diagnosis now for a year, I'm seriously wondering whether it wouldn't be better that I *don't* have kids.

I'm just about 33, very, very single, unemployed, poor, and still working this BPD thing out.  Realistically, it'll be about a year or so (maybe longer) before I complete further therapy, and a further while to get stuff like employment and housing (I currently rent a room in someone's flat) sorted out.  

If I was to find someone who would be able to handle my BPDness, just the nature of the disorder would make me very skeptical that they even were serious.  

I'm terrified that I would fuck my kids up, mentally.  Besides BPD, there are a few other genetic things that I seem to have inherited that I wouldn't want to pass on.  

Adoption is there, but I feel very, very strongly that if I am to have kids, I want them to be ""mine"".  I know that's selfish and awful, but I know that I would have issues with adoption.

So yeah.  If I'm to have kids, they have to be mine, but I'd fuck them up royally, and who would even mate with me anyway?  Plus, being older as a mum...  not great.

Should I?  Shouldn't I?  I don't know.

20,I'm in desperate need if anyone can honestly help I'd be extremely grateful. Unfortunately I can't find a therapist to help me even if my life depended on it here in Las Vegas.,"My psychiatrist is on leave until restrictions are lifted and that could happen who knows when. The last therapist that I seen on the 26th of last month stated ""I'm not even equipped to help you, just looking at you your suffering from severe PTSD, you also have an extreme amount of trauma from your past and to be honest I can look at you and know your going to be medicated from the rest of your life."" I'm desperately trying to seek help but unfortunately it seems to me no one here in Las Vegas is either equipped to help me or they just don't take patients with BPD because of it being so stigmatized or maybe they've dealt with horrible patients in the past I honestly don't know. I'm seriously here seeking help I don't want to be medicated for the rest of my life and I really don't want to feel like this anymore. To be truthful with you it's like I'm living in my own hell with nonstop flashbacks and I'm trying so hard to battle this mental illness on my own and I really don't know how long I can manage it. I'm in desperate need of help because at this rate I'm going to be living my worst fear....being alone....only with my deep, dark and empty thoughts of nothingness. If there is any help your willing to give, I'm willing to take it. I want to be functional, I want to fall in love and have a life one day before I die. All I know is I didn't case it or give myself this mental illness, It's unfortunately not curable but can be managed through alot of therapy, I honestly can't control it....but I am desperately trying very hard too and I'm just extremely exhausted mentally and physically at this point. I fully understand if you can't help or won't be able to help this thread is honestly my last hope so whatever help your willing to give I'll be extremely grateful for any numbers you give me to call if you have any. I really do hope you have a nice day today and please stay safe.",1586377261.0,False,3,4,Alluringgaze,None,fxe0xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/fxe0xe/im_in_desperate_need_if_anyone_can_honestly_help/
