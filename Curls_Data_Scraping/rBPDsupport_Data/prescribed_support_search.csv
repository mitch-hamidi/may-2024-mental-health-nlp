0,New chapter new anxieties,"I was prescribed quetiapine (50mg) this week from my psychiatrist for my bpd I've never really heard much about this medication before and after reading I am hesitant to taking it I'm a little nervous about some of the side effects that people experience and I'm not sure if this is an appropriate place to post this but if anyone else has this medication for bpd can you tell me some of your experiences  when you first started it because although I was assured it would help me with my symptoms of bpd,anxiety, and trouble sleeping I'm not to sure if I'm ready to be dealing with the scary effects",1699055898.0,False,2,3,Slutz_Wit_Nutz,None,17n8u9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17n8u9k/new_chapter_new_anxieties/
1,advice/medication side effects,"hi,

i feel a little silly(?) if that’s the right word, maybe embarrassed but i just met with my local community mental health team assessor today for the first time. after 15 years of being messed about, let down etc she actually listened to me and said she doesn’t diagnose but she said i can tell this isn’t clinical depression and your symptoms seem to suggest EUPD(the word she used), and said she thinks the doctor is going to prescribe mood stabilisers, so i’m wondering what are the side effects like for any mood stabiliser? just to prepare myself. 

also, does anyone have any advice on how to come with finally getting that diagnosis? just to add, i’ve had many GPs suggest i probably have BPD but they never actually referred me on to get this support/actual diagnosis 

thank you and i appreciate any advice/comments

2,I feel like a ghost,"I have been depressed for the past three months, and my meds finally kicked in so I don't think I'm depressed anymore, but a deep sense of boredom and emptiness is still there, even worse than it was when I was in crisis. I feel half dead: I've been social, going out every day this past week, both with old friends and new qcquaintances, and it doesn't change anything. It's like no one can touch or reach me, and when I say ""I'm bored"" people don't understand how bad it really is, and kinda play it off. I do not know how to make anyone understand, my mind is numb, I might as well be dead already but I am still breathing? I tried getting high and it helps foe a while, not a long term solution though. I met with my prescriber and she said there is no med to treat this, which is what I expected because I would have heard about it if there was. The best she could give me was, 'you're fairly young, (31) and bpd usually eases with age' like k thanks. The worse part for me is the total disconnection, like people hear me and see me but...I feel nothing. I have felt this in the past but never to this degree, and when I did I jumped into relationships to feel less alone. I am not sure what I want out of posting this, i'm just screaming into the void to see if I can feel any sense of connection with anyone reading this.",1695252240.0,False,2,1,fetchthequeen,None,16nzxrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/16nzxrc/i_feel_like_a_ghost/
3,How can I help myself?,"First I want to apologize for the long post that you're about to read but I'm really losing my sanity at this point.

I (f 21) was dating a guy (20) for about two months, he was a virgin and I was his first ever , everything was going so so well , we are very compatible and I really liked him a lot and still do like him , he also liked me a lot , until..

Before we had sex for the first and last time ever he had talked to me about STDs and I told him that he has nothing to worry about because I have never had an STD , so two weeks later we have unprotected sex , and it was really really good , ten days later he started experiencing some symptoms like a burning sensation when he pees , white or clear discharge, his penis was red and swollen, and he was going crazy and he was very very anxious and scared (rightfully so) he went to a doctor and the doctor told him that it's probably gonorrhea and he told him to start with the medication that he prescribed to him after he got a test , the test came back negative, and I also did all the STDs tests and all of them came back negative as well . (For the record we are syrians and we live in syria , so we are very tight on money and the whole process of going to doctors and taking all the std tests was very dangerous because any kind of sexual activity before marriage is not okay here) .

This guy is now convinced that I gave him something and he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, and he keeps calling me reckless (which I know I am I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago but my parents refused to believe it and didn't get me medication or treatment) .

My problem is that I was also too ignorant to believe it (because mental health is not really a thing in Syria) and now I feel like I desperately want him to stay in my life because I didn't do anything wrong, and I feel like my world is collapsing, and I know that I need to go to therapy and get treatment but I don't have any money, therapy is very expensive here and I don't know how to cope anymore, I truly saw something in him , and I feel like shit for losing him as a friend and as a lover , I didn't want things to go that way at all , and I don't know what to do.",1715932579.0,False,1,0,Unfair_Solution_2317,None,1ctzrvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ctzrvj/how_can_i_help_myself/
4,I need help,Last summer I started seeing a therapist and a doctor I love my therapist but the person that actually prescribed  me meds is very intimidating I mentioned in one of our 15 minute sessions that I thought I had bpd and he asked me a couple questions about if I have anger outburst to which I replied no and he said then you dont have bpd. Well a few weeks ago I came across something called quiet bpd and it fit me to a t stuff that i havent told anybody about and i want to bring it up to him tomorrow but i dont know how without him thinking that I'm self diagnosing. Please give me ideas on how to talk to him about it. Thankyou!,1594086889.0,False,2,4,bluehairedmommyof1,None,hmlge2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/hmlge2/i_need_help/
5,Lithium,"Hey everyone, I have recently been prescribed lithium to help with my mood regulation and I feel like some other people in here must have at least been on it at some point. 

So it has been helping me with my mood swings, and it’s been even helping me sleep for some reason, so I don’t want to come off it. But my face looks like it did when I was 12. Pimply as hell. My hair is finally growing back from a chemo treatment I ended in the beginning of January (not cancer) and I’m starting to lose some of the weight I had gained in the past horrible year, but over all I feel like I look like garbage all the time. 

So my question is, did anyone else who broke out after using lithium wear makeup still? I have an entire makeup room set up, but have been scared to use anything Incase it makes it worse. Help me please ❤️",1553436875.0,False,5,10,LegendaryCatfish,None,b4wron,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/b4wron/lithium/
6,I can’t believe I’m doing this,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicide, self harm and all that bad mental health stuff. (Sorry if I did that wrong). 

Hi redditors. I’ve never posted before. Thanks for reading and responding if you choose to do so. I’m sorry if the following triggers you or if you are struggling with the same brand of futile terrible I am. 

I’m at a point in my life where I’ve struggled so much and for so long that I’m just exhausted. I’m not angry or bitter or sad anymore; I just want it to be over. I’m tired of being confused all the time, completely disconnected from this thing called ‘life’ everyone seems to be switched into. I’m tired of being panicky and depressed and anxious all at the same time, almost all the time. Im tired of being at the mercy of my insane mood swings where I'm experiencing overlapping interchanges of all these conflicting emotions all day long. I'm tired of crying so often that it feels like my brain is going to explode in my own head and my eyes will just cease to function properly. I’m tired of being dismissed when I say I’m unwell (psychiatrist included) because ‘I’m doing so well’ - I don’t even know what this means or how you could conclude that from someone whose chronically unemployed, can’t finish uni or even leave the house or make eye contact with people without panicking. I feel like an absolute rotting turd most of the time despite what I’m putting out there (which feels to me like a shit show but to other people for some reasons seems completely normal).

People seem to consistently make this crazy assumption that I’m ‘intelligent and capable’ for some reason and therefore I don’t need help. They couldn’t be more wrong. I can’t accomplish basic tasks because I’m emotionally all over the place all the time and trying to do basic human things like pick what to wear in the morning sends me into shame spirals, suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I have no control over my emotions or impulses, I’m constantly floating away from my body and nothing feels real. I’m incapable of accepting any kind of affection or goodwill from others without completely self destructing and I don’t want to burden others so my relationships are nonexistent. 

I’ve dealt with thoughts, feelings, urges and attempts of suicide my entire life. Its pretty much always been a terrifying backup in the back of my mind ever since I can remember as a safety plan to escape the torture of life where I can always feel exactly how close I am to death. Some days feel a magnetism to it but a strong resolve to resist. Other days, I’m basically hanging on by a thread and not telling anyone so they don’t come and take me from my home against my will again. 

I just want the freedom to be able to make this decision on my own. I did not give consent to be born, and I don’t think it’s ethical to keep someone alive against their will when they are suffering chronically and there isn’t a solution. 

I just feel like there’s no way out. I don’t respond to medications and suffer from such severe side effects that my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe any more drugs. My old psychiatrist had me on 5 different meds and I was equally bad, maybe worse, but in a completely different way. Those who have had adverse reactions to medications will understand this. Being mentally ill or being on psychiatric medication is like choosing if you want death by drowning or self-immolation.

I do DBT group therapy, see a psychologist and psychiatrist but I still feel like absolute shit. Everyone seems to be going through the motions, ticking all the boxes, but I just feel like nothing has really shifted. No amount of bandaids is going to help me when I’m walking around absolutely raw with no fucking skin on my body. It’s excruciating to just be alive but because it’s not visible, and it’s a slow death, nobody cares and the state ‘has a responsibility’ to keep you alive. In my experience, everyone is all sad when someone kills them selves, but also calls them selfish because they’ve left so much pain in their wake. Being passed around a mental health care system that can’t really help you, is insanely expensive and practically useless makes me miss the days when I didn’t seek help, suffered in silence but could at least hold on to the hope that there was a possibility of getting better if I had the right help. Now I know that’s not even an option. 

I’m just doomed to relive this cycle of extreme pain, possible suicide, absurdity, exhaustion, sheer terror, panic attacks, extreme mood swings, paranoia, catatonia, confusion, dissociation, spontaneous stuttering, paralysis and fatigue, where I can’t seem to express myself clearly no matter how hard I try or connect with other people. 

I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop the anxiety, panic, negativity, paranoia and depression from seeping in. I fear my emotions, I fear my thoughts and the things in life I can’t control that are going to hurt me so I just live in a constant state of sheer paralysis, frozen in fear and bracing myself for impact.

The only thing that’s keeping me alive is the thought that my sister will have to deal with the trauma of my suicide. But it also seems like it should be unethical to keep a person in this much chronic pain alive. I can feel my body deteriorating, my mind is basically scrambled eggs at this point, and I feel like I’m at the mercy of an emotionally handicapped body that I have zero control over. I keep harming myself and those around me. I just want to die with a little bit of dignity but there doesn’t seem to be a way out.

Life seems to be one trauma after the next, and continued reluctant attempts to help myself that only end up in things getting worse. I was not made for this world. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Please let me go. I don’t want to hurt anyone but I’m so tired now. Please tell me this will all be over soon.",1596368916.0,False,10,7,sarahthehumanperson,None,i2asxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/i2asxt/i_cant_believe_im_doing_this/
7,I hate everything about BPD,"I’ve struggled with addiction and self harming for dopamine highs for so long, now that I’ve quit both for a year now, nothing gives me pleasure. I find joy in absolutely nothing. The psychiatrists just gives me adderal, clonazepam, and ketamine...really?! You’re just slowing down the process of my brain appreciating normal dopamine levels, I’m confused, frustrated, angry, but mostly sad. I want to enjoy my children, movies, sleeping in late, going on walks. The “flatness” of emotion is unbearable and I don’t know how much longer I can handle it. 😒😔",1518729884.0,False,6,1,llvllindy,None,7xtouj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/7xtouj/i_hate_everything_about_bpd/
