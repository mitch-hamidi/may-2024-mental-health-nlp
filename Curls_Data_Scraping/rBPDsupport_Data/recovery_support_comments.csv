0,"You can't beat BPD or recover from it. It's a life-long disorder. You can manage your symptoms, develop better coping strategies and understanding of your thoughts/actions/behaviours. You can have a good life, and develop a version of yourself that accepts the traits of this disorder alongside the other traits that make you uniquely you.

Insight is key, and it seems you have that in abundance.",BettySwollocks45,193wd7a

“Borderline Personality Disorder Demystified - An Essential Guide for Understanding and Living With BPD” by Robert O Friedel MD

The copy I have is from 2004, and it’s still worth reading but I’d see if there’s a newer version. The chapter “Research: The Ultimate Reason for Hope” is undoubtedly out of date in terms of the specific medications listed and studies cited. The hope is still good though, no expiration there.",PurpleAntifreeze,1bleos0

Looking at people's face book can be compelling 
Plenty of people post wonderful stuff on line 

Everyone has problems. Every relationship is hard. Thst is a given

1,"I love you for sharing this. I am going through a variation of these kinds of feeings too within my own way. You can feel free to read my past posts  on reddit in general  to see for yourself lol its not easy. 

Its very difficult, and you just did something that like proves you’re gonna be okay. Like the fact you are  able to put this in words and talk it through and the fact that you’re getting sober etc. That’s something to be really proud of!!!! I am proud of you OP! 

Other people’s dynamics especially when they are seemingly the dynamic that we wish we had can be challenging and gut wrenching. Like the grass really does  always look greener.  But just remember that you matter. And that you have a life you’re going to have to live for however long you got. And that you deserve a full content life. IDk where you are at but Please consider picking up a hobby. I picked up journaling becasue I wanted to keep writing about my feelings and then that grew to me wanting to go back to drawing. And then that turned to me wanting to make comics again. And then  I felt TEN MILLION times less insecure and alone when I finally met other people in meatspace to talk to who also have similar interests. If you spend alot if time on Reddit. maybe look up if there is a reddit for your city and try seeing if there’s any safe events you could attend to meet local people. And with that in mind — its tough, I’ve been rejected by potential friends, current friends,  and potential community ALOT. But also found a few. But you just keep trying because there are people who will listen and who want to see you do well.",Successful-Bad-9672,1bteb6r
2,"You dodged a bullet, my friend. My ex was similar in how your ex was. I got diagnosed with bpd in the relationship, and he basically always made me out to be the problem. I did all this work to fix myself in a relationship that made me feel like he was doing me a favor by being with me. Saying that mentally ill people are undesirable and weak. He had inferiority and mommy issues he refused to see.

If you're doing better because you left him. It's his loss and not yours. You're not the problem he is. He  should've been there, encouraging you to better yourself. 

My husband is the complete opposite of my ex because he comes from a family who has struggled with mental illness and has seen how people have treated them horribly. He is compassionate, always willing to listen, and he knows when he is out of line. He's encouraging and always tells me how proud he is of me.


Your ex is trash. You, my sweetie, are a fighter, and I applaud you for how far you've come into your recovery. My husband is a recovering addict himself, and he's doing so good. Be proud of yourself. Someone out there is gonna find you and treasure you because you did the work to get yourself together. Be proud of that.",InkBlotArt,1bteb6r
3,"Hey I’ve been exactly where you are. My BPD was so severely attached to my abusive ex boyfriend. After I left the relationship the second time he did the same. 

TRIGGER WARNING : DIRECT MESSAGE 

“Hopeless friendless broke no school no job, a family that hates you, a guilt that that kills you, no inherent value that you see yourself causing you to f*** the most trash and ugly people cause that’s the best you can do” 

I had just been disowned by my family after my first attempt (he broke up with me 2 weeks after my attempt cause I was “asking for too much”, AKA general reassurance cause he was out with the girl he had been cheating on me with throughout the relationship). 
Favourite people are hard to deal with cause detaching from them is irrational. He continued to be my fp until I returned to my original city and met with him again. I had just gotten out of another relationship and was insanely low so reached out. Seeing him again sealed it for me. 
Growing into a person he didn’t recognize confirmed that he was in my past forever. When we met I was afraid I would regress into the patterns I held before but seeing that he had not changed in the slightest (even getting worse in areas) confirmed that no, I can’t and refuse be treated that was again. 
This being said I was the exact same as you. He had a new gf like 2 weeks after me and was plastering her everywhere (not to mention the more personal, not NSFW, photos of them just being happy together he would send me directly on a regular basis). It hurt cause why could they be happy but we couldn’t. Let me promise you they are not happy. And if they are they won’t be long term unless this guy is the best actor on the planet. I feel like it’s common knowledge now that people cannot hid who they are for prolonged periods of time without slipping up. Think of how poorly he treated you, she will almost definitely experience the same at some level. 

Looking to the future, finding a healthy FP to replace this one so that you can move past his behaviour. Not looking for a replacement but finding someone positive to focus your energy on is definitely the way to go. 
I took a hiatus from dating after my whole experience with that EX which is what worked for me, looking at what exactly I gravitated towards in past relationships and what to avoid but most importantly looking at how I acted in the relationship which I could improve upon. 

Favourite people are fun to have when it picks the right person. My current partner is my favourite person in the whole world but compared to past favourite people, he’s actually helping me become who I want to be indirectly. Positive influences are so undervalued.",Gooseteeth9039,1bteb6r
4,"I’m proud of you for continuing with your sobriety! 

530 days is amazing, just absolutely amazing! 

I’m in active addiction, and I very much understand the drive to be sober as well as the drive to use. 

I have a person that in my life. He constantly invalidates how I feel, and what I think. I’ve been trying so hard to let it go, but I know I’m going to lose my cool and pick a fight with him.

We have our own issues with BPD and any co-occurring disorders/diseases. We do not want, nor should we tolerate their actions, or words.",Jolly-Pipe7579,1bteb6r
0,"First, maybe see how it goes expressing to your therapist how these issues have impacted you if you feel comfortable. You never know. It could lead to the best turnaround if she is attentive and a good therapist. Alternatively, there's no harm in shopping around for another. I've just gone through this process out of necessity as my current therapist is retiring, and while it is time-consuming and an energy drain, it's worth it. I may be coming out on top with an even better therapist this time! Hopefully, that'll happen for you, too! I mean, that's the point, right? And I happen to think it takes a strong person to say ""I am in therapy/have a decent therapist but it can be better and I want more for myself so I'm gonna keep looking until I find the best possible fit for me."" It means you're serious about the work, and I think it would be received well by prospective therapists as well.

0,">I’ve been in recovery for six years but still live with the impulse to self harm most days.

That's impressive. Please remember relapse is part of recovery, and you're someone who had been in recovery for 6 years. With all the stress and change lately, it must be hard to have those thoughts daily, and I'm sorry it's making you notice feelings of shame at all. Not a nice feeling :(

Fact is self harm is very common, especially among people with mental illness like BPD, and that it had a purpose - after self harm you noticed feeling much more stable. So one question is what else helps you feel stable? If you notice that feeling again, what's something you would try before cutting yourself with a shaving razor?",TranZeitgeist,fu7w67

12,"You did awesome. Sometimes it's not about retaliation, it's about having enough self-respect to represent your views in a way that honors your personal beliefs about communication, even if it won't be heard in that context.

I feel like that's a part of DBT (I don't know if it's in CBT as well) that all people could use. And I feel like that's a part of DBT that's so hard to come to grips with. It's like I used to ask myself, why *shouldn't* I defend myself with tooth and nail, since I can? Since I'm equipped to really tear someone apart, if I feel like they are tearing me apart? At the end of the day, though, it's really more about avoiding escalation for your own sake. Avoiding that battle, because it isn't as important as how *you* feel later when you're washing the dishes. Or showering. That battle will only stay with you for the long run if you let yourself activate those angry, bitter emotions.

Until I did DBT, I never really understood that saying sorry is more for your personal benefit than anyone else's. It's not a bargaining chip, it's a way to ask for forgiveness that acknowledges that you made a mistake, so you can honor your personal views and admit that mistake is not part of them. And I think being gentle with your arguments, even on an anonymous public form, comes from a similar philosophy.",AnnieBananny,3g17fn
0,"So far it seems like you are doing a good job on not trying to hurt him because he is hurting you. Right now give yourself space from him and let him make his choice and learn to radically accept his choice. (Radical acceptance skill in DBT) Take the time right now to self soothe in healthy ways, get stuff situated with your therapist, ask her for skills and resources to get through it, and journal your feelings rather than taking them out on you or him. Create a healthy boundary with him by telling him that there’s no back and forth with his choice because it hurts you. He needs to take a few days and make it. He is either with you and can’t go back on it within a short period of time or he is not with you and doesn’t keep hurting you like this. You deserve the peace with or without him.

Everyone is different and things generally feel like tidal waves crashing in around you when you first get your diagnosis. There are plenty of 'recovery' therapies and it can be completely manageable even if it never goes away. It is and will be okay. You are still the same person you were before your diagnosis. You are beautiful, amazing, and worthy of love. It sounds like your ex was quite toxic and made you feel worse about yourself through his behavior, which in turn makes your symptoms much worse. He is not worth the time or effort if that is the type of person he is. I have been there, it is probably better to just walk away. My best advise to you is to take some time away from dating anyone. Concentrate on yourself for a while. Take a yoga class, start painting, find something you love that makes you happy. Get into therapy and build yourself up as a person.

1,"Are you seeing a therapist? I cant stress enough how important it is to have a network of people that support and understand you, for everyone, but especially imperative for those w of us w bpd- & a therapist is a very good start (and foundation). Make sure you get a decent one, there are shitty therapists, and they will just make things worse. Certain insurance policies/EAPs will cover therapy. 

I personally cannot manage without a therapist. I spiral & sabotage much more severely without one. Your situation is completely common in those w bpd. If the person doesnt know you have bpd, id def tell them. It is very difficult for people w/o it to understand fully, but if they care for you, theyll look into it & it will help explain a lot of behaviors for them. 

As for the “this isnt going to stop”, bpd is not something you have to suffer w your entire life, treatment and recovery is completely possible, and if you get a therapist and they tell you otherwise, get another. Its pretty well known now that recovery from bpd is very realistic and should be the goal in therapy.",veyondalolo,huivqi
2,"I understand completely. Sometimes you just have to swallow the feeling and just try to just realize that we don't think how normal people do. I can drive myself insane when people don't answer me or I think they're ignoring me. But I tell myself to give them some hours or a day or so to get back to me before I try to make contact again. And hey, everyone is different. I'm not sure if you've disclosed your BPD to this person but hopefully they can understand you. It does get easier by the way, it just takes some introspection. I try to put myself in the minds and bodies of my friends, (the very very few I have left), and understand what my behavior looks like from the outside. Sometimes it helps me adjust and other times it makes me feel like I'm crazy. But just know you're not a bad person, you just feel things extremely powerfully. Im 25M and when i feel like things are getting bad for me I try to isolate myself for a couple days and just do things that make me happy, like cooking or going to the gym or even playing some videos games. Try reaching out to that person and apologize and then maybe take a day or 2 for yourself?

Everyone's mental health is different, and everyone's recovery is different. You may not want to rule anything out until you can see how far you can get in recovery.

I've had to accept that my life is going to proceed at a slower pace than other's simply because I have this enormous thing to deal with as well. Although I'm younger than you (25) I've also thought about having kids in the future and when I would like to do that. I recently broke up with my LT boyfriend and that felt like a massive step back in regards to how I thought my life should proceed.

Right now recovery is my top priority. I finally moved out my mother's house a year ago. I'm at university. I have not worked for years because of BPD. I'll be starting an 18 month MBT course in the new year. 

I'm just about holding it together right now, with a fuck load of support.

What I'm trying to say is that life is a ladder. We cannot just jump straight to the top, even if we can just about see it from where we are now. We have to take each step at a time, at our own pace, while constantly checking to make sure it's the right step.

4,"Obviously I wouldn't dream of having any kids in my current financial situation - I'm well aware that kids are expensive. Sorting out finances is just one of the things that would be necessary before I'd consider having children. Money isn't the only issue. 

I was mostly just venting my thoughts and was wondering if anyone had similar ones or something like that. ",highshine,3uxtbg

0,"Hey. I’m in the U.K. so can’t help with therapists in your area etc, but the ones you’ve seen sound appalling, and shouldn’t be practising. 

I have various personality disorders and PTSD, and yes, I probably will be on medication for the rest of my life (I’m 34 now and I started when I was 16). To be honest, I can’t even imagine life without them. They make me better. Why would I stop taking something that makes me better? Work on removing that medication stigma, and try to accept that medication can be a good thing.

Everyone is having a horrible time at the moment, and I think it’s especially hard for those of us with mental illness to endure. We’re lonely, claustrophobic, anxious, and some of our coping strategies have been removed. It’s natural that you’re feeling extra poorly at the moment. Let yourself accept that things are going to be really rubbish for a little while, but don’t forget that this will end. And you will have good days again.

I was very lucky around six or seven years ago and was offered ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy), and it changed my life. I still struggle, of course. I bloody posted here last week because I cut myself! It was the first time in two years, though, and of course I’m struggling with the lockdown like everyone else. But on the whole, it has allowed my recovery. It’s very peculiar because it forces you to lean into your trauma and accept it, rather than fight it (which is what we’ve spent all our lives doing, right?). But it works. There’s also a programme here called STEPPS which is used for those with PDs who aren’t as far into their recovery. Have a look into both these therapies/programmes and see if someone near you might offer them (when lockdown is over).

Please take care of yourself.",Unusualbellows,fxe0xe

Growing up and before getting diagnosed with my own stuff, I really enjoyed researching the shit out of things that interested me. Mental health being one of them. I knew something was up with me very early on and THANK GOODNESS for the internet because before all this met neutrality went down and internet life was actually bearable and relatively “fresh”, I was able to explore my mind and wackiness through research and actually allowing myself to feel and think the things I did. I just didn’t tell anyone. I’d read, watch videos, and ask google more and more to kinda get a sense of what I was going through, for my own peace of mind... because if I at least understood and accepted what I was going through, than that’s okay and enough. Because no one actually knows what we’re thinking or feeling unless we physically and vocally do so.. 

It became my own sacred secret. And that was okay and is okay for me because I also learned fairly quickly that the human condition alone is a very complex one, let alone one that is naturally made with an imbalance (which is also okay), so I’d just have to make sure that I was keeping it in check the best way that I could without letting fear, shame or guilt get in the way. 

Granted, that’s a bit harder now with having to grow up and transition to full blown adulthood. But it’s a great concept and sort of “light” to look to. You are who you are because that’s how youre biologically made. But you get to decide how you treat yourself and how you want to show up in your life, day to day. Even if it’s something unique each day. Just as long as you  work towards building a balance, a blue print to how you yourself need to survive and thrive. 

That includes letting go and REALLY not giving a fuck about what people think about you. Do what’s right for you so long it doesn’t hurt anyone or offend anyone. 

Honor yourself. Love yourself with your flaws and all. Because at the time of death that is all we have, ourselves. 

You have FULL reign over your body. Over your mind. Over your heart. Just because it’s been a tough fight, doesn’t mean you’re going to lose. 

Idk if you watch Naruto or anime at all, but if there’s one think I’ve gotten so far from Naruto is that each day, each moment brings a new challenge. Whether it be mental, physical or spiritual. Whether we’re ready or not, equipped enough or not. The important part is to show up and fight. Give your best and your all, regardless if you win or lose. 

Life is a win/lose game. It’s a matter of what we learn from it and how we use it to keep going. Because dude, as crazy as some days may feel living with this, we also experience some pretty dope amazing things! That wouldn’t be the same if we were normal! 

Kinda like Hannah Montana too 😂 best of both worlds! 

Make the most out of it love! Even if it hurts like fucking hell sometimes. It’s okay. We don’t like a lot of thing, but we still get through it because we have to. 

Don’t be afraid or ashamed. You’re you and you are trying! And that is enough!

Also, don’t give up on trying to find a good match in terms of healthcare and therapy. I’ve yet to find a good match, and even though it’s made things relatively worse in some aspects, I don’t wanna give up. And you shouldn’t either. You deserve to live a full life.",betsyletsy,fxe0xe
