6,Just got diagnosed.,"Hey guys. (Sorry for confusion I‚Äôm new here:))
I (24F) am in DBT outpatient treatment. Just finished 3 weeks of the PHP program. And now on IOP. Which is just 3 days a week for 3 hours a day. The PHP program was 9am-3pm Monday through Friday which I felt like I had a purpose and I was doing something. 
Anyways I guess what I need to let you all know is I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD when I was 16-17 after that went down a slippery slope of drugs (literally all of them) until I did acid at 20... and  thought I lost my freaking MIND lol (funny because having bpd you feel that way anyways) 
I always knew I was ‚Äúoff‚Äù or something. 
Fast forward 2 and a half years I was sober and fine.. so I thought. 
Here came the panic attacks, depression. Angry outbursts, quitting jobs, threatening to hurt myself. 
I knew I needed help or I was gonna go right back down the same bad road.
I found an (ACT) therapist that I‚Äôve been seeing every Monday give or take for almost 2 years.. I think . I‚Äôve also held down a job for a little over a year. At this job I had a breakdown that sent me to the doctors and that‚Äôs how I made it to the treatment center. I said all this to say now I‚Äôve been diagnosed with BPD. .. idk what to do with that. 
Idk who that is but that‚Äôs not me. 
I have a loving boyfriend that doesn‚Äôt deserve to deal with all these emotions.

7,So i was diagnosed then undiagnosed,"A team of professionals assessed me for the duration of my psych ward stay (3ish weeks) and came to agree that I have quiet BPD (among CPTSD, Anxiety & depression ofc).

I was then in treatment with a psychologist/case manager after discharge who later told me quiet BPD isnt diagnosable and assessed that I dont in fact have BPD because apparently I'm not ""violent"" enough. 

But in later sessions he would go on to say things like ""thats very common in people with bpd"" & such, making me think that he might now believe i have BPD.

10,How do you handle conflicting diagnoses from different doctors?,"Ugh I've always thought my psychiatrist was kind of shit, he apparently worships Reagan and only spends like 10 minutes a session with me and keeps asking me if I'm religious and when am I going back to church??? (Left the church years ago having been raised in it and never looked back)

I hate that he doesn't advertise himself as Christian focused but does this to his patients. Anyway... my lovely psychiatrist left and I was handed over to a new one in her office a long time ago. And I feel too over it to care. He gives me my meds, I want to take them at this dose, he agrees whatever. 


But a legitimate psychologist (my therapist) who I find to be very sane, thoughtful, caring, and intelligent has recently diagnosed me with Borderline. I brought this to my psychiatrist of 10ish years and was met with the standard, ""you dont have that, those patients are very hard to deal with, you're very easy to deal with, you dont want that."" I think it's relevant that I'm relatively quiet, with high social anxiety, avoidant, and a  high-functioning variant of Borderline, meaning I can hold a steady full-time office job and a relationship of a couple years. But it's the first in my life longer than 3 months where he isn't abusive. And it really only started being functional after I restarted medications, which I've quit cold turkey several times in my life during depressive episodes.

Ok, first of all, as if I chose to have this disorder. Second, does having BPD necessitate breaking down in front of the psychiatrist and telling him to fucking hurt himself or something?? Does it necessitate a history of alcoholism or inpatient or cutting?  Has he spent more than ten minutes with me in a session in this whole year? Did he give any thought to the diagnosis other than to say ""well, I don't want to deal with another one, so I'm going to deny that's even possible and hope things stay the same""

Like wtf man is it because you think I have a dumb female therapist, Mr. Christian Republican know-it-all? She is a licensed psychologist who has been practicing for decades and has also treated borderlines before. Ofc, he didn't care to find that out, just hurried me out of his virtual office. Fucking making bank off being lazy and careless with patients like me. 

So idk if it's even a conflicting diagnosis, because he seemed not to even look into it or even want to acknowledge it. But my therapist has diagnosed me and we started going through DBT. 

I want to know if any of you have dealt with having your reality questioned by doctors, and how common it really is to be misdiagnosed with BPD, maybe if you really had something else going on. 

I've only heard that it's common to be misdiagnosed with bipolar, but in my case my mood swings are very clearly shorter and attributed to triggering events, I'm def not bipolar. My past diagnoses are complex PTSD, GAD, panic disorder with OCD features, and some mild depressive episodes. 

Anyway, what are your experiences with misdiagnoses?

12,Recently diagnosed,"So I was recently diagnosed with bpd and I‚Äôm having a real tough time dealing with it. 

I used to be a really social person who loved hanging out with others, and since I go to a boarding school there‚Äôs always a way to socialise with others, but the past two weeks after getting my diagnose I‚Äôve been isolating myself from literally everyone except my fp. I‚Äôve been out of my room a total of 5 hours these past 37 hours, and I feel like absolute shite at the same time as I feel empty and nothingness.

I also have trouble with my fp, as they have their own mental illness and struggle with dealing with my bpd. Sometimes when we argue they say they don‚Äôt deserve being treated *this* way and leave me for a couple of hours, which is the absolute worst thing because of my fear of abandonment. When they come back they act like nothing happened, but I still think they hate me and are gonna leave me completely this time. It is absolutely exhausting every time they walk out, and even though I understand that they walk out because I‚Äôm being too much and I‚Äôve told them so, they are so absolute cold when they‚Äôre annoyed. I don‚Äôt understand how to deal with having an fp, let alone one without their own mental issues.

16,How common is BPD misdiagnosed? Asking because I was diagnosed a few years back and do not think it was correct,"Hello everyone, 

I am not sure how common my story is, but I think it's more common than I would think.

I was a problem child for a lot of my childhood in school, but began to improve in middle school. I was very bad with people all my life and everyone who meets me ends up disliking me (this is not an exaggeration, this is unfortunately quite literally the case). This caused me to be a very homebound child and I grew very, very attached to my family. I was academically rather successful in HS, but socially the same. College was an unmitigated disaster for me and at the urging of someone I ""saw someone"". The last time I was evaluated was for autism and ADHD in elementary school and was given a clean bill of health, so to speak.

After two days of talking to someone, the psychiatrist said she believed I had BPD. I heard of the condition before, but I was taken aback and after several sessions asked if she stood by her assessment and she said yes. After our sessions ended (I saw her in secret), that was kind of it.

I began reading about BPD more and more and the more I read, the less I saw myself in the condition. Yes, I have huge issues with impulse control and have pretty dire self inflicted issues with my health. I am very clingy to people because of the fact everyone I have ever known has run away from me. I have a limited sense of self, to a certain extent, and have huge problems being alone without anyone with me. 

But otherwise, it just doesnt click all that much. I am not suicidal, I am not driven to make rash sudden decisions that screw up my life, I am not the kind of person who would quit a job just because I want to curse out my boss (I am pretty good at holding my tongue when there is something in it for me). I wouldn't say I have emotional dysregulation. 

This happened a few years ago, and I havent followed up on it, but the problems in my life havent gone away. 

I figure that I have to wrestle with whether or not I was misdiagnosed to make progress on that front. Is it a thing to be misdiagnosed? Is this a condition like ADHD, where it's over applied? I am a guy, if it makes any difference.

18,I just got diagnosed yesterday after thinking maybe I‚Äôm schizophrenic (I see things) and I dont know what to think,"Honestly, I have a lot of anger followed quickly by guilt.

The guilt because I‚Äôm 31 and on top of self treating my anxiety/depression with alcohol until I was 29, I also had undiagnosed PTSD. I feel terribly about what I have done to people in my life. I‚Äôm so fucking sorry - I didnt know what was actually happening. I told myself too many stories about people and then let my emotions run with it. I‚Äôve always been terrified of effecting people negatively because of these instances and I feel like a complete and utter dick.

Anger because I knew my family fucked me up. I am no contact since 2019 April and they‚Äôre probably sitting there going ‚ÄòKelly is crazy‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòWhat happened that now she doesnt want anything to do with us?‚Äô (I used my original name. Legally, Kelly is not my name anymore so I feel okay calling myself that through my family‚Äôs eyes on reddit)

They fucking did this to me by not teaching me how to be human and abused me every day.

Fucking dicks.

They got what they raised: a person full of terror with the ability to have a sharp tongue. Panther in a cage.

I really need to do more research. My therapist sent me a list of books but I havent checked on it yet.

I feel like I‚Äôm still in shock over the diagnosis.

Honestly, I debated hard over this possibility but I didnt know BPD also came with hallucinations. I was hoping schizophrenic because then I wouldnt have to do SO much work on my thoughts and brain.

Not like I‚Äôm not willing to put in the work, I just feel like I‚Äôve been fighting for so long. I was hoping for a period of rest.

I also just started seeing someone and I‚Äôm scared of ruining a part of their life. The part where I was in it.

At least I‚Äôm aware of why I have these intrusively compulsive thoughts and I truly am working on myself. 

I just want some rest from all of this. Im so tired. It‚Äôs hard enough staying sober and constantly rewriting my brain but at least this gives me something to be aware of as I try to fix myself.

I have to remember that emotions are hard but regulation can be learnt. Every one of my internal goals are reachable. After years of practice, it will get better.

He always accused me of being negative, manipulative, only seeing my perspective, over emotional, crazy, always thinking im right. He cheated on me and lied alot and was disrespectful. So i always saw his problems as much more severe. I didnt agree with his accusations besides being over emotional and sensitive. But now that ive been diagnosed ive been reading articles, looking into resources, and now  perspectives of boyfriends with BPD girlfriends, I see how he could see me that way.....

So, i just sent him a really long text explaining everything i now see, saying how although i had good intentions my actions came across negativley( i just got diagnosed about a week before the break up, so alot of this is just coming to realization). I said at the beginning of the text i wasnt sending it in hopes of being back together or reciving a response from him, but he didnt respond. And im starting to see just how severe my disorder is... cuz now im crying, wishing i never opened up to him and sent it, cus i thought he would at least aknowlege that I am realizing everything. And i know this is my BPD speaking... cuz i shouldnt care if he responds or not. Im acting out of emotions right now and assuming he must hate me or think im crazy or doesnt want anything to do with me. 

Needless to say, this realization is making me feel hopeless. I didnt realize how bad i was until now. I thought i was mild and a year of therapy could fix it. Is recovery likely?? Reading others posts make me feel like ill never get better.

22,Not officially diagnosed but he [37 yo] thinks he can get away with anything by blaming it on my [28 yo] BPD.,"First of all, I wasn't officially diagnosed. However, my then financ√©, now husband, decided to tell me that I am BPD 5 months ago, 3 months before our wedding. I took it with a grain of salt at first then did my homework and realized that I do have some of the traits and told him that I don't want us to get married until I seek help and get an official, professional diagnosis since I want to know how to handle this if I'm BPD and don't want to bring kids to this world without knowing what to do. I truly meant what I said and now I regret not going with how I felt. He told me there's no way this would affect our relationship and that he'll always love and support me bla bla bla. 

We were planning for an overseas wedding so we'd celebrate with our families and then COVID-19 hit our jobs, wedding and honeymoon plans hard in the face. Fast forward to the last month and a half when problems kicked in with his jealous mother who thought I'm taking her son away. She made up things, called me a demon and her son a liar to get away with what she said and did and to make herself look better in front of her daughter, whom she tells everything. She simply likes to play martyr and must always be the victim of all circumstances. Even when we tried to explain to her that we both lost our jobs, are stuck abroad, and are going through many uncertainties and we've just been married for only one month, her reply was: ""So? I'm very tired too!"". He threatened to divorce me if I don't fix my relationship with his mother. And I decided to call her just because we were in the middle of a train station in a city that I'm not familiar with that's full of harassers. When I called her she started shouting and screaming at me. He heard her and later on denied that she even screamed and told me that I'm just ""oversensitive"" and then after another fight between us he admitted that she did scream at me, lied, and that she had insecurities.

I'm not an angel, no one is. But at least I'm fucking fair and admit it when I'm an asshole. I don't pretend to be an angel and I told him when we first met not to expect me to lay on the ground and get beaten, I'll always fend myself. 

We agreed not to bottle things up and to express how we feel when we feel like it. He often disappoints me, and when I express that to him he starts to tell me that it's because of my illness (me being BPD). I lose it when he says that because he never admits that he's at fault. He starts telling me that I'm ""splitting"" on him and would point at me from afar in a very degrading way signaling that I'm crazy, ""demonic"" and proceeds to say that this is why I don't have friends. 

Fact is, I was very popular in school and uni but always preferred to stay alone and away from people. I enjoy things that most of the people in my circles in uni and school didn't enjoy. He knows that and told me that he's the same and loved me for it. He knows everything about my life before I met him because I've let him in and I trusted him with information, and yet he chooses to say that ""people stay away from me for a reason"". What a douchebag thing to say. I lose it when he twists the truth to make me look like I'm crazy and he's sane and ""nice"". He often calls me ""mean"" and yes I will be mean when I feel threatened and when I'm being emotionally abused. Yes I feel like shit after I verbally abuse him when he calls me crazy and I apologize, but he never apologizes for the emotional abuse. NEVER sees what he did wrong and just blames my reactions on my BPD. 

We're both unemployed because of his carelessness and irresponsible behavior, both far from home and he thinks that he can get away with everything he says and does by blaming it on my BPD. I feel horrible that the only person I trusted and shared everything with happens to be the one who hurts me the most.

23,Is it wrong if i identify with BPD even if i didn't get diagnosed with it? i genuinely feel like i have BPD," 

In 2017 i got a psych assessment when i was barely 18 years old, they concluded i had OCD withNPD/BPD traits, they decided to not diagnose me with BPD/NPD because of my level of impairment. I however know that i have BPD because of the symptoms i have displayed since i was a kid and primarily since i was 17, which is the age where it became gradually worse, and now at age 21 has reached a tipping point.

i Have a childhood diagnosis of Intellectual Disability, and recently (yesterday) they brought up the idea of possible Autism Spectrum Disorder, and many times have said they didn't think i had BPD, however i am still reluctant to accept the idea i don't have a personality disorder.

Over the course of 3 years and self diagnosis, BPD has been the core of my identity. I have felt humiliated and excessively obsessive when i tell people i only have ''traits'' as i feel it severely invalidates my trauma and the pain i face everyday.

I have told people online/offline that i have BPD, and i seem embedded in my rigid delusion that i genuinely have this disorder, I feel as if the psychiatric system has let me down and has not provided accurate results because i am a male, and because of my disability. I was referred to a dual disability/mental health hospital as an outpatient for a 2nd assessment and will receive a diagnosis in 2 weeks, however BPD still seems unlikely to them.

The reason i relate to BPD so much is because of the behaviors i have, i can relate to ''BPD feels like having 3rd degree burns'', and i basically struggle with substance abuse, self harm, anger which is often irrational, and i don't know who or what i am as a person, and i have severe abandonment issues, i also experience extreme irritability over the smallest of things and will split on someone, from all good to all bad, rejection sensitivity, getting attached to people and wanting to marry them after a day, i've also struggled with thoughts of violence, homicide, arson, and grandiose beliefs. You can see my comment history and outbursts on reddit.

My psychiatrist told me that this time i will receive accurate results, and that he and his other 3 colleagues who are psychiatrists are working extensively to give me the diagnosis they see fitting",1588650131.0,False,0,2,babyboi1998,None,gdqhxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gdqhxy/is_it_wrong_if_i_identify_with_bpd_even_if_i/
24,It helps knowing I'm not alone on here,"Hello, I recently found the sub but I've never posted. 
     I have never been formally diagnosed with any personality or mood disorder but ive been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 
    
Also from what I've found on those sub is that it might be really difficult getting diagnosed. 

I know myself to blow up at people when I feel ignored, inadequate or when I feel abandoned. I always end up blowing up at the wrong people, even people who love me like family. 

I don't know why I get so upset and enraged. I always know it's wrong and that I need to stop because I always say the worst possible disgusting things or do things I absolutely will regret later.  

Even when people are trying to help me or show me tough love I just always get unreasonably upset.  

I feel like I've always been too much for people or never enough which has caused me to do things like multiple one night stands, do extremely impulsive things like spend money irresponsible which has led me to sleeping on a friend's couch. 

The only way I've managed to not have an episode or blow up is to walk away from things. It's really difficult. 

It does make me feel less alone reading what other people have to say about their experience on here but it also makes me hopeless because I have to deal with the outcome of trauma which wasn't my fault.

I was diagnosed at 24 with BPD and OCD. A few months ago I was diagnosed with ADHD. I‚Äôm also a divorced mom of 3 with some ‚ú® trauma ‚ú® Im a full time employee at a pellet mill. We make bio fuel. I operate big equipment and I can run the plant from a computer screen. Avid lover of hermit crabs and dogs. 

I am very passionate about supporting others with BPD since I have not had much support dealing with this illness. This illness is very stigmatized and misunderstood. There is a lot of misinformation that circulates around social media platforms. I really understand how hard it can be for us to get the help and support we need. 

So guys, I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm going to be as active as possible between parenting and working. I‚Äôll be taking time to familiarize myself with the mod responsibilities.

39,Struggling to Relate,"Reading some of the posts here I can‚Äôt help but feel a bit like the odd man out. I‚Äôve been formally diagnosed with BPD and managed to come to terms and acknowledge that yes, I might have a spooky scary personality disorder, but reading through this subreddit and what other people who share my diagnosis generally say I‚Äôm even starting to question the psychologist who diagnosed me. 

I wouldn‚Äôt describe myself as a jealous or possessive person, hell I could probably count the times I‚Äôve felt like that in a romantic context on one hand, which is also why I‚Äôm poly (by choice, and very happy with that). 
I still get intensely obsessed with new, shiny people and enter a stage of what I‚Äôd describe as lovestruck mania. That usually lasts for a few weeks before I either loose interest completely or calm down a little, but can be reignited as it happened with my current fp. 
In most relationships I‚Äôve been the more distanced one though exactly how I feel about someone can fluctuate heavily, but so far I‚Äôve always done the breaking up in the end (usually because I lost interest in someone or they did too many tiny but wrong things). I think I‚Äôm also fairly good at managing the whole fear of abandonment thing or rationalizing my feelings and restraining myself when a small comment makes me want to cry or scream. 
Of course I got plenty of other issues and while I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm good at relationships I‚Äôm generally reflected enough to force my feelings to conform to what I deem appropriate and minimize the harm for both people. Its a ton of work manually managing and weighing the rationality of every impulse and emotion though.

I guess my question is more a plea for validation because it would suck to go through the whole spiel of getting diagnosed again, but also if that genuinely sounds like another issue I‚Äôd like to at least know what people who do have bpd think of it. Maybe for added context I should mention that I‚Äôm a 20 year old trans guy (not on T yet though), and while I definitely did grow up with somewhat unstable attachments I‚Äôm really close with both my parents now and I know they tried their best (which I know isn‚Äôt the case for everyone, not trying to imply that).

46,Seeking Experiences: Life with Borderline Personality Disorder at 60+ Years,"Hello everyone,

I'm seeking insights and experiences from individuals aged 50 years or above who have been living with BPD.

Studies suggest that individuals with BPD face a high risk of suicide, which is reportedly 400 times higher than the general population. As someone diagnosed with BPD just over a year ago, I am currently facing challenges coping with the symptoms, and it has been a lifelong struggle for me. I know you understand it's exhausting. Initially diagnosed with chronic depression, I only learned about BPD recently.

I've observed that many individuals with BPD can often work ""normally,"" but I personally have struggled to maintain stable employment, with my longest job lasting just over two years. At present, I feel hopeless, unemployed, relying on savings, and uncertain about my future survival.

Given the impact BPD can have on individuals and their surroundings, I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who have reached the age of 60 and beyond while living with BPD. I want to learn about how you have coped with the challenges and emotional struggles that come with this disorder over the years. Can you share whether you feel life with BPD has been fulfilling and worth it? 

Thank you for sharing your experiences and providing guidance within the BPD Support community. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôve been struggling for a long time, and there were suspicions for BPD but now it is confirmed. To be honest it‚Äôs not that much of a surprise, I somehow knew I had it but was still hoping it‚Äôs not true.
My symptoms became more severe ever since I got into a relationship, including agressive outbursts, jealousy and a constant feeling of uneasiness. Blaming my partner constantly and feeling left out started to kill my relationship, and I didn‚Äôt want it to happen at all. Luckily my partner is patient and we somehow stayed together. I went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed and now I am on Brintellixn(vortioxetine) and Quetiapine.
Already after a few days I can feel my moods are more stable, but quetiapine does make me sleepy and very hard to wake up in the morning. At this moment I am only taking 25 mg of quetiapine at night but I am supposed to up the dose to 50mg a day (25 in the morning, 25 at night).

50,"How do I stop an addiction to a toxic person without breaking down entirely again?
","
I've always had relationships that made me go ""insane"", awfully high highs and low lows and never understood why am I like that, until I was finally diagnosed a few months ago.

However I'm still waiting for therapy and can't seem to manage myself properly.

I had a toxic relationship as always and it seemed to give me the highest highs so far - what he says, the sex we had, just overall his energy, it was all a huge fixation for me and the source of euphoria. When it went downhill I hit the lowest lows in my life and that's a big thing considering that I've been mentally ill since childhood and have other diagnoses as well.

I was usually good at not expressing my reactions towards other people, they just ruin me. So in this situation I have someone who's hurt me deeply and who has been  for the past months a source of basically anguish I would say.

However now he's back and acting all nice and I'm all euphoric again. Life makes sense and I feel alive and everything feels so good and easy. When he was gone it was all just dark and I felt either  like I don't exist or shouldn't exist.

I know it can't last and I'm gonna crash down so hard again. But I can't afford to have that happen again. My uni and work has suffered because of the breakdown I had over the first breakup and if that happens again I'm so so screwed. I don't have access to my psychiatrist as I'm in a foreign land and I'm waiting still for online therapy. I'm alone here and if I crash down I'm just alone in the void.

I'm so happy now but in the back of my mind  I know im doomed.

How do I untangle this without being on rock bottom again? I know we don't have a future I'm just hopelessly addicted.

58,I‚Äôve Been So Much Happier Lately,"I‚Äôve spent most of my life coping and making poor decisions for myself. I‚Äôve spent so many years wanting to, ya know, end my suffering. 

I was diagnosed with BPD/OCD 2 years ago. I was devastated with the BPD diagnosis due to the low chances of being able to get help. Therapists are hard for us to find. Some of us are medication resistant. Truly, I‚Äôve never had a medication or therapist that could help me. 

Then I met my current psychiatrist. After meeting me a few times she asked me if I had ever also considered an ADHD diagnosis on top of the OCD/BPD. I told her I had thought about it considering my son, my mother, and my youngest sister have been diagnosed with ADHD. She evaluated me. And low 
and behold, we added that to the list of things ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me. 

So, she started me on medication. Life changing is an understatement. I know my symptoms are unique to others due to the multiple complex disorders I have. So, this will not be everyone‚Äôs experience. But the medication has not just alleviated adhd specific symptoms, but my BPD/OCD symptoms have greatly subsided. I don‚Äôt wake up every day wishing I didn‚Äôt. 

My impulse control is better. I‚Äôm a happier, more attentive mother and partner. I handle my stressful life situations better without my brain automatically going straight to ‚Äúmust die.‚Äù 

Guys, I don‚Äôt really have many people to talk to that would understand what a relief this has been. I know you guys live with the constant pain and recklessness so you understand what a dark, hopeless mindset we tend to stay in. 

Today, the weather is beautiful. I‚Äôm feeling good inside my body. I feel beautiful again. I feel human. I appreciate the oxygen in the air and the blue of the sky. I applied my self tan. I‚Äôm shopping for Easter baskets for the kids (not Christian, just for fun). I‚Äôm finishing projects. I‚Äôm moving up at work. I have debt and bills and serious life stress and trauma. But I‚Äôm grateful for the moment. 

I hope everyone here can find a way to feel peace. I‚Äôm sending everyone vibes of healing and abundance and peace. If you read this far, thank you for allowing me to safely post my moment of brightness in my life. Ive never felt pure happiness before now. I‚Äôm grateful for this.

60,Has anyone ever taken the DES assessment while receiving therapy?,"Recently, I‚Äôve experienced a severe mental breakdown - to cut a long story short, the experience resulted in several hospitalisations and taking time off work for 2 and a half month to the present date. 

The aftermath of this was me receiving a care coordinator and psychologist, who have decided that given my recent experiences, they want to do an ‚Äòextended assessment‚Äô to clarify my diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with BPD for close to 3 years now and when initially diagnosed, I did not have to take the DES assessment. 

DES stands for Dissociative Experiences Scale, which is essentially a test of 28 questions relating to dissociative tendencies that you rate between 0-100% based on the regularity of your experience with the posed scenario. 

This is not anything I have ever been asked to do before, and I am unsure if this is a typical part of a BPD diagnosis. I have made peace with my diagnosis and being presented with the DES has sky rocketed my anxiety that it might not have been right all along. 

The last thing I want to do is send myself down the rabbit hole by googling to try and find any form of clarity on this, and I would be immensely grateful if anyone could shed any input on this or if they have any experience (personal or not) with the DES assessment.

I‚Äôm a photographer and recently diagnosed with BPD. My therapist calls it ‚Äúquiet BPD‚Äù because it‚Äôs all internal aggression.

I‚Äôm currently in crisis mode. Here‚Äôs the problem:

My husband has been away on business with his boss. His boss, we recently discovered, is gay, too. Not only is he gay, but he‚Äôs drop dead handsome, successful, wealthy and very charismatic.

During the trip, it‚Äôs been difficult to keep in regular contact with my husband, as he‚Äôs constantly at the beck and call of his boss.

Most of our conversations, when they do happen, consist of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to go in a minute, because I‚Äôm having breakfast/lunch/dinner/coffee/drinks in the rooftop bar/going out to see the local sights with (the boss)‚Äù.

It is tearing me apart.

My husband says that I have nothing to worry about, and that it‚Äôs just two guys on a business trip - but he saw his boss using Grindr, and the thought of these two horny gay guys spending all of this time, alone, together, getting to know all about one another, and sharing their life stories is killing me. And that‚Äôs without the mega-intrusive, vivid nightmare thoughts about the sexual situations I imagine them in.

Every brief conversation now involves me interrogating him relentlessly and aggressively about why he hasn‚Äôt replied to my messages, or where he‚Äôs been, or why he sounds guilty - so, every conversation becomes a huge argument.

I‚Äôm riven with jealousy, paranoia, distrust, and doubt and, at the same time, terrified that my irrational, over the top behaviour is just pushing him into the warm bed of his boss.

How do I cope with this? Help me, please!!

I'm not sure if this is going to make any sense, but maybe it will. Whenever I have a bpd flare up with someone else involved - typically someone who I believe is mad at me and hates me - I tend to disappear for awhile and wallow in self pity, and it's weirdly comforting? And while I'm just sitting there hating myself and trying to distance myself from the person who I'm convinced is disgusted with me, they will eventually come back and say they're sorry for something they did that hurt my feelings, but I'll kind of ""milk it out"" so to speak, and get this strange satisfaction or high from being upset and having strong mental and physical feelings? There's also a part of me that milks this out to make the other person feel bad which I know is probably very manipulative, but it's satisfying in a way.

78,Sensory issues,"

Is it a normal thing for people with bpd to have sensory issues? I don't think I had them for forever, or at least I can't remember, but for a couple of years I noticed that I can't stand any strong smell, I can't touch certain things because they make me sick to the stomach, but the major problem is with sounds. Loud music, traffic, people talking loudly or busy places make me feel so so bad like I cannot think of anything, I can't communicate, I get very angry and tired and just  shut down. I don't think I have another condition,  because none of the three psychiatrists that diagnosed BPD said I do. But man, it's getting worse.

79,some hope for BPD,"I recently got diagnosed with BPD. I‚Äôve struggled a lot and having my experiences be articulated has been really amazing, but it‚Äôs hard for me right now to feel hopeful. Everyday feels painful in some way. I start believing I‚Äôm destined to this kind of life, like it was already pre-determined for me and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. I hate that I can‚Äôt trust my relationships and that every time someone gets close to me I believe it will just end in pain and abandonment, especially romantically. I hate that EVERYTHING is so extreme, and if I‚Äôm not living in extremes, I‚Äôm disassociated. My diagnosis is very new, healing takes time. What I didn‚Äôt expect was the intense shame I felt upon diagnosis. I‚Äôve worked the past two years in healing my shame and have genuinely done so through therapy, but when I found out I had bpd all I wanted to do was hide. I hate how people talk about those with bpd, like the kind of person I am is already determined for me. I feel looked down upon and put into a box that isn‚Äôt true. No one else around me has it that I know of, and my two closest friends do not. I‚Äôve told them, and they‚Äôve responded beautifully, but there‚Äôs a level of understanding they can‚Äôt have.

I can't get a diagnosis done because I'm a minor and my parents are strictly against visiting the psychologist. I've asked them to take me twice but they've raged both times. I feel empty all the time and I do self harm but not as frequently anymore. Sometimes I feel like I'm perfect but the next minute I wanna rip my face off. I always have this urge to isolate myself and shut myself off. I've gone weeks without talking to my friends and I don't understand why I don't feel like talking to anyone. My life is always either really good or really bad. I hate everything. I've attempted once with painkillers. 
I keep asking my friends if they hate me to the point where they've told me to stop.
It's fine when I'm hanging out with them but when I get back home I start overthinking and it's just frustrating. 
I've been sexually assaulted multiple times as a child and grew up seeing domestic abuse and that really fucked me up. I think trauma from that turned into bpd but I'm not really sure

Like if idk something has triggered me so bad that I start crying or hyperventilating and my mum will force me to take strong medication to fall asleep for hours, but the way that she doesn't even help me, try to calm me or talk to me and just forces me to drug myself and threaten to send me to a hospital if i deny the medication just really makes me even more anxious.
I don't know if it's necessary to get to that point so soon instead of waiting and talking to me.
I really try to explain it to my mother so she can help me and we can understand it better but it just confuses me so much because I don't know any other bpd my age or even in my town and I really need some help understanding all of this, there are still a lot of things that I don't understand about myself or my condition but this is my main concern right now.

89,"Help me please, I don't know if I should've said all of this in an email.","Below this next paragraph is a letter I wrote to a psychologist office, as I am actively seeking treatment for a personality disorder(/s?)

I will preface this by saying that I am in no way trying to offend anyone in this group. I know I am not diagnosed, but I am almost 100% certain that this is what I'm living with. I haven't been to a doctor since I was a child - let alone a specialized one - besides involuntary suicide-watch nights at my local hospital and the occasional urgent care for the flu. So it is safe to say I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I would really appreciate your guys' thoughts on this email that took me an hour and a half to write because I got sidetracked.

--‚Äê-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not really sure how to come out and say this, but here I am. I believe I have BPD +ADHD. I hope you're not offended by my self-diagnosing. I can assure you that I am not saying these things because I *want* to have these personality disorders. I have lived without doctor interference for my entire life, but I can't continue to do that, so I started looking into my symptoms and what they might present. 

Upon extensive research, I display most of the symptoms in the DSM 5. At first I believed it might be CPTSd, but I more resemble BPD+ADHD. This has caused my relationships with employers, family, and friends to plummet. It has been severely impacting my life and I need help before it's too late. It's taken me a few years to seek help because I thought that it would buffer itself out - but it hasn't. 

I have had an extremely traumatic life, beginning as a child and ongoing to today.
I feel like it would be a huge burden to unload all of my trauma on somebody - and I don't want to re-live any of the trauma myself - so this has caused me to stay dormant and struggle by myself. 

I understand that I need to get an actual psychological evaluation and I am in no way trying to negate that fact. I know I am no professional. I am just stating what I believe is true so that I can find somebody qualified to help me. 

The best way to reach me is through E-mail or a scheduled phone call.

Before we moved in to this apartment I lived by myself and found it much easier to keep my apartment clean, it was almost always spotless, I was studying at the time.

I think moving in together has changed this because I feel like my independence is gone but also working shift has made it impossible for me to have a routine which I‚Äôm very fond of having otherwise.

My boyfriend only cleans the kitchen sometimes and rarely anything else unless I ask, it‚Äôs still better effort than myself.

It‚Äôs so debilitating and I feel ashamed. It has made me so depressed that I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I‚Äôve even lied to people around me about how often I keep it clean when it comes up in daily chitchat so I feel like a fraud.

Was diagnosed bipolar but new that wasn‚Äôt me so I continued life not knowing what really is up.

Every single day and I cannot help it. So I‚Äôve been struggling alone and no one seems to care. I‚Äôve been drinking way to much this past year, about a 750 ml every 3 days. I go to bed sick and pass out. 

Currently, last night: what triggered the thoughts was a phone call with a close family member.

I‚Äôm tired of existing and failing. After dinner I asked my husband to take my son with him and get us some ice cream, I wanted to be alone.. you get the point. I know it sounds pathetic but I thought that was my only chance and if I didn‚Äôt do it then I would keep suffering and things have not ever got better, I don‚Äôt want to live in pain anymore.

Finished up my note that‚Äôs been sitting in my phone for a while and put it up to my head. I then got scared and couldn‚Äôt do it. Thinking of SI is one thing (sounds easy enough, sounds like a release) but in the actual moment I was actually scared of the pain. Finally I heard my husband pull back up the house so I quickly put everything back up. I went out like everything was normal and he went to where the stuff was and said ‚ÄúWHY WERE YOU MESSING WITH MY STUFF‚Äù I said I wasn‚Äôt and he called me a child and said ‚Äúwow now I can‚Äôt even keep these in the house‚Äù he unloaded them all. I he kept verbally harassing me. I put my son to bed and slept in our guest room and he hasn‚Äôt talked to me since. 

Now I feel so embarrassed and alone. He makes me feel pathetic. I know I am. I‚Äôm barely hanging on and no one seems to care. I have told my mother and close people how bad it is and they said ‚Äúsorry maybe you should get on meds ‚Äú I‚Äôve been on soo many different types of meds my whole life and it was a nightmare, felt like I was living in a shell.

I was talking to my boyfriend, he's online, and I have been with him for 3 years.

I was fooling around talking to him and said something a bit self-sabotage-y that I didn't think was that bad. But then when he read it, he sent a text that had a tone of him being mad, then I started to apologize, and he said he would log out. He logged out and I've been texting him nonstop for the past 2 hours because I'm scared I made him mad permanently and I don't know what to do. I just recently got diagnosed and when stuff like this has happened in the past he's always come back but I'm afraid that one of these next times he's not coming back.

102,Update : When two People with BPD starts Dating,"[Prev post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/s/hYuP4gIY8n)

So we started dating, and this is an emotional rollercoaster. She is kinda immature, eventhough she was diagnosed, she doesn't go for therapy. Most of our days are filled with issues and nights with immense longing and intense emotions. We almost fight and breakup in the morning and reconcile with like an super toxic couple. I try to help her with her issues, it doesn't work. I always have to be the mature person in the relationship and help her deal with the anxiety attacks of arguments and ghosting she fucking does. 

Its hard, but still fucking stimulating enough to make me focus on this more than anything else in this world. Its fucking with my brain and also for a first time making me feel like immensely loved by someone who understands me finally ( most of the time, we are still working on understanding emotions and dealing with it ).

Idk, if its gonna last, even if it's gonna develop into something beutiful or toxic. Still exploring that. Rgt now i just understood that this is a risk I'm willing to take. Also i don't know why, i seem to assosciate our relationship to the one in You season 2. 

This post is more like a rant, and not for advice. If u see major red flags other than us both being the bpd problem, do mention them.

103,flat feelings most of the time,"hi. I've been diagnosed with BPD a long time ago, and it progressed through the years. i've experienced a lot of criteria, and talked to other people with bpd IRL.
i was confused - i asked my friend if she too has disorganised mind, like thoughts might be non linear, shaped as other stuff, basically i have a mess in my head and thoughts only start to make sense when i am telling them, without preparation. she said no. 
I've researched and found out that BPD was morphed with Schizotypal PD some decades ago, they were intertwined, and some people with BPD  might or might not have symptoms of schizotypal. 
i guess my core problem is due to this. i am losing feelings. i still can rage, or argue, or feel hypomaniac, but its all flat. when i am not triggered i feel like i have no emotions at all. i lost ability to feel love, romantic feelings, i just don't feel anything even if the person i try it with is meeting all of my criteria for a cool bf.
the only ""love-like"", limerence, i feel towards my ex, but we parted 3 years ago and now he has a gf and bla bla bla.... but its not a string feeling, it's like auto pilot

108,"I am ADHD, he is BPD (EUPD)","Long time lurker, first time poster.

So, ADHD is predominately diagnosed as a male condition but I am an adult, 32 year old woman, diagnosed with full spectrum ADHD! Whoop whoop! Energy for days! Bipolar Disorder (BPD/EUPD) is mainly diagnosed in women. However, my ex partner, 33 year old guy, has been diagnosed as EUPD. He feels everything! No matter how much I google I can‚Äôt seem to find any other couples that have had this dynamic. So, dear redditors, I call upon you to help me figure out whether or not this could be a healthy partnership should we both learn to appreciate the other?

We broke up in September 2019 due to financial problems and discovering he had addictions. So, that‚Äôs where the money went?!?! His behaviour became aggressive and me not fully grasping socially awkward situations probably aggravated him. No excuse for his behaviour, but equally I am extremely difficult to live with. Before September we were what I call the perfect couple. Holidaying with the kids, supportive of each other‚Äôs careers and he was extremely caring when it came to my ADHD (he was not diagnosed till after the relationship ended). Plus our sex life was out of this world!!! Like seriously, it was like a drug itself, being as it appears both impulsive in nature. 

So, we broke it off after some pretty serious arguments. Great, we can all move on with our lives!?!! Nope!!! Thing is, all that time before was PERFECT! Like I have never experienced! But being the stubborn cow I am I wasn‚Äôt about to tell him that. Then he messaged on Christmas and has been messaging a lot since then. Updates on his diagnosis, his medication and how he wants to date again. 

The question is, can an ADHDian and a BPDian have a healthy, happy relationship? And how is there such an attraction between two people with these traits?

109,I just ruined my relationship of 10 years and I lost my home.,"I want to start by saying I was diagnosed with BPD in 2017. It's been a problem for years and after having a manic episode in 2018 because of losing my job and moving, I've been working on myself non-stop and the whole time my partner who I love with all my heart and soul was there. But this year has been a nightmare, family members passing, employment issues, and the kicker, our ceiling caving in and our landlord having to redo the roof and ceilings.
These stressers have trigger another manic episode. O moved into my friends place because I was getting sick from the mold in the house then My friend and I started about moving in together without my partner knowing, then we started talking to them, then I turned it into a ""you don't tell me how you feel"" and they responded with ""I'm scared of making you mad"" then we started couples therapy.
I started looking for signs of what I should do, like mystic spiritual stuff, and I took somethings as signs to leave. My friend and my mother supported it, they (mostly if not only my mother) had been pushing me to leave for years.
Last Sunday I finally did it. I left my husband and I decided to move out, but now I'm in a situation of whether or not I myself wanted this or was it just me being heavily influenced.
I'm miserable, I've been crying off and on since I did this and I don't know what to do. I know I don't want my partner taking me back, I've put them through so much, but I want to go home. Where we lived together is my home. I want to go home, but I already made my bed and I'm moving in with my friend and her roommates.

110,Looking for reason(s) to live,"Hi, 38F here. I was diagnosed with quiet BPD last year, also have a history of OCD, PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression. I‚Äôm high functioning but have been going through a major bout of depression for about the past month. Feelings of emptiness and desire to die are pervasive and began around age 4-5. I go to therapy weekly and treat my symptoms with daily MMJ and occasional psilocybin.

In my latest therapy session, it was suggested that I need to find motivation to live based on ‚Äúpermanence‚Äù. My therapist and I both recognize that, while the structure of daily activities gets me through the day most times, I still lack an overall goal/reason to prevent me from ending my life prematurely. When asked what type of reason I might find, she said that it is up to me to discover that and I am experiencing a mental block to finding out what my purpose is, for lack of a better word. Have any of you out there been able to find a real reason to live beyond career goals, raising a family, or financial milestones? I want to learn to cope with this better but I‚Äôm really at a loss here. 

For reference, I‚Äôm financially secure, have a supportive family and plenty of friends, no desire to have children, and a complicated situationship that admittedly causes most of my acute issues with BPD.

111,How best to handle partner with potential BPD considering self harm.,"My boyfriend was diagnosed with BPD years ago, but will often flip between possible explanations for why the diagnosis is wrong. I'm not going to challenge his view of this, but I need help.

Its a complicated situation we're in, but the pertinent details are that he will occasionally enter a severely depressive state and will seriously discuss ending his own life. He is normally a very talkative and outgoing person, but completely shuts for 1 - 3 days or so when these moods hit.

I suffer from depression and even attempted end my own life once, so I'm highly empathetic when he gets like this, but that was a long time and years of therapy ago. It's gotten a lot better as our relationship has progressed, turning from week long severe meltdowns to short depressive moments as he's gotten to be more comfortable living in the safe environment I've tried to create for him.

We're in a polyamorous throuple, and our other partner that lives with us is highly supportive as well, we often switch off trying to take care of our boyfriend when it gets too much for one of us.

Today's episode has been pretty bad though, it was triggered by not being able to find the clothes he needed, and was exasperated when I tried to help. He blew up pretty bad, storming around the house until he tired himself out and has been nonverbal ever since, only piping up to say he wants to die.

I love him so much, he's ussually such a pleasant ray of sunshine, a genuinely wonderful and amazing person, and hurts so much to see him in pain like this. If it were me I'd want to be held and comforted, but he actively refuses physical contact when he gets this bad and I don't really know what to do.",1700893489.0,False,2,11,Sovereign42,None,183df8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/183df8e/how_best_to_handle_partner_with_potential_bpd/

I absolutely hate the way medication makes me feel and I was very open to trying tons of different options from tons of different psychiatrists. Throughout all this time it‚Äôs just been years and years of absolute insanity I went through serious verbal emotional and sometimes physical abuse from my father when I was little developed a self harm and literal heroin addiction which after years and years I was able to knock. I was in a horrid relationship with a 30 year old grown man with BPD when i was 19 that was horrid but i was petrified to lose my cats ( which he ended up stealing anyways) But I finally mustard up the courage to leave. After that I really started diving into my healing, setting boundaries staying active and with purpose doing hobbies instead of going out to the bars so much. It was all starting to clear up for me and I was no longer a sad shell of a person with constant insane thoughts controlling my brain and perception.

117,Splitting with favourite person and intense emotions.,"Hello to anyone reading this.
I was diagnosed with BPD and depression in 2021.
My dad passed away in 2013 and he was physically and verbally abusive to my mum but was very loving and caring towards me.
I was in a relationship with a guy who turned out to be physically and abusive to me as well so I had broken up and got into another relationship in 2022.
With this new guy, I felt much better mentally and started gaining weight. Everything was ok but I cheated on him after 18days of being in a relationship so I felt very guilty and bad about myself and confessed after 6 months to open up and be honest. It was once and I regretted and repented a lot and never did anything like that again.
But I found out that he cheated on me too after 3 months I confessed to him. He had a fake account too where he was sexting and complimenting girls anonymously.
Long story short, I forgave him and tried to move on with everything and accept whatever it is and stay happy with him because I really love him.

Things have been hard for me because I split a lot and I wish I was different, thought differently.
I live with a single mum and I have been trying my best to do well in my studies and so far my studies are going good but I am so tensed because of the things that have been happening in my life rn.
I miss my dad too cause I never spoke to him due to anxiety.
I regret a lot of things and wish things were different.

i had a crisis appointment with a psychiatrist i've been seeing for a few months- where i confessed every symptom i've been experiencing starting from childhood (i know shes not a therapist, i just gave her facts)  
she recommended more water, sleep and food.  
oh and to take more zinc- i never felt so misunderstood in my entire life. maybe that would be solid advice if i weren't leaving the country for the first time today (6/15). she recomended i cancel my trip due to my breakdown.  
anyways. im not sure what advice im looking for, i suppose anything  
how did you deal with your diagnosis? have you ever been far away from home during a crisis?

About a year ago, I dated a guy named Tim. It was a rocky relationship and I cannot claim that I was the only victim. We weren‚Äôt good for each other and I am willing to acknowledge my fault.

On the other hand, every few months or so Tim will contact me again after he dumped me. The first time he messaged me for me to delete a photo of us on my facebook. Which I had ignored due to the fact he is posting terrible things about me online calling me all sorts of names, etc. I eventually deleted it after he berated and dmed me some more just so I could keep the peace. The second time he dmed me, it was apologizing for everything he has done and asking for reconciliation. I wasn‚Äôt moved on and was thrilled he asked for a redo. A week later he had suddenly went cold, after I thought everything was alright. There were no arguments. He continued to spread rumors about me and ruin my reputation at the school we went to together, and I had made the decision to continue online.
It‚Äôs been about a half a year since then and we have been no contact. Recently, Tim had gotten expelled from school due to trafficking. Today, I had gotten a strange text saying ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù. I assumed it was my friend playing a joke so I resumed saying it back, and so forth. I asked who it was and he said ‚ÄúYou know who. do you still think of me?‚Äù. I had decided to not respond for a while and continue to say ‚Äúwhy did you do everything you did?‚Äù. He replied with ‚ÄúI thought it was the right thing to do. I'll be better this time. I wasnt ok mentally. I'm really really sorry beautiful.‚Äù 

I am just trying to make sense of everything. Why is he still crawling back after everything he‚Äôs done to me? Do I even reply? Please help!",1711406292.0,False,4,1,Better-Cancel-9365,None,1bnrfea,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bnrfea/questioning/

They then said they didnt think i was safe to he their due to mental health issues they noticed. They made me cry because any time a grown man yells at me I can't help but to cry, and he made me tell him my mental health diagnoses. He then went on a spheel about them, said I could go on sick leave or he'd have me kicked out of the program, so I felt obligated to go on sick leave. He completely destroyed me with what he said about me, I quit my job, and relapsed back to drinking alcohol everyday, went to a very dark place. Since then I went to the best PTSD/ addictions program in the country, and I returned to the college and am going to do the  on the job training and work term again.

125,BPD Issues,"I am having a very hard time recently. Last month I was diagnosed with BPD. I knew it was coming, but hearing it really hurt me in a type of way. I am 4 months into a relationship with my partner who truly brings me nothing but joy. We have our moments, but they pass very quickly. Right now I am struggling because I am getting an ACL reconstruction tomorrow. He got back in town from a 2 day work trip last night and I asked If i could see him since he's taking me to my surgery as well and we could spend some time together before I can't see him for a bit because I will be bed ridden for two weeks and unable to drive. He told me he wanted to have some alone time and didn't really want company. When he does things like that it makes me feel like he doesn't love me as much as I love him. When I do not see him I get through my days waiting until I can see him again. And he can function perfectly fine without me. It makes me feel like he doesn't miss me or care about me as much as I care about him. I feel so depressed all the time and filled with a void of lonliness until I get to see him again. So when he tells me he doesn't want to see me, it really makes me split. I just don't know how to get to a point where I will be okay with being by myself or accepting he wants alone time to decompress without my mind thinking he doesn't love me anymore or is cheating on me.

126,Still healing,"So I was in a very trigger bonding/abusive/maniplulating/controling/etc relationship for almost a decade. I was 18 when we met. I've been diagnosed with bpd a while ago. And that relationship is over now. I've been in an extremely and almost shockingly healthy relationship for over a year and a half. We have incredible communication. Even though I struggle, he is so great and communicating with me. The only thing I noticed lately is that, we were having a talk because I didn't like how something was handled (not important) and we spoke about it and had a great conversation. I then said wow I hate these kinds of talks I'm still not used to it. To which he wS surprised and said how I should be used to it after how long we've been together at this point. 

My thoughts; I went through prolonged trauma for almost a decade. A year year a half won't just change what I experienced and learned how to cope with (in an unhealthy way) for so long. Am I wrong? 

Also, I feel like not a lot of people in my support group take bpd serious enough. I'm really struggling and so often it's just ""trying harder""

127,Need advice pls,"I severely need advice. I am diagnosed with bpd and have severe abandonment issues. I‚Äôm 33 was also married for 7 years and have had children. I met someone in 2022 and I felt love, true reallll love for someone for the first time in my life. He left me and told me he no longer loves me 4 months ago. He was the first love of my life, he helped raise my one year old daughter with me since she was 2 months old. He is my very best friend in this world and I‚Äôve never connected and felt so comfortable with being the raw real me with anyone in my life like I am with him. I fell in love with his children and mine grew very attached to him. My one year old called him her dada and my 7 year old has had to get counseling because she misses him that badly. 

That all being said, he has made it very clear he has not held any different feelings verbally to me and has only wanted to remain strictly friends since our breakup. When I start showing my feelings he will ghost me and come back after some time has passed. He acts like him and I are such close friends like BEST friends when he comes around but has me blocked on everything social media wise and no one is allowed to know we talk at all really. I can see he has stories he posts on Snapchat but I‚Äôm not allowed on it. Nothing. Not even Spotify. what I need advice with is how do I become ok with this.

128,1am wake up thoughts,"F 25. Just woke up and I have been uncontrollably crying. I was diagnosed with BPD around a year ago and have been in therapy since. Various shitty things in life have happened to me, but my first trauma came from my dad (shock!) when he abandoned myself (8 at the time) my older sister and mum for a 21 year old woman. This absolutely broke my mum, she was severely depressed and from this age until I was 15/16 I was always scared she might end her life. My sister became rebellious due to trauma, but I went the other way and hid everything else going on in my life to try and protect my mum from feeling guilty as I don‚Äôt blame her at all and she did her best. The issue is that this trauma response of hiding things that I‚Äôm going through has made further issues with things that have happened to me e.g. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone when I was being bullied at school because I didn‚Äôt want them to worry, I didn‚Äôt tell them I was self harming at 13 etc and it was never noticed, being groomed online, covered up that my partner was abusing me for 5 years. My mum says to me that she thinks I have BPD due to my abusive relationship. I wish I could tell her everything else but I worry she would blame herself, when the person I blame is my dad for leaving us and not giving a shit, to then have another child and he is a good dad to him. Why did I never get that ? Since then I have had a strained relationship with my dad. We currently speak only about once a month though. When I was in my abusive relationship (ages 18 to 23) my dad cut me off unless I ended it and this also created a lot of trauma for me. I‚Äôm now in a situation where I feel that maybe I should say something to them. Or just my dad. Or I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to keep carrying this pain alone. I just want my dad to be sorry and take responsibility for the trauma he gave me. Not sure if even attempting to see if he will do this will just give me more issues.

129,Can anyone help me understand? I know I'm gay I just don't understand how my life has gone this way. ,"So I have recently been diagnosed with bpd and there are some things I am struggling with regarding my sexuality and how I've got here and I know it sounds completely far fetched but I just need to know if theres anyone out there with a similar experience. I have recently discovered that I am a lesbian but I had only been with men before my girlfriend (who was also just diagnosed with bpd today) and she's really struggling to see how I could possibly be gay which I understand but I just know that I am on the feelings and looking back through my life.

When I was 13/14 my mum went into my school because I was being called an 'anorexic lesbian'. I was very skinny hence anorexic and I liked to hold my female  friends hands. I also used to look at my female friends bodies when they were changing (I know this isn't OK but I just didn't think anything of it). 

When I was 16 I went to my mum and I told her that I thought I was gay because of a specific girl in my school because I really fancied her and wanted to be with her but she told me that 'I wasn't gay but if I was it would be OK' and that 'everyone has those thoughts and feelings about women'. I feel like in that moment she normalised having feelings for women and made it seem like that's what heterosexual women felt. In that moment I felt really disappointed that I wouldn't be able to be with women. 

My mum also used to turn off TV programmes with two women in a relationship in then them and I always really wanted to watch them and have remembered the scenes that I saw from them so clearly throughout my life. 

I then fell down a horrible hole of chasing validation through sex with men because I thought that that would get me love. I created a character that I thought men would want because I wanted to be loved so badly and I thought they wanted sex so I became a 'sweet, cool girl who just wanted sex'. Even though I actually was never attracted to men in anyway. 

Everytime I had sex with men I dissociated to my school hallway and pushed my feelings away. My counsellor said that I was trying to escape to somewhere safer but unfortunately my school experience wasn't positive and therefore I was self sabotaging and punishing myself. I always felt anxious and wrong with men but I ignored my feelings and kept striving to be the perfect character.

I found myself looking at my female friends and their bodies and imagining myself being with them. But it was always like I couldn't be. I knew that I was never attracted to men and I have been attracted to women but because I 'wasn't gay' I managed to get to pansexuality because I knew I wasn't attracted to men but I didn't look far enough to know that actually I was attracted to women and therefore gay.

When I was younger a girl kissed me in a club but I was drunk and she got lipstick all over my mouth and at this point in my life I feel like i was just so far into the character that I was so fixated on being the perfect woman for men so that I would be loved because it was my only option because i 'wasn't gay' because of what was said when I was 16.

I have found myself fantasing about women throughout my life but it was like I wasn't able to be with them and men were my only option for love and I wanted to be loved so badly. 

When I went to my psychiatrist to get my diagnosis he said that because my mum was my primary care giver her telling me that I wasn't gay was a massive part in my life and that I wanted to please her and therefore became characters so that I could be loved and used sex as a currency to achieve this because I thought it's what men wanted.

I will also say that both of my parents are suspected narcissists and my step mum is suspected bpd also. 

When I met my girlfriend everything was different, I thought that she was the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen and everything with her feels so natural and right. And when we had sex for the first time I looked at her and said 'oh my goodness I'm not thinking about anything else.' because that was so new to me, I was actually there and thinking about her and her body and touching her and not just trying to escape in my head. 

When I actually think about what I want I know that it's women and that I'm a lesbian but I'm just so confused how this could be my life and how I could have done these things when I know they're wrong for me. I just need some answers and want to know if there's anyone who has any? 

Basically I just want to know if anyone has had a similar experience as me? Because when I look at my life I know that the feelings with my girlfriend are so different than anything I've ever felt before. And when I look back I can see that I have fancied women but that I pushed all my emotions and feelings away to create this character because I wanted to be loved so badly.

I can take responsibility for the ways in which I sabotaged the relationship even before we got together. I refused to be exclusive and was dating around. But when I finally realised what was infront of me. I cut the shit. I was dedicated, head over heels but the damage was done, the resentment in him just grew until everything became so toxic I had to end things. The problem is, this is my forever FP. For whatever reason we can‚Äôt stay away from each other. The last 2 almost 3 years broken up we‚Äôve both (mostly him) broken no contact. Tried to get back together atleast 4 times and failed. We are fwb right now but rarely see each other because I moved 8 months after our break up. I have every reason to not want him in my life, he dated his best friend he always told me not to worry about, he‚Äôs said some god awful things when he resented me & he‚Äôs sworn off love and relationships. I should walk away but he‚Äôs the only person that truly gets me. Even at my very worst, he‚Äôs there. I feel my most myself around him. I‚Äôm not sure where I end and he begins.

Maybe the next  time it‚Äôll work and we will be the phenomenal love we once had or better. I‚Äôll be honest, before things got bad and toxic, the relationship was straight out of a fairytale. I to this day don‚Äôt know how I could be loved or love someone that much. But we did and everyday was a promise for it to grow a little more. Really cause why else in 3ish years have we not learnt how to move on or accept no longer being in each other‚Äôs lives?

133,How to tell between splitting/senseless anger vs anger that makes total sense?,"Idk if I'm wording this right, English isn't my first language so bear with me.

So for context, me and my partner are both diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, so we have a hard time admitting our faults when we fight, or just being patient with each other. We both have abusive traits in the relationship and I'm not proud of that.

But I got ZERO mental health knowledge, so I don't really know how to tell when I'm wrong for screaming, contradicting, ignoring, being angry at my partner and when I'm right for doing so (as in: he did something that will spite an angry response in ANYONE). 

Yesterday, his sister brought us some chinese fried rice since its my favorite food with some fries. We're Costarrican, so this isn't everyday food btw, this shits special.
As it was cold, and my boyfriend didn't show any interest in it since it ""looked weird"", I started cleaning HIS familys house, doing some leftover dishes, wiping the tables, cleaning the floors a little... so I could peacefully sit and eat the fried rice. I mean, I'm getting a little treat from his sister, might as well treat her by cleaning their house.
I was finishing everything up, I even air fried the fries separately so they wouldnt taste like microwave... and surprise, my boyfriend is now besides me, looking at the food with hungry eyes...... I thought to myself: ""Nah, he wouldn't eat the fries, he just ate a bunch of food..."". I washed a last dish and I turn and boom, one fry left on the plate. I caught him red handed.
I would've broken up with him for this. Like, dissapeared forever, for a bunch of fries... 

I was so angry, I wanted to scream, I felt a pressure in my chest, my eyes were crying before i even processed whatever happened... I wanted to die over some fries. And this happens all. the. time. over a thousand other things... 
I ended up angry for an hour or two until I stopped being mad and I asked him to say sorry to me because he clearly saw how much it hurt me... but its such a stupid thing, why am I even treating someone poorly over these stupid reasons???? What can I do?? How do I tell when I should be mad or when not to be mad, especially when I'm angry with my partner over past things that genuinely matter and hurt me? Even if i supposedly forgave him, I still bring those thoughts forth when we fight!!

134,Needing support,"Hello!
This is my first post ever on Reddit. I need support from people who also have BPD. 

I am 22f and I was properly diagnosed with BPD last year although I suspected it for a long time. I always had troubles with impulsivity, deppresion and emotional Control. Last year I fully realize how bad I am even though I was in therapy for almost two years at this time. It started when my boyfriend broke up with me. I Had a relationship before but this was first more long term. We were living together for couple months. 

I am acknowlegding that we had problems on his side, but I was more impulsive abusive and awful, because my mental Health was awful. I just got out from my parents house, was adjusting to new work, new city and was dealing with relative that Had dementia and unfourtunally died at the end of 2021. I am not saying this to demish what I did which included intensive splitting, arguing, trying to keep it through being FwB even though it was hurting us both etc. This land me in group therapy which I couldn't handle, because I really had a hard time hearing critism and taking full accountability for what I did.

135,Feeling incredibly misunderstood,"Hey, so I'm not diagnosed or anything, for personal reasons, so this probably isn't the best place to go but I feel lost and I hope to find some advice or at least answers here.

So I've been having severe moodswings for about a year now, I get incredibly irritated because of small things and I'm very impulsive and sensitive. It's very difficult to me to give someone an answer why I'm suddenly mad or just sad or anything. I can't take any critique without feeling attacked even if it's simple advice. If the tone of a person just slightly changes it makes me question if I did something wrong or if they're attacking me. And I'm in a relationship with someone who makes me very very happy most of the time and basically keeps me alive but my moodswings don't want me to be happy so I'll suddenly get mad or just very irritated and he feels like it's his fault or just wants to know why I'm acting so strange suddenly or just cutting him off and I can't give him an answer. I feel horrible and I don't know what to say to him. ""Oh yeah sometimes i just randomly don't like anyone anymore and wanna be alone for no reason?"" Sounds like a bad excuse.

I don't want him to feel bad about this just because I have strange moodswings that happen randomly and don't have anything to do with him. Is this just a strange phase or like a toxic personality trait? And how can I explain this to him?

136,How can I help myself?,"First I want to apologize for the long post that you're about to read but I'm really losing my sanity at this point.

I (f 21) was dating a guy (20) for about two months, he was a virgin and I was his first ever , everything was going so so well , we are very compatible and I really liked him a lot and still do like him , he also liked me a lot , until..

Before we had sex for the first and last time ever he had talked to me about STDs and I told him that he has nothing to worry about because I have never had an STD , so two weeks later we have unprotected sex , and it was really really good , ten days later he started experiencing some symptoms like a burning sensation when he pees , white or clear discharge, his penis was red and swollen, and he was going crazy and he was very very anxious and scared (rightfully so) he went to a doctor and the doctor told him that it's probably gonorrhea and he told him to start with the medication that he prescribed to him after he got a test , the test came back negative, and I also did all the STDs tests and all of them came back negative as well . (For the record we are syrians and we live in syria , so we are very tight on money and the whole process of going to doctors and taking all the std tests was very dangerous because any kind of sexual activity before marriage is not okay here) .

This guy is now convinced that I gave him something and he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, and he keeps calling me reckless (which I know I am I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago but my parents refused to believe it and didn't get me medication or treatment) .

My problem is that I was also too ignorant to believe it (because mental health is not really a thing in Syria) and now I feel like I desperately want him to stay in my life because I didn't do anything wrong, and I feel like my world is collapsing, and I know that I need to go to therapy and get treatment but I don't have any money, therapy is very expensive here and I don't know how to cope anymore, I truly saw something in him , and I feel like shit for losing him as a friend and as a lover , I didn't want things to go that way at all , and I don't know what to do.",1715932579.0,False,1,0,Unfair_Solution_2317,None,1ctzrvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ctzrvj/how_can_i_help_myself/

A few weeks ago when he was gone on holiday with little to no phone availability (mostly due to camping) I realised he was my FP after a horrific mental breakdown that caused me to relapse and threw me into a really really bad depressive episode. I have tried my best to explain the situation and tried desperately to not be too much with my mental health, which he knew about and said he understood and that he would reassure me when needed. However, since then he has been quite distant. Leaving me on seen, barely talking to me and what's worse is that my abandonment issues are heavily triggered by his new found romantic interest. 

He also struggles with his mental health and I've been feeling like i have became nothing more than a grey cloud over his head and an insufferable burden. A few days ago I tried again setting healthy boundaries to make things easier for him as I felt like I was suffocating him or putting immense pressure on him and he hasn't came through.

I grew up with an emotionally absent dad, who neglected me with basic affection and love aside from providing for me physically, and an emotionally unstable mother who would rarely get physical and throw things, get angry and triggered easily. My parents caught CONSTANTLY. That is all I know. Anyways, I tend to Google things, especially lately because I‚Äôve really been struggling with my mental health the past 4 years. I‚Äôve heard of BPD (borderline personality disorder). I know the symptoms / traits, and so as you can imagined while googling, and watching videos, I notice that I line up with a lot. I‚Äôm emotional, I can get triggered easily, when I am in a relationship, I always need reassurance, and am scared they‚Äôll ending leave me, etc. but doesn‚Äôt everyone not want their partner leaving them? I can definitely be emotional - like I said, I‚Äôve always been sensitive, am hard on myself, am insecure and scared of judgment, anxious all of the time, struggle with handling a lot of stressors, I have self esteem issues, and I overthink like NON OTHER in general. Im just always in my head is how I can describe it. Im VERY self aware at least. Anyways - the fact that I see traits lining up, scares the absolute SHIT out of me. If I have it, I feel like I will end up being alone for the rest of my life, and be so doomed because people with BPD struggle in marriages / relationships, I‚Äôm so scared if I have kids, it would be passed down to them, and I would have negative effects on them, what if I‚Äôm not taken seriously, people are scared of me, I turn into my mother, etc etc. what if what if what if is just running through my mind.

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Bpd, severe anxiety and depression 2 years ago and I‚Äôve been regularly seeing a therapist and trying my best to overcome my trauma. 

Since i was a little girl as little as 5-6 years old, my mom always talked about how she wanted to abort me but couldn‚Äôt and how she wished she never had me.

Then she has these episodes where she suddenly gets back to her old abusive ways. These last couple of months she has been worse in terms of how she abuses me. Every time i see her or talk to her she tells me how she just wishes I die or get murdered and she wishes she can do it herself choking me and watching the life drain out of me and she gave me so much details on how she would love to do it, or for me to off myself and make it easier on her.

2. Tried to join a 52 week program on dialectical behavior therapy. The program was twice a week once for group & once for individual therapy. However, you had to be accepted into the program and at that time due to substance abuse, they felt the money spent (self pay) and active SUD I would not be a good candidate for their program. 
3. After that I found myself thinking well if I can‚Äôt even makes it into DBP then how the heck will their be any improvements. So fuck it! 
4. I have found been self isolating since given the news and not really put much into place with the expedition of medication management and meet with my psychiatrist once a month.

Business has been great! However, self love self care and therapy went to the back burner. In the meantime SUD has progressed.

It was and will always be one of the most incredible and special things I've ever gotten to experience. Going from being her friend, to being her close friend then her best and eventually her partner, is the greatest thing that could have happened to me. I was diagnosed a month ago, and although it's been great to finally have a diagnosis it's become very apparent to me that old habits are hard to break.

After months of completely random outbursts that came out of no where and disappeared almost as quickly as it came, change in daily patterns and moods and general lack of communication in the relationship and motivation in life; my girlfriend has asked to take a step back from the relationship. She's such a good person to me, she's always been so patient, gentle and just generally supportive of me in everything I do. When she called me today to ask for a break I didn't break down, or panic, I let myself just feel how much it hurt to push another person in my life away. I've decided I can't ever let someone go because of that again. Especially not my girlfriend.

I need advice on how to break out of destructive loops. I need to learn how to stop allowing my mood to be taken care of by other people and become self sufficient, so that the day I get to be with her again I can make her feel the love I used to make her feel. All I want to do is be good. Love her and be helpful and independent, and learn how to be honest and open with my emotions. 

I hope one of you can help me out :) Thank you.

147,How to talk about a FP to other loved ones? ,"How to talk about a FP to other loved ones? 

I (27f) have been in a relationship with my gf (27f) for almost 2.5 years. After the first 1/1.5 years or so I slowly started losing touch with more and more friends as well as my family. It had multiple reasons and it was definitely not just on me (I won‚Äôt bore you with the whole story and all the reasons), but a big thing was definitely that my relationship started being very codependent. I was not doing good at the time at ALL and living with my gf in a city where I had no one else, I leaned on her a lot. In the meantime though, I have always felt incredibly ashamed and guilty for losing all of these people. Especially because I was always known as such a loyal and good friend, daughter and sister, and I felt like I changed. There were many reasons I didn‚Äôt manage to mend things (yet), but I guess a big one was the fact that I did not know what to say about how my relationship played a part in it ‚Äî both because I never wanted to be the person who chose a relationship/partner over everything and everyone ALL the time, but also because I felt like I was blaming my gf when she did nothing wrong. I did not want other people to perceive her as the problem, nor did I want her to feel like that.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, I finally got diagnosed with BPD (with probable underlying ADHD/autism) and everything started to make more sense. It‚Äôs so clear that I have developed a strong FP attachment to my gf and that leads me to neglect other people and other things. I hate it, but it also gave me some peace knowing it as I can understand myself more now.

Now for my actual question, does anyone have any tips on how to communicate with others that I have this FP attachment? And what that means and does? 

I really want to take accountability for my shortcomings but I also want to be understood. I especially want to talk to my 2 (ex?) best friends as well as my parents + sister. There were other reasons that I went no contact with my parents for a while (to protect myself after years and years of intensity and toxicity), but I do believe I would‚Äôve dealt with this different/faster if I didn‚Äôt have this FP attachment. My gf opened my eyes more to how my parents (mainly my mom) really treat me and I‚Äôm thankful she helped me stand up for myself, but I‚Äôd still like to work on this relationship and my parents do deserve an explanation on the things that make that more difficult for me.

Ive been in therapy a lot and gotten psychiatric care as well. 

I‚Äôve always been a pretty messy person. Not in a disgusting way or unsanitary but recently it‚Äôs gotten bad. I had kept my studio somewhat decent until my now ex girlfriend and I broke up two weeks ago and I‚Äôve spiraled ever since. With the holidays, my mental health goes in the trash and my apartment was starting to get messy but I just let it build because I couldn‚Äôt muster up the energy to clean it. I worked and if I wasn‚Äôt working, I was sleeping or binge drinking. Now, I have fruit flies all over the place and it was kind of my wake up call to start cleaning.

So basically I have a FP (favourite person),¬† he's one of my online friends, and they've been my FP for a while, at first I thought I liked him but soon realized it's just an obsession. I wanna be with him 24/7 and especially talking to him in VC. He does know that I have BDP because I keep feeding him information about how I feel (for example, I'm jealous of you and X being together most of the time), to him 24/7 and I always second-guess him (you must have snitched to X because you guys are so much closer!), and he seems pretty annoyed with it. He told me it is fine to vent and it was too much. I think it was too much too and I don't want him to be angry at me because I will literally cry if he shows any signs of him being angry, I know it's mentally draining for him but I can't control myself to not tell him. Jealousy is the worst problem I have to deal with, it makes me anxious and sometimes angry, or sometimes I will just burst out crying. It makes me anxious when he's talking with other people and extra angry and sad if he's talking to someone one-on-one, which he rarely talks to me in a VC but sometimes I just wanna hear his voice. I always stalk him 24/7 to see if he's doing something with his friends and I would also stalk his friends if they are both online on discord, if they are both online I would assume that they must be talking to each other and having fun, which makes me more anxious, why would he want to spend time with a mentally broken and a boring human-being? I have way too many expectations for him (he's gonna text me anytime sooon~ I'm waiting!) (He will understand me 100%) (He will comfy me If I say this to him)

Soon I realize that this is getting more unhealthy and unhealthy day by day and I want to do something about it but I'm so helpless,¬† I'm literally experiencing stomach pain because of anxiety, If this goes on, I'll be at my limits soon. I don't know what to do, every time I talk about this with him I just end up pushing him further and further, and I feel like I overshare too much.

When we first started dating I was fine with it. As we have been together for longer it has become more and more of an issue for me. It‚Äôs like something that always lingers in the back of my mind that I just can‚Äôt get over. I know I can be obsessive. I‚Äôve been open and honest on how it makes me uncomfortable which is very hard for me generally because I am bad about opening up about those things.

We have a shared laptop that‚Äôs how I found out about the porn. I told him as long as he is watching porn I will not be intimate with him and he had a breakdown.

But I'm back where I started: not all the symptoms listed in the DSM for BPD speak to me, and those that do are much milder for me than the literature (Fox book, etc) seems to suggest.

I have no trauma, no self-harm, no emotional dysregulation. At first glance, I'm pretty normal. I've never quit a job because a boss was mean to me (I am good at holding my tongue/kissing ass if theres something in it for me). I've never gotten literally **obsessed** over someone. Sure, my interpersonal relations are as bad as they could imaginably be, I have enormous issues with delayed gratification, my impulsivity is very bad with respect to my vices. But that's all pretty mild, if not to say simply personal failings.

Is this a normal thing that some people diagnosed with BPD experience? Two disclaimers btw: I am a guy and I did not score the ""quiet"" subtype.

I get emotionally tired and my affection is just gone. It takes ages to replenish such feelings and often I avoid even starting to like someone because I know how it ends. I do communicate this to everyone I date so that I don't lead anyone on. 

How can people even date that long? Where do you get the energy from? How do you even love someone and keep loving? It's just a weird concept to me.

159,I subconsciously forgive the people who have hurt me ,"I think this is mostly because my memory has gone to shit. But i don‚Äôt hold grudges, i can‚Äôt hold grudges even if i wanted to. My parents for example, the biggest thing my parents have done to hurt me is lie to me about my biological dad, created a whole fake scrapbook to keep up with the lies, with false dates and names. I would not have found out the truth if The biological father (who i don‚Äôt have in my life because i chose not to) hadn‚Äôt found me and told me the truth himself. My parents made this all about them, my mom made excuses for herself and my dad felt betrayed and ignored me for weeks when the truth came out, he expected an apology from me. I never had a good relationship with my dad, i thought i hated him he was always angry at everyone, he was verbally abusive and strict af, i couldnt breathe around him. My mom stopped defending me because he would just yell at her and then she would yell at me saying she would never defend me again. Every terrible argument i had with my parents ended with me telling myself ‚Äúremember this feeling remember how hurt you are-remember their words dont forgive them for this‚Äù But i always forgive even without an apology. I moved out almost 2 years ago and i feel safer, im not used to arguing and being yelled at anymore, but now ive become more sensitive to everything, i still see my parents from time to time and when they yell or bicker with me in the slightest i cry and i kind of start to tweak out. They look at me like im crazy and tell me i dont know how to handle discipline i dont need to cry over everything. I dont want to fucking cry but i cant help it and knowing that im making a fool of myself just bawling my eyes out makes me more angry with myself and my reaction to things. My mom has put me in mental hospitals just because she didnt know what to do with me anymore. After my first and only attempt to take my life she became reliant on mental hospitals to just take me away whenever things got bad. And that brought more trauma, so mucb happened to me in those places and she swore it was meant to help me. Then i was in a residential treatment center for 2 months, i had to live there, i didnt see the outside world at all. Thats when i got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and thats when i started to hate myself more. 
Theres so much i could say this isnt even half, now all i will ever be is my trauma its made me into such a complex person and i cant deal with myself anymore. I dont feel a strong love for my parents, i could move to a city far away and never talk to my entire family ever again and i would be fine, except my little siblings ofc id miss them. No matter what i can forgive my parents which is without saying because they‚Äôre all i have. But even past boyfriends , past friends who have destroyed me i can still talk to them because i dont remember the hurt i felt only the action, and i do forget sometimes, so people take advantage of that, the people in my life know that they can walk all over me and i wont hold it against them for too long.

165,Repulsed by sex after breakup,"Hello, recently diagnosed with BPD in the last couple of months, but realize that I've certainly had it my whole life. It explains so much of how I react to things, why I fixate and ruminate, terrible self esteem and self image, etc. 

Anyways, I went through a breakup two months ago, and now almost anything sexual repulses me or triggers me into thinking about my ex and thoughts of him having sex with someone else. When I think about him being intimate with someone else, my face gets flushed, I go into a panic, and have terrible, intrusive thoughts about how I'm a loser, ugly, disgusting, etc. When I'm in a good place, I'm very sexually liberated and love to be sexual with my partner. However, this breakup really fucked me up and he also gave me an STI, which has left me feeling so undesirable. 

I want this sensation and feeling to be over, I want to move on so badly. My brain knows that I am indeed desirable and that this diagnosis (BPD and STI) are not necessarily going to hold me back from finding love, but the BPD part of my brain loves taking control and trying to convince me everything is pointless, worthless, and that I am indeed a piece of shit. Anyone else deal with this? Any recommendations to get over this or to work through it? Any mindfulness tricks? I know time will eventually heal it, but hoping for any other coping mechanism.

167,I‚Äôm fixated on this boy and it clouds my every waking moment,"

I was diagnosed with BPD when i turned 18 and ever since then it‚Äôs been a roller coaster. 

I wanted some advice on how to cope with the favorite person obsessions.

There is this boy at work who I‚Äôve had a crush on for a few months. We drunkenly kissed on a night out but he told me nothing can come of it because he‚Äôs going abroad across the globe in a few months and doesn‚Äôt have a return ticket (he‚Äôs originally from that country) and doesn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll ever come back. This was the first red flag where i should have got out of there before the feelings really developed but it was too late. I went abroad for two weeks and came back feeling slightly over it but seeing him again made them all come back. We ended up talking for a while and kissed again but this time SOBER. I knew that meant something and we said we would keep anything private between us from our co-workers. 

Fast forward a few days and I‚Äôve become completely obsessed again. He is on my mind nearly every waking moment and I can‚Äôt seem to shake to what so ever. I can‚Äôt seem to get him out of my head and it‚Äôs starting to really drain me. I have no idea where we stand now after that kiss and I asked him if he wanted to come out after work with me and he said he was tired and probably going home, but when the entire group was going out he changed his mind. I don‚Äôt know if this is my own head playing tricks on me or if i‚Äôm being manipulated. 

I just wanted some advice on how to cope with the obsessive thoughts and not have it plague my every waking moment. I feel like i‚Äôm in a constant state of distress bombarded by anxiety and decisions of whether to text him or not, whether to talk to him or not, even thinking about what i‚Äôm doing wrong. I‚Äôm in a constant battle in my head asking am i doing too much? too little? if i do this what will happen, if i don‚Äôt do this then that might happen. It‚Äôs draining and scares me the way that it can drag down my mood so quickly and intensely. I even have self destructive thoughts of ruining any potential by being too much, just so that i don‚Äôt have to think about it anymore

168,I can hear them again.,"I've been diagnosed for BPD by my psychiatrist earlier this year. It all started 2 years ago when I heard the voices. Last year had to be one of my worst years since I had multiple psychotic episode AND the fact that I didn't know what's happening to me.

So this year, after being diagnosed and went through some session with my psychiatrist, the voices slowly fades. But my life is as hectic as before. I still couldn't curb my impulsivity, self harm is still happening, I hurt the people I love. But somehow, the voices fades to the background. 

Until 2 days ago.

I was actually doing good this week, i started my online business, my study is great and my workplace is fun. But the voices came anyway. I was happily hanging my tapestry in my dorm room when I heard a loud female voice echoes in my head, followed by a man's voice. What shocked me was how much louder it was than the previous one. The voices mocked me, for whatever I was doing it the time. Luckily my roomate wasn't there to witness me keep saying shut up to the voices. It strucks me as unusual since I have actually stopped my cannabis intake. So really, I have no idea what I did wrong for the voices to come back.

AND THEY CANCELLED IT ON THE DAY

heartbroken I go to uni terrified 
Due to situational factors I don‚Äôt attempt to access mh resources at uni till October (2019).After  an a&e  visit after an attempt, a referral made to an ADULT assessment team was made by my GP. 
after a phone call a few days later (so exciting at this point) they say they‚Äôll contact me for an appointment in 2-3 weeks however it is now March (6 months later basically) and nothing .... 
I spoke to a guidance counsellor at my uni and she said I need to hassle my gp which just isn‚Äôt gunna do anything at this point

172,I can‚Äôt afford DBT and I don‚Äôt know what to do.,"Hi all,

Hope you‚Äôre doing as well as you can today. Remember your best IS good enough.

Long rant to begin with?

I got diagnosed with BPD in November 2023. I was lucky and able to access three months of outpatient treatment through the public hospital. (In Australia for context).

I am middle aged. I have the BPD trait of impulse spending. I wised up to building ‚Äúwealth‚Äù and had a small bit of savings after working on saving for 18 months. I have never owned property, always rented and now my minimum wage doesn‚Äôt cover rent (and I‚Äôm gracefully living with my elderly / ill father. I don‚Äôt know how long he‚Äôs got.)

I quit my job (3 weeks before BPD diagnosis) because of my abusive boss and his horrible daughter. They both made my life hell, I was working 12-14 hour days. He threatened all employees (not just me) but the threat of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to put you in a PIP and terminate you‚Äù was too much to bear. I am the extreme of sensitive and cry at the drop of a hat. It‚Äôs crap. It had some savings behind me, however, I was unemployed for months and they soon disappeared.

I was bullied as a kid for being poor. I was bullied in high school for being socially awkward / different / gay. I‚Äôve never had a lot of ‚Äútrue‚Äù friends, and without my dad, i don‚Äôt really have someone to reach out to.

I used to be conventionally attractive and rather healthy in my teens. When I finished high school, I lost my first serious relationship where my BPD symptoms were all over the place. My fault 100%. I sometimes go back and write to apologise to them, but choose not to. It brings up too much.

In university I made many friends and for a good 10 or so years we connected, they were accepting of my quirks, life was ok.

Then COVID happened.

(We know how that panned out. Still panning out.)

I also lost friends because of different life paths and how that stuff goes. No one did any wrong, we just drifted apart.

Then when things got back to some sort of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù; I joined a queer affirming church (religion does play a part in my heart, however, I do not condone abuse, murder, exclusion, and extortion in the name of Religion.)

I‚Äôve made some friends there. They all live rather far away and I haven‚Äôt been to church since my diagnosis.

I also got a new job in March and I am enjoying it. There are a few downsides, yet only one that irks me.

There is a woman I work with. She is approximately 10 years younger than me. She is one of those ‚Äúsickly sweet types‚Äù (100% me issue, not her issue. I know this.)

So far she has stated:
- Her fianc√© has bought her a 170,000 car
- She controls all finances and her fianc√©s money is put into her account. 
- She had her braces, current car, and all overseas travel paid for by her brother.
- She is about to marry a man who is about to inherit millions of dollars.

She‚Äôs definitely a bit of a BS artist; I think we all can be, as life is tough. However, ever since her arrival my BPD has flared up. I am poor. Always have been, always will be if I don‚Äôt change my life.

As DBT costs 21,000 AUD + and is often ran during the day (when I‚Äôm at work); I cannot access it. 

My executive disfunction is rife too.

I am not close to my siblings as they are generations older and have their own lives. My extended family isn‚Äôt close either; my mum was an only child and dad avoided his family due to trauma. I don‚Äôt have many friends and I can guarantee I am sh*t at being a friend.

I am so lonely, facing tough times because Australia is only for the rich; and I can‚Äôt move countries to try something different. I only work in admin and I suck at crafts (but enjoy them). I enjoy reading too.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, you‚Äôre amazing! Thank you for reading my ranting.

173,Bpd - advice / help,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post this but just looking for some advice, I‚Äôm diagnosed with bpd. I‚Äôve always known I am impulsive and self disruptive, but I‚Äôve only just kind of noticed after thinking something like how bad it is, and I‚Äôm just wondering is this part of bpd and do other people experience this and how can it be changed. So for example today, I didn‚Äôt sleep all night was doing cocaine till about 1pm today about 5pm I said to myself and meant it genuinely, felt like I really was serious for once, said I‚Äôve had enough of doing this, and it‚Äôs selfish and I‚Äôm bored of it and had enough of repeating this cycle & that I‚Äôm not going down this route, because I know what‚Äôs happened in the past when I‚Äôve abused drugs to much. I even said to my friends that I do drugs with, I was going to distance myself from them & obviously I have said this to myself before, but I like felt really serious this time. Bearing in mind I still haven‚Äôt slept, without even realising to myself what I said earlier I go and get more on tick when I‚Äôm skint and have an early morning hospital appointment, so deep down I know it‚Äôs a bad idea but just don‚Äôt even think about the consequences, even though my normal self is the biggest stress head and overthinker, but for some reason when I do these self disruptive things, I somehow just don‚Äôt care almost and just think will be fine. And I went ahead got drugs, eventually started to feel the regret flowing in, then quickly realised the conversation I had earlier, and literally felt baffled, because I didn‚Äôt know I was so kind of out of control with my own head, that I can go from being stressed and feeling terrible n hating myself n think I‚Äôm really fed up and done with this, to literally just reckless. I‚Äôm just wondering is this normal with bpd and i‚Äôve just never really noticed it before and if so, is there anyway to control yourself when you go into the self disrupt careless mindset, like how do you get your normal self back that thinks logically, because I can see this is like one massive problem in my life, and in the past that mindset got me to a point I was an alcoholic, doing cocaine whenever I got the chance and on a rehab list and eventually jumped off a bridge, because of hating myself so much n rhen doing it over again, then feeling terrible later on. I never really realised how much of a problem this is until now . I also know this could be part of addiction, but i‚Äôve also done things like self harm, and drank bleach when not thinking straight.",1696393572.0,False,2,2,whatevertfu,None,16zdm4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/16zdm4k/bpd_advice_help/
174,Do you guys still dream/think about an old FP? Just me?,"Background: was diagnosed in Feb 2016, after breaking up with my first fp and bf of 6years in october of 2015, (ofp). 
Our relationship was full of constant fighting and although my bpd was shining, I wasn't aware of what I had and how I could treat it. Now I'm in a loving, great relationship with my new bf and also he's my new fp but in a healthier way. Some nights I still dream about ofp and I got a bit upset when he asked his new gf to marry him in Feb, they got together in nov 2015, so that still stings. Is there still some way some of you also cling to an ofp or first love or whatever? Is this normal? I feel like I'm neglecting nfp in a way cause I'm not giving 110% to him. Of course he's completely oblivious to this. I don't know if this makes sense. I hope it does.

175,I am on the verge of giving up on life and i need help.,"I (24 female) have been diagnosed with bpd 2 years ago. I‚Äôve gone through lots of therapy and lots of medications but it feels like no matter how hard i try i always go back to my older self the minute i am triggered. I feel stressed and tired of life and i feel so alone. I work a full time job while attending university (studying engineering) at the same time and its been so hard on me. I am all alone in life which means i had to work and figure things on my own since i was 16 years old and i am so exhausted. I am trying to do better and be a better person, friend and partner but its like i am the most despicable person to them so i don‚Äôt blame anyone for abandoning me but it‚Äôs so hard one me cuz i am trying and i don‚Äôt want to be that person but i cant. 

It feels like I‚Äôve hit rock bottom and my life is a mess. I am on academic probation due to my declining gpa and grades even though i am trying my best i am attending every class doing everything on time studying well before every exam but i seem to be doing something wrong cuz my grades don‚Äôt reflect that. My job isn‚Äôt going that well it‚Äôs so stressful and triggering and i am overworking myself cuz I can‚Äôt lose it or i will be homeless with my university tuition, rent, bills etc‚Ä¶., My house is a total mess its disgusting  i am so embarrassed to show it to anyone its the worse it has ever got though i live in a tiny space. 

My relationship with my partner isn‚Äôt going that well and i am mainly the reason why. He supported me more than anyone in my life and been there for me through everything but when it comes to mental illnesses he doesn‚Äôt really understand what i am going through and keeps trying to encourage me in the wrong way with things that work for normal people or for him not for someone who is suffering from crippling anxiety and depression as well as bpd. Though he is trying to change his views.

And i need help cuz i can‚Äôt do this anymore and i want to give up i see no hope for future the harder i try the worse it gets and though i love my partner more than life and is the i only person in my life, he is better off without me i hurt him so much that I can‚Äôt even forgive myself anymore though he worked through it all with me. I cant do this life anymore i have nothing to look forward to and honestly don‚Äôt want anything. 

Also, I struggled with self harm, alcoholism, and drug abuse but i worked through all that but these days the only thing on my mind is to just get black out drunk though I‚Äôve been sober for a year. And its so hard to battle my urges. 

If you have any advices or experiences please share with me cuz it feels like i get a virtual hug when i talk to people who understand things and going through the same things i am going through.",1699861215.0,False,4,1,Informal-Loan3063,None,17u5m67,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17u5m67/i_am_on_the_verge_of_giving_up_on_life_and_i_need/
176,Undeserving of Love,"I know it is in my neurotic nature to view things a little negatively, & I try to not let thoughts like these win.
 
I am 21 years old and I have gone through more trauma than most, not all, but most of anybody that I know.

I was molested as a child for five years by a trusted family member who was related to my childhood best friend. I was also molested by said childhood best friend.

I had seen somebody very important to me shoot themselves in the face, and had to force myself to be resilient enough to process that as a young girl still in middle school.

I had to lie to CPS at 15 out of fear of being separated from my little sister. I have three siblings in total, but we do not speak: None of them are borderlines. Just me. I am the black sheep. 

My father was a dead beat, who I had only met a handful of times. My step father wasn‚Äôt any better - a violent man who my mother only married and obeyed for her own security.

My mother was a diagnosed narcissist. A strict & controlling Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. I can‚Äôt remember the last time my mother hugged or complimented me. She usually expressed her ‚Äúlove‚Äù towards me with materialistic items such as steak dinners or cruises. 

That sounds nice, right? Sure.

But she was an alcoholic, too. She‚Äôs choked me against the wall by her arm and told me she‚Äôs wished I was dead. She was so controlling when I was a child - I didn‚Äôt have a touch phone until I graduated high school. Wasn‚Äôt allowed to drive, wasn‚Äôt allowed to close my bedroom or bathroom door, wasn‚Äôt allowed to have social media. I only had a flip phone that my mother controlled VIA her Verizon account which would flag her if I ever tried to text a phone number that wasn‚Äôt hers. She would email my teachers and ask them who I sat next to in class, who I walked with, and then eventually she applied to work at my school herself. 

I wasn‚Äôt allowed to date, have friends, go to the mall, go to the movies, go to football games or school dances.

She isolated me and constantly told me I had to represent her. Perfect, blonde, ladylike, and a daughter of God.

She would destroy my bedroom and take my little sister out for breakfast while I cleaned her mess up as punishments. She‚Äôd rip up homework assignments if I used her printer without permission and she‚Äôd take away my right to wearing winter coats at the bus stop.

She‚Äôd make me late for school to hover behind me as I covered bruises and cuts with makeup. Black eyes, busted open lips, bruised ribs and bruised legs. Her fingerprints bruised into my arms.

She‚Äôd tell me nobody would ever marry me and I would look ugly in a wedding dress. My parents have told me their love for me is conditional and my mother stole the first car I bought myself as a teenager to sell to my older sister. 

She even destroyed a piggy bank my great grandmother painted for me and in doing so said ‚Äúshe never loved you anyways.‚Äù

I was just 14. 

I also remember her sitting on my head with her hands and knees, pushing all of her weight into my skull. I was also 14. I remember laying on the bathroom floor just waiting for her to crush my head and kill me. 

I remember all the nights my mom never came to pick me up from work as a teenager, and I remember us fist fighting until my hands were covered in blood. I remember the boiling rage I felt when she‚Äôd pull me into a hug a few moments after, saying to me ‚ÄúYou know nobody loves you more than I do.‚Äù

She‚Äôd force me to sleep with her sometimes, too. Not sexually. More like she would be drunk and would beg me to soothe her through the night. I fucking hated doing it, I didn‚Äôt want to soothe this fucking monster. This rotten woman‚Ä¶

But I did it anyways. Because she was my mommy, & I loved her. 

I did EVERYTHING for her. I existed for her.

I left home the day I turned 18 & fell into the hands of a lot of people who targeted girls like me. But I didn‚Äôt know this at the time - I idolized  people and believed they could commit no evil. 

Moved in with a boyfriend when I had no car, no job, no phone. He stabbed me in my arm with a knife once, water boarded me, raped me OVER and OVER and OVER. Eventually left me homeless.

The boyfriend before him cheated on me and ended up marrying the girl. He was my first Favorite Person & also a diagnosed sociopath. He told me he never wanted a family but had a baby with her so quickly..

I have a lot of issues from all of this, clearly. 

I developed severe OCD, eating disorders, PTSD, major depressive disorder, but the most difficult is BPD.

I remember when I was a little girl I would cry at my window for Peter Pan to save me. All that I wanted was to be a wife and a mother, I told myself that if I didn‚Äôt kill my self and just kept holding on, I‚Äôd be safe and protected by somebody who loves me. I‚Äôll never be hit or punched or scratched or screamed at or gaslit or manipulated or brainwashed ever again. I held on tightly to that hope as I left home and ran straight to the nearest man that LOVED how fucked up I was. Naive and young and completely alone.

Did you spend your 18th hanging out with friends? I spent mine sobbing on my boyfriend‚Äôs doorsteps as I tried to quickly come up with a way to survive. I remember walking to work until my heels bled, I remember teaching my own self how to pump gas or write a check, I remember having ABSOLUTELY NOOOOOOBOOOOOOOOODY except for me.

I‚Äôve realized now I probably am never going to get that happy family picture I always dreamed of. My life is way too complicated for the average person to comprehend and handle. I think I have been a fool for thinking my past traumas did not matter and that I could live my life unscathed.

People love me at first - they become obsessed over me. I‚Äôm the ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù girl, the ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù girl. I‚Äôm a character to them but to me this is MY real life. Once they realize that my dark runs just as deep as my light, it‚Äôs over. I think people find me alluring because I am attractive and I am socially intelligent enough to morph myself into a reflection of your own interests. 

But once I let someone in, they feel blind sided. They can‚Äôt grasp how so much depth exists within one person. They do not understand how trauma forever changes brain chemistry during key developmental stages. They do not understand how hard I TRY.


I‚Äôve tried so many different angles. But none of them work.

I think I am meant for a life of solitude. I used to think maybe I could only date another borderline, or a therapist. Someone who really really understood.

I don‚Äôt want to be a statistic. A lot of people are usually surprised to learn I have a cluster B personality type because I am just so good at playing the social games everyone is so easy to understand, so easy to see, and so easy for me to predict. 

I have a hard time meeting others who are the same as I am. Sometimes I even wish I was with a narcissist again. 

I don‚Äôt know. I just think, with assisted dying being an option for those with BPD & all, I just think we should not even fucking be here. Even the professionals know that. Clearly.


Nobody is ever as emotionally intelligent as I am, and no it isn‚Äôt the grandiosity speaking. But I feel like if I have spent the time to learn about myself and my triggers and my emotions, why can‚Äôt others do the same to themselves and also to me? I thought that is how it worked? 

It is because they LOVE me. But they don‚Äôt love ME.

Worst comes to worst if I am not married by 40 I will just adopt. Perhaps I was meant to be a therapist‚Ä¶ & only that. I wanted to be a licensed clinical social worker, I wanted to write books about the brain, I wanted to conduct my own  research on psychology.

I wanted to do this alongside someone, as their wife and their child‚Äôs mother.

I‚Äôve never cheated before. I‚Äôve never hit someone I was with. I‚Äôve never called a partner a bad name, I‚Äôve never left them to cry alone.

I loved people until I got to the point to where I have realized I am simply, plainly, unlovable. 

I have a good brain that could be put to work, so I suppose I should stop trying to love people so much and just focus on what I know I can excel at instead. Just bluntly accept the fact that I am indeed wired wayyy differently than the rest of these people, and begin to live accordingly.

I do not think I was meant to be loved. My chances at that were destroyed as soon as I was born. Before that, even, stress in the womb from my father knocking her up and then running away.

All I want is love.

I want to know what other parents who have BPD do when it comes to discipline. As I was growing up, I knew beatings and insults were not effective or fair ways to get better behavior. As my kids have grown, I have done my best; my mantra being to never have to go to therapy because of anything I did or failed to do. It works well for the most part.

But I have a lot of trouble knowing with actually what to do, especially as teens. My daughter is pretty high functioning but incredibly high strung. Even a slightly harsher tone guts her. And I'm always afraid to hurt them in any way.

I completely lose myself when I‚Äôm in a relationship, I turn into a person who is perfect in every way for the person im with.

179,The 'Wanting What You Can't Get' Concept,"
Been diagnosed for two years now. Am 20 years old. Been recently dating a 24 year old. He is wonderful, a lovely man. I adore him, he loves me and cherishes me. He is also a brilliant partner for me and I care about him immensely.
In the beginning of us meeting, he was unavailable, cancelling constantly, was completely passive towards me. This made me want him uncontrollably. I had no desire for anyone else (which is so unlike myself). Finally, a switch changed within him, and he began to ""fall in love"" with me, as he puts it. Now I am the apple of his eye, and I have lost so much interest in him. I have a wondering eye now and am incredibly frustrated with this.
Previous to this guy, I was speaking to another man that I really liked. However, he told me he was still in love with his ex-girlfriend and had slowly cut me off out of no interest in being involved anything more than sexually with me. Lately I have been thinking about him. This past weekend, I was very intoxicated, and I ended up meeting up with him and having sex with him. Now I cannot stop thinking about him. 
The unfortunate part of this is that I lack a lot of guilt with my actions. I know I should feel very guilty, but I don't. It was something I wanted to do, and I fulfilled that. Which I am understanding now that the concept of 'hedonism' is something that comes with having BPD. Complete and utter pleasure-seeking behavior, even if it means you are harming those you love. I have spoken to a friend who has also been diagnosed with BPD that also has had experience with this.

How do you all deal with (or have conquered) the concept of, 'this is a good person and I should be with this person' versus 'this is someone that does not want me, therefore I want him'.

I am looking forward to hearing all of your stories, thank you all in advance.

I've been diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and surprise /s depression/anxiety. I have a question that's been bothering me lately seeing posts about BPD awareness. Essentially, there's a strong idea that there's manipulation and anger.
I most certainly don't feel outward anger, although I was close to figuring I may be turning it on in myself instead (side note:the trauma from my youth has made me avoid confrontation, I avoid at all costs angry feelings and actions [mostly through fear])

I also, as far as I know (we all dig deep for these worries eh) do not manipulate people. I believe I did in my early 20's via promiscuity, but manipulation would encourage rejection in my mind so why would I do it now (lesson learnt also early 20's)

I guess I'm worried that I agree and relate to so many BPD statements but am worried that it's prescriptive. That I manipulate and don't know it.

182,Help,"Im not sure if I have BPD or not. I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed but a lot of my behaviors match to a t what ALOT of people are talking about on here. I don‚Äôt know where else to bring this.

Im in the army and have been deployed a lot over the last 10 years I‚Äôve been married. A year and a half ago I moved to another base to be an instructor so I have been home for longer than I have ever been during my entire marriage. It‚Äôs now completely falling apart and heading to divorce very soon if it doesn‚Äôt get fixed and fixed fast. If I‚Äôm being honest I don‚Äôt think it can be fixed. This sparked me to have some deep introspection on myself and behaviors because ultimately I need to be in control of it and will accept responsibility for anything even people wronging me. 

So I started off thinking I was a narcissist which sparked me to go to a professional to fix myself. Turns out I‚Äôm not a narcissist. But she said I‚Äôm a anxious avoidant. So that lead me down a path of my therapist trying to get me to improve my self esteem. My wife on the other hand has narcissistic tendencies and will not hear me out and consistently I am the one apologizing for my feelings. At which point I get cold and then she is upset that I‚Äôm cold so I fake affection and care and force myself to be a ‚Äúgood husband‚Äù completely disregarding my needs and boundaries which makes it worse until a big blowup where she half assed comforts me and I know she isn‚Äôt going to abandon me. All of the major figures in my childhood chose someone over me mom dad brother sister. 

In this search for a solution so I can regain control I have opened up some very upsetting things about myself. I have realized I have given every person I have ever met a fake me so if they were to discard me it wouldn‚Äôt be the real me and I would be able to live with that. 

I am now realizing the source of my feelings of worthlessness come from my life of people pleasing to avoid abandonment (true abandonment) and I‚Äôm now sitting realizing I have been manipulating and lying to my wife for ten years had two kids hurt them by not ending the relationship and pleasing her by having kids. Which is now reinforcing my feelings of worthlessness because I can‚Äôt hide behind the ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù facade and it turns out the people that did leave was because I‚Äôm worthless and I actually am. 

I‚Äôve been manipulating this woman and lying to her for ten years and even had kids to please her and I don‚Äôt know how to live with that or myself.

I used to have substance abuse problems now I cope with healthier looking things (the gym) but I have even abused that to the point of injuring myself and I‚Äôm starting to desperately seek external validation and on the brink of relapse into my old habits of self destruction.

Im in more emotional pain than I have ever felt and am fighting back bursts of tears at the slightest reminder of the real me which is actually worthless and should be abandoned

183,Canadian mental health's week,"This week is Canadian mental health‚Äôs week.

I cannot remain silent. I have witnessed so many prejudices related to different mental illnesses. And I have been victim myself of some prejudices related to my mental illness.

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I have an eating disorder (ED). 

I am trying really hard to recover from my eating disorder. It has been a year since I am in therapy and take medication. Even though I am on the path of recovery, I am still sick. My day-to-day existence is still challenging. I have been victim of many misconceptions people have about my disease. Today, I want to break those misconceptions. 

First of all, I have gone to my family doctor before my eating disorder went out of control. I‚Äôve told my doctor I was worried about the relationship I had with food. I‚Äôve told her that every time I felt angry, sad or anxious about something, I ate. I‚Äôve told her that I often got up at night to eat things I didn‚Äôt allow myself to eat at daytime. I‚Äôve told her that I was sometimes craving for junk food. I‚Äôve told her that I was often eating so much that I felt a pain in my stomach. I‚Äôve also told her that I was constantly checking my weight because I was worried that I was weighing more than my friends. Those are the common symptoms of an eating disorder. My doctor didn‚Äôt take me seriously. She didn‚Äôt consider my eating behaviors as a problem. Actually, she told me it was quite common among teenagers to like junk food and to eat ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. 

For a couple of years, back in high school, my eating behaviors remain the same. I was stealing money from my mother‚Äôs purse to buy junk food. I was hiding food in places where my mother could not find it such as my room‚Äôs closet. I had drawers filled with wrappers. 

Then, it got worse. Two years ago, I had convinced myself that I had some kind of virus and that I couldn‚Äôt digest food anymore. For a week, I had stopped eating. My close ones were worried but they didn‚Äôt question my behavior because I had convinced them I had a virus. When I started to eat again, food disgusted me so much that I felt like I couldn‚Äôt keep it: I had to throw it all away. And that is what I started to do.  At first, I told my parents that I was throwing up because of the virus. But, it kept getting worse. I could barely eat with them. And when I did, I ate a ridiculously small amount of food. I was throwing up after each meal. And I had started to skip meals. In a matter of a few months, I had lost a lot a weight (something like 25 pounds). At one point, I couldn‚Äôt concentrate at school anymore. I was feeling weak. I was feeling anxious around others. At that time, all I wished for was to disappear completely. I told my parents I needed to go to therapy. I knew something was wrong but I didn‚Äôt know what it was. My first therapist diagnosed me with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), related to a sexual assault I had been victim of a couple of years before.  Then, I was diagnosed with Depression. Then, I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, they found out I had an eating disorder: I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. Finally, after a suicide attempt and a stay at the hospital, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 

I have found it really difficult to hear about the final diagnosis because I knew that this one was accurate. When my therapist first described to me the symptoms of BPD, all I could think was: ¬´It is me. It is all me. Is it all that I am? Am I a disease?¬ª For those of you who don‚Äôt know much about BPD, there are nine specific symptoms to this illness but you only need to have five of them to be diagnosed with it. First of all, BPDs fear abandonment. That‚Äôs why BPDs make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Because of that fear of abandonment, BPDs have unstable relationships. BPDs relationships are often intense and short-lived. Also, BPDs have unstable self-image. BPDs may feel good about themselves for a short period of time and then hate themselves. BPDs often don‚Äôt know their needs and desires. They may change values, goals, and even sexual identity. Because of their unclear self-image, BPDs engage in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm, risky sex, alcohol or drug abuse, binge eating. Those self-destructive behaviors can lead to suicidal behavior. BPDs also have intense emotional swings. They are described as hypersensitive. In fact, Marsha Linehan, the psychologist whom invented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is now used to treat people with BPD, says: 
‚ÄúPeople with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.‚Äù BPDs also experiences chronic feelings of emptiness due to their unstable self-image and their lack of self-confidence. BPDs can also struggle with intense anger and can have trouble controlling it. More frequently, BPDs direct their anger towards them. Finally, BPDs can experience episodes of paranoia where they feel suspicious about other‚Äôs motives and out of touch with reality.  That feeling can lead to out of body‚Äôs experiences. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, I knew I had to tell my close ones. The impact of the symptoms on my life was so important: I could not pretend that they did not exist anymore. My therapist had warned me that the reactions to my diagnosis could be quite inadequate due to all the misconceptions people have about mental illnesses. Unfortunately, people often see BPD‚Äôs desperate calls for help as attention seeking. For example, that is often the way people feel about self-harm and suicidal behavior. Another common misconception is that people think that all BPD sufferers are extroverts. People think all BPDs express their intense emotions at the exact moment they feel them. In fact, some of us keep a lot of those emotions to ourselves. Sometimes, it is because we are not sure how to express those feelings. Sometimes, it is because we don‚Äôt even know how we feel: there are so many emotions trapped inside of us that ask to be released.  If you know someone suffering from BPD or from any other mental illness, you have to know there is no magic way to cure for those illnesses. The person who suffers from a mental illness has to be ready to recover and that feeling can only come from her. There is nothing you can do except stand by her side while she is trying her best to recover.  

I hope that my statement will help to demystify BPD and Bulimia Nervosa among some of you. And, I hope that those of you who suffer from any mental illness will feel less lonely. I also hope it will encourage you to speak up to stop the stigmatization of mental illnesses.

184,What should I do after a breakup from the most supportive and trusted relationship,"I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago and thought that I couldn't stand it. Luckily for me, my ex-boyfriend was with me at that time. He was patient, took care of me, gave me hope and trust. It was a bad time for both of us and we passed it together. For the last 3 years, I think I have escaped from this syndrome and we were living a good life. I trusted him totally cause he's not only the man who be by my side when I'm at the worst point, he's also my friend for more than 10 years, I thought I knew everything about him. 

But last month, he suddenly broke up with me. It was a real shock cause we were still discussing marriage the day before and there's no warning sign for it. And now I'm feeling terrible. I'm feeling like I'm abandoned, thrown away like trash and I can't control my feeling anymore. Sometimes all the good memories turn back and I miss him so much, but right after that, I'll be reminded that he left me cruelly and I can just feel anger and hatred for him. Those feelings always fill in me and I can't focus on my work or anything else. I'm just miserable all the time, so many negative feeling, I don't know how to describe more detailly.

185,"Dating Among BPD, The End....","[Prev Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/s/GH7IUvIApk)


So i started dating someone with BPD, me also being diagnosed with BPD.

How it started : we longed for each other, we understood each other. Felt like we were made for eachother.

How it was : her trauma dumping on me and being the therapist for her after she promising me she won't abandon me and this is gonna last. I did promise the same thing.

How it ended : i got latched on to her, she was my FP, she splitted, i begged her to stay, she just abandoned me......

The confrontation and the explanation of my emotions during the end: the tail end of explanation to a messy short lived love story.

----‚Äê-------------

I couldn't understand that she was having a splitting episode, cuz i couldn't understand what was going on.... i loved her too much that i made her my FP, and when she split on me, it made me really miserable. I used to go in and out of panic attacks, some lasting for about hours to recover back and get back to working. Lasted till yesterday, untill i figured out what happened, and explored those emotions.

So what i feel like happened :  I had a traumatizing event when i went out for drunk, the friend i went with got bruises and concussions and was hospitalized, i was in shock, cuz i was the one who saw the whole thing and took him to the hospital. She wanted my attention even though i told her i was in shock, i gave it to her, supported her even though i was in shock, i wanted an distraction at the moment, i told her my traumatized event, she just moved away from the conversation. After a while she splitted on me saying i wasn't attentive enough. Did not know what was happening. I went with it. Tried being supportive didn't work. I begged her to stay and not abandon me, as i was fucking miserable. I tried to reconcile, cuz i accepted her as a FP, after a long time. Nah, she didn't want me anymore, i thought she would understand me and stuff, nah she just wanted to use me and make me feel like shit. To be noted, i was hesitant in the relationship. She is the one who convinced me to be in the relationship. My abandonment issues are at its max now.

So after everything i saw a post on my recommendation, where i saw someone splitting on thier loved ones, the fucking texts were literally the same. Damn i felt scammed.........

So after figuring out my emotions , and realising this was already over, i confronted her. She was still hostile towards me. When i told her she had splitted and alsked her to read upon some resources, she fucking told me, if she started reading upon BPD, she is gonna become more of a BPD person.

WTF!!!!!

Damn, that was the final red flag i needed, i actually thought she was working on herself and stuff, she then started accusing me of having BPD and how the hell would i be able to help her. This was a moment of enlightenment,  damn, i became so fucking happy and void of feelings for her, after being so miserable for a while. I did have a feeling that i was the one who pushed her away and i was the reason for abandonment, i kinda felt different after . Nah, she was the biggest redflag i had ever dated.

The happy part is this made me understand, the difference between the people who try to be better and the one's who use narcissism to deal with their issue.i have splitted with my partners, but not like this, never hurt them. If ur in this sub, its most likely that u r dealing with ur issues, and not being a narcissistic ass. This makes u a good person.

Also thanks for this subreddit for being my support system, i did really get some amazing support during every post or milestone during my short lived dating adventure.

So I should start off by saying I've been diagnosed with bpd, ptsd, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, reactive depression, and general depressive disorder, and body Dysmorphia. I've been abused my entire life, so I have zero trust with anyone, I have a two year old son, his dad was very abusive, physically and mentally, I just got away from him a few months ago, got into a new relationship recently, and it's Rocky already, because of me and my insecurities. 

I always think I'm always sick, with everything and anything.. Last night, I fell into my own ways, and cut.. The scary part is it felt good.. To open that outlet again. I KNOW it's not good.

187,The ole breakup dance,"Soooo I‚Äôm here because my partner and I have broken up. He has commitment issues, depression, and anxiety. I just recently was diagnosed with bpd. We care about each other a lot but trigger each other OFTEN. Usually when he will mention some vague future plan and doesn‚Äôt include me in it then I‚Äôll get a fear of abandonment and spiral out which then makes him recoil from my clinginess.

We‚Äôve been doing this dance for about 4 years now and have gone to couples therapy before I learned of my bpd symptoms. 

As a solution to all this he wants us to be broken up, for me to accept that, but for us to continue being intimate, and living together and working on our mental health but as ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù. I‚Äôve run this past a close friend who doesn‚Äôt have BPD and is aware of the black/white thinking that goes with bpd and he reckons this is still waaaay too hard accept even without bpd.

188,Advice on how to manage symptoms without professional help?,"This post might be a bit long so sorry in advance. tldr; I have no access to MH services and need advice on managing my symptoms. 

For a bit of background, I've had issues with anger and lashing out as long as I can remember. My other symptoms started to display between the ages of 13 and 16 and have progressively got worse as I've gotten older. I live in the UK and was with CAMHS while in college, my CAMHS worker said that she was pretty much certain I have BPD, but because I was 17 she couldn't officially diagnose me due to guidelines (something about puberty and hormones causing the symptoms, idk). My sessions were first thing on a Friday morning but as I progressed in college I needed to spend all my time on campus and couldn't go to my appointments anymore, and was discharged.

Since then I've not been to any sort of therapy, I went back to my GP at 18 and they put me on anti depressants which did absolutely nothing but made me feel worse and I stopped. I'm now nearing 21 and have been referred to my local mental health services maybe 4 or 5 times since, but nothing has ever come of it, they've just told me to self refer to drug groups/anger management groups despite the fact that I've said multiple times that my drug and anger issues are due to a larger problem, not the sole problem theirselves. I'll admit that I'd sort of given up with it due to being fucked around so many times, but recently my boyfriend got super worried after a breakdown which resulted in me not leaving my room for 6 days, bearly eating, crying near constantly and lashing out when he came to check on me because I took him not spending all 6 days with me as him not caring about me. After I'd regained my senses, I agreed to give getting help another go, and sent in an online form to the local services describing all my symptoms, explained that I've been told by CAMHS I've probably got BPD but couldn't be diagnosed at the time, and wanted help for that. 

Well this was at the beginning of March, and obviously with everything going on now, I doubt I'm going to get any help until this has all blown over.
I can feel myself slipping back into old habits, getting stupidly impulsive, saying nasty things without thinking, my moods won't stay consistent for more than an hour at a time and I'm getting increasingly paranoid that my boyfriend, housemates, family, basically everyone hates me and wants me dead. I really don't know how to handle this anymore, part of me knows I'm being ridiculous but it feels like the sane part of me is locked in a room watching the mental part of me take control and ruin every aspect of my life.

For those of you better adjusted than I am, how do you cope with these things, and generally for anyone, how do you manage your symptoms without access to proper psychological help?

192,Will I ever love myself?,"About 5 years ago I broke! I tried to go to sleep forever! I somehow lost all.ability to cope with my emotions. Though I have always been intense emotionally I was always able to ""function!"" but it became impossible! I was diagnosed with severe  depression and mild anxiety. We have tried every medication under the sun for depression.  About 2 years ago I again couldnt deal with the thought of having one more day! I was diagnosed with having Borderline personality disorder!! Once I actually received this diagnosis everything made sense. I could look back and see that I had this my whole life. I could make sense of feeling outside, I didn't feel so disgusted with myself for they way i used to hurt myself. I felt a glimmer of hope that now the healing can begin we have found the true problem. In these two years I have never been worse. I couldn't except that there was no magical pill to make me an adult again. I have closed off almost all communication from the world. I only leave my house when I have Dr appointments and only if my mother drives me (pretty pathetic) I have a nephew I only met twice and another maybe a handful of times. I have another niece and nephew that had me before I broke and now wonder where there favorite aunty has went. I can't stand to see my family all I see is pain and disappointment. All I see is their distrust that I won't kill myself. So I shut away. I can look in the mirror my view is so dark and distorted. I just want my life back. I have these people trying to help and everyone says the same thing. Only once I love myself can I find out where I belong and what I was meant to be. Only then can o find happiness. But all I have is hopelessness and an extreme hate for myself. I don't hate much I hate rapist and murders and people who hurt children or elders bit nothing is as and as the hate I have for me!! I am finally taking steps to get help. I start a group therapy program this week. I want to be realistic with my goals to avoid disappointing my family and myself once again. So really will I ever love myself? Or is this distorted view here for a lifetime? Can I have BPD and find happiness? Or is hopelessness all I will know?

195,I just realized how my maniac episodes are nowadays when I thought i didn't have any for a long time,"I've been diagnosed with BPD about 5 years ago and tbh the medication, therapy and working my self-control issues helped me get a lot better, but today I realized that every time I start talking about stupid or crazy things that I am aware that I am not going to do, but I portrait them to the people around me as if they were an actual possibility (like today when I was telling my brother how I could form a cult without a problem at 25) is that I am actually having a manic episode (like I went on and on for like 3 hours straight of how I would be able to form a fucking cult/my own nation, yeah super delulu ik) and on one hand I am afraid to tell my psychiatrist and worry him, making him medicate me even more (or worse, lock me) but on the other hand I'm relieved to know that my BPD manifests my manic episodes in this way instead of in a violent or really self-destructive way, I mean I know it's not right but it's better that it just me bluffing about doing crazy shit while being 100% aware that I'm not talking seriously than actually believing that as a reality or having any kind of reaction that hurts people or myself in any way. Although, what satisfies my ""craving for chaos"" is making people think that I am dead serious, I am aware that it is actually a joke, but it amuses me to see the reaction of the others. Is it wrong? Should I talk to my psychiatrist, even if I'm afraid of the consequences this may cause? If I'm not doing real harm to anyone, maybe there's no need to talk about it. Like, on one side I want to tell people that I don't really think like that and that it's just my way of coping so they don't worry but that would take away the whole point of it/ what's satisfying this internal urgency that I have and in the other side, perhaps by not having this coping mechanism I may develop another one that is really harmful/problematic/self-destructive. But at the same time I don't want them to worry but that reaction is what makes this coping mechanism work and cover whatever it has to cover, so that it fulfills its function. 

Like i want to talk about it with someone but I'm afraid that this will change the way they perceive me (in case it's a friend)/ it will no longer generate that reaction that ""entertains"" my need for chaos (in case it's my brother or family)/ leads me to have a more severe diagnosis or one that generates consequences when trying to fix something that, in the end, doesn't harm anyone (if I tell my psychiatrist) or generates a new coping mechanism that does lead me to do something bad to satisfy my need for ""adrenaline"" (in case my psychiatrist cures this one somehow).

I don't like ""living in peace"", I don't know how to do it, it bores me, and for now this is the healthiest way I can maintain a normal life and not do something stupid just to feel some rush.

Should I keep it to myself or talk about it with someone? For now, the person who I feel that could understand it better, give me an objective opinion and not judge me, would be my psychiatrist, BUT he is also the one who could generate the worst ""consequences"" for me In case he finds out, also, I was the only patient he actually enjoyed talking to and just had some issues but wasn't really crazy. I think this would really change that and if I tell him our sessions won't be like ""opening up to a friend"" anymore and it might become like any other medical appointment, which I don't want to bc i felt really safe talking to him and we made a lot of progress this way...

196,Success and Struggles,"I really just needed to talk about things with others that may be able to relate.

Some BG:

So, I've had mental health issues as long as I can really remember. I was in and out of psych hospitals and treatment from my mid-teens until present (now almost 36). I am diagnosed with both MDD and BPD, and while things have improved a lot since I was younger, things are still a struggle a lot of the time. I'm learning that I'll never really react to the world as someone who's more 'neurotypical', and that's okay. I instead need to learn how to be more effective in managing how I deal with the ways I experience my world. I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, I have not been able to work for a long time now. I have a huge issue with being able to consistently get up and out of bed and in to work. After enough of that, well you get fired. And after losing enough jobs, you just kinda say it's not for you. :/

Well, after years  of not working outside the home, I had my first day of sorta work yesterday. I say sorta cus it's more of a side gig type thing my husband got me at his job. I'll go in on Saturdays, with my husband, and help out.

It was nerve wracking. It keyed me up for hours before and after. (I didn't sleep Friday, went in to work Sat, got home Saturday night and slept for like 4 hours, and now I'm awake again. FML) I had to be around people I only sort of know, and I don't really leave the house, like at all. I was scared of screwing up, and looking incompetent, and reflecting badly on my husband. I was afraid of talking to much (which I do when I'm nervous) I'm still not sure if everyone liked me or was faking it.

I was with my boyfriend for a little over a year and had never in my life met someone I swore would always at the very least care about me. Someone who would always stay a friend at the end of the day no matter what. I thought our bond was so strong and special that it would never break. Tonight it did. The woman he swore I would never need to worry about? His ex wife he swore he would never even call a friend. Tonight he is in a hotel with her and their children at the beach and the deed has most likely already been done. I have been diagnosed bpd and have NEVER trusted someone so much. We have been broken up now since December but lately it‚Äôs seemed just too easy for him and last night it was confirmed why. I thought I was going to grow old with this man. My children asked to call him dad. I loved him children so immensely. He swore and swore he would never entertain her in any way and here I am spending all day and night non stop puking from panic attack after panic attack and crying since 5am yesterday. I have children but I can‚Äôt function. I also have ocd and I usually go to cutting when I feel this much pain inside of me but I‚Äôm been working so hard to quit. Tonight broke me apart. I have zero will or want to live other than my children now. I pictured them holding each other in their hotel room all day and night. And when the sun went down I lost it. I lost all of what I had left to love of myself inside of me. I have his poetry tattood on my shoulder where he used to kiss me when we made love. I had never felt safe and loved during sex before him. All night tonight knowing they were in a hotel together I pictured them making love over and over and so detailed I swore I could hear it. I lost my mind and blew him up so much begging for him to please make it stop for me, that he told me a restraining order has been set in stone. He‚Äôs made me begging and voicing my complete betrayal and hurt of him ending up in her arms and having sex with her of all people, just me being utterly insane and unsafe. He‚Äôs turned into someone who acts like he never even loved me once. Was never my best fucking friend. Was never so in love with me we could take the world on and feel so good. You guys I feel like since I could not take my life tonight as I so wish I could have, it hurt that much, that I lost all ounce of self worth, dignity, hope, love for myself and just all sense of wanting to carry on for good. I swear I felt the pain get so intense tonight that I felt myself leave my damn body. I‚Äôve never cried this much in my life. I‚Äôve never hurt so much in my whole god damn  much. The amount of betrayal if you guys even knew‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all too much overwhelming and all consuming. I was literally screaming out in pain for god to please make the pain stop. That is so anything. He said I need help tonight and he‚Äôs right. He hasn‚Äôt once acknowledged or even cared about how much this has broken me apart. The only thing he‚Äôs done has been to make me feel even shttiwr than myself. I can‚Äôt do this. I have zero coping skills and apparently now I‚Äôm not a safe person and there‚Äôs a restraining order placed against me by someone I swore would be there for me ni matter what. I don‚Äôt know where to go from here, I can‚Äôt contemplate this is really happening to me and I just have this overwhelming want to rip this tattoo straight off my skin. I know I‚Äôm insane.

198,Help for Borderline Personality Disorder?,I've never used this site so my apologies if I'm doing anything wrong... I am in desperate need of help. A year ago I was diagnosed with BPD. I thought I could handle it on my own and for a few months while I was by myself I could control the disorder. I've been in a relationship for maybe eight months and it's hit the point of no return. There's something about being in a relationship that triggers my deeply embedded issues of abandonment. I need help despite my hatred of talking about my feelings. Has anyone tried using medication to regulate BPD? Has anyone gone through DBT? Is simply speaking to someone the solution? I would greatly appreciate any support or advice.

200,Need someone to talk to,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439534.0,False,4,3,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ad08fd/need_someone_to_talk_to/

202,Sponsors?,"Hello, I have just started a partial hospitalization program and am taking my recovery from BPD more seriously. A friend, who is in 12 step, recommended I find someone like a sponsor for my journey and I think this is a great idea.

The biggest difficulty for me is that I do not have a space to meet potential sponsors. As with most PHP groups, we are not allowed to contact each other outside of group until we're both discharged. So, I have come to reddit. I was thinking perhaps this could be a thread to match each other, if we feel comfortable.

If you think you'd be a good match for me feel free to send a DM. If you don't think so, that's okay, and  I welcome you to post what you're looking for!

For myself, I live in Seattle and would love to find someone local. I understand we're currently all at home for COVID, so I am happy to start virtually but I'd love to find someone who I could perhaps get coffee with sometimes, but this is not required. It is very important to me to find someone who is also professionally diagnosed and in treatment, especially if you are doing or have ever done PHP or IOP. At this point, I'd say my BPD is moderately managed and I am looking for support with someone who is also somewhat managed. My goal is remission, I hope yours is too!

Sometimes though, I don‚Äôt know what to do when he‚Äôs angry about something you wouldn‚Äôt really expect. He‚Äôll give a lot of emotion. When he calms down he apologizes. I just want to know what I can do, to help him more or be here for him. I love him so much and don‚Äôt want to see him suffering.

204,Talking with my work/coworkers about my BPD,"Hey ya'll,

Last year I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. It has been quite the road having discussions with my family and friends. At first, some of my friends reacted as ""That puts all the pieces of the puzzle together. I'm glad you explained."" Others don't seem to want to take the time to REALLY understand what having BPD means and how it can positively or negativity effect a relationship. My family on the other hand, completely denied me.. for months, just about a year. I can still hear my dad swallow his pride when we have conversations but he is coming around. 

Anyway I do have some trauma with sharing my experiences with BPD because I have had to defend my own disorder at a time when I was already feeling guilty for even sharing or denying it myself. 

I understand that sharing my own personal experiences would be helpful for my coworkers but honestly, they are not all safe people for me to open up to, so I want to be technical with what I share. I really want to have them understand what having a relationship or in their case, working with someone who has BPD can be like. 

I know I want to mention to them that I have repressed trauma that will come up randomly and result in, wherever I am or whatever I am doing I have to leave and go process however that may look. (Usually for me its having multiple mental break downs until I feel better.) 

Has anyone ever gone through this process before? 

Anyone have any advise on what topics of BPD I could discuss with them?",1564013579.0,False,0,3,mommasaidnoEm,None,chgaqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/chgaqw/talking_with_my_workcoworkers_about_my_bpd/
205,Partially recovered. Trying to figure out what's next is screwing me up.,"Quick summary. Mid 30s, female. Diagnosed BPD a little under 2 years ago. Long history of, well, everything you'd expect. Went to DBT, learned a lot, got a lot better, but still struggling. 

Several months ago, I had a ""final meeting"" with my therapist where we agreed that I needed time to process what I'd learned so far. 

I think it might be time for me to go back, but I'm not sure. I'm hoping maybe I can get some feedback to help me figure that out, and figure out whether I should see the same therapist or try a new one. 

My therapist was amazing. She explained things to me in a way that I could really understand. She validated my emotions consistently and taught me how to do the same for myself. She has been certified in DBT for many years, and she specializes in BPD.

I feel like I was emotionally a 6 year old child when I started to see her, and she helped me grow considerably. 

Now I feel like it's time for me to learn to stop coddling myself quite so much and become a fully functional adult. 

Problem is, ever since I altered my expectations of myself in that way, I've noticed my symptoms resurfacing. 

I don't *want* to be an emotional child forever. I *want* to move more toward normalcy, but I'm absolutely not willing to undo everything I've done so far.

207,"Abandonment, too scary and heart breaking","&#x200B;

kn I have been diagnosed with BPD since 3 years now. (I am 21). Abusive parents, abandonment issues, bullied at school, I have ADHD and OCD too. But as the fool I am, I thought someone will still stay with me. I don't think that is ever possible now. Last year, my parents told me how my sexual harrassment means nothing to them as it is not rape. I was shattered. Took an overdose of tranqs and cut myself. I never expected my parents to be nice, but I hoped they would be, and then this happened. That last bit of hope died inside of me. My then boyfriend didnt give 2 shits about it. I was depressed and asked him to just sit with me so I can study, he blatantly refused. He also abused me verbally. Told me he has to spoonfeed me and that I am nothing without him. He was my best friend for an year and then we dated for 1.75 years. He abandoned me when I needed him the most. I broke up with him. Additionally he was a nightmare for someone with OCD. And I decided not to date again as with all the issues I have, I didnt expect someone would stay.

&#x200B;

Then came my current bf, a completely different person. We fell in love. Things were going great. I moved to a different continent 1.5 months ago for an internship. I am here for 1.5 more. Things got bad. One day I was restless and irritated and tired and frustrated. He was trying to make some arrangements for us to watch something together on a video call. I was suggesting something else and he wouldnt listen. My anger got a hold of me and I started throwing stuff around. He got scared. We had conversations about it and he was not at all fine mentally by me throwing stuff angrily as he felt I would have thrown stuff at him too if we were together in person (there are reasons for his fear, it is not irrational) couple days later i split on him. And then i apologised. And he said the apology is sudden and he can't believe I am sorry. I tried convincing him it was legit and at one point i said ""i have bpd, i change"". next day he sent me articles on splitting. he said he  doesnt know how to handle this. (before all this he was pretty exhausted due to recurring fights between us) He said he doesnt  even  know if he *can,* handle this. Which i completely understand, it is not easy. i dont expect anyone to ever handle me. 

&#x200B;

Then things changed drastically. He has some serious issue at his home. He really cant focus on anything else right now He still texts me. He still asks about my therapy and how I am. But things between us are sensitive now and I dont see him coming back. I dont expect he will, i just wish, and hope, and want, and need him to come back. He is all i can think of. I believe I deserve this abandonment. I am damaged beyond repair and expecting someone will stay with me is far-fetched. No one will stay with me. I am hard to be with. And he is not coming back as he will be exhausted af.

&#x200B;

I have regular suicidal thoughts. I dont act on them tho, it is a discussion him and me had, and no one of us will act on those thoughts. But they are persistent. I get depressed randomly. I get stuck in ADHD Paralysis. I wish I had someone by my side. Atleast to talk to. I feel lonely and abandoned and stranded. I dont have a single clue as to what I should do next. I am waiting for the 1.5 months to pass and I can meet him.

208,Clingy/not being able to be alone or handle any kind of news well,"I blow up things in my head like most diagnosed with BPD. 
At this rate, I'll never have friends that at least won't be affected by my disorder. 
I have two friends, one I barely see because she's in the foster system and in regular school. The other I've grown most close to, talk to every day and spend almost every weekend together is a loner. She finally opened up and told me exactly what I've been worrying about, how my negative talk and behavior is affecting her. She no longer wants to talk all day or spend the night, it makes me really sad. Brings tears to my eyes.
She's my best friend and if she can't handle me; the strongest person I know, had been with me through hell and back for almost four years? I've never known a more real and trustworthy person and I don't trust easily. 

I'm just so fucking lonely, god, if I don't talk to someone constantly I feel crazy. I try to distract myself, believe me. I've tried painting, drawing, watching movies, talking in therapy and etc but this has been happening for years.

It's now been 2 years since going through therapy and I'm approaching my 25th birthday, I honestly didn't think I'd make it here, I was set on destroying myself. I haven't self harmed or attempted suicide since, in my darkest days I was hospitalised at least once a week.

I've been in a full time job and found out what I want to do. I still don't have many friends, still finding it hard to form relationships, and I still feel like my boyfriend will leave me for whatever reasons I can conjur up. But it's getting better.

210,FINALLY getting my diagnosis assessment and im scared of fucking it up,"Backstory: 24 years old, ive long known that there was something different about me, I grew up with a tough childhood, as did most if not all the people in this group. Finally went to the doctor sometime in my late teens and got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, the classic -.- im not saying that wasn't and still isn't true now but even back then, I knew that it was deeper than that. Since the age of roughly 15 I suspected BPD(now called EUPD), Attachment disorder or aspergers (now known as part of ASD)
That put me onto a natural interest in mental health and different disorders, the varying types of anxiety and personality disorders etc. This interest and build of knowledge also helped me immensly when it came to dealing with my mums own mental health crashes, my dads alcoholism and in turn, his eventual passing 6 years ago, my grandad 2 months later and my nan about a year after that. Life's just great, ain't it *insert eye roll here for full effect*

Cut back to the here and now, after several counsellors, different GP's, years worth of personal research and honestly just trying to find someone to believe me that it isn't just depression that I've been carrying around since I was like 4.

Well. Its finally happening!!!! I've got a video call apppintment happening in less than 3 weeks and I am so glad to finally be getting some answers and get on a track to treatments. I'm going to be tested for EUPD, CPTSD and she'll give me a brief screening for autism and if there is anything that comes from that I'll be redirected.

However, I am CRAP when it comes to actually explaining my symptoms and behaviours and thought patterns, things that have happened to me in the past, reactions I had to events or people when something happened etc... 
I'm going to preface the interview by telling her that I'm not very good with this sort of thing, especially as its going to be a video chat and not in person so I won't be able to gauge her reactions. Basically im terrified of messing up my chance to learn whats up with me by downplaying things or not wording things right.

Does anyone have any tips for diagnosis interviews, how to make sure you remember everything they will want to know about?? What kind of questions will they ask??

I had a flash back the other night from when I was raped (which is really hard to put that word down, it happened 3 years or so ago and I still can't say it out loud) and I've been extremely out of it since. Dissociating, severe mood swings, suicidal thoughts, the whole shebang.

Today I ended up cutting pretty badly and ended up in the ER for fear of overdosing. They discharged me and I've got to have someone watch me until my therapy appointment on Tuesday. I'm so out of it. The resident psychiatrist said there wouldn't be any point to admitting me since she believes I was suicidal from stress and just wanting to die because I wanted to escape.

If anyone knows anything about psychology, how the brain works, or anything about BPD in general any suggestions or answers would be very helpful!! So I don't normally post stuff about my mental health issues (unless I'm just in a really bad way and I have no where else to vent but social media, then I'll do that but otherwise I won't post) but I thought it would be a good idea to post my question here. I was diagnosed w/ it about 3 years ago I would say and I've had it ever since and my mom, therapist, and psychiatrist have been starting to think I've had this for a while. But for the past 2-3 years esp this year, it's been getting harder and harder to remember things. For ex this esp happens a lot w/ anything school or college related. Last fall semester I was bran new to college it was my freshman year. I had 4 classes I was taking all that were morning and lasted throughout late afternoon. I would get the syllabus I read over it. But I believe it was on the first Friday of the first week I already had a quiz but it was over the syllabus. I had read the syllabus and I knew there was a test but I wasn't sure what info would be on the test. So I read it over that night and that morning when I got into class before it started. But when it came to the test, the test had questions on it and I couldn't remember anything at all. This is just one example. Later that semester I got a planner so I could write my assignments down. And I did write them down I even went to my accessibility counselor to come up w/ a plan for writing things down and I would go in every Monday once a week to write the assignments and/or tests/quizzes for that week or if I had any papers do. I would write these down but when the test/quiz came up I didn't remember until my professor had mentioned it in class about two days, sometimes it would even be the day before the test and then I would have to spend all the rest of the day studying, or all the rest of the days I had left to study and because I spend so much time typing up flash cards on this online website called Quizlet, and I didn't know what info would be on the test either and we had to use the info from the power points which were somewhere between 20--50 slides on each PowerPoint. And this took me all afternoon and even way late into the evening to type up so I barley had enough time to study. I even pulled 2 all nighters in a row one week. And then because I didn't have that much time to study I barley remembered the info for the test/quiz the next day. My question is, does anyone in this page have BPD and have you experienced problems like this? Or does anyone experience bad memory problems in general? Did you ever overcome it? If so what did you do to fix it, or at least relieve some stress off of this issue? I ended up having to drop out of the fall semester classes cause I got to stressed about it.

When we first met, we both communicated very well about how we were & what we feel our ups/downs are. About 6mos in, I started having symptoms of a BPD split bc of a situation in which I attempted to let her in on my grief (something I guard ferociously) & it wasn‚Äôt perceived. At that time, it seemed as if she didn‚Äôt care about me the way I‚Äôd been believing she did up until then. That initiated my split & to be completely honest, I cannot even begin to list or explain the things that I was feeling. I just was feeling as though she was completely against me & didn‚Äôt understand why she stayed around. I was drowning in the moment that caused the split & got stuck in that spiral. While she, on the other hand, was pushing & pushing for me to meet her needs in the present moments. (Theres things & moments that I‚Äôm leaving out for the sake of trying not to make this post way longer). In December (2 days before her birthday), I was told something that was along the lines of her cheating on me that dated back to the summer. This set me off even more & when I brought it to her attention, she seemed as though it wasn‚Äôt important enough to take upon herself to rectify. That made me feel like there‚Äôs some truth to the information, which I still haven‚Äôt been able to let go of. In January she moved out & back with her family in an attempt to put space so we can get better. In my opinion, it was working up until mid-Feb when she came to me about a personal medical situation that threw me for a loop especially seeing how we‚Äôd been intimate & I was being made aware of it just over a month after she moved. I was feeling very much so like just as we were going to be able to close the door on one thing, another door of bs opens up. I started feeling overwhelmed again & I didn‚Äôt feel like I had any support from her because she was worried about why I wasn‚Äôt giving her what she wanted/needed from me in the moment. I tried explaining that I was having a hard time processing everything (I process from the past to the present, not the present to the past so it‚Äôs basically like everything in the present is on pause while I go thru the past to identify different things). At the end of February/beginning of March, I reached out to an ex due to the fact that I‚Äôd noticed similarities between that relationship & this one that I wanted to correctly identify so I could change it in the present. That led to her & I spending about a week or so together with her spending the nights here. On the day that the ex was leaving, my person came in & saw her standing in my room while I was in bed freshly showered & had just taken my robe off to lay down (so it looked way worse than it was). That led to a long night of me explaining the BPD split, the reason I reached out to my ex in the first place, as well as the lies I‚Äôd told to keep it from being found out. I admitted it was super impulsive & I didn‚Äôt think at all before doing it, as well as not taking into account how it‚Äôd look or be perceived by anyone else. I told her it could be fixed & we could get better but it‚Äôd take a lot of work to do so simply bc I‚Äôm now in a space where I realize I let my BPD get way out of control. I was in my own shit storm for 8mos at that point & I have a lot of work to do to repair this relationship that‚Äôs been broken for about 5 of those 8. The next couple of weeks was kinda hard, there were some uncomfortable conversations but I did my best & explained as much as I could. I started changing my behavior as well. Last week there was a night she‚Äôd come over to spend time with me & asked to see the text messages between my ex & I, in which I told her I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with that due to the sensitivity of the conversations (they were majorly centered around my grief & my feelings/emotions during the first two years of it prior to the breakup). It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want her to know now, I just feel like there‚Äôs steps that need to be taken before that due to the fact that up until this moment, the only time my grief has been brought up is during an argument about something else. She never asks me about it, and to me it doesn‚Äôt make sense to allow her into that part of myself without her ever even trying to talk about it with me. She‚Äôs now said to me that she started seeing someone, and is done trying to pressure me to open up to her. I‚Äôve been doing CBT/DBT, as well as the BPD workbook by Dr. Fox all on my own to be able to get better for myself as well as the betterment of our relationship. I‚Äôm stuck feeling like I‚Äôm not being given a chance to actually open myself completely up to expose myself to the person that I want nothing less than forever with. I texted her this morning asking if we could talk in person because I need to be able to convey this to her. I‚Äôm just not sure how to go about it at all - what do I say or not say, what options there are to hold myself to, and more importantly if she can be the support I need to get us on the same page again so we can move forward. Does anyone have any suggestions on what things to touch on and what to leave alone? I really want us to seek couples therapy to bridge the gap that we‚Äôve wedged.

214,Need feedback on controlling my temper,"So, I feel like I've been doing REALLY well lately at controlling my temper. I haven't ""lost my shit"" in a really long while (like months). But obviously because I'm human I still have feelings of anger. I tend to raise my volume a little when upset, but I haven't ""yelled"" or ""screamed"" (which is my definition of losing my shit). In particular my husband is not pleased with how I deal with my frustration/anger with my 3-year old. I am with him all day long and he can be...well he 3 so kind of a psycho! haha (Anyone with kids knows exactly what I'm talking about.) 

I've been really proud of myself, but my husband (particularly in the moment) tells me I need to be calm when disciplining. I try that ""nice"" approach often, but he (the child) doesn't respond. He doesn't think I'm serious. So I talk more firmly and raise my volume (not really intentionally...I'm just a loud person in general). But I need some feedback here. Am I wrong? I don't see ""that look"" my son used to get when I lost my temper the other way before. He used to look absolutely terrified of me. It broke my heart. Now he just looks at me knowing that he made a bad choice and is getting a consequence.  

I feel like I'm doing ok. Maybe I'm not the perfect mom and definitely don't have the robotic demeanor that my husband does (and most certainly can't just tune the kid out like he does), but does that mean I'm still fucking up or ??? I just don't know. I don't have anyone else to talk to about this. Only my husband knows I am diagnosed with BPD and he's the one telling me I'm being a bad mom.",1483727841.0,False,3,2,slow-regard,None,5mf9uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/5mf9uk/need_feedback_on_controlling_my_temper/
215,Trigger Warning (suicidal thoughts and self harm). This is just a rant so I apologise if I don't make much sense.,"I was just thinking about how my family (specially my mom) are just a bunch of hypocrites (for lack of a better word because English is not my native language).

I've been self harming since I was 14 (I'm 26 now) yet my mom still doesn't think there's anything wrong with me. To give you an idea this is what happened the other day ([link to post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gptoy7/trigger_warning_selfharm/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)). I was one of those teenagers who didn't think would make it to adulthood and now that I am an adult I'm sometimes sure that I will die of suicide someday (though I don't really plan on doing anything to myself short-term). 

The thing is I was just thinking about that and realised that if I end up killing myself I know that my mother would say thing like ""I wish I had known she felt this way so that I could have helped her"" and shit like that when, whenever I'm feeling very depressed and I've talked to her about it, she has always dismissed my feelings telling me that everyone has problems and everyone feels sad from time to time and that I just need to toughen up and stop being so dramatic.

And the worst part is that I know she wouldn't feel like she did anything wrong, because she really doesn't realise that I'm hurting and that the way she treats my feelings only makes me feel worse. So she would most probably be genuinely surprised if I enden up killing myself. 

My depression or whatever it is I have (I haven't really been officially diagnosed with anything, not even BPD, but this is the community I feel most comfortable in and I relate the most to) has always been hidden from everyone in my family except for my stepfather, my mom and one of my aunts, nobody else know because my mom loves appearances and seeming like the perfect mother with the perfect children.

I don't even know what I'm saying anymore, sorry. I get so mad when I think about it that my head races and I can't think straight. 

Anyway, thank you for reading if you got this far into my rant. I didn't really make any points or ask for any advice, but I needed to get this out of my chest and tell it to people who would understand.",1590843533.0,False,6,1,ghost_snakk,None,gtdw29,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gtdw29/trigger_warning_suicidal_thoughts_and_self_harm/
216,"DAEs brain ""shut down"" when they're ""in trouble""?","I'm very newly diagnosed with BPD, and the most comforting(?) thing for me is reading through forums and finding that so many people experience all these ""quirks"" that I've just kind of...thought made me weird for quite a long time. One that I'm particularly wondering about is whether anyone else just shuts down when they're in a highly stressed state. I think particularly for me, this happens if I'm ""in trouble"" from someone - not due to a self-instigated argument over nothing, but legitimately because I've done something wrong, and they have a legitimate right to be angry at me. I don't really know how to explain it, but in these sorts of situations I'm pretty sure I come off as almost sociopathic, because someone can be screaming and crying at me, and I will be really expressionless, sans emotion and pretty much unresponsive. I know I'm doing it and I'm fine with that, it's comfortable and safe and numb. It's like, if I was a hermit crab, I would be drawing into my shell or something? More to the point though, I couldn't do anything about it even if I wanted to. It feels like my higher functions really do stop and there's nothing I can do about it and I just need to ride out the storm and reply later. 

I mean, it can be way less serious than this. It can be a boss being like ""why didn't you finish this"" and me not being able to make eye contact and mumbling ""I'll have to check"" even though I know the answer but I need to go back to my desk and hide and write an email because I can't formulate a response to his/her face.

217,What to do at this point - suggestions welcomed,"I have been diagnosed with BPD for almost 8 years now. One of the hardest parts of my illness is right now. I have never had healthy relationships until now - well at least it used to be. I have been with the love of my life for about a year and a half now. A lot of the times I was awful... now I mean awful. I was mean, irrational and not a good person to be around. Why did I do that if I love him so much? I pushed him away to the point where he is not ""in it"" anymore. Doesn't feel engaged to be with me considering how horrible I was to him. We are currently on a ""break"" to see if he misses me and wants to be with me but we live together and it is extremely hard. I am trying to stay positive and hoping that this will reconnect us. It has been a couple of weeks now and I am not as hopeful anymore. When I get super anxious or depressed I get physically ill. To the point where I cannot go anywhere bc I am vomiting so much and I don't eat.  I am sooo fearful and worried that he will end it with me. He is the only person to actually understand me. I love him so much. He used to tell me I looked nice, want to touch me and we used to write little notes on the fridge for each other. He doesn't seem happy with me even when I am trying to engage in conversation with him or what have you. I have been trying very hard to be a ""normal"" person. I am on a good balance of meds I believe, and I am going to a personality disorder clinic/programs hopefully this upcoming September. I just don't know what to do. He doesn't like talking about it bc he has talked about it so much with me that he thinks I don't ""get it"". I do get it now and I want to be the person i was when we first got together. I was fun, outgoing, easy to talk to and affectionate. I really want my relationship back.. he means everything to me.

218,Frustrated with partney,"My partner is very lazy and it is very hard for me to deal with as being a patient of BPD. He would use this against me and try to gain sympathy from others. We both have business together where he drives me places to places as I can't drive and it gives me anxiety. I deal with customers, manage online activity and sell in the store, clean store tidy it up. In the whole time if I let him take care of customer he will less product in such a low price that I would lose money (I don't understand how he does it when there is a price tag and I don't understand people haggling). Any after coming back home his only job is to serve me food and feed the animals(we have dog and a cat). I come home , vaccum the house, pick up all the dishes he has left everywhere ( I had several fights and screamed my lungs off but didn't work) all the rubbish dog threw around. He will sit on his arse in the mean time as he worked all day and dealt with me a person with BPD.  He uses this as a wild card after I got diagnosed with sever anxiety and BPD. It's so frustrating living with him. While cleaning if I ask him to organize he won't do it. He only wants to relax. In the store he doesn't do anything, he wants to relax. I don't know how else to react . I get so frustrated and angry and tired and so helpless. I cook food for him,cook my food. He is really ungrateful. If he cuts Vegetables or even bring me food he will take a note of it and tell me he has been doing work while I sat down. I scream and yell as I have BPD and he suffers. He talks shit about me with his mother. His mother wanted to give us some fruit trees as a gift I didn't want them as I didn't want more responsibility. If I don't water them or take care of them, they are simply left backyard dying. He told his mother it's my BPD that I refused but she got them anyway as her son wanted them. I have nobody to talk to.my family lives in Jordan, his family is my family. I just clench my teeth and once while go for an big big episode.

219,Depressed and feeling lost,"I was diagnosed with BPD in July. I also started dating this girl who has BPD, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and schizoaffective disorder. Recently she went to the hospital and is getting help for her voices and hallucinations. She's been admitted to multiple hospitals multiple times over the last few years. I broke up with her while she's there and she comes home tomorrow. She really wants to get back together but everyone keeps telling me she's abusive and manipulative and is trying to tell me what I want to here, bring emotionally manipulative, to get me back. 

I need an unbiased opinion.

So she has cheated on me, claiming she didn't know it was cheating (I slept with someone while she was in a hospital in August while we were on a break and she says it's still cheating). She also was talking to men at one point in a sexual manner because she wanted the attention and wasn't 100% sure she was gay. She started that before we were officially dating. We dated for about 7 months. She is a party animal that copes with stress by drinking and I'm not really much for partying any more. Bad decisions are her forte because that's what she's known for the past few years and I've done everything I can to help her. My therapist says I act more as a parental figure than a girlfriend to her, which I've been working on changing myself. 

I guess that I want to believe she can and will change, because I made a drastic change from being with my ex to who I am now. Am I crazy for wanting to keep trying to believe her?",1453417502.0,False,5,2,PiffTheFairyMuffin,None,422lkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/422lkj/depressed_and_feeling_lost/
220,BPD and ignorant family,"Hi all ! First time posting in this group. I just need to vent to a community that will understand. 

I was diagnosed with BPD in early March, so I‚Äôm still trying to get a handle on things. I have been unable to access counselling due to the pandemic so with the help of my husband and two very close friends we have been able to educate ourselves a little more about BPD. The only people who don‚Äôt understand or care are my family. Mainly my mum, older sister and twin sister. 

To cut a long story short me and my husband have been trying for a baby for 6 years and unfortunately I‚Äôve suffered a couple of miscarriages. This absolutely broke me mentally. 

My twin, who I am usually quite close with despite her ignorance of my illness, has just found out she is pregnant. (My older sister video called us the end of last year to tell us all she was pregnant and my twin called me after as she knew I was upset about it and even said that it was tacky and insensitive how she told us) however today, my twin told us all in a video group chat about her pregnancy. 

I did not react how they wanted me to react. I left the video call without saying congratulations because I didn‚Äôt want them to see me upset and give me a hard tome about it. This was still the case, the video chat must‚Äôve turned bitchy because my mum started texting and so my husband called her to explain. She spent around 10/15 minutes complaining about me and saying that I‚Äôm ‚Äúout off order, that I‚Äôm shutting my family out, and that I need to get over it (those exact words)...‚Äù obviously more was said but for the sake of my sanity I won‚Äôt be writing it all out. 

I‚Äôm crushed, I left a VM on my mums phone as she refused to speak to me, I took the phone off my husband to try and explain but she hung up. 

The only person that‚Äôs really tried to communicate and reach out was my older sister but that wasn‚Äôt without her own options on the situation. I‚Äôve attempted to apologise to everyone but this hasn‚Äôt received any type of response. 

Just really at a loss. I‚Äôm completely crushed and I don‚Äôt understand why they just don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs bad enough having a twin that I‚Äôm always in ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù with and I tell her everything, it‚Äôs worse having a family who just doesn‚Äôt get it... or wants to understand",1591561155.0,False,3,1,JustStack1990,None,gyjm8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gyjm8f/bpd_and_ignorant_family/
221,"Trying to heal myself ,need some advice","I've been diagnosed with BPD since my teens (25 now). At the time I was addicted to drugs, cutting and one suicide attempt. Two hospital visits from that I met a guy who helped me get out of my rut , we lived together for 3 years with his support I finished nursing school and am currently a nurse. I ended up leaving him two years ago and had a streak of extremely unsuccessful relationships with very damaging people with warning signs so bright it took immense denial to stay in them. This last one really did a number on me and now it's over .. He left .. After all that lol. Now I'm trying to get over it, deal with feelings of depression but most of all my extremely deep feelings of loneliness, and insecurity. I've decided I need to start healing myself , started taking zyprexa ( which I have been on and off due to its SE of tiredness and drowsyness) . Zyprexa in particular BC it helps me eat , I have this obsession that if I gain 15 pounds everything will work out. I'm very thin I'm 5'2 90 lbs. I've been chain smoking a pack a day for a month. My issue is tha I'm not enough for myself, as damaging as my relationships had been it took a relationship for me to become motivated and feel better, alone I seem to be incapable but I must try. I came to this group today hoping to find that motivation here to help me stop smoking which btw metabolizes zyprexa faster and I'm
Not getting the full effect of the medication :/. I'm also starting nightshifts at work so if I feel lonely now during the day I can't imagine what nights alone and awake will feel like.
