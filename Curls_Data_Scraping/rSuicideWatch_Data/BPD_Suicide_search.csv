0,BPD 10%er,"I have borderline.

I'm tired. 

My dad just died last month. I'm trying to do his estate. My mom is dead. 

My 6 year relationship is failing more daily. I can't spend the time HE wants bc I'm working on estate / am DEPRESSED. our communication is crap. We argue. When I try and remove myself it makes it worse (I've been taught to remove myself from those situations.)

I hate having borderline. 

I started cutting when I was about 13. Had a near fatal attempt 10 years ago in November. The only one. 

I've been going to my psychiatrist weekly for the last month and forgot this past week,  that's how clouded my mind is.  

I'm tired of everything. 

I don't feel like he loves me anymore or that he wants me to love him. Everything is getting destroyed.

13,"Bpd, autism and joint/co-ordination issues. ","I wake up depressed, and pass out exhausted from fighting the undeniable hatred. 

I have serious joint, co-ordination and bilateral integration problems due to brain damage I suffered as a teen from a car accident. I had brain scans that came back clean but I was still left handicapped.

I can’t grasp things properly, drop things all the time and leaning for something is impossible without falling over. It’s embarrassing, humiliating and makes me feel worthless and useless. I will forever be living a life sub par to ‘normal people’. Life is shit, and I’m pretty sure it will get worse as I get older.

My mum found me a therapist to help me and then told me I couldn’t have the sessions with her. She got the diagnosis report and then told me she didn’t want me to get the help. It felt like she dangled the solution in front of me and then ripped it away. She may as well have tortured me. She made me feel like crap bc the report is bscly j the stuff wrong with you and then just left me with the horrible feelings. She always does this and I hate her for it, but she’s a therapist so no one will ever see the bad in her. She just isn’t there enough, isn’t a good enough mother. She doesn’t care enough about me to see how much I am suffering. If your own mother doesn’t care, who tf else is going to?

Autism means that no one will ever socially accept me. I am automatically hated and disliked by everyone. I have never felt included or . I’m so fucking tired of feeling like I have to ‘earn’ social approval or whatever it’s exhausting and I never get it, people are still dicks, except now they think you’re a loser bc you’re a people pleaser. I need to be left alone a lot but people never respect this and then I just break.

Bpd means that every day is a rollercoaster or pain and suffering. I can’t cope with the severity of the emotional trauma of it, sometimes it makes me feel sick. 

I used to love sport, but now I’m too scared to leave the house because of people treating me like shit. When I want to go for a run, people act scared of me or avoid me as if I am a 6ft man when I’m an average sized woman and it has traumatised me. No one has ever acknowledged how scary it is for me to be a woman in this fucked up society ever in my life, and I’m tired of it. 

People treat me like I’m uneducated and a lowlife bc I’m non white.

15,"BPD diagnosis, should I end it now?","I'm 20F, and after cutting myself to the point of getting stitches I got referred to a psychiatrist. He strongly suspected I have BPD and prescribed me  Abilify on top of my antidepressants. It doesn't seem to help for now. 

Reading up on the symptoms, I do relate to most of it besides the anger outburst. I don't get just sad, I feel profound grief when anything bad happens. I get so depressed it hurts physically, I'm in so much pain and can't handle it anymore.
My self esteem is at its lowest ever. 

I've also read a lot of bad things people say about BPD, and it made me feel even worse about myself. Some people seem to think anyone with BPD is a monster. I'm already dealing with tons of guilt and shame, I lost my only friends due to my binge drinking and stupid behavior. I don't mean to hurt people, but I still do. I think it would be better if I killed myself soon so I avoid hurting anyone else accidentally. I already have a plan.

Since BPD isn't really treatable, I also feel like I'm going to be in pain forever. I've already been depressed for 7 years now. I also deal with alcoholism, an eating disorder, terrible anxiety and dissociation. I've been sexually abused by 3 different person I trusted, people I thought were my friends.

17,My BPD Will Be The Death Of Me,"I truly feel that my Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) will be the death of me.

I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) as well at Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) but nothing truly destroys me more than my BPD. 

I've suffered from mental illnesses since I was 12 years old but the development of BPD has truly been a nightmare and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

Once again, my FP has left me and once again I have hit rock bottom. I truthfully from the bottom of my heart do not feel like I'll be able to push through like I did before. 

Every other time I've gone through loss like this, I've had support from family and medical professionals as well as my medication. 

But today? I have nothing.

I have no family that can help. I can't afford my medications nor can I afford a therapist. I can't afford to go to the ER and tell them I want to die. I can't afford to call a suicide hotline in fear of them calling the authorities to my house and being forcibly hospitalized and then receiving a medical bill with thousands of dollars worth of treatments.

I can't.

I truly feel hopeless. Suicide IS my only answer. 

I try to distract myself with work but once I get home, the reality sets in. 

I am worthless. I destroy myself and everyone around me. I am cursed with this awful disorder that I didn't ask for. I am forced to suffer in agony for the rest of my life and there is nothing I can do about it. 

I **will** kill myself. I know I can't live on like this.

20,BPD,"I have known ever since I can remember, that I will eventually take my own life. As a kid, I always thought it would be by 18. For a short while, I was proud of myself for surpassing that.

Around 19, I was diagnosed with BPD. Every single relationship I’ve had, has lasted 2 months at max. Every. Single. One. Even then, they were based on my own delusions and idealizations. My relationships all added together don’t even amount to 1 year. I am 29 years old in December. 

I have been diagnosed by not only one, but multiple psychiatrists. I have voluntarily checked myself in. I’ve purchased skillbooks, I’ve invested in weekly therapy. None of it matters, because at the end of the day, I know two things for certain:

1) I will never be loved the way I love people. I am never a priority for anybody. I am always, *always* an afterthought, at best. ALWAYS. I feel too much. I am emotionally manipulative and I don’t even realize it. I am emotionally/verbally abusive when I don’t get my way, and I don’t even realize it. I see more of my NPD father in me than I used to, and that makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t want to hurt anyone anymore. every time I do, when I come back to earth, I start to hate myself even more for what I’ve done. I feel constant pain and shame from all of the damage I’ve caused throughout my life. I just want someone to love me, and for me to love them. I am so desperate to be loved, yet nobody wants to. I don’t blame them at all, it’s not easy and it’s not worth it to put the time and energy into someone like me.

2) I will never be the man I want to be. I am female-to-male transgender, for perspective. I hate giving myself shots, often I forget to even do it. I hate that I only attract cis women who have been with only cis men who always leave me for cis men. I pass easily, but sexually I obviously cannot provide what my potential partner wants from me. I even ensure they know before we meet, but it doesn’t matter. They forget, everyone does, because I’m always forgotten about and taken at face value at best. I cannot imagine a life where I can possibly be happy in this body, because even if my partner accepts me, I still don’t. I never will. In my eyes, I am not adequate and I never will be. I will not be happy because I cannot be anatomically what I need to be in order to be happy. There are no options available to me which would provide me with that relief.

I am not very smart, and I’m not rich. I have my highschool diploma at most. I’m not the most attractive, and I’m impulsive and emotionally immature. I have no skills that can help me build a career and I have no retirement plan (remember, I didn’t think I’d need it). Women fall for me and end up avoiding me like the goddamn plague in such a short time, as they should. I would too, in fact I do it every day lol.

In March 2024, the Canadian government will decide whether they will provide MAID to those suffering from purely mental illness. I hope they do the right thing and show me some grace, and realize that I will suffer way more pain and for much longer if not. I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this. None of my afflictions are curable, there’s merely only temporarily relief for either. I can’t do it anymore, I will not know love, and it is all I’ve ever wanted, I have been so desperate in my cravings, but I have not been shown any ever. I will never have my only desire in life, and I just can’t do it anymore. I don’t want to. I lasted 11 years longer than I thought I would, I can’t see it being any longer than that, nor do I want to to be honest.",1693708724.0,False,7,2,xLeone30x,,168lb7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/168lb7p/bpd/

24,Need to vent about my BPD,"I have BPD and it's too much now. I tried to kill myself last year and its threatening to become that bad again. The simplest and stupidest situations send me into an absolute agony where my brain and chest are feeling shredded and like a black hole. I am trying therapy stuff but they've told me it's for helping to manage, it can't cure me or stop the thoughts.
It's laughable: the last few New Years I go see my friends. I said, let's do it again. One friend says no, they have plans. That's totally fine, they are allowed, they have other friends - and all my logic brain is consumes in total frantic weeping and total rejected feelings.
 Now we plan to meet a different day. The friend is spending most the week with others. And another friend can't confirm yet because they're possibly doing something else. Again, TOTALLY REASONABLE but my idiot fucking brain is going mad. ""I'm always expendable I'm unwanted I am the spare friend when the better friends aren't around for them!"" Like I'm so pathetic and loathsome that I get on my own nerves.
I hate myself so much that I can't actually understand why they want to be my friend, so every time they can't come out I think ""this is it, the beginning of the end"".

25,BPD and shitty college experience,"Hi everyone, so to start my story, I didn’t have the best parents growing up and my dad was an asshole and an alcoholic. I always thought things would get better and when I was 15 I started dating this beautiful girl and I thought we would be together forever. Unfortunately we were long distance and I started dealing with BPD issues and I got hooked on weed badly. At 19 she dumped me and started dating another guy and they are still together. I started dating someone new and we weren’t perfect but we loved each other dearly. 3 months ago she dumped me and is now with someone else. I’ve gotten on meds and tried really hard to improve myself but I just don’t want to do it anymore. I’m sad all the time and nothing gives me any real joy or satisfaction. I feel like I’m doomed and I’m tired of being a burden to everyone. I’m 21 now and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t see the point in continuing to live and the only reason I haven’t done it already is because I know it would destroy my family and my friends. Everyday I just wish I didn’t exist anymore.

29,I’m sick of myself (BPD),"I want to die so bad. My fiancé won’t even hear about it.

I have BPD so I’m very emotionally volatile and easily upset. It’s hard to be around me, it’s hard to be my friend, it’s hard to keep a relationship of any kind with me because I’ll either have an episode outside of my control or I’ll push you away because I can already sense being abandoned. I’ve always been described as too much. And I feel like with time and attempting to heal I have somehow only gotten worse. I keep trying and trying and trying and it’s no use.

I’m broke so I can’t afford treatment or meds or therapy. We’re facing eviction in 2 weeks. Bills keep popping up out of no where it seems. I can’t keep up. I can’t get a better job. I can’t make my partner or anyone happy. I’ve lost so many people I used to call friend within this past year. It’s just feeling like my reasons to live are thinning out.

I read about a method with helium. Quiet and painless. I want to pass in a big field, all alone with the earth. But it feels like a big orchestration. And I admit I do worry about those that love me, like is my mental illness only telling me that I’m hard to love or is it true? If it’s true I should go. I should make room for these people to be free and move on and not have to tend to my every mood swing.

39,Why live with BPD?,"Suicide feels very ethical as a person with BPD. My incurable personality disorder has the “chance” to go into remission decades from now. Because of this disorder, whenever I get close to anyone and things get emotionally charged I say and do things that are manipulative and abusive. It’s like a reflex. And in therapy I’ve been trying to unlearn that reflex but if that reflex is BPD, I’ll be unlearning that for the rest of my life, with no guarantee that reflex will change. 

So it seems like the two ethical ways to deal with this are (1) lead a life of solitude so you don’t hurt others or (2) kill yourself. I don’t want to inflict harm on others, but I also don’t want to be lonely, so honestly dying seems like the best bet.

40,BPD Ruined My Flight,"I (20F) was fine with flying before BPD. Even after, I'd never had any issue with it. I'm a travel lover, so I fly a lot. I live in South Africa and am now in Tunis, Tunisia.  Three days ago, I caught my flight from Cape Town and it was a disaster. My BPD has been attacking me full-flare in the form of emotional dysregulation and an insane, intense fear of abandonment. I don't have an SO. My first real relationship in ages ended a few months ago. That's the reason I'm travelling now. I don't want to get into details because it's painful to remember, but basically, I began to get scared the moment the plane took off, worried if my friends were talking about me right now. What were they saying? That lead to rumination over every single conversation I'd had with friends and family, twisting their statements. They probably don't want me around. Will they leave me? They probably will, just like him.

They were serving alcoholic beverages, and even though I'm not supposed to drink, I had something (can't even remember what it was) and drank and drank until the flight attendant refused to serve me anymore. Then suddenly I just felt everything. The plane moving, the loud chatter, my racing thoughts, everything. I took off my seatbelt and paced up and down the aisle for about twenty minutes before this older lady told me to go sit down because I was disrupting everyone. I told her I was trying to walk off a panic attack, and she told me to suck it up and go back to my seat. I just began crying out off nowhere, then hit by an unbelievable wave of anger, screamed at this woman for about two minutes before going back to crying. This flight attendant came to me and told me to go sit down because the seatbelt sign was on. I did, but everyone was staring at me by then. I tried to watch a movie, but I couldn't focus as my mind was still going 100 MPH. I was so happy when we finally landed. But as we were leaving the plane, I heard a guy say, ''Thank goodness, all that crying. Damn kids.'' I don't know why that comment tipped me over the edge, but it did, I ran to find the nearest bathroom, locked myself in, and self-harmed. I'd been clean for a month and was proud of my progress, but now I've had what I consider to be a huge setback.

Don't get me wrong, Tunis is beautiful and I'm enjoying my stay, it's just so difficult with all these memories and emotional dysregulation still going strong. I can't stop thinking about the fact that if I didn't have this damned disorder, I'd be able to enjoy myself more. Don't know how much longer I can take this.

58,Trauma bond from ex partner with BPD,"My ex partner [43F] suffers with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and potentially bipolar disorder as a comorbidity (a definitive diagnosis is still TBD by her psychiatrist, this is not an amateur-diagnosis). She “split” me, pushed me away, and broke up with me 11 weeks ago and the trauma bond I’m suffering with is destroying my life and making me want to commit suicide.

My ex partner was manic when our relationship started and they said the dissociated during much of our relationship. Even while out of her manic episode, this was the happiest and healthiest relationship I’ve ever had. I truly thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with this woman, and she thought the same about me. 

She split after her first appointment with a new therapist who also triggered her into a bipolar episode. Our relationship was as happy and healthy as can be right up until she broke up. We were madly in love with each other and talked about future plans together (near and distant). After she split, she said she was no longer in love with me and told me not to expect her to come back because it’s not going to happen. She cares for me deeply and we’re still friends up to this point checking in with each other every week or so. 

She told me she had a past history of “always running away from her relationships” and left
6 engagements. I’m beyond devastated because this woman brought out a side of me I’ve never seen or felt before. She was my best friend and made me feel so incredibly blessed to have her in my life.

Since the breakup, I’ve lost over 17 lbs, I haven’t been able to workout in over 6 weeks (I’m a disciplined bodybuilder), I only eat twice a day on average, I get horrible flashbacks and anxiety attacks, I’m on antidepressants and sedatives for my major depression, and my thoughts of suicide are extremely bad. 

There’s not a single moment of any day that she’s not on my mind. I can’t breathe, I’ve lost all of my happiness, I’m hoping and praying every single day we can reconcile the relationship now that we both have a better understanding of her diagnoses and how they affect her. The breakup didn’t feel warranted, predictable, or foreseen. My world flipped upside down overnight and it doesn’t feel real. I love her and I’ve never been loved and cared for like that before in my life. 

Everyday I’m fighting thoughts, plans, and ideations of suicide, and how it would affect those around me. Every morning feels like waking up from a terrible nightmare.

I’ve been obsessively reading about the suicide risk for the disorders I have and somewhat take solace in knowing that they carry a higher than average probability. I’ve also been praying that a cataclysmic event will happen that will take me out so I don’t bear the responsibility of it.

63,"i think i have bpd, if i do im going to commit","excuse my awkwardness, this is my first time really using reddit.

im not quite sure what went wrong growing up, i dont remember a lot of it

 i had both parents and a financially stable home. my mom was mean sometimes, and she'd hit me, but i always thought it was discipline, she grew up in another culture, where she told me her father used to hang her brother upside down to 'straighten him out' because he suspected my uncle was gay. he was 8

my parents and i have had a weird relationship, and without the whole sob story, they had other things to tend to, my father working overseas and my mom working at the local ymca with other children, so of course she didnt want to come home and keep doing her job with me. i dont blame them, being a parent is hard, i am just sad that i had to be their kid

ive struggled with school (and suicidal thoughts) since middle school, specifically math, and until my junior year in highschool i would not get any higher than a C in any math class. i always enjoyed art, so i thought that i could get math free degree in art, a creative sphere that is always in demand, but with ai art, this is quickly deflating as an option.

im 20, live at home and commute to college, but im behind, and my parents dont know. i was and am still afraid that they will not support me, even though they say otherwise. i took a gap year after getting institutionalized after an attempt last year. i was admitted to a critical care unit due to no other clinic being available the night i attempted, and i experienced the worst of the worst of what poor mental health has to offer, its hell on earth in there. you become subhuman.

 im moving out the 20th to an apartment by myself, but my dad said something that scared me

when talking to my sister he mentioned i was moving out, and my sister asked my father if he was worried and he said ""were afraid of her moving out alone"" and i joked it was because i was an art major that he didnt think id be able to make enough money, but he said ""no, were afraid of you doing something and it taking too long for anyone to notice.""

my attempt last year was exasterbated by a lot of things, SA, abortion (unrelated), a stalker, two unspoken attempts that failed, losing my support group, friends were talking behind my back, but most of all it was the end of my 3 year long relationship. he always had a history of always flocking to other girls, and to be fair we were young, 16 and 17, and we were horny teens. what went down between us hurt me a lot, as he had a track record of slowly falling for 5 other women over the coarse of our relationship. in a very lonely state, having just lost 5 core people in my support system, i met this guy online and noticed my ex would get jealous. i noticed the only way he cared abt me was when this other guy was my priority and out of sheer desperation to keep him around i kept flirting with the guy, even if i didnt mean it. 

i think im a bad person, i think ive made too many mistakes to fix, besides the formerly mentioned, and somehow im somehow even more isolated than when i attempted last year. my support system right now is my ex, who reached out to me at a very coincidental time, the same day i had solidified my date. hes been helping me non stop, being here for me. but i feel guilty. he hurt me a lot, but i think i hurt him too just by being around. im unstable, i cant handle things, and my head is a mess. after my gap year im reinrolled in classes and i have a job i enjoy.  i met a boy, and he's kind and smart and so sweet. things should be ok, but they don't feel like it. little things happen, like losing my wallet, or losing my airpods, getting a bad grade on an exam or a speeding ticket i can't afford to pay and it feels like its all for nothing.

im trying so hard to be better but it feels like i keep getting kicked. after needing to contact my psychiatrist for a refill on meds, i came across a video abt bpd, watched it, and felt mortified. this was my greatest fear, to think my symptoms line up with these people so often betrayed as evil demons? 

but it makes me question if i really am the bad one here? last night my ex said something that made me sick. he the girl who he 'told me not to worry abt', dating in november 2 weeks after our breakup, but realized he wasnt over me. he asked her again this year a month ago, and he says things have been good. he's been hanging out with me, since i dont have anyone else (this is a legitimate problem) and his mother got upset at him for possibly hanging out with me. he regrets telling me, because he thinks itll push me over the edge, and it will but it's not his fault. 

he told me that his mother thinks im an emotionally manipulative person that only wants to hurt everyone around her. she thinks the girl my ex is dating ""is the one"". 

what do i do now that my only support line is my ex, who has to keep hanging out with me a secret? i need help and im trying to find it, im contacting my insurance for a counsler, since my current clinic doesn't take bpd patients  bc they require what's called 'intensive care'. remission rates go up as the patient grows up, but it takes around 10 years between when a patient actually gets diagnosed, and their first bpd episode. im so tired. but i cant kill myself because i know i will hurt him and my parents but im sick and tired of wasting everyone's time and care. no one cares, and like my dad said, if i did something, it would be far too late for anyone to notice.

67,I am indeed the queen of BPD and I hate it so much. I want this all to be over. ,"So back in March, I (27F) met a guy (25M) on Tinder and we hit it off. I was looking for something long term and he was too. A week later, I lost my virginity to him. It was all so special to me. Having my first date, first time, everything. I felt like I hit the jackpot with this guys because of how well we hit it off. Anyways fast forward, I started to ask for too much reassurance on whether we were on the same page and if he was looking for something serious with me. It got to a point where it got really annoying to him and he started to resent me a bit. A month ago, he went through my phone without permission and found that I still had dating apps on there (I was inactively using them, but still had them). He kept accusing me of talking to other guys and kept calling me a liar, so he broke things off with me over text and blocked me. I should also mention, he does have some delusional thoughts and emotional baggage. For example, he says he has a hard time trusting women because of his past relationships. He also says some pretty misogynistic comments. I did find out he takes Paxil and Vynase, and those medications can cause some delirious thoughts.

As a person with BPD, I wasn't rationally thinking but emotionally thinking of how I want to fix things and how I didn't want him to abandon me. I got his mom's number off of Facebook (she never knew about me) and I called her, told her who I was, and told her what happened. I dug myself in a deeper hole doing that, but he then texts me and tells me to come over and talk about it. I apologized for everything and apologized for calling his mom. Funny thing, he never apologized to me for invading my privacy and not trusting me when I told him I was not talking to anyone else... After that, he still broke things off with me because of me calling his mom, but in addition to me be ""annoying"" and ""clingy"". Not even a week later, he texts me ""hey.""

Again, with the fear of abandonment, I responded to him. A few days later he told me that he doesn't want a relationship with me but wants to be FWB. I accepted that because I still wanted that connection with him. Things were going well for a little while. Fast forward to this past Saturday to yesterday, I kept texting him non-stop. I was worrying if there was someone else or if I said or did something because he wasn't responding to my messages to hang out, but he wasn't communicating or responding to me. I also want to note, I do have a history with texting people non-stop if they don't reply, which has cost me relationships with others. Yesterday, he told me ""we should go our separate ways"" and that ""I find what I'm looking for"" and he blocked me again.

Again, my emotional thinking overtook my rational thinking and I bolted to his place. Obviously, he was shocked that I showed up. We talked for a long while, I was trying to convince him that things would be different, I was telling him to unblock me, to no avail. We hooked up as well. Fast forward to the end of the night, he was going to bed and yelling at me to leave and I was refusing to until he unblocked me and promises me to see me again. He was so adamant on not doing that, but gave up and unblocked me and promised me so I can leave.

I kinda figured in my gut he would block me again and not want to see me again. This morning he texted me ""Do not ever contact me again. If you continue to harass me or show up at my place, I will call the cops and file a restraining order against you"" and then blocked me again. That was that. Obviously, I'm not going to contact him anymore because I don't want any legal trouble, but I am scared if he calls the cops or files a restraining order against me still. So very scared. I'm also devastated that this relationship is damaged beyond repair and that we can't be in each others lives anymore. It hurts me more than anything. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I am absolutely and utterly destroyed by this. I am absolutely heartbroken more than anything.

I went out my way to be nice to him during our time dating and I genuinely cared about him. I indeed was very generous and supportive towards him. I know it was a very short while we dated, but I honestly thought he was ""the one"" because of all the similar values and interests we had. I was even falling in love with him. Again with BPD, I tend to fall pretty hard for someone. I am hurt about the loss of potential and what could've been between us if none of this happened... BPD has entirely ruined my life. It has cost me jobs, relationships, and now this relationship that I truly wanted. I sometimes wish and pray that I would die or if I could just go back in time and change everything. I wish none of this had to happen. I miss him so much and I will miss him more than anything. I feel like I mess everything up, no matter how hard I try not to. I am in therapy and take medication, which has helped a bit, but obviously as you see, I'm still stuck in this negative cycle. I just wish I had better confidence and self-esteem, so I wouldn't have to suffer like this. My anxiety and BPD gets the best of me each time and I overreact and cause strains in my relationships. I just wish I could have him back and fix everything. I don't think I could ever live this down.

I don't think I'll ever be happy or get what I want in this life. I often think of how everyones lives would be better off if I died. Especially after this situation, I am strongly considering ending it all. I feel like I can't live properly in this world, that I can never be normal, and that my life is just a waste. Everything good that happens to me, gets taken away in an instant. It hurts so much. So very much.

Classic BPD stuff, i feel very empty all the time (because of the dissociation and such, its a feature of the disorder). I feel completelt generic. I stopped self harming like a year and a half ago but i feel like, whats the point? Im not any happier not hurting myself. I dont feel like making these positive life changes or going to therapy is actually doing anything helpful for me. Ive been extremely suicidal ever since i was in primary school. Ive been abused etc. etc. I guess i want to kill myself for all the reasons youd expect someone to wamt to do that.

I wish it mattered in the slightest. I know that if i hurt myself today, in a year i wont remember it. I dont remember anything about my life almost, it just feels like a series of random excruciatingly bland events. Even when im physically feeling an emotion, it dpesnt feel like anythimg

84,"Suspecting my now ex cheated on me while I'm suffering from severe OCD, BPD and suicidal tendencies","It's a long story but basically my ex of 2 nearly years broke up with me after we had a big fight about the fact that he doesn't give me any attention and he puts his friends first. I am gonna be honest, I lashed out very badly and called him every name in the book and there's no excuse for that, but he promised like 5 times to change and he just wouldn't. My frustration was just at an all time high and I couldn't take it anymore. He recently met a girl who instantly became his best friend and since then they've been spending every moment together, she pretty much lives in his house, sleeps on his bed, wears his socks, she rubs her feet on him etc. And it made me very jealous and suspicious but I didn't wanna say anything to prevent am argument. Now we did get into an argument because I couldn't keep silent anymore. He basically said that he can't give me more attention and time, while literally spending all his time with her. So I was done, but I didn't wanna lose him at the same time. Now he made the choice to call it quits and abandon me while I'm at the lowest point in my life, and his girl best friend who used to say that I'm very important to her and I can call her 24/7 for support, suddenly doesn't answer anymore since me and my ex broke up. So I can't say 100% sure that they're fucking, but I sure think they are. I think she was just waiting for her chance to shoot her shot. I'm so devastated and feel so worthless and alone. I really want to kill myself because this is the straw that broke the camel's back, but I want to do it carefully because I don't want to make things worse by crippling myself for life.

85,undiagnosed bpd ?,"Tw sh 
Since probably 2 weeks ago I have felt myself creeping backwards on my to do list. That which would be to succeed. To at least reach contentiousness within one lifetime. To reach a milestone without a cliff waiting behind the white gates. I havent been sleeping and i have been sufficing off rice and cucumbers and human interaction. I havent been eating properly or doing my work and while this is somewhat within characteristics of my normal day to day, this low has been extensive and I am reaching extremities i deemed impossible once i thought i had already reached the worst. Truth is, it continues to get worse to the point where i am and have been considering my new normal as  genuine. I have been cutting since i was 13. First it was safety pins and thumb tacks. It turned to scissors and cigarette burns and pocket knives. It turned to silent cries and constsnt readjustment below the belt just to feel a quick sting in class. Like i just did a bump. Recently, its been worse. I am a freshman in college and my situation entails that i live alone. This is not something i chose nor ever would have chosen i am an easily overwhelmed, overthought, anxious, ocd riddled adhd spewing human being with little reluctance for boredom and lack of stimulation. I am extremely intelligent big picture, but i am built to let everyone down in the picture within the minds of those i love. I failed my first semester and i am in my second now doing basically just as poor. I will be dismissed if i continue this devastation and once i reach that point i believe there will be no turning back for me. I have some great friends, 2 days ago one of my best took me to the hospital in fear of my wellbeing after i brought it to their attent i had been hurting myself for days on end. Generally my self harm never overlapped. One good day blended sharply into new cuts and just as fast as they came they would go and come again. The past 4 days i havent slept more than 8 hours combined and the toll on my mental has been massive. Once checked into the facility i was put on display while awaiting an evaluation. I was walked past with exposed arms and blushed cheeks at least 10 times by each of the faculty. I gave them all names and stories in my head to pass the time. Once it was disclosed that i would wait another 4 hours to be evaluated after already waiting 4 i decided to do something about the situation. I gaslit my doctor into believing this behavior was one of a stressed out college freshman with the type of ocd that made me obsess over the clock and my assignments. Reality is, i obsess over words and reaction and emotion and what i can sense and perfect, not what i must create. I was able to convince him to let me go even though i was on suicide watch. It is scary the place my brain put me in to obtain that ability. It is a shame it is not the first second or third time ive had to do so. Long story short, i am struggling more now than i was or ever have before. Although i didnt depict it much here, i believe i am struggling with undiagnosed bpd and i find my highs to be slightly higher while my lows are digging through what i deemed prior as rock bottom.",1646816956.0,False,3,1,Ambitious-Hunt-1206,,ta3v9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ta3v9n/undiagnosed_bpd/

97,Bpd is the reason my life ruined. Now i have to end it,"The story goes like i was really an anxious loner kid back in school. I never really had friends or wanted to love anyone. I was always alone tho i felt lonely, I didnt know to care. Then at 17 i really felt lonliness consuming me from years of silence. I always rather third wheeled with friends cuz for some reason i couldnt get along in my highschool where i tried having real friends. It was lockdown when i was 17, very $uic!dal.college started when i was 18. I was excited to make friends and have a love life like normal people. I did glow up and tried to put on my best cheerful funny self out there. Heck!!!! I messed up. I got psychosis and felt like everyone was calling me names and plotting against me. I was soo paranoid. Like i been always paranoid in school days and always felt negative. But this time at its worse. So i ended up messing and whole college hated me. I turned to show attention seeking behaviours. Which ever guy or some friend approached me same happened and we ended up in mess. Each time i felt horrible. I was broken in ways i cant say. I i didnt know what was happening. But i knew something wrong. I engaged in $uic! de attempts. Overdosing even cut!ing... IIgotTa diagnosis that i had BPD. I was happy cuz i had answers to my questions. Then i met a boy. I was determined to save our love for whatever the heck it takes. He loved me soo dearly like i was the most precious thing. Two months, it was the only time in my whole like where i felt normal like someone with a life. But i did have constant wars with my mental health. He helped. But later i got damn super paranoid again. I went worser and worser, I hurt him. I didnt even realize how attention seeking, manupilative i got. I went too toxic. But i thought he was the bad guy and hurt him like hell. He tried explaining how its not what i think and tried to help me find and correct my flaws. But it made me think he is jus blaming me for no reason ad i got more mad at him and hurt moree. He broke up and we remained friends. I got reckless, i thought he wanted someone else and that i have to find someone now. I was sooo sure he was with someone like idk where i got the idea from. and so tried loving someone else and sexted once. I told him. He jus gave up on me lol. He said he was done with our relationship thing. wasnt even a week after breakup. Well the new guy i broke up in a week. I always loved my 1st bf still. I still had fights and paranoia but i tried my hardest to not show my terrible self. 8 months later... It hit me. Sooo hard. Soooo bad. I couldnt hold it in. I went insanely paranoid. I questioned our whole relationship. I found him like a villian and had a huge ass fight. I was paranoid he was doing stuffs with girls and moved on and hung out with them. In a anger to forget him i decided to hang out with some jerk who tried to get in my pants for so long. I jus wanted someone to hangout i didnt know anyone. And in impulse i said okay. But he took me to a dark place and everything that i didnt want happened. No seggs but uk what i mean. It happened. I dont even know what went on my mind. ts not SA cuz i was soo scared and clueless. I didnt even say NO properly when i did say NO, it wasnt even assertive. I let him do until he left me and went home crying and like i felt soo used. He hurt me while whatever he did to my body. I got mad at my ex. I was yelling it happened cuz him. He said i always do everything and regret and said goodbye. I didnt understand why. I was soo confused like what did i do to deserve this. I fought and fought.. He said not to cross paths with him ever again cuz i totally hurt him and he was done with my whole thing. I was soo insane. Why would he leave me. I did everything i could.... Then i send a whole ass text on how he made me feel and how my whole thought procesd was and kept accusing how bad of a bf he was. He said few mins he wanna clarify. I decided to talk one last time. It fcking broke me down like i can never be alright again. He told me what really happened with him and the break we took. He explained the ways i hurt him. The things i did which were not fair at all. How he never even baited an eye on any girl but i kept assuming. How he got drained and still decided to come back to me after breakup but i ruined it all... 

I realized i could never change it. Im the monster myself. No matter how hard i think im okay. Im never okay. These patterns of behavior and stick to me like leech. I thought i was fine but noooo fckn nooo even all this time all i did was bring toxic. Toxic toxic. I cant stop crying. Its like my world stopped spinning. Its not the fact that we broke up. But the fact i was the one who ruined something soo precious and beautiful. I was the one who was actually the toxic ex here is making me guilty. Everything that happened with everyone, i always wondered why people are soo sh!t why no one is good. But i was the mistake all along. It was all on me. I was the bad guy. 

I dont think i can ever live again. Everything is hitting me like a huge fast a$$ train. 

I dont wanna do this thing called living anymore. The last thing i ever want is to hurt someone who truly loves me or has genuine intentions with me. 
Yeah thats right. I aint gonna complain why my life is sh!t anymore. Im the mistake and i wish i could atleast be the brightest star in the sky devoid of all this evilness instilled in me... i could paint the sky with the most beautiful sunset... When i do it.

My autism makes me feel like a freak of nature, not to mention I’m trans and literally look like a freak. I have this unfulfilling desire to be female when I was born a male. I’m trying my best to see this transition through as a last chance to changing my life around but, idk if I’m going to make it or when I do, I don’t know if it’ll be enough. I hate myself to death and can’t think of anything good to say about myself. I have no hobbies, talents, and barely have enough skills to keep a roof over my head.  I know that I have some form of bpd. I have no respect for myself and go around life as if I’m wearing an invisibility cloak ( like in Harry Potter)  and people can’t see me, so they won’t treat me like a normal human being because I know I will let them down because I’m autistic. I have no respect for myself, and I feel like I have no presence like I’m nothing. It makes it hard to make any introductions about myself I’d rather rot alone than feel judged by people. I have adhd and cant maintain a clean room or manage my time and I forget things all the time. I’m 27 and never had a bf and I have dreams that I’ll be alone for the rest of my life. Being an immigrant, with learning disabilities means I’m never able to learn the language as good as I want, or as good as natives. It’s annoying to say the least and I’m paranoid about it to the point I always beat myself up for any minor mistakes in spelling, vocabulary or grammar.

My brain has become insufferable, I don’t know who I AM and my minds inner dialogue is full of voices, they have their own personalities. When I’m happy and doing better mentally I’m a whole different person and the voices become motivating and supportive.

107,I think I have BPD meaning I’ll never get better.,"I have very bad trust and abandonment issues. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression last year and my meds don’t help me. I don’t have the money to see a therapist and life has honestly gotten worse for me. 

I lost my friend group. My only friend didn’t invite me to his birthday dinner. We’ve been friends for 7 years. And I’m getting ghosted by this girl I really like. 

I tend to get really attached to people when I like them and I try not to be as overbearing anymore because I’ve burned bridges doing that. I have cried over so many people this year it hurts to count but more recently I thought I was getting better. This girl I was talking to I tried to create a healthy amount of space and stuff but she bailed on me the other night and now she’s not really responding. I asked if she was okay but no response so ig this is gonna end like every other relationship in my life. 

I just want someone for me. Someone who’s my person and cares about me as much as I do them, but I don’t think I can find that. I end up obsessing over people and pushing them away.

Anyways I came across a video detailing life with BPD and it was all the emotions and feelings I have. It was like someone went in my brain and wrote down what happens to me when shit gets like that.

109,"I'm Just So Done, Having BPD Sucks.","My Therapist became my ""favorite person"". If you don't know what that is please look it up. Basically its someone (you don't choose) who you are 100% emotionally based on. Its causing depressive episodes. My PTSD from my abusive ex is going hard too, and because my T is my fp I feel like its alot harder to talk about. So here is a flashback vent and what triggered it.
Mathew sat next to me during homeroom. I tried ignoring his existence completely at first but because thats what I always did and its never gotten my anywhere I thought to try something new. I turned to him and tried starting a conversation about chemistry (he was doing chem work). He ignored me. That made me feel angry. Who does he think he is, I should be the one ignoring him, not the other way around. So after a few minutes I asked another small question relating to the homework he was doing, he turned and snapped at me. I felt a flashback come on. This one specifically was the bathroom one. 
>A group of us went out to eat for dinner. I went into the bathroom and there were three, womans, men's, and family. The family one is the biggest and so I just went in that one. I just needed to wash my hands and was just about to come out. I heard a knock and replied with ""someone's in here"". But the knock repeated and before I could answer the door began to open. Mathew walks in and quickly shuts it behind him. Any words I were going to say ran away from me. As soon as he walked in my stomach fell and I found I could no longer speak. But in a very pitched voice I said that I was just about to come out and he could have just waited. He laughed and said no. So I was still standing in front of the sink looking in the mirror above it, trying to distract myself from the fear that was crawling inside of me. He started talking but I dont remember what it was about. Next thing I know he is standing right behind me and his hands are on my hips. I look up at him through the mirror and see him staring back at me. I try to wiggle free and his grip tightens and it starts to hurt. I said ow that hurts Matt. He didn't respond or anything. I told him to stop and that I need to go back, that they were probably wondering what was taking me so long. No response from him, instead his grip tightened further. I tried pushing myself aways, and nothing. He is bigger and stronger then I. At some point I remember saying in a very defeated tone ""stop please let go"". But he didn't. Instead he very quickly pulled my pants down to my knees. I went numb. I started instantly dissociating. I yelled stop once more. He said no this time and backed up just enough to unzip his pants. My limbs felt like jelly and I tried to move, to yell, to do something. But fear kept me frozen once again. I felt his chest pressing firmly against my back and I kinda blacked out. I have no memory until roughly a few minutes later. I looked around trying to understand what was going on and where I was. I felt him, more specifically I felt him raping me. I went stiff and he noticed the change in my body posture because he yelled at me. He yelled at me and started pushing my body into the ledge of the sink, with his own. I felt my hip bones dig into the ceramic with every motion. I felt his small grunts of breath on the back of my neck. I blacked out again. When I came back he was pulled his pants back up, and told me that if I kept trying  to fight him or escape like I did this time a bit but more so other times he would hurt me. He told me that actions have consequences, he sounded like my father.<",1647259050.0,False,2,0,animaluv4040,,tdvt6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tdvt6u/im_just_so_done_having_bpd_sucks/

Thank you for reading if you do so, you're a pure soul. The text will be a little bit mixed up, sorry for being confusing. 

I am not a person who reaches out like this but I just don't know what to do anymore. I suffer from BPD with several co disorders and social anxiety. I am low functioning, really low functioning. Every day is a fight for me. I was traumatized several times in my life. My life was so hard, I did go trough 20 years of my mother abusing me so hard, my father did go and buy some milk, I was raped when I was 15 from a really disgusting person and still I've never talked to someone else than my online friends about. I finished school with 18 and my grades are decent. 
The college I always wanted to go accepted me, but I canceled after one day. Like, to live with bpd is the most drowning thing I know about. I sit at home for 2 years now, escaping in daydreams and gaming and as soon as someone reminds me that I have to live trough this life I break down. It just feels like suicide is kind of inevitable for me. I am also very overweight and no matter how hard I tried, I did go trough a lot of work but I never lost weight. 
I did visit several psychologists and everyone told me they're not able to help me (Germany literally hates pwBPD). 
My 3 siblings are also suicidal and I just don't know anymore. I am so tired of fighting. I am not functioning in any way, I go outside like every 2 months because I dissociate as soon as I leave my home. 
I try to be a positive and ""healthy"" support for the people I care about and I learned a lot about me and bpd by myself. I trained my own behavior and it gets better but still my feelings doesn't change. I can control myself better outside of me, but not the things that are f*cking me up inside. I don't know if someone is able to relate to the pain I am going trough and please don't tell me that it's my fault, I tried so hard to even visit school over the years. But at some points I just didn't see a reason why to stay if I am not even able to work. Suicide goes trough my mind all the time, it feels like I have to do it otherwise I have to continue with this life.

I had what I wanted to type all ready in my head but I'm probably gonna mess this up and not get my point across. But alas. 

As many people this year has been pretty difficult. Personally 9 days into the start of this year my dad died. It was quite traumatic to say the least. I had been suffering from mental health issues probably from the age of 10 due to some other traumatic experiences, waking up as a 10 year old to screams that my mom had passed away during the night and some childhood abuse all around that time and onwards. 

But I've really found this year with losing my dad and pretty much not having a family anymore a bit too much to handle. The Pandemic really didn't help and losing my job twice, once due to a national lock down and the second from contracting covid-19 (present day) 

I found myself rigorously searching for ways to just take my life as quick and as enjoyable as possible (I know that last part sounds very odd) which I don't do often but when I do its almost soothing. I almost crave just turning myself off for good. I don't value myself enough to think I deserve any better. 

I'm just wondering does anyone on here have any better ways of deflecting from that sort of thinking? I was diagnosed with BPD and GAD but I guess the diagnosis doesn't matter as much as obviously many people go through the same thing regardless of diagnosis. One thing I do notice with BPD is the chronic feelings of sheer emptiness, low self esteem and general purpose.

126,"Fantasies about attempting suicide, am I narcissistic or BPD???","Cw: graphic details
Long post

Hi everyone,

For a while now, I have been fantasizing about attempting suicide, failing at it, and then waking up and being showered by love and affection and seeing everyone around me, especially my partner, realize that my pain was serious, that I was really sad and hurt.

These invasive thoughts are heavily triggered by arguments with my partner. Like yesterday for instance. I made too much noise while arriving home and one thing led to another and I just ignored him for the rest of the night and I **expected him** to break the ice somehow (I know this is self-sabotaging) and he didn’t do it, he just went to bed (the bed in his study room, not our bed) without telling me anything. Upon realizing that, I started sobbing uncontrollably and this is where the thoughts hit me. I felt left aside, ignored, unloved. I felt like he wanted nothing to do with me, he wanted to avoid me at all costs. The emotion was real, it wasn’t feigned. I even got a bit nauseous by the constant contraction of my diaphragm.

Now, I have to clarify that for the bed thing I know in my logical mind that he sometimes sleeps in this room because of the quality of the bed / chronic pain issues and that it has nothing to do with me. But the thoughts were more powerful than logic. As I was crying, I had the thought of, what if I end it there? What if I take a knife, scissors, whatever, and cut open my veins, what would be his reaction upon finding me? What would he say to me if I failed and woke up in the hospital? Would it change our dynamic? Would he take me more seriously if I told him about a feeling/emotion I’m experiencing?

It’s not the first time that this type of issues emerge (i.e. argument, avoidance on my part and wishing he breaks the ice, he doesn’t, I feel left out, I have these dark thoughts). It’s actually a pattern that comes about once a month, maybe less. Only today have I decided to talk about the issue. Now, I do not think I really have serious suicidal thoughts, because my wishing to hurt myself is deeply rooted in attention-seeking. I don’t think I really want to **die**. I apologize to everyone who experiences actual thoughts of this nature and takes offense in my testimony. I am telling you all about it because I need to make sense of it all. I don’t know if this is a BPD trait, a Narc trait, rejection-sensitive dysphoria, I just know it’s fucked up. Btw I’m diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and I have been professionally evaluated as Intellectually Gifted. The test for ADHD was negative. I want to do an Autism evaluation in the next few months to figure out if it’s part of the reasons why I can’t function well in society.

129,How BPD has taken over me.,"Imagine having any feeling, but in its most extreme and intense form. The bad part is intense happiness just passes by but the intense sadness fucks you up real bad. From extreme moods shifts to recurring suicidal thoughts, a morning would start off amazing and by the night arrives I'm sulking and thinking to end myself. In these fluctuating moods you just tend to forget who you really are.
At a moment I would be happy and joyous and wanting to set goals and future plans like having a family, great career and some luxuries and hours later a feeling of emptiness takes over with an intense feeling of being abandoned and ignored by everyone starts to occur. These modes that switch and lately switch a lot I am starting to forget who I really am or what I really would have wanted. And now there's a lot of irritable mood, fatigue from the moment I wake up and no interest in anything at all, more like nothing to even look forward to.
Somedays I'm writing letters to leave behind if I tend to ""quit"" and sometimes I'm writing notes to self about how to go about the life. It feels like I'm getting mentally unstable. This paranoia of unstable mind is creating even more fear, I'd rather die than having an unstable mind.

141,"True misery, living with BPD","Get ready for a lotta reading

So I am a 20 year old male that has literally no social life and I live with my mom and her boyfriend. My dad died a couple months ago and he was diagnosed with BPD early on in his life, and he literally was a picture perfect example of someone with bpd. He never knew where he was going in life, he would jump from job to job, each completely different from one another, and he would burn bridges and turn from the most loving man in the world to the devil. He emotionally scarred me and my brother by basically manipulating us and holding weird expectations for how we would function, calling me out for insignificant things, showing me unconditional love one moment then conditional the next, etc. But at the same time he spoiled us. He also abused hard drugs and drank a ton of alcohol and there were plenty times after my mom moved out when things went downhill that I had to care for him and drag him out of his own vomit to his room, just pure insanity.. but for some reason I don't blame him, he was the embodiement of depression at times and he lost 3 of his brothers. I became a hermit around middle school and became completely disinterested in socialization due to how anxious I got and how I overthought things all the time, I literally couldnt show genuine emotion (and still cant), even though the emotion I experience is intense enough to literally make me feel like I'm having some sort of brain aneurism (this happens particularly when I'm angry and coming back with a retort, I feel lightheaded for a split second and it feels like my brain pulsates or something).. and the emptiness is so overwhelming even today that I literally make small efforts such as open my window, drink energy drinks, change into more comfortable clothes, etc. just to feel some sense of temporary satisfaction. Anyways, I feel like I am living life is hard mode. Everyone holds the same social standards/expectations for me although I face an intense rollercoaster of emotions that literally change within minutes. But there's a lot of times I cannot even put a finger on how I feel. Sometimes when I try to talk I'll say something that sounds downright rude or immature, and I don't realize it until afterwards when the person either somehow makes it apparent to me or I inevitably replay the scenerio in my head looking for mistakes I made. And then I will beat myself up all day over it, and it feels like I can't even control it, it's like theres a part of me that constantly judges what I do and makes fun of me and stuff and I can't shake it off. I am so exhausted emotionally that I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake back up. Every time I make progress and think that I'm doing better, something will happen that will completely ruin all that progression and send me back to the start. I feel like I'm in this never ending cycle, like some sort of fucked up clownhouse. And worst thing is, this disorder stays with you for life, despite the possibility of it becoming a little easier to deal with later on with therapeutic (is that the word?) treatment. I am just so blown away by how I could be given such a shitty hand in life, suffering from a highly stigmatized disorder that nobody will understand unless they actually have it. Every time I try to vent to my mother she gets angry and says I'm not trying when I really am trying, or so I think. I can't stand this any longer. Just within the last 5 minutes of me typing this I went from feeling empty and sad to feeling some sense of euphoria, and I am not lying. My psychologist (an older man) ran down some of the general symptoms of bpd with me and said that it wasn't likely I had it, but I know I have it because I thought I had it/was researching it even before my dad let me know he was diagnosed with it (guess he kind of never bothered mentioning it until then as if it wasn't a big deal). My stepdad is a very old fashioned cynical person who really doesnt believe in such disorders probably because he doesn't understand them. So I am stuck in a situation where I am being pushed and pushed harder than I've ever been, all while I suffer and beat myself up every single day, and with nobody to talk/vent to that understands. And just to put a cherry on top of my fked situation, I have this nihilistic, hopeless view of life and reality, as if a veil has been lifted and I now see how pointless everything is. No I don't believe in creation and never will. All of above is why I think my suicide would be justified. I feel like it's a terminal illness.

142,BPD an EX and Suicide,"I have all 9 traits of BPD. I didnt know this when i met her. In fact i didnt know i had any mental illness till 4 or 5 months into our relationship. I thought i was just another angry person who grew up in an abusive home. 

My first relationship of 3 1/2 years ended in divorce. It was at this time in my life i realized i didn't want to live life angry and hating myself. I was incredibly depressed and suicidal then, but through spirituality i worked my ass off to realize the awesomeness of people and life. And to appreciate the good and sometimes the bad even more. 

After another few years, dropping out of college, and a 2nd failed relationship, i met Mandy. And she... She was all of the things i love in life wrapped up in one amazing package. Without realizing it, i had her wrapped up in what i later found out was an intense and explosive emotional relationship (something i thought was good but i have since read otherwise). The closer we got the worse my triggers got. I could see that my emotions (or rather my inability to control them) were putting a huge strain on our relationship.

You see, i was only 4 wen my father molested me for i dont know how many months. He was also incredibly abusive. Punching me into walls, kicking the wind out of me, choking me (all at the age of 4 up until about 15). He told me i was ugly, dirty, and fat my whole childhood. Then my brother ran away from home when i was 14 after the death of my grammy. Those two events brought my mom to alcoholism to which she ended up abandoning me to be with some guy she met in las vegas. My grandparents picked me up 3 days later.
 
So one morning I finally decided to google my symptoms. The first thing to pop up was complex ptsd and it felt like id finally found something that could explain my actions. And then i saw a borderline personality disorder.. I cried. Everything I mean EVERYTHING i had been experiencing my whole life was seperated into 9 catagories and then explained in detail. I was so happy and also so sad for myself. Kinda like being able to see myself as a person for the first time.

I wanted to share it with her. The answers i had found. I thought it would help her have a better understanding of me. I thought it would help us grow stronger. I was wrong.

It terrified her. It overwhelmed her. And slowly i could see her pulling away. Even if she didnt see it yet. She was tired. I had worn her down. I love her. I love her more than anything. But more than that i respect her. So i told her maybe it was time for us to accept the fact that this is all i got and she deserves so much more. 
And now here we are. In an apartment with 8 months left on the lease. She will be moving in with her mom soon and taking little rosey with her (our now her 8 week old golden retriever). Im happy for her. Shes going to be doing everything i could have only hoped to afford for her to do.

But me. I have nothing but my job at mcdonalds and my name on this damn lease. I dont speak to my family, i have no friends and not even a cent to my name. I have nothing. I am nothing. And after all this time and effort im just done. I dont want to do this anymore. I cant cope again. I dont want to live like this. Spending most of my time trying to convince myself that i am ok when i dont have a clue who i am. I dont even have the skills to self soothe myself. Im lucky my disassociation has saved me from a few breakdowns.

I walk around every second with the firm belief that i am a monster. Everyone i ever cared for has left. I have no identity. I have no worth. I have had nothing but the responsibility of living with a demon i didn't create. Im not feeling sorry for myself. Im not playing the victim. I got up every morning for years and told myself that life wasn't easy but it was worth it. But now, with no savings, no career, no education, no family, no friends, no professional help, no positive outlook and shit credit, I just can't anymore.

I dont know why im writing this. I think a part of me is looking for permission. Another part of me wants validation. Another part wants to hold on to the hope that things get better in the end... And while im sure they can and do get better, my brain will always be so irreversibly damaged that things wont really change. I will always come back to feeling like a monster.But before that I guess I want to be heard. So thank you. Maybe this was helpful in some way to someone else? Good luck. And dont forget to show love to the people who chose to stay by your side. I havent found a greater show of love yet.

I’m 20, and I’m just so so tired of being alive. 

My mother had complex ptsd, drug and gambling addictions, and BPD. I’ve always had this feeling that I probably ended up with some sort of mental illness considering my traumatic childhood but finally hearing a psychiatrist confirm my suspicions has me feeling… more confused than before. I have a wonderful significant other, i’ve reconciled my relationship with my previously neglectful father, I no longer talk to my mother whom was a major source of chaos in my life growing up, I have friends that love me, and have a wonderful apartment with two awesome cats…. Yet now with this diagnosis I feel more inclined to end it all than before. I don’t want to live a life dependent on medication. I don’t want to have to go to a therapist. I don’t want to be a burden for ANYONE. It’s not fair that others can live a life where they aren’t unnecessarily paranoid or anxious or sad or suicidal. I don’t know who I am and I never have. I am merely a sponge that soaks up the personalities of the people around me. It feels like I went to the store to shop for personalities only to pick the cheapest, shittiest ones for sale. I’m just an actress with no home-base persona to return to. Is life really worth living without any real sense of uniqueness? I’m one person out of seven billion around the world but I feel like there is not one character-defining trait that nobody else has. I am too stubborn to seek salvation in religion. There are SO many posts online about why nobody should date/marry/bear children with BPD persons. What’s the point of living when others KNOW I’m selfish, manipulative, reactive, and exploitative. I feel as if I’ve made too many bad decisions in my life for anyone to really remember me for any good i’ve caused. I don’t know if this makes sense to anyone else but I really think that if I were to suddenly die, everyone that knew me would automatically remember me as a better person than I actually am. I feel like my absence would cause less harm than I could  potentially inflict being alive. My moods are so volatile, so unpredictable that I never know when I’ll do harm upon those I love the most.

I don’t have a home. 
I don’t have anyone to share things with... even the good things. 

I don’t have anyone that truly misses me when I am not around. 

One can’t understand what it feels like unless they have felt it. 
One of the worst experiences is feeling alone. I wish I could adequately explain how I feel but I can’t. 

 Instead I end up deleting the words just as soon as they appear. It’s an embarrassing and shameful feeling. The words look hollow and insincere compared to how they actually feel. 

 One of the worst days of my life is now a memory that plays on repeat. Confusion, surprise, pain….Like jumping into ice cold water and feeling my own breath being ripped out of my chest. The words are seared in my mind and sting and ache just as painfully as they did when I first heard them. Like a knife to the heart. It sounds silly and cliche but You just can’t imagine what it feels like unless you’ve felt it. I could see their emotion clearly. They were tired of my presence and just wanted me to go. They took time to deliberate, to plan and to think. Time to choose their words carefully.  They could’ve changed course or chosen to soften the blow. Instead, their words were spoken with forethought and intention. They were spoken with purpose. 

I used to be scared to not wake up. I felt gratitude and-if I’m honest, a small thrill; how, in spite of myself, I seemingly continue to be spared. Why? Why me? ..And why not them? What is the purpose? What is my purpose?

I feel like I don’t have a purpose anymore. Like everything I wished for- and even everything I thought I had is gone. I feel lost and most of all alone. ",1714877792.0,False,2,1,SpiritedTourista,None,1ckhjep,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ckhjep/i_feel/

154,My BPD is suffocating me,"I have experienced issues with Borderline Personality Disorder since I was about fourteen years old. I'm almost thirty now. 
For awhile I was doing 'okay'. I wasn't self-harming, I didn't experience intense emotional instability, wasn't engaging in destructive impulsive behaviors, and in no way thought about suicide. I did well for about 6 years. And I used to believe that saying, 'things will get better eventually, you won't feel like this forever'.

Lately however, I have begun to spiral out of control again. I self-harmed, slicing my arm open that it was a centimeter away from bone. I ended up with stitches and a huge ER bill I couldn't afford.
I have also been thinking about suicide. A lot.
I've begun to feel like I'd be better off just leaving everything behind, because I feel like I'll never REALLY get better. My mother never did. She committed suicide, same diagnosis plus Bipolar disorder II. 

I have a plan. The other day, I came incredibly close to going through with it. I was driving down the backroads, when I picked my tree, unbuckled my seatbelt and pushed the gas, getting up to just over 100. Before I was able to leave the road an 18-wheeler came rushing past, causing me to gently swerve. I was determined to not involve anyone in my suicide, at least in the act of it at the time. 
But I still think about carrying out this plan. Today it was pouring rain, and I thought about how easy it would be to run off the road and end everything. 

I just want to stop feeling so much pain. I want to stop being 'okay' one moment, and then suicidal the next.
I've tried counseling, medication, inpatient treatment, going to groups...I just won't ever get better, not permanently. And I can't face this for the rest of my life.",1540429225.0,False,4,1,calanthiaa,None,9r5ld8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9r5ld8/my_bpd_is_suffocating_me/

I’ve had counselling for over a year but stopped seeing her recently as I realised that I shouldn’t trust people and that I can go it alone.

I have had a hard time letting myself get psychology. It was told me get psychology is bad. I do think I have some brain issues because of stress. Intense stress. Major depression causes retardation. Being a Jehovah's witness is at high risk of schizophrenia. I have schizoaffective, bipolar type. So I'm bipolar and severely borderline. I have no kids. I have had sex. With protection, without protection. I have self esteem self respect issues and boundaries problems. I think as if I am maybe two years old. I also talk like a elementary grade infant. I've been to the psyche ward twice. The third time was just because I wanted to stay off the streets, I was homeless.

I have had one abortion. I think my family is middle class. I am white/European heritage. I was born here. I am not sure I have empathy care or compassion for my self. I hate my life and my self actually. Friends hate me and my family hates me. Except for my Mom and dad I guess.

157,"Sister has BPD, has been suicidal for years...","It's getting worse. I may sound selfish in this post but I can't deal anymore. My adult sister has BPD and has been diagnosed for years, she had a great psychiatrist years ago but he died from a heart attack, now she hasn't found anyone steady. Due to insurance changing and stuff like that, she has a new team of doctors and things seem to just be getting worse and worse. She is constantly suicidal, upset or in a rage. She has two sons, one just started college and the other is 16. She has part custody with her ex husband, who is a very stable and helpful with things. 

I live 4 hours a way and have been back and forth with my shitty car at least one weekend a month (if not every other weekend) while I work 60 hours a week. I just can't. I this last weekend was my birthday and she got mad at me because I told her I just wanted to be alone for my birthday because I am more and more depressed due to emotional fatigue, mostly from her but other things too. So now I have a three day weekend coming up (Wednesday-Saturday) and she tells me she is going to kill herself on Wednesday.

 I feel manipulated, but I know she has BPD and I don't understand her pain. I have been suicidal in the past and have attempted to take my life before, so I get that, but I don't know what it's like to essentially live in hell with her BPD. I don't know what the right thing to do is. I spend so much of my time talking with her, driving up to see her (and she goes into a rage if I visit my other sister while I am there), I can't just go and be there with her because it will be the same thing in two weeks. I literally don't have emotional space in my life for anyone else and at this point it takes me two full days of being alone and out of contact with the world to start to feel like myself again. But two whole days without contact with her sets her off and here we are. 

IDK what to do. My other sister's husband had a terrible heart attack last month and I changed my work schedule to go up there and be with them. He was in bad shape and I stayed with my other sister for a day in the hospital. That night I got back to my BPD sister and she said she was going to kill herself and had razors out and everything. I know it was a trigger for me spending the whole day with someone else but I had to take her seriously. We got the doctor to call in more colazapine (which she says hers was stolen), and I spent the morning with her and she calmed down enough for me to go back to the hospital. Then I got to rush back down to work another 60 hours.

Now it's been three weeks since I visited and with the suicide talk IDK what. She told me last year if I don't move up to where she is she's going to kill herself. I can't. My whole life can't be about her. I don't know what to do.  If anything were to happen to her I will feel guilty and selfish the rest of my life. I wake up with worry in the middle of the night but I don't have words for her. Her brain is what it is. She means so much for me, we haven't always been so toxic, but she's so lonely and has nothing fun in her life (hello? Who does). IDK. I told her last night I was going to have her committed on Wednesday then if that was her plan. Today I plan on calling her shrink and asking wtf is going on. And getting in touch with her ex husband.

164,Confessions from a BPD//I’ve tied my noose and I am ready.,"Not a throwaway. I am 21/F I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. I’m black btw idky that matters. 
Broke up with my ex of one year. I know this is a bit mad to say but he’s the love of my life, sorry not sorry. 

This man is one of the most kindest, beautiful souls I’ve ever known. He’s the only person who told me he loved me and meant it. He showed it, in all the kisses, hugs, time he spent reassuring me and helping me understand the world around me, he would come home from work (I’m on disability aid) and massage my feet - unprompted. He did it because he could. He is everything I’ve every fantasied about in a husband and I could happily allow him to be the father of my children. He’s my best friend.

We broke up because of me. I am a messed up person, I don’t want to blame my childhood or even my BPD but I’ll explain - BPD is a very evil, manipulative disorder to have. Having known quite a few and having lived my entire life as this demon, I can confirm we are the spawn of Satan. If you’re bpd and reading this and you want to talk about stigma please don’t. Please be honest with yourself. We pick the fights, we discard (which is abusive btw) when we feel slighted, we’re controlling, some of us are physically abusive too and highly manipulative. Nothing is off limits when we feel slighted. Not lies about miscarriages, not lies about whether or not we were raped etc. Please, understand, I know these things can really happen to us, I have been raped, I have had a miscarriage. But of all the people ive ever met wit this condition I knew a lot of us were lying, I watched us and me manipulate situations. 

My ex isn’t perfect but I fucking ruined him. All the while swearing I love him. And I DO. I love him so much that it scares me, his mum is also like me, I used to look down on NPD’s ironically and so that I could detach myself and tell myself “at least I’m not like narcissists!!! I’m better!!!” And I would read r/bpdlovedones to make myself feel better. Because I’m not like THOSE bpds, I’m BETTER. 🙄

I am not. I am evil. I isolated my bf by moving him in with me, I was the person he saw all the time. I encouraged him to cut off his parents (they are a suite however but his mum said he could always return to hers if need be and I didn’t think that offer was necessary so I wanted her out of the picture. Although tbf likewise with her, she hated me, I think, for taking her son) 
I would split on him and they talk shit behind his back, to my little sister, to my dealer who I Later ended up fucking after he and I broke up 😩 
I would ignore him for days on end not even loooing at purposely not acknowledging his presence & eventually he stopped pandering to me and let come crawling back instead which I deserved. 
Once i thought he’d hit me-he wouldn’t ever ever do this- and threatened to stab him. He walked away I started begging him not to go. How fucking cruel.
I would chat shit about his friends, found them immature and annoying. I made fun of him sometimes but towards the end of the relationship I had stopped that because I hated the way I behaved.
He also showed me some clout people he idolised and I wormed my way into their friendship groups and sat at ones birthday party last year and the other one is my best friend who I go out partying with yet my ex has never got to meet.
Sometimes I lie to him about an interaction with someone because I’ll feel ashamed of how much I overshared about myself and my life and the relationship. My friends think he’s this monster and he’s fucking not. I wasn’t very vocal about the beautiful stuff he did for me and I regret that and I’m extremely ashamed. 
Eventually my emotional abusive pushed him into doing something awful and far away from his nature to me.
I went out of my way not to slander him and only told a couple of friends. I ended us completely because he deserves so much better, also what he did really fucked me but I know that I deserve it and he isn’t really like that. He never has been. 

I love him so much. I wish I was born without BPD. I wish my parents had loved me. I wish there were suicide facilities that I could die a dignified death in, instead of my garden. 
To anybody who has lived with a bpd, I’m so so sorry. I wish I could heal all the victims, I’m sorry you’ve had to meet us. Please don’t beat yourself up if you stay with us, but try to remember it’s just love bombing. Don’t let it trick you!!!!!!!!!




Finally I will confess everything I have done to show evidence of why I know I’m a monster:

- aged 6 I have grown tired of my parents abuse. I don’t understand why my mother hates me so much, why my father is a monster. They expose me and my siblings to sexually vulgar stuff (dad used to watch porn in front of us and movies with sex scenes), and mum used to leave books that had pictures of babies that had been blown up. One day after being homeless for a while, we get taken into care and meet social worker. Dad always told me not to tell or they’ll take us away. I decide, at 6, that I should punish my parents for not loving me. I tell the social worker because I want us to be taken away from her as a punishment. They do. 

- even so young, I decided I needed tragedy in my life. I wanted to experience all the trauma. And I did - some by accident and some by which I purposely placed myself there. I got myself raped, beaten up, I had a miscarriage because I purposely stopped using my pills but then the father (a drug addicted drug dealer) beat me up after taking Valium (he didn’t beat me because of the baby, he did because I told him to clean his piss off my bathroom floor). I lost the case at court because the evidence went missing.

- I was forced into prostitution by a gang I hung around with and purposely ignored danger so that bad things would happen.




- at 16 I got sectioned for suicidal ideation. Here I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression and then “trauma induced psychosis with schizoid symptoms” something like that ???? I don’t have psychosis, nor schizophrenia. Day one I saw the patients that acted out the most garnered the most attention and I had never been SEEN like that. So I imitated symptoms. I scare myself with the level of acting I’ve executed. 
On all of my siblings lives this is true. I then decided I would go to secure to see what it was like and show them I was bad. So I began to say I heard voices, saw my dad climbing through the window, I would say people looked like wooden dolls and would scream and cry, imitating somatic flashbacks. 
The only thing I really get is dissociation and emotional flashbacks. That’s it. 



- when my little brother went looking for our parents. I planned for my siblings to all hate them like I did after I met up with my birth mum in 2017 and she was heartless Gemini pig. Everything I’d put myself through just to hear her say she was sorry - I wanted her to feel guilt at how she treated us when I told her everything I’d gone through. She didn’t give a shit. When I cut her out she told me to tell my siblings she has “no children”. 
I told my brother that our father forced me to molest him and I told him our mum knew. I thought it would make him hate them like me. So I wasn’t alone in my sadness and hate. But my brother is too pure hearted.  And he and our birth mum hang out together. She IS actually evil tho, I get my manipulative/spiteful side from her. My brother doesn’t understand mental health and thinks she is wonderful.



- on New Year’s Eve my ex took me to a 2 day hotel party with his friendship group, and I got jealous because he wasn’t paying me enough attention and chose to sleep there instead of with me. On the Uber back on New Year’s Eve I told him the guy changed the route and tried to go to some dodgy area. Tbf I feeling triggered I can’t remember by what, but he did actually go off route and that set off alarm bells but he didn’t do anything to really indicate that. He dropped me, my ex was late picking me up from outside. Midnight came and I left him to sit in the dark in the bathroom, high and drunk. We should’ve kissed. 
I’m so spiteful. So ducking attention seeking. 

I’m not doing this for kicks btw. This is how my mind works and I never realised until I started reading r/bpdlovedones properly and regularly. Then I realised this IS me. I am this fake, hollow, empty person, I am an imitator of emotions and a puppeteer. Everything I’ve ever done has been part of a plan to make me Victim Numero Uno. I am disgusted. I have spent a lot of time thinking this over. 
I have tied my noose. This is my second attempt this year and I pray it’s my final
One. I can’t live with what I’ve done to people, I can’t live with this manipulation, IM AN ABUSER. And that’s all I’ll ever be. How can be so cruel to others when I’ve been abused myself??? On top of that HOW TF am I able to justify this crazy shit in the moment?????????????
I need to speak to God, I need to chat to man. HOW DARE YOU CURSE ME TO WONDER THE EARTH LIKE THIS? HOW DARE YOU?????? IM SO ANGRY. I AM A FUCKING MONSTER and I deserve every awful goddamn thing that ever happened to me. 
I don’t even deserve death.
DRAG ME BTW - DRAG ME TO FILTH, FUCK YOUR SYMPATHY OR YOUR EMPATHY JUST DRAG ME TO FUCKING FILTH, LORD, SATAN AND GOD HIMSELF KNOWS I DESERVE IT.

I'm dependent on Tramadol, and other Opiates with Venlafaxine to get through each day. (It works!) I've read that all these other things mixed in with BPD (co-morbid disorders) raise the 1 in 10 chance of death by suicide to something like a 1 in 7 chance! (I think the stats are accurate? Some links would be cool!)

I see a possible problem next month when I run out of Tramadol... I self med with it - £300 a month. One I cut down last week, I dropped into a suicidal/paranoid/anxious state, which I was brought out by increasing Tramadol again.

That wont be possible next month - I need to cut down before then, or I'll be cold turkey.

All signs point to me realistically being the actual 1 in the 5 that doesn't make it... a perfect storm of problems.

I've mentioned this to my CBT therapist, and she'll be working out something for me.

I wanted to know if there's anything I can sort out for myself?

The scene - 7th July... I'm in an emotional crisis, and deeply suicidal/paranoid. (I'd want to lie to psychs to say I feel ""fine"" so I can make an attempt - how can I handle this if it happens?! I've done it in the past.) 

Do I just walk to the local hospital and say at the reception ""Hi, I'm suicidal, so I'll sit over there a bit, but will head off shortly and kill myself if I lose too much self control.""
That would be the situation - but it sounds to me like it' fail miserably in helping me!

If someone from A & E comes out later to assess me - and I say I'm suicidal - what could I expect? Being kept in overnight? Sent home?
Prescribed crisis medication? (sleeping tablets?) That would be cool - but I've never heard off anyone that they'd get tablets to help them through a short lived crisis.
I'm very suspicious of going to the hospital in this kind of situation...

It'd be nice to know what I'm getting myself into! I look after my partner, so I can't be locked up like the one in ""Girl, Interrupted"" for over a year!

167,Living with BPD as a male is a true living nightmare and I'm not sure if it's worth it anymore,"I have borderline personality disorder, wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Everyday I wake up to a world of immense agony and pain, where a small comment can escalate to a full-blown war. 

My emotions are uncontrolled and I can't cope with anything without breaking down and lashing out at those around me. Not that I have anyone though, I'm 23, still a virgin and got zero friends. Never been in a relationship and the few crushes I had were already chaotic for me.

Even better is the fact both emotions and bpd are seen as a female thing, an overly emotional guy is looked down upon, that coupled with the intense insecurities and trust difficulties, I am basically seen as weak and pathetic by society. I also happen to be severely traumatized from childhood abuse and really fragile and scared of intimacy. 

BPD causes me to have seeking a relationship as my sole purpose in life, literally what gets me up in the morning. Though, girls would never be interested in me, and even though I'm bisexual the fear of intimacy doesn't go well with the hookup culture of lgbt dating. 

So I'm 100% alone and always have been, and in immense pain seeing as my own disorder causes me to wish for someone more than anything. 

I have no sense of identity, nothing long-lasting that can bring me enough joy to live. Everything I do in my life seems to revolve around making myself more desirable somehow so someone will love me.

Even my parents are tired of me after the stuff I put them through. Nobody understands, there's nothing that can help me except a somewhat obscure form of therapy that isn't easily available in my country, and my life is agonizing no matter what I do.

No amount of self-help, reading, philosophy, religion, wishful thinking, hobbies, spending time in nature, meditation, alternative medicine, or change in behavior helps me cope with my mental anguish. 

I have been living in hell for over two decades. My own mind wants to kill me daily, and at this point, I can't find enough reasons to convince it that it's a bad idea. I'm not even depressed, just looking at suicide as a rational way out of my situation. 

Living in europe makes it hard to get a gun though, that's probably the only reason I'm still alive until I find the guts to pick a more bold and possibly painful method.

i've felt myself slowly get worse, and worse for a while now, and tonight i had to really convince myself to not drown myself. it scared me. as i've self harmed before, and taken far more than the recommended dose of medication, tonight for the first time, it felt real.

177,Been dealing with BPD/OCD,"Before i begin i'd like to thank anyone who takes the time to read all of this. It's a very long story, but i feel like it's needed to get the point across.

Lately i've been having trouble standing on my own two feet again, mentally speaking. I was told that i have a big heart and was a compassionate person but my latest ruminations about my past have been haunting me.

I'd like to share something i haven't with a lot of my loved ones because it's probably the worst thing i've ever done to someone. A few years ago there was a girl who lived in the same town i did. She had recently broken up with her boyfriend and was most likely a BPD like me. I hadn't known this girl personally, nor have i ever even heard her name before. 

I had heard in the morning before all of this occurred that her mother went on facebook and said something along the lines of ""Fuck everyone one of you cunts who did this and who bullied my daughter to death, i hope you all suffer"". Its not the exact quote, but she showed hostility that at the time i felt was unjustified and childish.

During highschool i had been a pessimistic asshole, and despite cutting myself before and being suicidal it had gotten better when i had gotten a girlfriend. One night i was browsing 4chan and saw a thread about the incident on /b/. The thread was dying, but it was something along the lines of ""She committed suicide after her boyfriend broke up with her, lets go on this facebook page (It was a page in remembrance of her) and post pictures of buses for the lulz"" (She jumped in front of a bus and died in the hospital)

At the time i was frequently on 4chan and the lack of empathy they usually had made me adapt the ""Life sucks, you just deal with it"" attitude. 

My closest friends have/had that same type of attitude, but the more i think about it the less i see them as friends. One in particular has always been there for me and has helped me through more tough times than i could count... but recently another who i'd had considered to be as close as a brother to me has shown how much he hates people, and i guess its partially the reason i grew to feel that way.

Instead of simply letting this pass by, something in me compelled me to re-post the thread for the entertainment of it all. I sat and laughed at these comments without a second of remorse for the family or friends of this girl who probably shared all of the same problems i did. I didn't think once ""What if it was me"" or ""How would my friends or family react to this"". The next day i came into school and i saw just how many people were upset by it... i had felt like it was all faked sympathy for the death of this girl.

Now here i am, two years later, thinking about how i could of let myself get so low. How i was able to allow myself to get enjoyment out of this girls suffering and her family's suffering. I never once thought about how much her mother was probably going through and the extreme emotions she was feeling. I couldn't imagine ever losing my daughter or son to suicide. I feel like im just worthless scum at this point.

I just want to let go of the past and move forward with the best of intentions but theres always a voice in the back of my mind telling me that ""You're just pretending so that people will like you"".

I hate this. I hate who i am. I hate hurting people above all else. I've recently had a life changing experience that's given me a new appreciation for everything in this world, and for all the kindness that was given to me but that i never appreciated, but these past demons continue to haunt me every night. Here i am typing this all out at 4 in the morning when i have class in 6 hours.

The suicidal thoughts that had gone away for the last two years are finally coming back with force. Im scared every day that im going to become a terrible husband to my future wife or that i'll never be able to make up for what i've done, or that i'll end up like my neglectful father who never truly appreciates anything that's people do for me.

I feel lonely. I feel lost. I dont know where to start to rebuild myself, or if there is anything even worth saving. Im starting therapy tomorrow at my college for my issues, but i'm fearful about the future because of the past.

I’ve messaged someone who’s going through a really rough time that I wasn’t doing good and I feel like this person doesn’t even really like me when I’m my head we are friends. I think it’s something to do with how fast I jump to being friends in my head, and I think I’m just scaring everyone off. Yesterday I found out that my friend doesn’t have bpd, and on top of that they both fell out with me because one of them told me they wanted to punch me in the face at one point and that really upset me because I have some trauma related to the women in my life threatening/hitting me. I thought I could talk to people about the upsetting things and actually have a conversation about it but instead I got shouted at and blocked. I can’t get help, it’s been 3 years and it’s still the same as it was when I first got diagnosed with bpd, and everything I read online about life with bpd just makes me want to kill myself more. I hurt myself yesterday and I will continue to do so until this feeling leaves my body. My intrusive thoughts are the worst as they will cause me to cause others emotional harm. I believe they’re trying to use me. Everyone in my life has used me to the point where I cannot a trust a single person that comes into my life. I may take my life very very soon and there isn’t much anyone can do about it. Im sorry to everyone I’ve hurt and I’m sorry to those who think my actions are selfish but I’m just trying to make life easier and so that the others around me won’t get hurt by my horrendous mind. Did you know 70% of people with bpd attempt and 10% succeed? And that most people with bpd won’t have a significant relationship past 29? Why would I consciously want to live a life that is so full of pain and loneliness?

 I’m going to be doing it tonight. I’m going to wonder out into the woods and slit my wrists and hang myself. I’ve hung from the ropes there before and it’s the nicest place to look at before you pass out. I’ve written notes to my friends and my family to let them know that there was  nothing anyone could do, and that the only one to blame for this is myself. I don’t deserve the air I breathe or the ground that I walk on, and I wish I could hav had someone be in love wi me just once, but I was never made for being loved, only loving unconditionally.

180,Post-Traumatic Cripple with BPD Living In Poverty,"I live my life in so much pain. Been dealing with the suicidal thoughts since 2nd or 3rd grade, feeling like they're always there, at the back of my mind, voices suddenly coming into the light the moment I'm alone with my thoughts, whispering to me about how I'm worthless and deserve to die, how no one loves me, how everyone around me is waiting for me to finally off myself so that they can finally be happy. Maybe it's the trauma of being abused as a child, or the shame of being blamed for the rape I endured between ages 8 and 11. Maybe I inherited my mom's crazy. All I know is if I'm not doing 1000 things at once, the voices come to me. 

The life of poverty I've always lived doesn't help. I've spent my entire life under the fear of this or that getting shut off or someone coming to my parents' door either to shut us off, collect a debt, or serve us with some kind of court papers. As an adult, finally living on my own, I'm barely scraping by. From the years of abuse I'd endured, my knee and my back are absolutely fucked (I'm 22 and get around with a cane. think about that.), so there are a lot of things I can't do, like a lot of standing or walking around. Worst is I've never been able to get these injuries checked out (both because of active efforts by my mother to deny me medical care and because I'm fucking broke), so I can't exactly apply for disability, and as a college student just trying to finish my classes before my Pell Grant gets utterly fucked by the Dump administration, I barely have the time to do the work I can find. Fiancee is a struggling factory worker, currently unemployed but always only just barely able to pay our bills and make child support payments. 

This month, I emptied out my bank accounts to pay rent.... and only had half as much as we needed. We have naught but $20 in grocery store gift cards to our names and, until I get back to my work study job next year, I don't really see anything coming in for us.

And, to be honest, the voices make it hard to see a point to anything anymore. I know people think I should get help, get into therapy, get on meds and MAKE THE FUCKING VOICES STOP, but with how I grew up, so deeply and constantly in debt, I'd much rather end everything than live in fear life that again. I can't fucking do that shit again. I can't keep fucking living like this, constantly worrying how we'll pay our bills, constantly going without so there's enough for my fiancee when he gets home from his job searches...

He'd be better off without me. No longer wasting money on me, no longer stressing out about triggering my PTSD, no longer dragged into deep pits of depression when he can't help me out of the abyss my BPD brings me to.

186,Declining University Grades + PTSD & BPD = Give Up Now,"My personality and sense of self are very complicated so my current run of under par grades are killing me. 

I'll give background if it helps others understand - I grew up in a family where one of the siblings had cancer until I was 12. I had to take on a mothering role until my brother was well again and my mum could return to the family. By the time that happened, I had started high school at a catholic co-ed in a rural town. Between Year 7 and 9 I started off being bullied and harassed but this became worse over the years transitioning into frequent physical, psychological and sexual assaults with several instances of rape, one being on a school camp by a group of boys. The school told me it was my fault, I should ignore it, or find a new group of friends. 

The only thing that was constant and I could control were my grades. I moved towns and did very well in high school. When I moved to the city for university, my first attempts at dating brought back all my old traumas and I became severely suicidal, depressed and addicted to substances. My grades at university went from 3.0 GPA to getting kicked out. After months of inpatient treatment and a billion medications, I went back to university at a different place and degree, and was able to get back to what I was good at with a 3.75 GPA. I also at the time started a law suit against the high school where the assaults happened, but like when I was a student there, the school is not taking the law suit seriously (they are submitting documents weeks to months too late and are not co-operating like asking for me to supply documents the government requires them to keep in storage). 

However - right now, I have started to decline in my grades and lose focus to the point where I am being given 50% grade passes because I am not following the task instructions. I don't know if it's because the assignment instructions were poorly written (which some of them have been), or I'm so focused on trying to control the one thing I can that I'm good at. So my recent marks have been 50% passes when I am used to getting 70% and above (Distinctions and High Distinctions). I'm doing Law/Arts and I know how competitive getting a job will be so the grades are make or break. 

But my mentality is telling my to give up now because I have already stuffed up so what's the point continuing. I think I should just give up now because academia was all I had going for me but it's clear that I'm just mediocre, not special or different, and a failure at the only thing I have worth living for. And I also hate myself because of how stupid the whole attitude to grades is. 

I lost all my friends when I was an inpatient so I now spend most days by myself, I catastrophise everything (like these grades) and I always jumped to conclusions that the world is against me. Every grade good or bad is like a stab in the gut and having trauma-induced BPD means the self-hate and disappointment just keeps stacking on top of each other. My self-harm is increasing to almost daily and so are my para-suicidal overdoses. I feel if I'm honest with my therapists the current semester will be a waste (I'm 3 weeks out from exams) as they may admit me. I just feel like my future is dead and so I might as well be too. 

If anyone, especially with PTSD or BPD, knows how to deal with or come back from declining grades when feeling depressed and suicidal some tips would help.

187,Helping someone who plans to commit suicide+has BPD,"For the sake of protecting this girls anonymity, I'm going air on the side of caution and be sparse with her or my personal details: 

**Backstory**: I ran into this 17 year old girl a few weeks ago on what is ostensibly an outlet for 4chan (specifically the /pol/ board) users to communicate outside of the board (via facebook), and she lives in a foreign western european country (I live in the USA). We got to talking, we both liked eachother, and I thought that taking her along with me on my annual trip to (let's just say) Europe would be a good idea so that I could better get to know her. I proposed we do this, and she said she'd talk it over with her parents at some point between now and when we'd have to go. This girl is intelligent, sweet, attractive, and I was as a result completely thrown-back by the revelation that she intends to kill herself in three months on her 18th birthday, which she disclosed to me a few minutes back. 

**Her personality**: Her demeanor is typical of your average teenage girl. She's light-hearted in our calls (or has been), has an affinity for Disney songs (talked with her today and she was singing them for 3 hours straight, knew all the words, her happiness was infectious), and just generally never seemed to take anything too seriously. She's proven to be stalwart in her ideological convictions (i.e. a proponent of first-second wave feminism, an issue on which she would not budge), has spoken in some detail as to her plans for the future, and how she'd like to enter the tourist industry and settle down somewhere in the Mediterranean, have children after her 30's, and had just generally shown no indications of being in the psychological predicament that she's in, barring the occasional display of insecurity which I presumed to be typical of a girl that age. i.e. she uses a British accent in lieu of her native one in order to come across as being more socially attractive to people, which I shut down as soon as I started talking to her on the basis (and looking back this was a great move on my part) that her native accent was preferable to the British one, after which point she had no problem switching back in subsequent (skype) calls. Additionally, a comment about the size of her breasts being too small. Again, I didn't take any of this as being totally out of the norm for her demographic, although granted, the accent thing came off as being a bit excessive. And in retrospect, no female her age with any semblance of normality would be browsing that specific board. 

So yeah, tonight she gauged me for validation pertaining to the nature of our relationship, and why I'd want to take her on my trip. I told her I liked her, that I found her attractive, and that on that basis I was interested in taking her. Her reply, verbatim, upon telling me that we'd have to go sooner than later: 
>""Well im executing my plan that i have for 5 yrs
On my 18th birthday
Which i thought would be most suitable
Because when im 18 i have to leech off the govt and i think thats horrible enough
(Me) I'm lost
Basically
Im comitting suicide on my birthday
So i figured
Before would be better lol""

**Her story**: Needless to say I was perplexed and initially thought she was playing around (she's playful). As such, I subsequently inquired and asked for her to tell me this on skype so as to confirm (what seemed to be) the impossible. I asked her to tell me her story, and so she began (and I will try to recount this the best I can): 

She started off by telling me that her plans for the future were just things she romanticized about in order to make herself feel better in the short term. She then went into her backstory, starting with how she'd gotten into an altercation with a girl who'd stole something from her in the fourth grade, something which apparently had notable ramifications with her school/parents that she didn't particularly elaborate upon. As she went on, her emotional composure started to wane, and what were initially snivels progressively became tears, and then full out sobbing. She said that she had issues making friends in middle school, that other girls made fun of her and was unable to make friends, and that she ended up getting involved with the wrong people at age 13. She found a boyfriend who eventually extorted her for nude images via physical threats of harm against her (using another girl-friend of his who was supposedly a trained fighter), and he spread those images around the campus, which eventually reached out to thousands upon thousands of people. She started getting harassed at school infinitely more than she had been, being lambasted as a whore, slut, what have you by her peers, and eventually was even approached by her neighbor on the subject. Then she was sent to a psychward for a few months(?) on account of what had become a severe case of depression, in tandem with the BPD. My recollection at this point is hazy, but she ended up dropping out of school around 2014 and pursuing an education in her desired field at a school away from home which was expensive for her family. At that school she was again made fun of by others, many of whom had also seen the nude images, and told she was too ugly to enter that particular field by the other girls. Moreover, she didn't seem happy with going down that path anyway, and eventually gave up. She enrolled in what was/is essentially a school for dropouts and got a job as a cashier. During her job as a cashier she was approach by her manager who referenced the nude images (and again this is years after the fact), that's all I know about that. She eventually quit that job and is currently working another job so that she can ""pay off her parents for the money they'd wasted on her"" before she goes through with the act. Ergo, she's obsessed with the notion of being a financial burden on others, a sentiment that was presumably reinforced by the aforementioned image-board which places a heavy emphasis on personal accountability and not being a societal ""leech"". Finally she said that she'd tried and failed to kill herself on two occasions in the past, and that she sometimes ""walked slowly"" in front of oncoming traffic in hopes of getting hit. She ended on that note because she had to go to bed, and the duration of this call was 36 minutes. I should add that I do not understand the relationship she has with her parents very well, though the mother had supposedly stated, post the 4th grade incident, that she'd wished she'd had an abortion. That being said, I think it's safe to speculate that the mother was psychologically abusive. Her parents divorced when she was 7, and to my understanding she now lives with her father and her brother, and perhaps a step mother (I'd never bothered to inquire before this particular call). The father seems to have her best interests in mind, and enjoys her company. 
**tldr**: She has no future prospects as of now whatsoever in terms of her professional/academic life, she's depressed, she's been severely traumatized, and diagnosed with BPD and chronic depression. 

**How I responded throughout the call**: I'm relatively well versed in ""street-psychology"", as it were, and knew that the bare minimum that was required of me was to thoroughly hear her out, to validate her psychological maladies pertaining to her past as having been profound/relevant in their impact, and to continue to re-affirm the notion that she is both intelligent, attractive, and most importantly young with an entire future ahead of her (and she is, from an unbiased perspective all of these things). Moreover, I told her that she did not have any deep psychological issues that could not be remedied. Apart from that, I really didn't know what to say. 

**Regarding her sexual life**: She's a virgin, and there's there's been no abuse of a sexual nature that I'm aware of outside of the incident with the nude images. She's had one other boyfriend, a relationship that lasted for two years (IIRC) with someone online who crazily enough lives in my city. She'd planned to purchase a ticket to visit him after her birthday, but then figured out he was cheating on her with a local girl a few months back. Since then she's remained single. Pertaining to that facet of her life, this is all I know. 

**The trip**: Very rural, beautiful location at my grandparents summer home (they are incredibly nice people). I also wanted to show her a big city or two.  

**Me**: I'm 19 and living with one of my parents, am from (what is currently) a middle income family, and I have no immediate plans for the future beyond transferal to a four year.

**My question**: I am not interested in finding a wife or anything right now, and I already told her (and this was probably a mistake on my part, and was a bit of a knee-jerk reaction before I knew she was dead-serious) that if she's serious about killing herself, I didn't want to take her on what would be a three or so week trip. So now I find myself in a bit of an ethical dilemma, wherein I want to take her so that I can try to somehow sway her from this path, but I also don't want to become the romantic crutch upon which she re-builds her life with long-term plans for the future (with me). I honestly have no idea how to proceed, and the trip is going to be in late May, and so there's ample time for me to take some course of action here. Maybe I'm insane to even think that the trip is viable anymore as a means of helping her. I don't know.

What do I do? How can I save this girl? I've certainly no intentions of walking away, but she will want to know what it is that she can do to get out of her predicament, and I have no answers for her. Of what use are emotional platitudes if I can't help outline for her a cohesive step-by-step plan to get out of this psychological ditch? 

**Note**: What I've disclosed here in terms of backstory is virtually every detail I can think of, anything left out was left out on account of my not knowing X detail. I can however resume this chat with her tomorrow to get to know more, and may update this thread accordingly. 

**Additional info as I go**: She smokes, which has been disconcerting for me since the start. Said she was peer pressured into it at some point.

191,"Friend is suicidal and has BPD, what can I do?","I have a friend who has borderline and right now tells me she is suicidal. She's told me this before, about a year ago. I don't know what it's called in english but she put herself in a kind of care where you go when you start noticing this. She got better last year and even if she never felt great she did feel okay and not suicidal at least. But now it's come back. She told me she feels lonely. The exact message she sent me she told me she didn't want to burden me with this information but that she had to tell someone. And she wanted to be cautious because maybe she only wanted attention. (That's her words)

She can be a bit hard to handle. Most nights out towards the end she wants to go clubbing which is always a bad idea with her because it usually ends up with her hooking up with someone and the day after she feels shit about it and lonely again. She has an abusive ex that she still meets from time to time eventhough me and her friends tell her she shouldn't ever speak with him again. This time when she started feeling lonely it could partly be due to the fact that she met someone one tinder who she got a bit interested in but he stopped answering her. And she feels lonely again. 

I'm talking to her through texts and just trying to help in any way I can. I'm not her best best friends but I think she think's I'm one of the easier ones to talk to. I try to hear what she is saying but I don't really think she knows herself why she feels like this. She told my why should she be fighting when it hurts so much, it's going to feel much better when she's dead. I said that she should just take it one day at a time.

194,Alone in a crowded room. Tired of BPD. Just let me go.,"I have borderline personality disorder. It's exhausting. Everything I feel, it's like I'm not strong enough to stand the waves of my own emotions. I'm ruled by them, constantly straining against them so they don't unleash some sort of tsunami that wipes out all my friends, trying to figure out a normal response and pasting that on my face so nobody notices I'm drowning.

And why is it so hard to ask for help? I've been really lucky to connect deeply with a few wonderful people, but I feel like I'm just begging for attention if I talk about this or how I feel like I don't deserve to live. Or that I struggle to see the value in living sometimes. I'm sorry, internet strangers, I'm sort of rambling and not making much sense.

I feel like a prisoner, and the only way to be free is to let go of the life that's keeping me hostage. But to do that, I have to part with everything I've ever loved and that's loved me. I couldn't do that to them. But how can I do this to me? I'll save them from a few months of feeling sad, in exchange I'll go on suffering my entire life. 

I make enough to survive, and that's it, and that's the way the ruling class wants to keep it. I don't make enough educate myself and finish my degree, or move as I please to a place that offers better opportunity--I live with my entire life dictated by a job I hate. They decide my waking moments, they even decide when I get to see my family.

I'm nothing more than a pawn for a corporation, which I could stand if it were just for a short while, if I could ever get to the end of the board and start accomplishing things important to me, but all my energy goes to them and for not even much money.

I'm so trapped. It feels like there's only one way out. Everything is so beautiful but I hurt so much.

196,[x-post /r/BPD] I'm depressed. I moved states and I hate everything here.,"I'm 19. I moved from Atlanta, GA to the fucking-nowheresville of Vero Beach, FL in the middle of December of last year. My parents retired and since I couldn't financially get my shit together in time I was dragged along with them.

I left behind my school, my job that I loved, my best friends, and my boyfriend of a year.

I hate it here.

I don't know anyone and I don't get a chance to know anyone. Everyone here is old. I live in a gated retirement community and I have yet to see anyone under the age of 50. Not that I'd really like to make friends anyway, but it sets the mood.

I'm lonely and I miss my boyfriend. On the 1st of February when I flew over to see him (we've been flying back and forth, though not too often), he broke up with me. It was very amicable and I understand where he's coming from, but it's still hard to handle. We're remaining close friends right now and talking multiple times a day, so I didn't lose terribly. But I do miss him a lot. I'm convincing myself that we will still have a future together, maybe just not anytime soon. He's coming down for spring break in April, but I'm not going to get to see him before then.

I would say I'm doing online school but that would be somewhat of a lie. I'm ignoring online school. I enrolled because I didn't want to drop out for a year due to out-of-state tuition and whatnot, but it turns out it's a lot fucking harder to keep up with when I keep forgetting about it. I think I'm going to withdraw from the remaining two classes; I already withdrew from one. I haven't done any work in any of them.

Then there's this fucking terrible job I just got. Today was my second day. It's working in a large retail clothing store and turns out I would rather scrape bricks than do this menial labor of checking sizes with hangers and labels and prices with security tags one by one for 6 hours a day. The woman I was training with gave me the opportunity to try presenting a display, which was fun, until an assistant manager completely overhauled it because I apparently did a bad job. Now I don't want to do those anymore because I guess I don't believe in myself.

It was at least decent without this job, but now all my day time is eaten up by shit I hate doing, so I don't have the energy to do stuff that I actually enjoy.

I'm depressed. I'm so fucking depressed. I don't want to be here. I want to go back to Atlanta. I want to be able to call my boyfriend and have him pick me up in 20 minutes. I want to go to my job that I adored and had fun at. I'm just waiting on waking up from this really bad dream.

I'm trying to figure out if/how I should move back. I'm starting to contemplate killing myself because nothing gives me any happiness here and I feel like I'm stuck.

BPD and another potential BPD. I ended it today because I felt it was the best thing for me ultimately, but it feels wrong in my heart - she’s like a drug. 

I don’t want to be here anymore. I just want to not have to feel, deal with human emotions. The only thing stopping me is my cat and screwing my family by leaving a mortgage.

I’m done with this life. I don’t want to have to feel sadness or pain anymore.

212,"Husband thinks I have BPD. Now I'm an ""abuser"" and apparently I have the emotional mind of a child. ","I was the one who found the book Stop Walking on Eggshells, and he read it and said that I definitely have BPD. I have abandonment issues, I have angry outbursts, I'm physically violent, when we were dating I had sex with other people to ""get back at him,"" and the funny part is I always blamed my SO for the problems in our relationship. 

What made me look into the disorder in the first place is when I accused my brother-in-law of making up stress to force my husband and I apart. I also accused him of breaking up his cousin's marriage. I had a real fear that my husband would abandon me for his brother and care more about his brother's stress than my depression and anxiety. 

The real kicker is when I researched BPD online. There's a recent AMA about a husband whose wife has BPD, and most of the replies came from people who basically said, ""GET. OUT. NOW."" That people with BPD can't change, they'll fuck up their kids, they'll give their partners PTSD and ruin their lives. 

My husband is so supportive but I can't help but think he's just putting up with it because he feels obligated to to prove that he isn't like his Dad, who left the family when he was 13. I feel like everybody would be better off away from me. It's pretty telling when there is more support for people who are related to those with BPD than the people with BPD themselves.

All I ever wanted is to have friends and now that I have them I still feel so alone. I'm just 15 why do I have to feel like this. My vision is blurry and I don't know who I am. No one gave a shit. I overdosed and passed out. And after hospital they took me to the psychiatric ward. The psyciatrist there told us that I can wait another week. I was BEGGING for help for months since mom didn't wanna take me to my previous psychiatrist anymore. No one gives a single fuck until I completely fuck up myself. Why? All I ever wanted is validation. Psychiatrist also told me that I most likely have BPD but I can't be diaghnosed until I'm 18. I just want someone to be there for me and understand me. Around people I feel so fucking alone. I know that no one will love me the way I love them. I would do ANYTHING for them. I would DIE for them. And I'm sure that no one cares and that no one will see this either. I love you all. I'm sorry. Stay strong!
