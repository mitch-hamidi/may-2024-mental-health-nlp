0,Borderline Personality Disorder ,"I got diagnosed with BPD last week at the age of 33, 2 months after I broke a 12 year long relationship over a stupid misunderstanding. She was the reason I kept going in this world and now I have understood the reason why I am the way I am. I don’t think I want to live anymore. 7th March 2025. The date has been set. I hope I live enough in the next 10 months before I take myself out!

1,Feeling depressed and borderline suicidal ,"I'm a 26 year old female living in London. I have a child and a partner I live with, my friend group isn't extensive and I can't talk to them about my mental health because they're tough love approach sort of people and I'm very emotionally heightened. I lost my job in November and my partner lost his in January we've been applying for jobs every day but we've stopped even getting responses, not even rejections. Our finances are so bad I've resorted to shop lifting our dinners which has resulted in multiple bans from multiple places, for context I'm not a criminal, I've lived alone since I was 16 my relationship with my family is turbulent to say the least and I've had to support myself since I was a teenager I have done nothing but work since I was legally able but recently things have been hard. I've had to start selling things I love like my clothes and collectibles even bedding and furnishings just so I can make ends meet. My best friend died in December and everything's sort of been a downhill slope from there. I'm so embarrassed and angry at myself I hate myself for letting my family down and making myself look like a fool in the process. Something I've been afraid to tell anyone is that I sometimes think if I killed myself then this would all go away? The crippling debt, the embarrassment, the constant reminder in the back of my mind that I'm a failure. The voice in my head is so loud right now telling me I would save everyone a lot of headache if I just jumped off my balcony. Sometimes I think even if it didn't work at least maybe people would finally understand that I'm suffering. I get everyone has problems but I'm in a constant battle of heart vs mind. Do I steal or do I starve my head says do it and my heart says you're not a criminal don't be one. I can't do it anymore I need help I've called the samaritans I've spoke to mind everyone tells me I'm not a bad person but I feel like a useless person like a waste of a skin sort of person, like I'm inhabiting space someone else would have made way better use of. Does that make sense? I don't know. I don't have anyone and if I tell my partner I'm this depressed he will just spend every day on edge and I don't want that for him. What do I do? I'm just trying my best but it's not good enough I don't know if it's ever going to be and I just want it to be over I don't wanna feel the weight of it all anymore my chest is always heavy my head is always spinning I can't do it anymore.",1713202805.0,False,1,4,wicxaphase24,None,1c4sb04,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1c4sb04/feeling_depressed_and_borderline_suicidal/
2,Borderline personality disorder,I'm so depressed I have borderline personality disorder and I have been to mental hospital 8 times for suicide attempts and I don't have insurance anymore so I can't go to the doctor and get medication anymore I hit myself in the face every day my face is always swollen and bruised I hate myself so much my borderline personality disorder is so hard to understand and my family just don't care to understand it I have a severe hatred for myself I have to hit myself until I have black eyes and burn myself with cigarettes because i feel like I deserve it I don't know why I have such a severe hatred for myself i cry every time I look at myself in the mirror I wanna die im tired of life I just want to stop being so depressed and the only way to fix that is to kill myself  im gonna cut my throat because I always cut my wrist but It doesn't kill me fast enough I don't want to go back to the mental hospital they don't help they don't care so I will cut my throat i just hope and pray God doesn't send me to hell im sorry God please forgive me,1707791128.0,False,1,0,ProfessionalBelt8258,None,1apiaka,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1apiaka/borderline_personality_disorder/
3,Borderline over and over,"It has been so many years
Endless years of bitterness and loneliness
In which I’ve seen the same things happening to me over and over
So much pain and traumas to went through 
What did they amount to?
Nothing, I lost
And there’s nothing I can do about it anymore
No one cares
No one saw anything
No one saw that, one day, I was so upset of the I felt that I thought that, it would be better for me to get lost
Even if I could do it over
There’s nothing I would change
It’s a fitting end for someone like me
I guess I lost so much time with trying to get better 
But how can I get better when there’s so much loneliness?
A pitch black loneliness
Nothing would change even if I tried to
I have no one
No one at all
I’m only a doll that you play with secretly
I’m not good enough to be relegated to the first level
No one likes broken toys after all
Whether I wanted live or to give it doesn’t matter anymore
And anyway, who would even slightly care about that ?
Right, I’m just borderline and avoidant. With ADHD, possible ASD and substance use
I don’t even know if I can carry it to the end 
I have 1920mg of Oxycodone that I’ll inject into myself (I do it too often) with 5000mg of Amitriptyline, 15 000mg of venlafaxine, 2500mg of lamotrigine, and several harmless pills of Concerta and Loxapine

4,Suicidal thoughts and borderline personality,"As a teen I always knew that I was struggling to regulate my emotions and it didn’t get better when I started to self harm but I was able to find temporary relief. For a while I was just carving words into my thighs as subtle reminders or just to create scars to pick at later. Then I moved into burning myself and that made me feel tremendously better and I didn’t have to do it as often because the healing process took much longer than surface level scratches and cuts. Eventually my biological mother found out and I was sent to the psychiatrist which was when I find out I was I was manic depressive. I got put on meds but eventually stopped taking them bc they made me feel nauseous. For a while I was able to stop self harming but over the years I would end up being triggered and it was my only way to self soothe. I’ve never made great efforts to kill myself but this year and in the most recent months, I find myself thinking about it for most of the day. On a bad a day but even on good days. Some days it’s the first thing I think about when I wake up. I also can tell that I lack purpose. Im almost certain that I am just a body taking up space. I lack initiative and motivation to do anything but survive on a day to day basis. What makes it worse is that I have a boyfriend that loves with me and so I find myself waiting until our lease gets closer to ending to actually make an effort to just do it. Which makes me think that maybe im not suicidal and that it’s just a scape goat fantasy world I live in to avoid real life. I also find myself sleeping every chance I get and my boyfriend thinks I’m lazy which I  guess I am. I don’t see a point in doing anything if nothing I do actually matters. Is this just nihilism? Maybe something I can learn to understand?",1703743758.0,False,1,0,Actual-Celebration18,None,18smull,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/18smull/suicidal_thoughts_and_borderline_personality/
5,How do I deal with being borderline suicidal?,"Title. I don't know if I make sense when I say ""borderline suicidal"" but basically I'm in a very bad place mentally at the moment and pretty much the only things stopping me from offing myself is my fear of what comes after death and the fact that I've fallen out with a friend and I don't want her last words to me being her calling me a ""cowardly little fuck"" (I won't go into it, long story and faults on both ends) because I don't want her to potentially blame herself and I'd rather go out on a happier note.

6,Borderline personality disorder cycle of suicide,"I am in a lot of pain. I struggle to accept this may be how my life is forever. 

I’m 40- I’ve been suicidal since age 12. My family thinks my bpd and suicide is fake and I use it to manipulate people. 

I cut everyone out bc I can’t deal with being treated like a piece of shit anymore by them. It now feels like self abuse. 

Going to walk my dog and do some meds that help with this state in hopes I can shift. I’m a ketamine patient, but not in a self harm state so that’s my plan for today

11,Borderline Personality Disorder,"I have BPD. All I do is hurt people. All I do is hurt myself. Everything is painful. I can't have interpersonal relationships, I destroy those. I inspire hatred in others effortlessly. My parents abandoned me at a young age. I have never had a friend. I am not a whole or developed person. The void is unsatisfiable.

The whole world has told me that I am not a worthwhile person since I was born. And I believe it. I consider myself cancerous on this world. I don't believe I can get better. I try to hold out hope. But it's faded a lot. I (22M) am not willing to live like this any longer.

I keep thinking that when my grandparents die, and my cat dies, I'll hang myself from a lamppost in the main street of my home town. I want to be hard to remove, and I want it to emotionally hurt as many people as possible. I want to send the message that there's something wrong with this place if it can create someone like me. I want to stream it to the internet. I want my death to echo through the self-absorbed hedonistic apathetic trance we're all in. I want people to face me, that I'm a reflection of the sickness that made me. I can program, so I want to make a website that can be accessed by QR code. I want my suicide to be recorded to this website, with my message. I want it to be stored on a distributed cloud service like IPFS. I want to create a cloud bot that sends everyone from my home town this website, often, after I'm gone. I want them to face the rot. I want a system to automatically send photos of the suicide to people by physical mail. I want to haunt the place.

That's all just a fantasy of course. It soothes me.

And if I did it. I'd do it on the birthday of my, what's called a, Favourite Person which is someone a person with BPD is basically obsessed with.

I believe that I am a bad person. I have no self-love, no self-regulation of emotions, little self-awareness, little self-efficaciousness or self-trust, no sense of agency over my life, no hope that I can take action to secure my needs. And I know everyone will one day hate me, no matter what, because I believe I am insufficient.

12,I think I’m mentally disabled or at least borderline disabled,"I don’t think I’m a typical case of “mild autism” because I’m exceptionally stupid and people have treated me differently my entire life. Even as an adult at 25 some people still talk to me like I’m a child. I look back at some of the things I’ve done/said and they’re so incredibly stupid that only a mentally disabled person would do that. I’ve been so oblivious in some social situations I hate myself for it. I’ve only recently started understanding basic social cues, and often look back to understand something after it’s happened and I just hate how stupid I am.

I’ve been in an embarrassing number of car accidents just because I was thinking about something other than driving and forgot to look. I have a hard time holding down a job because if anything is on my mind or im distracted slightly I will screw up.

I used to think I must not be THAT retarded because I got a 3.8 in college. But then I think of how I fail at every job, was terrible at every sport, have the social skills of a toddler, etc. and people tell me all the time that I’m stupid, there’s something wrong with me, etc.

People take advantage of me all the time, or at least try. I sometimes let it happen for various reasons. Maybe im lonely, or I need access to drugs, or I just want sex and pretend to be loved. I’m pathetic. People who obviously hated me in retrospect and it was clear in the things they said, the eye rolling the jeering. Calling me a loser, comparing me to serial killers, saying I seem like a school shooter…. and thinking that someone saying those words drenched in contempt wants a relationship or is my friend…

People are incredibly hostile to me. People have told me twice to my face that they want to hurt me when I just thought I was making conversation. They look down their nose at me, sneer, tell me I’m stupid, subtly mock me. Probably rightly so, because I’m a loser. People can’t help but feel contempt for something worthless. It’s just human nature. 

When I was in rehab, I was ostracized and bullied. I gave away my cigarettes before trying and chickening out of hanging myself with my bootlaces…. The look of utter disgust on one of their faces…. and then for the roommate to come in 2 1/2 hours later with laundry after I finished crying like a bitch and gave a sarcastic “you’re still alive, yay!” Again, too fucking dumb to realize it was that transparent. I tried to slice open an artery cutting lengthwise down my wrist about a year ago. I tried to cover it with my coat. Coworkers must have noticed because they went on a spiel about how people that kill themselves probably deserves it, and how after his cousin committed suicide his family pretended to care for a few months before she became the butt of all their jokes.

And I beg to be told why I’m treated like this. What’s wrong with me? Help me, tell me so I can fix it? I beg and plead with people sometimes. But always radio silence. Gaslighting. Etc. What am I supposed to draw from that other than that I’m mentally defective and people don’t tell me because I can’t change it? Why else would I be incapable of recognizing what it is unless I’m retarded? Whatever is wrong with me it’s both painfully obvious to everyone who interacts with me and at the same time completely immutable, otherwise I’d have been told by now what’s wrong. 

People just want me gone. And when I do go I won’t be remembered fondly. Probably like my coworkers cousin. I’m so sick of this “ohh don’t kill yourself” suicide hotline bullshit. I don’t think people when they imagine suicide are thinking of somebody like me. I think most people that finally finish it ARE people like me. 

And I beg to be told why I’m treated like this. What’s wrong with me? Help me, tell me so I can fix it? I beg and plead with people sometimes. But always radio silence. Gaslighting. Etc. What am I supposed to draw from that other than that I’m mentally defective and people don’t tell me because I can’t change it? Why else would I be incapable of recognizing what it is unless I’m retarded? Whatever is wrong with me it’s both painfully obvious to everyone who interacts with me and at the same time completely immutable, otherwise I’d have been told by now what’s wrong. 

The sad fact of the matter is that I’m not wanted. It doesn’t “get better”. I keep hanging onto this stupid tiny thread of hope that one day I’ll have a life worth living and will be accepted and not a bug to be squashed. But there is no hope. It doesn’t matter how much you care, how much you’re good to people in an effort to make the world a bit easier for SOMEBODY, try to find happiness in some little corner somewhere, give your life some kind of value or purpose because you can’t live without other people there.

13,I was borderline about to kill someone,"Just flat out murder. My grandma asked me to speak to her just to listen to an angry rant. She has dementia. None of what she says is true. All I see is a suffering person before my eyes. She thinks my dad is trying to kill her. He's not 

Then my broken head said why not you just kill her yourself? My grandma can't keep track of time, nor the days, and her short term memory has been shot ages ago. I'll be doing the whole family a favor, plus my grandma will finally be at peace. She truly died years ago. Whatever husk that lives in her now is all that remains.

After all, I have nothing else to live for 

I just exist to appease other people 

I'll be appeasing everyone if I do it, right?

And then maybe the police can kill me too when they show up.

All I did was leave in the middle of the rant. I'm isolating myself in my room and she's still going, angrily ranting about things that have never happened. It's been two hours. It got so bad that my mom called a relative to help. It escalated to the police being called. I don't know who called them. Wtf are they going to do - its just a ranting old lady.

Nothing will be done. My mom keeps saying she'll get her admitted to a nursing home soon. I don't believe it because she's been repeating the same shit for a year and my grandma is still here. I offer to help but I'm rejected everytime.

So... All the more reason for me to take action.

I can't force the people around me to change. I'll have to be the one to do it.

Yet... I know if I did it it'd break my mom especially. Because she'll understand the motive but she doesn't want to see her kid become a murderer.

I learned to deal with him and haven’t spoke to him for about a year now even though we live together but my sister still haven’t found a way to handle him and is becoming worse and worse everyday. 
Step dad would do little annoying things to straight up disrespectful things like turning the wifi off at 9pm every night even though we both pay rent, throwing shoes outside during rain, threatening to kick us out via text and tell her she has no friends go outside etc, and whenever you bring up a serious matter to him he would just laugh and won’t take it seriously and just changes the topic or walk away.

She usually spends her days playing games all day or working and she seems fine during those times but whenever she gets into a fight over something with the step dad she is crying and saying how she is gonna kill herself or wish she died in a accident or something etc etc its not very pleasant to hear.

I tried to talk to her but everytime i suggest a solution or advice she will deny that will help her in anyway and just won’t even attempt it or say that she is already fked up and can’t change or dont want to change etc etc i have no idea what to do.

The suffering will never end. I've tried all kinds of therapy and medications and there is no treatment and especially no cure. A life with BPD is not worth living, unfortunately.

21,"Today I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Tomorrow, I will be dead.","Today I was unofficially diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Tomorrow, I'm going to hopefully be dead.

I have a previous diagnosis of severe CPTSD [I had a truly horrifying childhood that I don't care to recall that contained every type of imaginable abuse], but my psychiatrist didn't have those records on hand so he's tentatively diagnosed me with BPD because he said it was 'staring him in the face'. He said it's possible to be something else but he strongly feels this is an issue for me right now. He tried to explain that I could get through it and change, but he's lying. Every post and comment I've seen on any site proves it. We are monsters who deserve nothing but the electric chair. I wish we could be caught in utero and aborted, or at least I could have been. Then I wouldn't have hurt everyone- my parents, my friends, my past and current friendships and relationships. They could be so happy and have good lives if I had never been born.

I know how people look at people like me. I have read all the comments and posts about how abusive we are. I don't want to become that way, I don't want to have been that way. I *love* people, people are beautiful, they deserve love and praise, and I go out of my way to put my feelings aside at every given second. It's was all a lie. 

I was hurting people, I didn't even know. I'm selfish and completely self-absorbed. I'm an abusive monster. Everybody with my disease is. I've seen the how we're perceived. I don't want to be that- I can't. I love people so much and I only want them to love me back. I didn't let myself have an identity and let myself become the person that whoever around me needed at the time because that was the only way I could think of not to be left alone. 

I was never honest about my emotions or my pain or the hell at home. When I was a teenager, my dad told me that if I told my friends what I felt inside or if I exposed them to my feelings too much that they'd all kill themselves. I repressed the me that wanted to be held and loved and the me that wanted friends, and I went cold, shutting out all my friends and acting cruel so they wouldn't talk to me anymore. I didn't want them to end up dying. It hurt so badly, I still have never forgiven myself for that.

I don't want to hurt anyone. I've never raised a hand to other people, only myself. I've tortured myself because of how I could never be good enough for people. I've cut ties and run because in my eyes I can see that I'll just destroy people I'm close to. People have said I'm kind, loving and thoughtful but they're all lying to make me feel better. They're nice genuine people that I've fooled and hurt.

I can't look my family or friends in the eye after this diagnosis. I especially can't look at my boyfriend. He's known I struggle and he's been supportive, but knowing that I may have been unwittingly abusing him this whole time is too much. He wanted to go through this with me and be there for me but I can't be the one responsible for ending his life. I don't want to make him kill himself. I want him to be with someone who he can love properly who can have children with him.

I have my method planned out. I live in the far North. Im going out into the bush tonight. It's supposed to be at least -20C tonight.  I'm going to walk until I can't anymore. I'm not bringing my coat or any of my things. I don't want my family or anyone else to have to find my body. I don't want them to have to identify me. I don't want them to blame themselves. 

I'm leaving them a note to let them know I'm sorry and that they were amazing and lovely and that it's not their fault but that I had to get out of town fast and that I can't talk to them anymore for their own safety. 

I hope my body gets eaten up by the bears and wolves and other predators- I want my death to be worth something, even if it's me becoming warmth and nutrients in the bellies of the wildlife. I just want to do one thing good, and I can do that with my death. 

I doubt anyone would find this and make the connection to who I am. I can't be convinced out of this. I just needed to say it somewhere. And at least I know that people with my disease are reviled on this website, so hopefully I can help brighten the days of some of you. I can be the way you get revenge on the person with BPD who hurt or abused you.

Please, send me your hatred of people like me. Take it out on me. I won't be alive tomorrow anyhow and I want to help someone.

24,Insurance denied my meds and now im borderline suicidal,"Edit: Im scared of what I might do in the morning, please help me on what I can do to get my meds back before I game end myself.

I dont know what to do anymore. My insurance denied all of my meds back in December because I haven't seen my provider in a couple of years. Im a new adult and I have a lot of anxiety with scheduling appointments and being worried about putting it on a bad day, so I forgot about it with all of that stress. I went to get a quick fix because the same provider schedules three months out. 

Guy I saw treated me like I was wasting his time, and made me feel like my withdrawal symptoms were dumb (as best as I can put it). Long story short he agrees to refill after making me feel like I cant do anything right, so I went to grab the prescriptions in town. I didn't realise until I got home that the mother fucker went in and halved my dose, so my ""90 day"" prescriptions are actually only going to last me 45. I dont know why he changed it, I told him verbally and its something he has to go into and change. Was it to punish me? Maybe he thought I was trying to abuse the maximum dose of my antidepressants. I feel so worthless and and unthought of. Ofcourse I didn't call back at the time because I told myself that I didn't want the guy to be punished for something like this, and the anxiety as well. 

After I was on my last couple of days I scheduled another quick appointment to get back on my regular dose (I delayed it as much as I could). She tells me that the fucker would have had to go in and deliberately fuck my dose up, and was also confused as to why. I forgot to pick up medication afterwards and delayed going and grabbing them again until I absolutely needed them. Well turns out my insurance denied it, my pharmacy told me they would try and contact them yesterday but I haven't heard anything yet. 

I've been off then for two weeks, the brain shocks get worse and worse every fucking day, I cant move my eyes without it banging in my head, my mouth, and my limbs. Im nauseous to the point where if im walking I dry heave and gag until I take a break. Today the tremors started, its constant. Its a cool feeling but it makes me feel pathetic.

Also, today I can't stop crying and crying and crying. I feel so guilty about everything, I just want to feel ok. My partner is wonderful and is with me, but fuck death and dying is constantly on my mind. I dont deserve to live, I dont deserve kindness, there must have been a reason as to why I never recieved compassion from others until now, it must be my fault, I dont deserve him, I dont deserve the love of my parents or family, not after how I was treated all my life, I really really really really really really really feel tremendous guilt, I dont want to hurt my loved ones but death is the only thing that calms me down, I dont want to be selfish but sleeping forever sounds like fucking bliss. 

I dont want to hurt anyone anymore, im going to fucking kill myself at this point while my partner is out at work, I dont want to but fuck me im so impulsive and God I really need to. But I dont want to hurt him, more than that I dont want to hurt him. But just as much I just want to sleep forever.

I feel like people just put up with me, because I'm a sad fat loser who nobody actually cares about. I can't even be myself, because who I want to be is near impossible for me. I have constant mood swings, and I act like such a cunt most of the time, but then, 5 minutes later, im trying to be a nice person. 

I can't take it anymore. Everyone thinks I'm faking when I say I have BPD, but if you actually took the time to fucking observe how I act, its painfully obvious im not faking. I wish I was just faking, cause then I wouldn't have to deal with the constant mental torture. I wanna do it so bad, I wanna just fucking end it all.

35,borderline incoherent suicidal rambling,"the idea of not being in control when my time to die comes is alarming to me. it doesn’t help that im irreparably burned out to the point of having dropped out of high school. supposedly just for the rest of this year, but i cant imagine surviving to see 2020.

so often the argument people go to when trying to talk someone out of suicide is how devastated the victims friends and family would be. i know my death would hurt them; the problem is that i dont care anymore. all i do all day is sit at my computer trying to weasel my way out of doing the chores that are my responsibility because A: i fucking live here and B: my mum has so many health problems of her own to contend with that she physically cant do that shit herself half the time. my friends always drift apart until we end up losing anything we had in common and ghosting each other.

part of me thinks i want to hurt them, though. if my suicide tears them all apart, maybe that will be enough to make them hate me. maybe it will make them hurt less. i don’t know.

i don’t know if this is a common phenomenon, but i remember a time before i was born. it was nothing but blackness; no sound, no thoughts, no body to worry about. i’m positive that’s what awaits us in death. such a thing is probably terrifying for most people, but at this point i just want to go back to that.

most of all i want to stop thinking about the way the world is becoming. if the rampant impending fascism doesn’t kill us all, climate change will. it’s all but irreversible at this point. i see no point in staying alive long enough to watch the world boil to death or to get executed for being queer and autistic.

im tired of trying to be a good person, and being morally grey or an awful person isn’t something i ever want to be.

i know this barely makes sense and sounds insufferably defeatist, but at least i feel a little better for now. honestly the only reason i’m still alive is because guns are hard to get in australia and i’m too much of a pussy to kill myself in a painful manner.

43,Borderline Personality Disorder is awful and I can't access help,"Sorry about the long post in advance. I'll summarize best I can, there's a lot of crap that led up to this decision.

&#x200B;

I was neglected in childhood so that my parents could focus on my brother who is on the spectrum. I completely get it, and he needed the help more than I did. Realistically, with the cards they were dealt, my parents made the right choice to choose him over me. Even when either my brother or my Dad would get violent with me, I'm sure I did something to deserve it. I've never really been worth anything from the get-go. I was an extra stressor, and it would have been a lot better for my family if I was never born in the first place. I grew up locked in my room and not really allowed to spend time with friends because it took time away from my brother and there wasn't a lot of information about Asperger's at that time, so 100% of their energy had to go to him. I don't blame him. I blame myself for taking any attention away from him when I was younger.

&#x200B;

Ended up being emotionally abused by every person I dated, and then in late 2016, I fell in love with the man who would show me what physical and sexual abuse felt like as well. But he was my ticket to moving out of my parent's place, so I couldn't just ""leave"". Eventually, I snapped, tried to pack up and leave while i thought he would be at a friend's all night, he beat me, but I made the mistake of using self-defense for the first time, and he ended up calling the RCMP on me because I was ""having a psychotic episode"". Thanks to that, my abuse claims were essentially laughed off when I attempted to report. Where I am in Canada, I was almost charged with assault due to my use of self-defense. I ended up leaving my hometown because my family didn't want me back home, and I lived with my aunt (in a tiny redneck trash town of 9,000 people ugh) who LOVED to make little ""jokes"" about my weight, my appearance, my mental health, how ""I must have really pissed the guy off"", the miscarriage I went through etc. But it was better than homelessness I guess?

&#x200B;

I moved to a bigger city, but I'm all by myself now. I previously had a best male friend of about 3-4 years, and although he didn't make his true feelings clear, he got extremely upset about me ""friendzoning him"" and he raped me after a concert about a year ago. Nobody believed me, figures. I don't know a single person here in town, hard to make friends when I'm an abuse magnet. My last attempt at making IRL friends ended up with me in the hospital while the ""friends"" robbed me. I am terrified to leave my safe little apartment to do so much as grocery shop. This isn't a life I would wish on anyone.

&#x200B;

Turns out, I have Borderline Personality Disorder. Getting the diagnosis was a HUGE weight off my chest, because just having a name for what goes on in my head was nice. But at the same time, treatment for my situation would be around the $800 a month mark. The PTSD from that violent relationship caused me to be unable to work, and I'm just barely surviving off of my province's income support and I can afford maybe 1/4th of the therapy I need to even have a hope of improving my situation. I'd like to get healthy enough to manage my own life, but I just can't.

&#x200B;

The stigma I get from the general population is one thing, but the stigma I get from the ""professionals"" who are supposed to help is exhausting. I see no point in bothering to stay alive anymore if I can't afford the help or access the care I need. My friends have all bailed because they either liked my ex better or got tired of me ""not being happy yet"". There's no hope left, and realistically, people have seen it coming since I was 13. I have a plan. I just can't afford to get better, and BPD feels like a goddamn life sentence. I'm terrified of being a ""toxic Borderline bitch"" so I isolate. But nobody reaches out either, so there won't be anyone around to miss me in the first place. Everyone says I deserved the abuse or rapes in some form or another, and I can't take this anymore.

&#x200B;

If I could access the help I needed without the stigma or having to go alone to every single appointment, session, whatever, I would consider giving life another try. It's been two years this Tuesday since I left that abusive man, and none of my friends or family have reached out much. My parents try to help financially, but they can only do so much when my younger brother is the one who has the potential and the proper supports in place. He deserves it more than I do regardless. He makes jokes about my abuse like my aunt does, but maybe he just doesn't know better. I hope he doesn't mean it. Maybe I did deserve the abuse because I had no idea I had BPD until after the abuse all came to a head and the disorder can be quite volatile. I always made sure to take it out on myself rather than risk hurting others. I can't make any sense of this.

&#x200B;

Just wanted to share my story somewhere. Anywhere. My friends and family won't listen. Thank you for reading. I'm looking forward to finally, FINALLY being at peace. I'll be going through with it once I get my supplies together. It'll be a hell of a lot cheaper than therapy. Birthday's in August and I don't wanna spend another one alone. I can't.

Broken, broken, broken. There is such a thing as deeply, irreversibly broken.

Having BPD should be a legitimate reason for someone to ask for assisted suicide. Your life is essentially over. You will never have a relationship that isn't abusive one way or another. You will never be loved healthily and happily, and you will never love like a real human being.

How do you live for yourself when you have no self? How do you live for yourself when you never had anyone to begin with?

53,Relationship issues. Borderline. FP screwed me up. Can't stop self harming and planning suicide.,"I found out he was planning on breaking up with me.

We're both in med school. He's male, 23. I am female, 20. We both went through a lot of shit and we're both not mentally healthy right now. But I love him with my heart and soul and if he reached me to talk I would've tried to change and make it better. He says I have trouble trusting him but when I finally starte trusting hom I caught a bunch, A BUNCH of lies. How am I supposed to be okay with that?

I have chronic pain. We were just at the hospital and he said that when he's with me he feels peace but when we're apart he gets stressed about a bunch of stuff  (so do I btw).

He keeps friendship with a girl who hates me and talk shit about me. I find this so disrespectful. And in the end he came with his demmands about what he thought was wrong and I had WAY more shit on him. I find him worthy the stress and the trouble but it's like for him I am not enough. And not worth it. I am borderline and I do have trust issues obviously. I've been lied to since ever and used and abused. Like wtf. He used to say I was the true love of his life and he made me feel like a person for the first time in my life and now this. We cried a lot. I feel destroyed. Like I was ran over by a truck. 

After 7 hours of talking and crying and fighting we actually realized we can get over it and make it better. But my trust on him in broken and that's so hard to fix. I feel like it's possible to fix everything but I know it takes a lot of time. I'm not sure he finds me worthy of the waiting.

He said he was having too much second thoughts because he is in a mental crisis right now and he can't really make up his mind but I decided to break up anyways and told him that if he decides he wants to try we will start from zero. Like since before the kissing phase in any relationship. I am so done. I've told him about MANY things he did wrong and he acknowledged that. And he said he wants to try again but I have this sinking feeling in my stomach that he will do the same shit again and because of BPD all I can think of is hurting myself (and I have) and suicide. 

I feel like if I don't self harm I will kill myself at any moment and I'm trying to keep it together because of my mom but I am losing control and dissociating and I'm scared I might have a psychotic break.

I went in to my intake with tears in my eyes begging the interviewing psychiatrist who was determining my diagnosis to please help me.  I was tired of abusing alcohol, cocaine... tired of my mood swings and impulsiveness destroying what little stability I had in my life.  

I considered myself an extremely lucky girl when it came to dating:  I always had a way of attracting sweet, supporting guys... guys that were romantic and affectionate, the kind that most girls would complain there were not enough of in the world.  And things always seemed like they would change... but eventually after the honeymoon period my moods could no longer be stiffled and out came the true me.  Poor guys, soon they were worn thin, tired of the constant tantrums and breaking up every two weeks on my end.  They left; of course they would, because if I were in their shoes I would do the same.  Whatever their breaking point was I always had a way of finding it.

So the drug abuse, the tumultuous relationships, the constant feeling of emptiness.  I cried to the interviewing psychiatrist and beg for help, and so I am accepted into the program, but unfortunately due to low funds they program only places it's focus on depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.  I am thus diagnosed with major depression and treatment starts.  

The medicines I'm given are to lift my moods, but I tell them that really it's my constant switching of emotions that is causing me problems.  ""Sorry,"" they say, ""We can only treat your depression.  We don't deal with BPD here.""  I begin to go to drug counseling as well for my binge drinking, and I do make strides there.  I am also given one on one CBT with a therapist, but this is where I am at a standstill.  I can sense the frustration growing in my therapists voice at each new session as she can tell that I'm just not ""getting"" CBT, and that I'm not trying hard enough.  It's true, I'm not trying hard enough; it's so hard to unlearn my previous bad habits.  But I keep trying, even if I'm failing.

During this time I happen to meet a guy who far overshadows my previous boyfriends, and who I'd consider ""the one"".  He's handsome, college educated, with a well paid job and he just bought his own house at 26!  I feel like I hit the jackpot.  We begin our whirlwind romance, with him taking me on multiple trips out of town, buying me multiple gifts, hinting at wanting me to move in with him after we hit our on year anniversary.  God, it feels like a dream come true.

But then... it happens again.  I start to lose my temper.  Panic at the slightest things that don't go my way.  Throw tantrums.  Break up on and off.  He still, amazingly, wants to stick around.

Then a tragic accident occurs that requires me to have to look after the injured family member.  I have to quite therapy because school and work and my caretaking leaves me not time for it.  I won't be able to go out anymore, so I break up with dream guy for the zillionth time.  He still wants to be friends, but I can feel my moods getting worse, so I tell him to fuck off out of guilt.  He looks sad, but he understands and tells me to write him and email or letter if I ever change my mind, as he would like to remain friends.

I spent the next 6 months being a good caretaker, sacrificing my social life to fulfill my familial duty.  

Finals are over, my family members heals enough that they can look after themselves and no longer require my constant supervision now.  I have more free time, and so with the semester over I send an email to my ex hoping to reconnect...

No answer.  I mail a letter to his house.  No reply.  I send a final email with a read receipt included to see if he maybe just hasn't been logging on to his inbox, or is ignoring me.  The next day I get a confirmation that he read the email, but no reply.  

I start to panic.  Why would he say he wants to be friends and then change his mind?  My BPD clouds my judgement, as I had previously learned to be patient and wait in therapy, but now I'm panicking and feel that I have to know why he won't talk to me, burnt bridge or not.  I send 30 emails in the span of two weeks, no answers.  Fuck it, I'll send a few more with read receipts and burn this bridge and salt the earth...  

Now here I am.  I deserve this, and now I don't know anymore.  I just want to die already.

70,I've learned I have an illness that might kill me without warning. And I'm borderline suicidal. Irony?,"[see my previous posts for context]

I don't want to give details because they would be identifying, but the tl;dr is that I have recently learned that I have a fairly serious illness. It might, without warning and without me being able to do anything about it, suddenly kill me in a fairly unpleasant way. (This isn't cancer or the like.)

Prognosis is unknown; I'm taking some steps to figure out how to detect it if it happens, alert people within the very small window where something can be done, and figure out what might even work when it happens to fix it.

I feel... conflicted.

This thing is not under my control. It's not the same as consciously choosing to die; it's more like a sword of Damocles with worn thread. This was something that had been a theoretical possibility before, but it's changed recently and become far more real.

I'm trying to do the practical steps necessary, forcing myself to take care of my health, etc. But to be honest, I'm scared. It's not how I want to die. And throughout dealing with this medical issue, I still have some part of me that is speaking in my voice and begging me to let it die already, almost all day every day, unless I'm doing something very distracting.

I don't feel like I have any resolution for this. My illness is so rare that it's basically a complete wildcard, and more to the point, I can't live in a hospital or have my housemates check in on me every two minutes.

It's ironic, no? Suicidal, with a fatal illness. Or maybe that's just poetic. After all, the hardest part is really making the decision, and here that's been taken away from me.

I feel constantly overwhelmed. Even the smallest tasks are almost impossible to get done, things accumulate, and I just hide in bed watching youtube to avoid dealing with it.

71,"I'm Mentally Lost and Borderline Suicidal, But Nobody knows because I apparently hide it to well. Am I Crazy?","I just now happened upon this site and have come to read the many daunting stories and tragedies that have beset its many posters. So I figured I might as well give this a try since it's anonymous. This previous year of 2015 has been the worst year of my entire life, which sounds so melodramatic, but I don't know how else to describe it. What has happened to me all in the coarse of one year is so overwhelming to me I don't know what to do and everyone who's heard it thus far has a difficult time believing me, which makes it all the more worse obviously because they associate my genuine fear & anxiety as ""Pussy"" behavior and so on. 

I'm a 23 year old male filmmaker and my 85 year old openly gay & married former film director mentor, whom has known and guided me since I was 17 (as well as helped me graduate High school), literally pulled his dick out and began jerking off in front me, while telling me he had never really been interested in helping me with my career & life, that he just wanted me sexually. My Real Biological grampa died 2 years ago, and he was closer to me emotionally than my real grampa. He lied to my face for years, never meaning his kind words of wisdom that he said to my face. 

It was all bullshit the entire time. For 4 years. I ran away crying and haven't seen him since and never will again. Then Afterwords I finally confronted my fear of School and dropped out of College. That's right. I said it. I have a fear of School. Almost no one believes me, and even school councilors as well as my parents think I'm bullshitting them, but I have a genuine fear of classrooms and the entire schooling establishment as whole. I literally have claustrophobic feelings When I'm inside a classroom. And I'm not just a fucking lazy slacker because I had a 3.0 GPA average throughout high school, I've written a 147 Page screenplay which took 2 years of habitual all Nighters to complete and was ranked in the top 100 out of 4000 participants of the Scriptapalloza Screenplay Contest, I Bought my own Car all in cash right out of highschool with my own money that I saved up over years from my minumum wage job, and to this day I Pay all my Expenses Including my food, Phone, Internet, gas, clothes, and car Insurance. 


Every fucking thing except for rent, which also makes me feel like absolute shit because I'm still living at home at age 23 - (So I'm not fucking Lazy, Just a fucking Loser) So finally after 2 years of Optional schooling in college I couldn't take it anymore. I dropped out. I told my father whom proceeded to tackle me to the floor, press my face against the ground and scream that I'm going to be a failure and that I'm going to go nowhere in life. I'm 6'4 and 200lbs and my dad's half my size & weight but i was so traumatized and powerless he essentially took advantage of that and went to town. I just couldn't bring myself to hit my father even to defend myself so I threatened to call the cops if he didn't let me go. 


He let me go and I ran out of the house and I cried in my car for several hours until driving to my mom's house, which is now where I pretty much live permanently now. (My parents are divorced). Then several months later, My small Dog Max, a cavalier spaniel whom I've had since I was 13 years old as a puppy (I'm 23) had a Heart attack and literally chocked on his own blood in my arms on the way to vet in my car at 4am in the morning. My mom and I buried him in the backyard that day. He was only 9. Throughout Highschool as well as childhood, Max was my literal best friend. I don't have any really close human friends. I live in my worlds I write as a Screenwriter. People think I'm exaggerating when I say that and I'm not. I wish I was. I wish I wasn't occasionally thinking of suicide every other day now. People I've talked to, even my mom whom almost gets me better than anyone doesn't get how close I was to max. 


He was my literal best friend and I felt him die in my arms. I still cry by myself ever other night because I'm used to hearing his snoring. He would sleep on my bed every night, so now there's nothing. Its to quiet at night now. Then Literally just 4 monthes after that I was emailed and told by a Writing fellowship whom had been reading my script and judging it, to essentially fuck off and try again in another year, after already spending 2 years writing it as well as spending $2700 on Concept art out of pocket for it so that the Fellowship would consider it for entry. Then finally 2 or so weeks later on December 26th I fell at Work and Broke my right hand and also dislocated 2 of my fingers. I was put on workmen's comp and had two surguries to put my hand back together again. 

I've been unable to write for nearly 2 months during recovery because I'm fucking right handed. But just a few days ago I got the cast taken off, The metal pins in my had were removed and now my fucking right hand and arm are atrophied and thinner than my left. I'm now back at my minum wage loser job and now I'm Fucking broke. I'm a drop out. I hate myself, I hate my Life, and I almost hate everyone else. Everyday I burry it down, Smile and act nice to people and everyone around me thinks that I'm this tough person for putting up with so much, but really I cry every night and think about killing myself. Weed has helped lately but I don't want to make myself a drug addict and become dependent on a substance for relief or happiness. So, I'm really lost. Am I crazy? I Think I'm just a loser. But my opinions and decisions got me to where I am now so what the fuck do I know???

76,"I was just diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and I can't rationalize continuing my life anymore.","http://www.palace.net/llama/psych/bpd.html

The information in the above link pretty much sums up BPD and I fit it to a T.

I could go on and on about the myriad of horrible things I've been through and done but it boils down to this:

I have sabotaged my life and the lives of people I love more times than I can remember, and up until I was diagnosed I never knew why. For decades, I wondered what my goddamn problem was. I wanted to understand why I did the things I did, and acted the way I acted. I wanted to understand because I thought that if I did, I could put myself on the road to fixing whatever the problem was somehow. But I can't fix this. I can't go through life picking up and then knocking down myself and the people I really do care about over and over again. I've hurt a lot of people, people who I love and have sworn up and down that I'd always be there for. Most of them, are out of my life now and I miss them so much but I know if I try to re-establish contact with them it'll just be a matter of time before they are briefly and inexplicably demonized in my mind. These are the people I'm supposed to be there for. I KNOW I care about them but I can't seem to show it, or prove it rather. And now I'm alone. I have aqcaintances and people I call friends but I feel no real connection with them and when I do see them I just humor them. I show them the person they want to see because being myself well, can be a pretty big fucking  drag. 

My question is this:

How can I or anyone else expect me to want to continue living if I know I am just going to keep up this behavior without being able to do a damn thing about it? When BPD gets going feels like your a pilot flying a plane and all of a sudden the plane goes into an extremely fucked up auto-pilot mode and your just sitting in the cockpit waiting to smash into the side of a mountain. But you always survive the crash, barely. Fuck this. I'm tired of 'living to be an asshole another day' every time my brain decides its gonna shit the bed and make me go ape shit on the people I care about. It's not fair to them.

83,Major Depressive.. Borderline.. Bipolar.. General Anxiety.. Anger Management.. Compulsive lying.. Self-harm.. and not much reason to live... yet.,"I live in anxiety and fear. I might have some form of borderline personality because I don't understand other people's emotions and they don't understand me because I am afraid of looking at their faces. Also, I can unconsciously turn manipulative in order to avoid uncomfortable situations for myself. I can act out emotionally because I have lots of anger. If I'm about to make a big endeavor, my anxiety triggers all of these psychological states. I compulsively embellish things, sometimes to the extent of lying. I may have attention problems. Here's my story.
For at least 10 years of my life, I have put most of my effort into a dilemma. I have studied a lot of psychology in my one year of college, and it turns out that I may have a lot of extreme issues. I don't think I really have the strength to overcome all of them, because focusing on one at a time is pretty much all the capability I have at any given phase.
I grew up in a family with a very traditional and conservative culture. We are first generation immigrants, and from this culture, my parents have a very authoritarian, and/or anxious-ambivalent parenting scheme. Most of my life, I have grown up independently, outside of my own home, looking for my own goals with respect of my parents' opinions. When my grandfather died, when I was about thirteen years old, I started to take on a very selfless personality, and became aware of my parents' fighting conflict regarding family. This was a traumatic event, as I was the sole person who walked in on my dead grandfather. It effects me to this day as the image is burned into my mind. It took a toll on me, and my parents really relied on the fact that I was in the middle of them, and I would take the brunt of their arguments against each other, trying not to take sides. I somehow felt guilty that my parents were fighting. They really should have been divorced. I started to resent the fights. I would stop focusing on my academics because I just didn't care, and I became more social. As high school began, the parties came, and the drugs, too. All of which I was certainly open to delve into, to help the pain a little.
But this ""rebellion"" (in their eyes) backfired, as I became addicted psychologically to marijuana and with my parents finding out, I had an uphill battle trying to live up to their expectations once I was guilt-stricken, again. This was during high school, where I was at first one of the contenders for valedictorian, because I was always getting A's and generally had a peaceful state of mind. I was happily socializing, and I loved and was pretty good at playing sports. I generally felt balanced. That all began to decline since I was alone my high school years with my parents, and depression started to sink in.
I always came home to a fire. The house was exploding with loud screaming and yelling and bouts of anger, tears, and numb silence. Every day I would try and retreat to my room to be alone. I eventually stopped going to school every morning, and retired to my bed to lay there not moving. Catatonically depressed. I was hospitalized, but never really understood why my parents intervened, and I suppose they had no clue what was going on with me, either. No one bothered to understand my side of the story because in their eyes, I was simply a selfish rebel. After all the years I gave to mediating the tension at home, I was blamed. It killed me inside.
Fast forward, I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and barely scraping through high school because psychotherapy and medications wouldn't work. I was very numb, and that effected me socially. I had no one to talk to. I turned inward and found no solace. There was this girl who tried to help, but I'll get to that later.
My sister, too, basically abandoned the family and tried to get away from it all. A much healthier option in my opinion, but I was just too proud of being selfless... as oxymoronic as that sounds, I was really putting all my effort into solving this dilemma so I could be at peace. It was a constant struggle trying to take care of myself while taking care of others. I stopped eventually playing sports because I was physically unhealthy from all this psychological stress. I was pretty much stunted.
Somehow, I got into Northwestern University, from, I guess, telling my story in that college essay. My grades deteriorated so much from junior through senior year, I don't know how I even ranked in the top-30 in my school. F's continued through college. I thought I'd do better away from home, but it only made me sink further into a hole because I didn't know how to take care of myself. Though I did study psychology, and wow, it taught me how many problems I really do have. I was on the extreme end of every diagnosis. Even psychologists/psychiatrists can't pinpoint what I have. Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Seroquel, and recently a new drug Latuda... not much has worked at all.
That girl eventually decided to break up with me while in my first year in college (the one who probably salvaged my deteriorating self-worth in high school). She said she needed to see other people. Probably because I was just a drag on our unhealthy relationship. My family basically excommunicated her and always blamed me for another rebellious act by being with her.
I had absolutely no self-worth at this point in my life... at nineteen years old... I gave up. I didn't know how to even take care of myself because I never really had.
At twenty, just one year ago, I attempted suicide. I was stuck at home doing absolutely nothing for an entire year, and so that numb existence pretty much led me unconsciously to sitting in the back of my car with a hose sealed in coming from the exhaust... with the catalytic converter disabled. That girl I was with was the only one who knew how deep my depression went, so somehow she could tell I was isolating myself... and when I responded with a single text saying ""I'd rather be dead,"" she called 9-1-1. It's probably why I'm still alive.
Well, I'm still here on my second chance. After a years-worth of therapy in an outpatient program, I have found some stride. I go back to Northwestern next week, with a determined goal to graduate, a support system in place, and plenty of hope for myself.
Well, let me tell you a little about the revelation I had this year. Something solved the dilemma, a bit. My mother, the one who I always though was super controlling and to blame in much of the conflict between my parents... opened up to me. She gave me the truth. I had already found out that my dad had cheated on her, and she found out two years ago after 27 years of marriage. But not only was he cheating once, but throughout their marriage. And not only was he cheating, but she found out that he has always been gay, and hiding it from all of us. He had always been going to dating sites and spending unusual amounts of time out ""working,"" so this checked out. He was living happily with a heteroromantic family, and a closeted homosexual identity. He is a very selfish man, as he blamed my mother for so many things, as if she was to blame for his lack of presence as a father. Always been ambivalent with me, and never truly supported me as his son. He would just throw it all on her. She's more trapped than I could ever realize... but his fucked up control over all of us has also fucked me up. He knowingly commits to his way, leading to his fights with my mother, literally blaming her for ""making him be gay,"" and not owning up to his own sexual dependencies. Fuck that. He knowingly puts me in a place of psychological hell, blaming it on her. He knew I attempted suicide because of all of my experience, without owning up to it himself. Fuck him.
He doesn't know that I know. But as I prepare to go back to school, the anxiety is creeping up. Am I able to do this? My mom also told me that he said, privately to her, that he thinks I'll never be able to finish school.
Seriously, fuck him. I tried to maintain my congenial relationship with him, but all I do is get perturbed by every fake, two-faced, abusive way he conducts himself.
I have no one to thank but my mother for always believing in me. But she has no will left, and only relies on my getting through this. It's a tremendous challenge, and I feel pressured to save her. I once read something she wrote, in secret, saying she would be able to ""sleep peacefully once [she she saw me] succeed."" My dad. Put her into this dark place. She doesn't even have the power to leave him.
Listen to this Alt-J song... It's lyrics embody what my father does to my mother... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeMiVU77wo[1]
I always though my father was my friend, but I see that he drives my mother crazy. In turn, I'm fucked up. I'm the girl in that video.
I'm scarred for life. I don't know if I'm ready to put all into my life yet. I don't want to confront my dad... but I don't know how to move on. I'm really anxious about returning to school after everything. I know it's all set in place and things are clear... but I just don't know if I'm strong enough.
I needed to tell someone this... Thanks for reading.

90,I'm a pedophile and I think I'm ready to kill myself,"I've never had a normal sex drive and I thought I was asexual for a while, but I guess the reality is more insidious. I've struggled with Pure O OCD ever since I was a child, and at first I thought this was it. I've always worried about hurting people. My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.

My boyfriend has a good job and I work in customer service which isn't ideal...but I'm getting paid? 

I'm drowning in debt...medical and student. I don't have my driver's liscence because I had an extremely tough teenage hood and suffer from extreme anxiety. I have high functioning autism, PTSD, and Borderline. I don't have any insurance or life savings. That's not even bad when I think about. 

The worst part is the loneliness. I don't have many friends and I don't know how to foster closeness with people due to my disability and mental illnesses. I'm suprised I could even manage to pull such a handsome and lovely guy. I don't pick up on socail cues and have a hard time differentiating boundaries so it can really push new friends away.

At most I'll get 5 hours of sleep and still I'll wake up multiple times a night. 

I can't afford therapy and finding a therapist is hard due to the stigma around borderline. I want to be dead, but I don't want anyone in my life to suffer with the guilt from my suicide.

122,Society's cowardice is killing me and making me hate people,"Hi everyone,

This is not hate speech. I only want to share a few thoughts that make me dislike my existence greatly.

I've been dealing with bipolar and borderline personality disorder since I was very young. Medications have helped me a lot, but it took me many years to realise how.   
When I'm on them, I'm dead. I'm no longer myself. Their primary real effect on my mind is that they made me the 'average' person who ignores or accepts people's cowardice.

People are so scared of retaliation for speaking their minds that acting like machines has become natural. Society dogma is that ""one must always say what's right, not what they think."" I always wondered how the world would be once we reached the AI singularity, when computers would become self-aware and smarter than humans and possibly lead us. 

Only now I realise I already knew the answer to that all along. ",1715367849.0,False,1,0,salty-blood-thirsty,,1coxbnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1coxbnp/societys_cowardice_is_killing_me_and_making_me/

127,Kinda Done,"So, maybe a bit of a rant, but here it goes. My wife is insisting that I seek DBT therapy. It's been alleged that I have borderline personality disorder. Yay. So, while being aware of that potential, I looked into the DBT. It looks promising. Apparently it really helps borderlines. Lucky me, right?

Well, here's the thing; it seems to me that most of that kind of therapy (and it's cousin CBT) does a lot to change people's thinking or, more accurately, how they feel about their thoughts. My thoughts are as follows... ""I'm a wage slave. I have it a lot better, being Canadian, than a ton of other people in the world. But that doesn't make me feel any better. I bake bread professionally. But that's not how I see it. I see myself as a tiny cog in a massive wendigo I call 'capitalism'. It doesn't sleep, it's never satiated and I'm honestly done feeding it. I can't just up and quit because there are consequences. So I'm also being coerced into participating.... I don't want to play this stupid game of life any more. I'm sick of just playing along and, as far as I can tell, the DBT therapy really does seem to want me to start thinking it's okay that I, and billions of others, are being exploited for the sake of shareholders.""

My main point is, I want off this stupid merry go round and the only out I see is removing myself from the equation. You can't exploit the un-coerced and you can't coerce the dead. I want out of this party. My wife will be upset. My sister will be upset. Maybe my mom will be too.

137,I'm starting to think my long distance girlfriend commited suicide,"Adding some context here.
I met my girlfriend online and we grew close pretty fast but she has borderline personality disorder and body dismorphic disorder. So the start of our relationship was really rocky.

But after a year things seemed to get better untill she disappeared once again for a month. She had cut her wrist and had to be sent to the hospital. The way she described it was that she was disassociated and she acted on an impulse to hurt herself. Then she was shocked and rushed to the hospital.

Months later she came back and since then we were officially a couple. Things gradually improved. Instead of starving herself she started eating again and I was very patient and a rocksolid person to her she could rely on. She was really doing better and she was happy.

I even visited her for a couple of months in manila where she lived and everything was great. But a tragedy happened while I was there. Her only family member died and we had a funeral to arrange. And we did.
I bought her a Nintendo switch and some games to help her cope with her loss.

So I went home with the promise I would be back soon.
8 months later she suddenly ghosted me after telling me she felt like a burden and I was better off without her. I was financially helping her while she was looking for a job. I assured her this was not the case but she wouldn't listen. So she disappeared on me and trying to contact her for the past month and a half yielded no results.

It made zero sense since I made sure she had no worries and now she cut herself off my help and support. No peace of mind at all.

Now after a month and a half of not seeing her online ever on her social media i'm starting to think she committed suicide. I mean it is a possibility.

Borderline personality disorder
A history of hurting and starving herself.
Losing her father 8 months ago.
The moment she disappeared two of her cats died.
Feeling like she is a burden to me. ( Her feelings, not mine)
Not being online at all or any sign of life on social media.

The worst thing is if she killed herself I would never know for certain. I contacted her best friend on Instagram to ask if she is okay and that I was worried for these obvious reasons. But her best friend ignores that message and does not say if she is okay or not.

So yeah I am in this weird Gray zone where my girlfriend either is a cowardly ungratefull bitch or she is dead.
The uncertainty of it all makes it even worse.
All I can do is pray that she did not hurt herself I geuss and a sign of life would appear.

But I fucked that relationship up and now I’m all alone. I have loving parents but I have found out that I might have narcissistic traits and I can’t live with this knowledge of how much I have disappointed people all my life. Sold my parents’ gold at 18 to have fun outside. Threw away my academic potential. Finally found someone who brought my life on track and but she got fed up of my constant lies and fights. And even then it was me who broke up with her thinking she wasn’t good enough for me. I have fucked up my life. Tried taking my life in 2017 but couldn’t go through. 

But now I have fixed my date. It’s exactly 10 months now. And planning to create a bucket list of things I need to do before I go.

1. Taking parents for a nice trip
2. Try surfing
3. Finish reading all of Dostoevsky
4. Meet my ex for one last time
5. Throw a nice good bye party (ofc not announcing that it’s a good bye party)

154,I've ruined everything,"I want to start by saying that I'm turning 23 on Monday and I know that I'm still young and have a lot to live for. I've hit dead ends in my life before but I never gave up hope and eventually I found a way out. However, this time it feels like I'm really stuck and the walls are closing in more and more with each day and the worst thing is - it is completely and utterly and absolutely 100% my own fault.

I've had mental health issues for nearly 6 years now, ranging from severe social anxiety to the suicidal stages of depression. For the past 2 years, I was under the impression that I was getting better but I'm starting to realise that my brain might have been gaslighting me into thinking that, by making the ""typical"" symptoms of depression disappear. Instead, I developed a deep distrust towards people, thinking that all they want is to use me for their own advantage and that they're all narcissists trying to take control of me and manipulate me. I started pushing people away, first friends, then my family. This distrust developed into full-blown paranoia by the beginning of 2024 and lead me to abandon my job, my flat, everything I had and leave the country basically overnight because I had convinced myself that the only way to make my life better is by cutting everyone off and start a new life. On my way, I burned every last existing bridge to my home country so that there'd be no going back. I really convinced myself that this is what I had to do.

It's been nearly 2 months and the realisation of what I did is now just starting to hit me. I'm in a completely foreign country, no friends, no family and no idea what I'm actually doing here. I don't like it here at all and this gut-wrenching feeling of homesickness is driving me insane. I have a job but what is the point of going to work if you have nothing to look forward to when you come home? I thought that when I started to settle down here, things would get better but it's the complete opposite. I'm getting more depressed by the day and this isolation is starting to kill me. 

I came here hoping to starting a new life but the reality is that I'm still living in the past, wishing I could turn back time,  go home and reconnect with my friends and family. But unlike me, they've moved on and they're done with my shenanigans - I can't blame them.

I just don't know what to do now. There's no point in going back home because all bridges have been burnt down, but there's no point in staying here either because I don't belong here and I absolutely despise being here. My brain led me here to isolate me even further and I hate it for that. If I were to just walk into the ocean, no-one would notice that I'm gone for days and even then they'd all just think I've done a runner - as always. I don't know how to fix this anymore, this might just have been one wrong life choice too many. 

I truly don't want to die but I'm starting to feel like it's an option to consider, especially now that I'm all alone and chances are that nobody would ever know if I would just disappear into the Atlantic Ocean.

Thank you for reading through my little rant, I wish you all a wonderful rest of your day. Take care!

Three times hospitalized, several therapists and psychologists, and tons of medication later, things are worse with her. She claims nobody wants her around, that she was a mistake. “I’m not supposed to be here on Earth” is a frequent declaration. She’s described visual and auditory hallucinations. 

She has three biological sons in their teens and pre-teens and two step-kids, also teen and pre-teen. Her husband adores her, but she feels guilty, thinking she tricked him into being with her. She keeps saying she’s so embarrassed by her mental state and feels that everyone would be happier with her gone. I’ve spent hours trying to convince her otherwise, that she would devastate her family — immediate and extended — if she were to go through with this. She’s determined, though, and is making plans to get her affairs in order so as not to leave a “mess” behind.

the last time i posted on here on my regular account, i was told i deserved to die and that wasn’t mentally ill, just a bad person. i have been called suicide bait for expressing myself. even my art on my regular account is now downvoted because of harassment.

214,My BPD Will Be The Death Of Me,"I truly feel that my Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) will be the death of me.

I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) as well at Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) but nothing truly destroys me more than my BPD. 

I've suffered from mental illnesses since I was 12 years old but the development of BPD has truly been a nightmare and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

Once again, my FP has left me and once again I have hit rock bottom. I truthfully from the bottom of my heart do not feel like I'll be able to push through like I did before. 

Every other time I've gone through loss like this, I've had support from family and medical professionals as well as my medication. 

But today? I have nothing.

I have no family that can help. I can't afford my medications nor can I afford a therapist. I can't afford to go to the ER and tell them I want to die. I can't afford to call a suicide hotline in fear of them calling the authorities to my house and being forcibly hospitalized and then receiving a medical bill with thousands of dollars worth of treatments.

I can't.

I truly feel hopeless. Suicide IS my only answer. 

I try to distract myself with work but once I get home, the reality sets in. 

I am worthless. I destroy myself and everyone around me. I am cursed with this awful disorder that I didn't ask for. I am forced to suffer in agony for the rest of my life and there is nothing I can do about it. 

I **will** kill myself. I know I can't live on like this.

i was finally starting to feel like a person again and then the emptiness came back (during outpatient therapy i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder) and i realized that it will always come back no matter how happy i am anymore.
my plan is to get on a greyhound and drive to niagara falls which was the last place i visited where it was all happy and i want to see it one last time
then maybe i'll jump (new york side, not canada because i don't have a passport unfortunately.) and if i don't jump i want to stay there forever or for a significant period of time like when i was happy and be remembered as a run away or a missing person. this way my family will not mourn me as deeply because they won't have to find my body but the people who want me dead will still be happy and then can be happy about my gift to them.
the only problem is i'm currently unemployed and only do babysitting gigs so i don't know how to pay for it yet. but yeah
i want to do it may 9th (my exs birthday, the ultimate present for him) but if i get enough money i could do it during april

I've been in treatment for Borderline and PTSD for a long, long while. I'm at the point where every treatment so far has failed, and i've been on EMDR, DBT, crisis suicide watch, and whatnot, nothing seems to be helping. And every time i come across some institute that wants nothing to do with some ""filthy, gross borderliner"", half of the referrals turn me down also. Among these have been a few inpatient units, who have all been like ""oh, borderline and self harm? You can't be with us, self harm is your own responsibility."" I'm very, very used to being turned down everywhere. And this makes me afraid.

I also live in a physically abusive home that i have traumas from and currently no chance at moving out in this expensive ass country, so that's why i've really been hoping to get inpatient, so that i can work on myself in a safe, controlled environment before I find my own place to live, and be ready for it.

I'm currently still on suicide watch, and they are trying one last inpatient referral. Its a unit that's specifically for people that have been failing or turned down everywhere else, mainly patients with borderline, and sometimes comorbid eating disorders or PTSD. You're not even allowed in if you don't actively self harm, they said on the phone, so there wouldn't be anything for me to worry about. Except... i do worry. I'm just so used to being turned down everywhere that i'm so, so stressed about this. I'm stressed to the point that, if i'm turned down again here, i'm going to end it all.
