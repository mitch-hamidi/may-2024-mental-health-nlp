0,That’s not true. I have bpd and therapy does help. We can change. You’re self aware and that’s a step ahead of everyone else. ♥️,Dizzy-Dream,1bxjs2p
0,"I feel you. I was diagnosed with BPD triggered by abandonment issues, and then my wife left me. I got fired, my cat died, and I was hit by a car while riding a bike, which thanks to no-fault insurance means I won't get a thin dime for going through the most painful experience of my life. I have been shattered physically, mentally, and financially. All the positive thinking in the world isn't going to change the facts of my situation. I will have to do a lot of work just to get back to work, and then my life will just be work. Life doesn't seem worth the effort.",Alan_Ranta,1bolynj
1,Try Autism and manic depression haha. As if pretending to be normal wasn't hard to start. I've been without meds for 20 years. The key is to choose a job where you can disappear during the lows and get really good at identifying symptoms for the highs so you don't make an idiot of yourself. I still wouldn't trade the rollercoaster for anything. I've had incredible revelations during the highs.,PerspectiveDismal584,1bolynj

0,"Maybe therapy might be worth looking into? I've had a few people in my life woth BPD, and all of them showed symptom improvement through DBT. It takes a while, and you have to be serious about wanting to do better, but over time it'll help you express and process your emotions in a way that is healthy for both you and the people on the receiving end.",Fancypotato1995,1bctlyr
1,ive tried in the past and it might help but i cant get over the fact theyre getting paid to sit there and hear me complain about shit. i feel weird about it. ive had several people recommend dbt. im on a waitlist rn and have been for about a year. idk things are just rough rn and always have been. gonna keep trying tho,Ok_Elevator_6475,1bctlyr
2,"It's a little difficult to get used to tbh. I've been in therapy for most of the last 8 years or more, and you start to realise that once you find a psychologist who is a good fit, and specialises in the area you need help with, therapy becomes a lot more than just sitting in the room for an hour and complaining. 

One bit of advice I can give though, if you do begin doing some DBT, make sure to do some of the work books at home too. A lot of people do the practices in therapy and proceed to not do them outside of it. To build up the healthy habits and relearn new behaviours, you basically have to be practising all the time. It's exhausting, but definitely worth it in the end.",Fancypotato1995,1bctlyr

7,"Hello,  

What’s the difference between the two?",Just_a_friend2021,1aj3q0x
8,"BPD is a personality disorder characterized by unstable perceptions in one’s experience of personal relationships, driven by an intense fear of rejection and abandonment. This causes one suffering from it to swing back and forth between idealizing a person and devaluing them. There’s more to it than that but that’s the gist. It can look like bipolar from the outside due to mood swings and emotional instability, but bipolars manic highs and depressive lows are different than the pure chaos that is BPD. Both are very painful and debilitating.",Double_R_23fa,1aj3q0x

0,They say loving with BPD is like living with third degree emotional burns all over your body. Combine that with something else and it feels like a death sentence. Living with it feels almost fatal. But for most people it’s not. It sucks and is way harder than normal life but it can be managed. I’m sorry. I’m here to talk with you if you need it.,Tithenlas9,193plgb
1,I just talked to my psychiatrist and realised BPD runs in my family but I am NOT bipolar there is just no way. Except I have constant mood swings from normal to near suicidal but I don't have any other types of moodswings so I'm pretty sure it's just the autism???? Fuck. Like I have melt downs but I don't become like manic or super happy.,maybeDysmorphia,193plgb
2,Oh I'm not talking about bipolar. I have borderline personality disorder. What you're describing is very much so Borderline Personality. It's very similar to bipolar but no mania. My mood will change from minute to the next.,Jordynjaf1234,193plgb
3,"Please look into borderline personality disorder and see if it matches your symptoms. It is very commonly misdiagnosed as bipolar. I felt the same way when I misdiagnosed as bipolar. I knew it was incorrect. I was never manic. Impulsive yes, manic no. Always having meltdowns.",Jordynjaf1234,193plgb
4,My mother is bipolar (severely so) so I am kind of afraid it is running in the family. I don't think I'm bipolar or BPD but I'm starting to be scared because I could be. I really could be. I go from normal to intense suicidal urges and back probably once or twice a day and can't control it. I don't understand anymore. Sometimes I'm really loud and happy and confident other times I'm silent other times I want to kill myself. It's always one extreme or the other.,maybeDysmorphia,193plgb
0,"Ok, tbh, I cannot relate.  Like I had a shit life but we’re worlds apart here.  I know about bpd but I didn’t know there was a stigma, I have a general knowledge of bpd.  You’re not a monster for having a mental illness(or likely).  Mental illnesses aren’t you but they try hard to make you think they are.  Tbh I’m not sure but I’m pretty sure you weren’t born with Bpd, if I’m wrong forgive me.  You’ve been hurt by life in general.  Worse than most, but I believe you can pull through.  I can’t do much to relate or make you feel better instantly but I want you to know you’re a great human being and are not a monster.",Alien760,1c7qaih
0,"I used to be with someone with BPD, it’s a absolutely horrendous mental illness. It was heart wrenching to see how BPF affected him. 
I was so mad with the world because there was nothing that was in place properly to help with this. 
The only thing that came close to helping him was therapy, but go with someone who specialises in this disorder. As work to help with funds, family etc…. Anything that’s going to get you that kind of help.",ArtChampagne,1axcdwx
1,"i need CBT tbh but no where near me offers it, i can't drive bc of money/mental issues, so i'm kinda stuck. my family doesnt understand the severity of what i'm dealing with. i've tried to bide my time and weigh my options, i'm just in so much pain lol. tired of being in pain. so sorry to hear about your ex. hope his healing journey went ok and helped",yawnsoul,1axcdwx
2,"My former partner is currently in prison now for the things he had done to me. I wasn’t so much angry with him, but how there was no help for him when he was struggling the most. 
Unfortunately I had to protect myself and his family also protected me and that’s why he’s now there. 
Your family needs to understand the severity of it. The ups and the downs and how that can affect a person. 
I don’t think people really understand how exhausting it is to not have a middle ground when it comes to moods. 

I know I’m not going through what you’re going through, but I saw with great detail what it did to someone I loved…

My heart breaks for you it really does.",ArtChampagne,1axcdwx
3,"I'm so sorry to hear that. As someone who struggles with BPD, I have always understood that those on the receiving end are never at fault nor responsible for my actions. The bestest friends I've had are those who know when to hold me accountable. You've held him accountable and you still feel empathy for his struggle.. I can tell you're a good person. He is not absolved from his mistakes because of BPD. I'm glad you are safe now despite everything. And I hope that he can change, though some things can never be rehabilitated. 

Thank you for your kind words.. they've given me some strength. My heart is with you as well. Sometimes I think loving someone with a disorder so debilitating is almost just as painful. It's helpless in a lot of ways. I'm sorry to you.",yawnsoul,1axcdwx

1,"My soulmate had BPD. I saw how much self hatred it caused. He was such an amazing kind person. But was misunderstood by many, and that caused him to have so many self doubts. I tried my best in the short time I knew him to help. To show him he loved correctly, he treated others correctly. His anxieties were rational, his stress made sense. That everyone else was being dismissive of him which wasn’t right. He as a human, his wants and desires, all made sense. He wasn’t hard to understand, he wasn’t a bad person, he wasn’t scary. But in the end his family was extra unkind one day, he made an impulsive choice, and now I live in misery. I miss him every second of every day. I hate that I couldn’t get him to see that it was those around him who were assholes, not him. That those around him only pointed out his weaknesses, as if there was anything wrong with those. They made him doubt himself. His kids needed him. I needed him. At least his kids have his ex wife. I’m just alone now. Helping him see clearly was not a burden to me. His BPD wasn’t a burden. But it felt that way to him too. He hated it and he hated himself, but he had so much more love to give this world.",mkal223,14a7qpw

I know you're hurting. I'm so sorry that you are. No one should have to deal with bpd. I hurt too... Please at least try finding tiny check points. Even if it's only for one month.

I completely understand how you are feeling. This is not normal. Nothing about mental illnesses is normal. For the longest time I didn’t take my mental health seriously, it’s honestly our society’s fault that we don’t take mental illness seriously.

0,"Fellow person with BPD. I can relate word by word to you . But let me tell you, even when I feel like a shit person due to my personality, the main thing i remind myself is that while I'm responsible for my actions, i also have the opportunity to make amends if i want to. We are just sensitive people. We feel emotions more strongly than others. We are like burn victims or people born without a skin, or children born with smaller lungs that will mature as the child reaches a certain age. We are as worthy of love as any neurotypical person. When you berate yourself for the person you are, I want you to ask yourself, would you say this to your 7-year old self? Would you say this to another person who is confiding in you?

Are you still injured? If you are, then I hope you will be able to endure it until you're finally back to full health again. Yes, the words > endure, sounds corny as hell, I'm aware of it. No one likes to be told to endure/keep going

Gather all your valuables, save up your remaining money and gtfo of there, because, right now, the town and its people are really killing you slowly.

There are times where I discard anything related to sex because for some reason I lost interest in it, it may be because I don't want to deal with women and their bullshit at some point.

Like as of now, if I don't have sex, that's fine, I'll just beat my meat and there's that. I agree that women interest me, but at the same time, woman is a hassle to deal with and I may not have the tolerance to deal with it and just walk away.",sirfaggit,cnebv5

Don’t view it as a death sentence tho. 9/10 people with bpd *don’t* die by suicide, and I’ve found that it can healing to embrace the ups when they come and tread through the downs as lightly as possible. 

The swings may be inevitable, but suicide is not. Sometimes I feel like all is lost, and it’s easy to forget what’s really important, but if you can find a way to consistently look towards your life-goals or something like that, your focus shifts from the darkness and instead starts to find light in little things. 

It can be a long hard and slow process, but trust me it is so worth it. I still have my swings as always, but I haven’t been in a place so dark as suicidal tendencies in a while now primarily because of how I’ve been able to work on how my mind thinks of the predicament itself rather than thinking of the solution. 

Not every question has an answer. Not every predicament has a solution. Sometimes the answer, sometimes the solution, is to learn to look past those questions and predicaments that hold you back. 

Like I said, it’s a little easier said than done, and it’s a difficult journey (one I’d advise not attempting alone), but in the end, it’s all worth it. Finding yourself, and realizing that that is so much more important and powerful than what the darkness says, is one of the most freeing things in the world, and even helps for the dark times to be less dark in the future.

If you think you might have BPD, it could help to have it diagnosed by a licensed mental health professional (such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker).

1,"Thank you for the advice!, ye I have painful neuralgia that I'm medicated for and yet to be diagnosed extreme nerve pain in my upper body (I had a very strange injury about 1 1/2 years ago that doctors can't seem to understand) my meds hardly keep the pain away and on top of this I have always had a baseline level of depression unfortunately. Yes I would say my mind is generally switched to sad emptiness.

3,"If your current doctor(s) don't seem to understand your condition, don't be afraid to get a second opinion from another doctor. I think that if the chronic pain from the accident is better managed, it could potentially make dealing with the depression easier.

Are there still some things that lift you up out of the depressed state?

0,"I’m not diagnosed. I don’t know if I have BPD. But I think I’m likely on that spectrum. Sometimes I feel alienated because I’m toxic and inept. I feel rightly alienated. And sometimes just misunderstood and thrown away for other people who are easier to deal with and more balanced. It’s hard not to feel like everyone’s last choice. It gets to me. I don’t feel like people really enjoy being around me. I believe they’d rather be around someone else. And it’s probably true. I don’t think there’s a lot of sympathy for a person like me who ends up destroying their essential relationships and being alone. I know from being on Reddit the way others encourage cutting ties with someone like me. I think it’s hard. I don’t know if you deal with these feelings. I think somehow it’s easy for people with this disorder to want to commit suicide, and for other people to even not discourage it. But it can’t really be right even if other people allow it. Narcissists, psychopaths, schizophrenics, and people who even commit crimes get to be allowed to live. They even get jobs, and not just any job, but really good jobs.

5,"I’ve been diagnosed with BPD comorbid depression, and I totally get how you feel. If you look at me from the outside, it doesn’t really seem like anything is wrong. I seem to have “friends” and people who “care” about me, but none of it feels real to me. I don’t trust anyone I’m around because I constantly feel like I’m about to be abandoned, or turned against. I’ve resorted to drug use and drinking in the past but it seems like I either have to be constantly high or drunk to feel anything. I’ve been hospitalized, gone to therapy, basically all the usual crap. But nothing seems to work. I temporarily get better when I’m outside of my regular environment, but as soon as I’m put back into it I can’t function. People don’t understand how I feel at all. They don’t get that little things they say actually contribute to my feeling of hopelessness. I’m only 17, but yet I feel like it’s time for it all to end.

10,"Thank you. My sister says I’m not bad either. But she still has to distance herself from me. I don’t really like how my relationships are turning out for me. I don’t really feel in control at all. 

I’m afraid to get diagnosed, but I did do some reading. I think learning about the thought patterns behind BPD helps some. 

I don’t know if people would really mind if I died. Maybe it’d be something to talk about for a bit. I don’t really believe I’m liked as a friend or as a family member or anything. It’s hard to deal with that. 

I’m sorry about people not really caring about you in a way that feels meaningful or deeply rooted. I think it’s kind of the right thing to tell someone not to end their life, but it’s not always really always worth much, I know, especially coming from the person. Somehow words that should have impact become what feels like empty gestures. It’s a shame that happens.

Thanks for reading what I have to say. It helped to write all that.",easydoesit333,hedssp
11,The only person you've ever felt connected to must feel very hurtful. I suggest going back and thinking of someone who might feel the same way about you. Some one you might have turned down or a friend that you liked but didn't want to be around with with your other friends as you felt he was too cringey perhaps. Hope you can find someone. You may feel guilty at first but it'll soon be gone over as you'll be with the person. Hope you can and hope you feel better . <3,itzmikxx,hedssp
12,"The irony of humans. So often people forget how to be human, and just simply state the obvious like 'you shouldn't die, that's selfish' or 'think about the people you're gonna hurt'.

But we have to believe that we are enough on our own. We have a fear of abandonment. So maybe take some time to invest in yourself because at the end of the day, we are the only thing that is guaranteed to be a constant in our lives. I know what it feels like to work so hard with little success. But success is often about patience, and resilience, and perseverance.

i don't know what to do either. 

all i know is, there are still good moments that you can experience. some of the best advice i got out of therapy is that all things are temporary, even the dark times. just have to survive to make it to the positive side of the cycle. of course, being a cycle, it'll go back negative eventually too. 

radical acceptance helps. at least, trying to accept things as shitty as they are. convince yourself that life can be worth living even with painful moments. 

doing nothing is one of my only ways out of the dark times.. just need to survive the amount of time it takes to turn the cycle again.

I know it SUCKS being vulnerable but it’s what will save u I swear! I ended up single and alone after 6 years and 2 step kids lost my job and home all in the same month over people pleasing. As soon as u stop viewing yourself as an adult and ask other to treat you as though you were younger aka the family life will get easier because there will be fewer expectations and you will finally be able to relax and return to adulthood step by step but you must first work on yourself before trying to go out there and be a typical adult.

Theres at least places like this sub where you can find other people, we are all gonna be a bit different but theres an acknowledgement that sometimes shit happens to us that most everyday people will not get. I’m not saying they are stupid or putting them down. They try and most of the time have an uplifting effect on us that they’ll never know about. But we’re speaking different languages. 

My experience is usually as follows: 

Everything is fine for a while then i’ll get a bout of brutal nightmares, not of the events but themed the same. Wake up in a cold sweat and panicing about going to sleep and really fighting it. But always fall back asleep to the same repeating hell.

Then litlle tiny things piss me the fuck off to a level that is totally uncalled for. Im aware of it too. I try to keep a hold on it. I’ll get confused and make bad desicions. Usually trying to fight things that should be approuched with care.

Then i get really cold. Feel permantly over-aware in situations that dont require it. 

Then out of nowhere (in the eyes of anyone else) i’ll crack and start balling like a child over THE SAME FUCKING MEMORIES THAT WONT GO AWAY. Come out of it and it all starts again.

Or I’ll be very much over the top in agression. Usually only if i get into a fight, which happens alot.

A mate was trying to get me to play fight (early 20’s) i told him to stop and he didn’t and he endedup falling ontop of me (by accident) i freaked the fuck out and choked him unconscious whilst screaming at him to submit.


In front of another friend.

Happy days. 

Pfft.

Anyway, i thought id allow that out. We are all a bit mental! And we end up in the shit by accident.  We realise after and its not just sad, its utterly humiliating when the common sense returns.

Its not what happened/is happening to us, its what we turn it into.

On a good day, i can look on everything like “fuck, I survived all that, I can do anything”

But of course you have the flip side “i survived all that and now nothing matters” /dark twist of trauma (for me) is that after, i felt so alive it made everything else weak in comparison/ 

I cant relate to your world of going from huge highs to massive lows, but i get going to the extreme in a split second to the point where “you” aren’t really there. Just watching it happening. 

 I went through school with all my shit, although at that time it was more like “EVERYONE IS AN ENEMY KEEP THEM AWAY” kinda thing and since has evolved into a more complex thing (also due to the fact i’ve put myself in situation that just piled up more on top of all the rest). 

Tbh, i didnt go to many of my exams, i wasted the whole experience, but still, as an adult we can still develop ourselves. It helps to have qualifications, dont get me wrong, if you can get them DO IT!!!

But its not everything. Im as qualified as the village idiot but i can still speak 5 languages, work with animals, adapt, build, grow things and ultimately, survive.

""You might be given a diagnosis of BPD if you experience at least five of the following things, and they've lasted for a long time or have a big impact on your daily life"" 

You feel very worried about people abandoning you, and would do anything to stop that happening.

You have very intense emotions that last from a few hours to a few days and can change quickly (for example, from feeling very happy and confident to suddenly feeling low and sad).

You don't have a strong sense of who you are, and it can change significantly depending on who you're with.

You find it very hard to make and keep stable relationships.

You feel empty a lot of the time.

You act impulsively and do things that could harm you (such as binge eating, using drugs or driving dangerously).

You often self-harm or have suicidal feelings.

You have very intense feelings of anger, which are really difficult to control.

    When very stressed, you may also experience paranoia or dissociation.",IodineSky111,busncr

If your BF truly loved you he would work on these things with you and have patience. But like all things it’s important to give yourself time and space. Heal, see a therapist.

1,"Yeah, I know how you feel. That intense fucking fury that you know your mental health is holding you back and sabotaging you, yet that small part in your brain realises there's something beyond it, yet it's entirely unreachable. Or it feels that way anyway.

I'm in the same boat, I guess. I'd not be very averse to being hit by a bus or something if I was crossing the street tomorrow, but I'm not going to actively seek it out. 

I think it's interesting you can identify anxiety as taking the best out of your situations. It shows to me that you're able to self-analyse in a critical sort of way, so by extension surely checking yourself into a hospital, or maybe to family/whatever to see what you can do is worth a shot.

Life sometimes feels like such a chore when you feel like you don't have anything to live for but that's where we all go wrong. 

Most people have a fancy job with long hours that they HAVE to work, to put food on the table, to make their spouse happy, for a holiday where they can finally be happy and enjoy. 

We're all living for the next thrill, next moment, for the future. A future we hope is bright. 

However, we often forget about the moment we have, the now. We spend our precious moments ruminating about the past, things we could have done, things that hurt us. We love doing this. However, all it does it hurt us and make us upset, it takes away from the now. The now where you're alive, will every cell in your body working in sync to keep everything in order, the now where you breath in to oxygenate your body and breath out to remove the waste. 

Beautiful moments go by and we miss when being stuck in the past and future. You may feel like you don't have any money, no partner, however, so you actually need those things? We do you? 

I'm sorry I might be rambling and you may not have any clue what I'm talking about. But it's a great mentality of living in the moment which can bring a lot of joy. It's very helpful in low points in life. Read Eckhart Tolle power of now if you're interested. 

It's really helped with my BU and calmed make me a calmer person. I'm not sure where you live, I understand healthcare is very expensive in the US and also not sure what the insurance is like but if therapy is possible for you, then definitely look into that. Best wishes

Of course you want to manipulate people, you have a deep deep hole that wants to be filled with understanding and love. And you didn’t get it by being quiet and waiting.

Don’t contact him overly apologizing. If he knows you have bpd he already understands why you do what you do. The apologies are a special kind of agony bc it reels the non back into the craziness by garnering sympathy.

2,"I'm not sure how much help this will be, but it might help a bit at least in giving you some UK-based information. I also apologise to going on a bit, I can't seem to help it... 

I live in the North of England and have recently started to be seen by the local Crisis, Assessment & Treatment (CAT) team here after telling my GP about a recent close suicidal incident which got her worried enough to refer me for immediate consult after asking me if I wanted her to. (I've been seeing her for about ten years with depression and I feel a little guilty for distressing her a little...)

I have no idea what the situation is in other areas, but the CAT team I am being looked after by are a 24 hour team of mental health staff (nurses, Drs, support workers, etc) who's sole job is to care for people in and after mental health crisis. I know that they have a permanent cover at the local A&E for people who come in. BTW, my GP advised me that I should go to A&E should I feel in danger of what might happen, though I haven't wanted to.

All contact has currently been at home, including assessments from the initial emergency staff and a psychiatrist. At the moment they are visiting every couple of days to check up on me whilst they work out long term care (I've had an improvement since they started so the need hasn't been that great, but I am appreciative of the contact as I live on my own and have very little contact with peers). 

As far as I'm aware, hospitalisation is only used in drastic circumstances and the need was assessed when they first saw me. I'm very glad I didn't have to go to hospital as I cannot imagine it to be a great experience. I think the idea is that in some circumstances, the care is more effective outside of a ward. I even got a call from their pharmacist to check if I was OK for Venlaflaxine, which was unexpected and quite nice. It' kind of like being in hospital, but sleeping in your own bed.

That's my experience so far. I'm not a medical professional, but I'm not sure that committal is the immediate response to suicidal inclination. Again, I could be talking out my arse though and of course everybody's situation is different. 

Briefly: I can appreciate not wanting to talk to your partner. Mine is currently working abroad for a long period, has bad anxiety and I know is worried about potential consequences of depression. I try to keep as much to myself regarding the bad stuff, but when I did let on that I was 'ill', the reply was wonderful and a great help.

Wait, for everybody involved, locked up for a year (which may not be even likely) is better than dead.

If you started pot, alcohol, and cigarettes, it would not be good for your health, but your prescription drugs may subconsciously make you confuse your identity with your diagnosis. You are not your illness. (Pot and alcohol can make depression worse, you would have to be under the supervision of a trusted loved one, not recommended at all if you have an addictive personality)

I don't know how the UK psych system works, is it easy for a doctor to say that you no longer can make decisions about leaving a hospital? In USA, that is very difficult for a US doctor to do, but I don't know about UK.

I know, it does sound a bit too good. With all the negative news about the NHS, I expect that care would be minimal because of lack of funds. I do get surprised though. I guess that's the focus of the news for you. 

Though I have little expertise in this area, getting the Tramadol sorted is the priority to avoid anything happening in the first place. It could be that you end up in a position where you don't *want* to seek out help and end up killing yourself whilst in withdrawal. 

Do you have contact with a GP? I think sometimes they prefer it if patients come to them before the shit hits the fan, so they may appreciate a heads up and possibly treat accordingly. That is just supposition on my part though. Might as well use the NHS whilst we still have one...;)

0,"I got diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago (I'm 32 this year), and after reading up on it, I felt it a death sentence. I already had some other mental health problems, and one that went undiagnosed until last year. I let it define me. I let all my mental health issues define me. I thought to myself ""How can anyone want me?"" Then I met my fiance. 

Never have I met a man that was fully equipped with the tools to take care of me and help me manage my BPD and the emotions that come with it. There are some times where I can see and hear the frustration in his face and in his voice, but at the end of the day he loves me and every part of me. 

You can't let your issues define you. I've done that for almost 20 years. I've been mentally disturbed longer than I like to admit, but *somehow* I can come out on top. I beat drug addiction AND alcoholism. It's all about finding that which will ground you, bring you back to reality. Trust me man, I loathe the fact I have BPD. It's probably the most debilitating of illnesses I have, and I have schizoaffective disorder. But at the same time, there is so much more to me than my illness. I do origami. I love to write. I can talk for hours about Harry Potter. I look at my positives rather than my negatives. BPD is ***not*** a death sentence. It is a mere hurdle.  If you ever want to talk or have some support, you can feel free to PM me. There are some amazing resources out there to help you through this!

I know that I've made my fair share of mistakes in the past, and every so often they come back to haunt me. I find that accepting that I committed them and observing what I learned from then really helps me sleep easier at night.

If I were you, I wouldn't worry about being a terrible husband or person. The fact that you have this ability to look at your past and see the mistakes you made is a good sign. Introspection is a powerful tool that lets you recognise mistakes you have made and steer yourself away from making future ones.

There are many terrible people in the world who are incapable of looking at themselves and their actions, and give no thought to others that may be affected by what they do. It is those sorts of people who contribute to a lot of the world's suffering. By thinking of others and recognizing mistakes you've made, you are already letting go of your past and moving into a bright future.

Therapy is an excellent solution as well. By talking to someone, you should be able to offload some of the guilt and give you some direction on where you want to take things from here.

I hear you and you're not alone. 
It's tough when you're caught between 'hello I need to survive' and 'hello I need a fucking break and some room to breathe/money to survive'.

Here's something for you to hold onto though---at your age, my life was shit and I was about as low as I could go. 
In the last six months things are *finally* turning around. I'm finally getting accepted into a BPD outpatient program in the spring.
Money is slowly but surely becoming a little easier. Hey I'm not living with shitty abusive partners or sucking cock to make sure I have food/rent anymore and no longer 10+K in debt anymore....so that's a bonus.  

This is not to say that I don't still struggle with voices and pain and bullshit (my last attempt was 18 months ago) but that things can and do improve. 

Your fiancee needs you and loves you. He's going through just as much shit and darkness as you are. I know it feels like/your brain is like 'you're a useless piece of shit' but you need to remind yourself that your thoughts/feelings can and will be distorted. 

Debt sucks. But it's temporary and such a small thing in the grand scheme compared to death. 

The thing I find helpful in this situation (when my brain is trying to kill me) is to think practically and take it one day a time. 
Ok, debt/bills an issue? How can I change things?

Could you and your fiancee move to his parents' etc. place for a while, until things become stable? 
Does your campus have a health department---they could see you and begin getting you the help you need to document all your disability/pain stuff. 
This also might be a time to contact your local government/community health place and ask for a list of community services and possibly a social worker so they can help you re: pain/accessibility/money/housing etc.

Do not disagree on her when shes telling you reasons to commit suicide. It may seem counterproductive, but if she were to say she's ugly, do not respond by telling her she's not ugly. Instead empathize with that, you could say ""I'm sorry you feel this way, how long have you felt like this?""

29,"If you don't want to go to hell than become a Christian and accept Jesus as your lord and savior... He Loves you and he forgives sin but there are still consequences to sin in this life and the next... if a Christian kills themselves, they still go to heaven but they receive less rewards than has they stuck things out... If you become a Christian and accept God into your heart it may make it harder to end your life as has happened to me when I tried a few times as that tiny piece of hope just gets in the way as well as situations that pop up to prevent it such as a failed attempt, random ppl or cops showing up out of nowhere, security guards telling you to get up leave when your trying to die of hypothermia,  or like a presce near by you want see yet talks to you by putting thoughts and images in your head like family or whoever feeling hurt by what your about to do or hurt when you go through with it... 


You can watch vids on YT 'do Christians go to hell if they commit suicide?' Answer is a resounding 'no' but still sin has consequences... you can also look up near death experiences of ppl who tried to kill themselves... Every non Christian who had a near death experience from suicide all say hell is far worse than things in this life so it's something to consider 


Ppl would say what you need is God and to change your life around and focus more on others by helping them or getting involved in community such as at a church or something; and stay active... 


Becoming a Christian though doesn't mean all your situations will improve which is a common misconception... I've been a Christian all my life and had tried taking my life in the past and currently it's likely on the table with how things are going and I'm 40 now, so any good years are already lost and there isn’t hope of relationships if the one I'm trying to start keeps going in the opposite direction where the person I love hate me because I love them but has crush feelings for ppl who see/treat them as whores to be used and discarded all because those ppl are more social, talkative, and ""fun"" even though they have absolutely no love or respect for her... (a broken record (curse) in my life, and I'm too old now that there is no ""you will find something better later on""... 


Also the opposite of things I pray for keeps happening as if God doesn't care but I know he's real... every time there seems to be a good moment it's immediate taken away as a game is being played on me... Just the other Saturday ago I overheard my girl break down as if she loves me and regrets being with other ppl yet all I ever see /hear from her ever since is hate, avoidance, and overhearing her mock me for saying nice things to her in an early Valentines Day letter and a previous text where I tell her if she's doing things with others in breaks my heart but I forgive her, as I overheard her mock me saying I broke her heart and she made a mocking cry sound as if im a joke to her... And other things like this... 


Basically I tell a friend I've know for years I love them and I always treat them well but crap user guys basically call her a whore and treat her like one and not well yet she chooses them, likes them, but hates and mocks me... 


In the past girls I liked/ loved told me they don't deserve me then they go and run to be with crap ppl and end up broken ppl; and I'm left alone over and over again in thus curse and broken record and I am so done with it as I love this girl the most and I'm losing her... 


I will continue to pray God turns things around... idk maybe if you the reader prays she and I be restored and come together perhaps God will finally grant it if you readers are believers or not... ",KanzenR,1am90do

I answered as truthfully as i could. The doctor told me they were going to keep me overnight and when i said id rather go home they told me i was being held against my will.

It was a very negative experience for me because i wanted to be cared for but it felt like the hospital only cared about avoiding liability. I just said what they wanted to hear and they let me go the next day. I got slapped with a huge medical bill a few days later. 

Maybe a psych ward will be different but id say don't go in blind.

So I will go into detail how it was for me - it might be 100% different elsewhere and for others.


It was just going there; leaving most your stuff at a locker - cord for charging phone gets locked in to a charger room where you can put your phone to charge, you are not allowed to have any strings or string/rope lookalike items. Meds get replaced with what they have there. You are not allowed anything package-wise that is opened (not even menstrual pad stuff).
You get given a calming medication that makes you sleepy when there, very tired and heavy eyelids all the time (for me anyway).

There is a common room with a tv, some puzzle games, card game and you can ask for water, coffee, lemonade or tea.
You eat at set times.

Whoever else is there is a gamble, can be nice people to talk to I guess but I am very much just going into my own shell a lot so I only spoke a little with one.

The others can have all sorts of other problems - worse or less bad than you.
I think one guy there intentionally tried to be annoying to me for example cause he did stuff like sit infront of my view when I watched tv while eating dinner  - the only spot out of many, just to block my view basically.
It wasnt a big deal at all - just felt a bit meh ish. He maybe didnt even know. Idk. When you are in a bad state mentally I guess we just assume things too.

Anyway.
The bedroom is barren. Not much in there. No pictures or anything on the walls.
The bed is hard to sleep on.
No curtains - just built in blinds.
Light is either super bright or none at all.

The thing that stood out the most for me was how cold it was everywhere in the ward.
I used double socks.
Oh and you can borrow clothes there - also depending on what you wear; if it seems dangerous you have to change.
I didnt have to but I preferred the cosy outfits they had there (cozy pants, longsleeved soft shirt or tanktop, and a longsleeved over shirt with some buttons, all were very soft anyway)


It was ok but I felt very alone too, just in another way.
Like there I was in a different enviroment and there were people around talking etc.
I had the option to ask for help or company too - I just did not use it cause of my mental state.

I think its an ok place, but it helped me less than I thought or hoped it would.
Most likely cause I have a hard time being honest with how I feel when it comes to pain.

I now know I can call there and go there tho if it seems as bad again, its better than being all alone in apartment I guess.
I missed my bed and my cats, as well as the ability to grab something from fridge.

I have no idea where you live or so - and every place can be very different.
Nobody can tell you if it will help or not, cause its very individual of what you might need and how you behave too --- besides what the places provide depending on how different they are from where I went.

Sadly I cant tell you if its worth it...
I know I spoke to some people there, doctors and nurses, and I got some insight in how I might be thinking wrong when I usually assume the worst, or expect too much out of others because I myself am doing too much for others.

I hope my ""ted-talk"" post helped anyone get any insight in how it can be - at least where I live (Sweden).",CatJamFan,uouh4k

I was admitted through a suicide attempt, which meant that for my first week there, I was on 24/7 1-1 supervision. 

When I was moved to outpatient at the end of my ward experience, it was a *lot* better. A lot of the worst/most abusive staff were night staff (usually agency, too) and being a day patient meant that I could avoid that.

36,"Either admit you are of danger to yourself (ie. Go to the ER and say you're suicidal, have a plan, or have taken measures to end your life)

Or seek out a mental health professional and say you need to be hospitalized. 

I've done both methods involuntary and voluntary. However the process is very very long. They have to transport you to a hospital and then find available rooms for a psych ward. Expect to be at the hospital for more than 3+ hours. Sometimes you need be be transported in a ambulance or cop car (yes, handcuffed or restrained). 

In the end, it's worth getting away from everything and stabilizing yourself. I come out somewhat improved but it does not address the real issues in your life. It's temporary. Usually within a few months I fall back to the same situation, but getting the right treatment will prevent this. 

People tend to be anxious being there, unwelcomed or feel crazy but not me. It's a place I could call home. Especially as an adult it was a way to escape my family. You can refuse visitors and calls. I'm the person that likes taking a break and the psych ward gave me that opportunity. The most ""uncomfortable"" I felt was being around homicidal people, but you get used to it. These people want help and I respect that.

However I do not recommend. I was involuntarily admitted a few years ago and it wasn’t a nice place to be. It was very negative, everyone around you was also unwell, but you also look at others who are in the hospital and think ‘surely I’m not as ‘crazy’ as them’. All sorts of people are in the hospital, for example in my ward I was suicidal but I was paired with many people with different issues ranging from eating disorders to psychotic/schizophrenia. To see people in a much worse mental state than you is very eye opening and somewhat scary as you have no idea what to expect.

It is otherwise wandering aimlessly around the hospital or trying to make conversation with people. You have set times you can enter and leave your room (you can’t just stay in your room all day and sleep, they make you get up and get ready by 10am latest). You are restricted from basic items, even using mirrors. You are given medication that you have to take at the counter in front of them, even if you were never on any form of medication before.  They don’t tell you what it is either, usually though it’s anti depressant of some kind. 

The only positive thing I got from it was a break from reality and somewhat of a realisation that even though life fucking sucks, having life outside of the ward was much better than being inside. 

That’s just my experience from the hospital I was at in the UK, of course others will have different experiences.",-lugia-,uouh4k
42,"Getting committed for a severe manic episode was one of the best things to ever happen to me. The ward I was sent to was incredible. Fantastic nurses, and they had such bright and colourful decorations everywhere. It really helped. This was in Canada.

I got committed by going to the hospital emergency and basically just showing them how manic I was. You can be voluntarily committed, but it may cost money depending on where you live. But if you’re in the UK, I am not sure if you’ll have much luck. When I lived there and I tried to get help, they wouldn’t. It was impossible to get help. It’s part of the reason I left the UK. Went to A&E for depression and they just said with an angry face ‘well what do you expect us to do about it?’ And they said they couldn’t help me unless I had actually made an attempt.

46,"Do you have crisis houses near you? Those places are really good, you can normally stay about a week, it's an inpatient kind of thing but you're free to leave, and it's not necessarily clinical but there are lots of complimentary therapies. Normally in UK they wanna try you in a place like that before hospital, and having stayed in both numerous times I'd say that hospital is only your best bet if you know you cannot keep yourself safe. Crisis houses are very good for knowing you are unwell and need help, but you know you're not a immediate risk to yourself. As for staying private - last two hospitals I stayed at were private, most recently it was funded by the NHS because they couldn't find any room in any NHS hospitals but needed me inpatient as soon as possible, and honestly, it wasn't all too different from NHS. But as I said hospital should always be the last resort, try other options first. And in terms of treatment etc, there isn't a lot. You're in a building where they can make sure you're taking your meds, eating right, and making sure you can't hurt yourself, there's not much more to it than that.",perceivesomeoneelse,uouh4k

At night you go home and sleep in your own bed. Most insurances cover at least 2 weeks of it if you have any, or you can get a payment plan for your bill as well I think.",kungfuchelsea,uouh4k
49,"If talking about it helps you then probably.

For me it didn't help. Been to there 2 times. Talking about my problems doesn't help at all.

Would have been admitted a 3rd time since I overdosed but they didn't want to take me back a 3rd time lol.

I remember there was some doctor when I overdosed asking is there anything they could do to make me want to live. 

Its laughable because what do they expect me to say? A burger from Mc Donald's and a small fry?

After the ward you will probably get apointments with a mental health worker.
 (Ask you how you are feeling and suggests calling a suicide prevention hotline)

My thoughts on about that number is that I don't want to be stopped and I couldn't care less about someone asking me how I feel like I haven't heard it 100 times over and over again.

I want to end my suffering not explain how I feel.

Things have gotten better for me now i guess. I have my own flat in a homeless hostel because my mother kicked me out after I came back from the hospital from the overdose.

I still prefer to be dead. 
I feel different after I attempted to end my life. I feel like apart of myself as a human has lost an emotion. I have no fear or concerns of death.

I'm trying not to attempt again until I get my own house or something and when I would be in a bad situation.

I don't recommend overdosing, I didn't think it was possible to feel that nauseous.

so, I don't really think we can truly answer this question for you because I think it heavily depends on where you live and what your needs are



I can say with more certainty though that if you live in the USA, it's unlikely as the health care system in America (including the mental health) values money more than quality care
though still not impossible, a lot more unlikely as most psych wards in USA will lie to you about your own stay and nitpick and exaggerate and intentionally misinterpret your words and actions if you aren't careful just to find any possible reason to keep you there as long as they can so they can make as much money off of you as they can (I cried in a psych ward once and they threatened to sedate me and told me that ""this behavior will justify you being here""... I wasn't even misbehaving, I was just crying and that was it) and even if you have insurance you might still get billed some as your insurance might not cover it all, even if they say they will (after my most recent stay, I still got billed from the psychiatrist there for every one of the 7 days I was there, even though he only saw me on 3 of those days)

53,"I have been 3 times.  I think it’s helpful for extreme episodes,  but if you just feel like it is normal symptoms and swings, it really isn’t going to solve your problems.  They might be good at getting you on different meds, but for many conditions and disorders this is only a temporary fixed as they will need to be closely monitored anyway.  It is also very expensive if no insurance is covering it.  I think my most recent stay cost my insurance about 2k per day.  I was very lucky to be covered.

I have received many diagnoses from Bipolar to a whole list of dissociative and mood disorders.  I now take no medications, but have been able to be functional and relatively happy.  It is still really hard sometimes, but it is so much better.  I promise that it can get better.

I was thinking about him even half a year ago, so many guilts about my acts I couldn't handle the idea of me being the person I was. I suffered a lot but some months later I started talking to a therapist. Opened up super hardly to her because of my shame and guilt. I understood that I did some bad things, made a person feel bad, sometimes on purpose as well. The big deal is about understanding that you have the chance to change this. I know it's hard for someone to start seeing a therapist so I'm not suggesting directly this but for starters try to fix the things that hurt you and your opinion about yourself. Understand where this is coming from, how do you feel exactly? What do you want to change? Are you ready to make the effort or are you prepared to struggle by guilt? We are people, we are ourselves. We do bad things and we do good things, we are not bad nor good. It will take so so so much time to change your opinion about you. Bad days will come as well and you will feel like you achieved nothing at all. It's all part of the progress. I today got rid of my guilts.

Unfortunately I'm much more up to date on the mood spectrum disorders (out of sad necessity) than I am on BPD, so I'm afraid there's only so much I can say that would be directly relevant to your situation.

But please, please don't let yourself become a victim of the mentality that this is an unwinnable battle.

Regardless of his motives, your husband IS being supportive, and that is invaluable. I cannot begin to express how much I would love to have someone in my life who would be willing to make even a token effort to be supportive of my own situation, for any reason. What the two of you have is precious - fragile, in danger, and in need of serious protection - but precious.

The last thing anyone involved needs is to have to watch you deal with the unfolding of this circumstance on your own. It can be extremely hard to feel worthy of someone's compassion and patience sometimes; believe me, I know all too well. But the most tragic thing we can do in these situations is fall victim to those thoughts and feelings. Cling to the fact that, no matter what, you are very much worth his love, and draw from that the strength it will take to face your challenges.

1,"A lot of current thinking on BPD seeks to reframe it as Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder) touches on this a little bit, but I don't know how accurate or up to date that information is.  There was a strong push to replace (not successful yet) the Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis in the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual with Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  The reasoning is that around 90% of people diagnosed with BPD have verifiable complex trauma histories, the C-PTSD diagnosis does not carry the stigma that has grown up around BPD, and it may be a more positive and accurate framework on which to base treatment.  There are a lot of very effective therapies out there (there is support!!).  You might look into [Dialectical Behavioral Therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy) in your area as a great place to start.  :)",heartbag,gnopi
2,"Well, to begin with, looking to reddit for relationship advice is... you know, there's really no comparison.  Just really really really do not take life advice from the internet lightly, and NEVER from the more popular reddits (ie IamA).  Ditto the general population's opinion of mental disorders/depression/women in general and their ideas of how to cope when things get tough (ie, ""don't"").

Having said that, depression and BPD and all that shit are *hard* to live with.  For the person living with it, and for the people living with the person living with it.  But if someone is willing to put out the energy and love necessary to deal with it - goddammit, KEEP HIM.  I haven't ever had a relationship, and I tell you, I'm scared of being in one, but I'm also jealous of people like you, who've found someone with the strength and the love to walk through it with you.  He *may* eventually crack under the strain.  He *may* decide that he can't take it anymore.  But until then, give him the benefit of trusting that he really does love you and want to see you through what you're dealing with.

Oh, and it would take a truly shitty support group to say ""yeah, you need to leave her"" without one HELL of lot of good reasons.  It'd be like calling a hotline and 30 seconds in getting ""well, geez, I really can't think of any good reasons for you *not* to jump.""  Support groups can be extremely valuable resources because they let you get out all the bad shit that is going on that people who aren't going through it will *never* understand.  Hell, /SW and /depression are support groups, of a kind.  We just have a somewhat difficult time reaching out and giving each other a big fucking hug when it's really needed.

You've taken several steps forward.  You've acknowledged that you have a serious problem that needs to be dealt with.  You're in counseling.  The things you're too afraid to tell a counselor, you've written down here for us to see.  You're going in the right direction.  I highly recommend talking to your counselor about some of the things you're afraid to talk about - those are your biggest weak spots while you keep them hidden, right?  If you can't say it out loud, write it down.  Hell, print out this post and hand it to them.  It'll suck and be hard but when you do it, you're winning a battle with yourself.  It may be that they do not feel qualified to help anymore but hey, they're going to have more connections than you have, and it could be they can point you to someone more qualified and better for you than even they are.  That's *if* they decide they can't handle it!",throwoutgirl,gnopi
3,"The thinking that people with BPD can't change or be helped is out of date.  A lot has been learned since Stop Walking on Eggshells (which is nonetheless, a very good book, I think) was published.  Folks with BPD can absolutely be helped if they're willing to work at it, but I think it would be really helpful to be sure that it's the right diagnosis, first.  

There are some great resources at [bpdcentral.com](http://bpdcentral.com/index.php), including a link to [Rachel Reiland's book ""Get Me Out of Here""](http://bpdcentral.com/bks/supposed.php), a personal story from someone with BPD who really did get truly well.  The most compelling evidence is the heartfelt positive review by Anthony Walker, himself the author of ""Siren's Dance"" which is one of the most pessimistic (but powerful) true stories of BPD ever written (he was married to a BP and it ended badly).  

It might help to look at it this way.  If you truly have BPD, it means that for your whole life you've been suffering from something terrible, and not knowing what it was.  Now, you have a chance to get real help, and real understanding.  Even if recovery will be difficult, you're still better off knowing what you're dealing with.  ",SQLwitch,gnopi

It's difficult to be an outside person looking in, thinking I may know the challenges he must face but not really knowing the whole side of the story. Of course I don't and can not, which is why neither I nor the rest of the family make any judgement regarding their relationship.

The truth of the matter is, it doesn't matter what any of us think from time to time, he loves her, he'll take care of her, and we'll always support that and their relationship.

Good luck to you, dear. If he cherishes you, that's all that matters.",sirloafalot,gnopi
6,"Thank you for your reply. It's very difficult for me to accept that my husband could possibly love me enough to want to stay with me - apparently part of the disorder - and instead I assume he's got ulterior motives. In fact, he commented offhandedly that a support group would be a really great place to go for non-BPs, and I told him the support group would probably tell him it's better off to leave your partner than stay. 

I get so scared of myself because I haven't hurt myself yet, but sometimes when my husband gets angry with me and tries to leave, I want to hurt myself to teach him a lesson. I know this is ridiculous thinking but I can't stop my brain from having these impulses. 

I'm in therapy right now but I hide things that might give it away that I abuse my husband or have anger problems because it embarrasses me. I'm terrified that if I tell her I have BPD she won't want to see me anymore because it's too much to handle. I just have always had this feeling that I will never be able to function in society and now I know for a fact that I can't. ",mixcoatl,gnopi

10,"I answer a crisis hotline and a lot of our frequent callers have BPD.  Calling a crisis line isn't supposed to be a ""regular"" thing, but many of them can't get the help they need anywhere.  I attended a training seminar recently given by the team lead at the DBT program that our local health authority runs.  She said something that, on the basis of many years talking to a lot of people with BPD, I absolutely agree with.  She said the people with BPD are usually doing the best they can, and they deserve the best help we can give.  

BPD can look like ""bad character"" to people who don't really understand the disorder, but, in fact, some people with BPD have a great courage and tremendous character.  Some don't.  Just like any other disease, some people face it bravely and some just aren't so brave.

And I feel like she'll reject me, or won't believe that I have BPD, when I think it definitely is something more than depression and anxiety. 

I definitely won't go off my meds. I really want to get better and I know it takes a while for them to work. My husband is getting really involved in my treatment so I think once I start the meds he'll make sure I'm taking them - he does that with the pills I take for my stomach issues now anyway, so that's a relief to have the support.",mixcoatl,gnopi

If I didn’t have Antabuse in my system I would be wasted now too. I get it. I know I wouldn’t survive. I’m so done. But I’m a pussy and I take Antabuse because I’m weak. I’m pathetic.

0,"I have BPD. It's such a shitty disorder and us people with it typically treat ourselves very harshly. Just a reminder that you're not a horrible person, your brain just quite literally functions differently from the average person, and that's not your fault whatsoever so don't put the blame on yourself.

I recommend you visit r/BPD and speak to a therapist/psychiatrist to see if they have any ideas on how to help you. Unfortunately, there's no specific treatment or cure for BPD but there are meds available that can help you manage specific symptoms.",cutiegothgf,16hee2b

2,"No I've realized more recently I am a shitty person especially cause of bpd if it is indeed what I have. I'm seeing a therapist now & on meds & I don't get why people push either because it doesn't help shit. I've been seeing so many post of people talking about someone they love/care about with bpd & then just bitching about them & the comments upon comments of them just basing how horrible people with bpd are. And there definitely not wrong, even the person I care most about & who i though cared about me has made several posts bitching about me & being so negative about me, again there not wrong, & they even said they wish they'd been smart enough to run. And I'm always the one asking for them to come over or to go over to there place to spend time together & they've admitted to agreeing to things just to keep me from having a meltdown so I'm sure that means everything's just been to keep me from having a breakdown & not because they actually care about me or genuinely want to spend time with me.

5,"It would be shocking for any parent to hear. The best thing that you can do to do check-ins with her. Talk about it openly with her as calmly as you can and try to get as much information from her as possible. Just to figure out how active her thoughts are. Does she have a plan and the means to carry it out? Ask her if she can be safe for the next 24 hours and then check in again to see if she still feels the same way. Remove anything that she could possibly use to act on the thoughts for her safety. And when she gets her assessment let them know about it as well so they can be aware too. It will be difficult to not react overly emotionally, but if you do she may withhold information from you down the line. Encourage her to keep an open line of communication with you. It may help her if you can share some of your experiences with her and how you cope with things. Obviously we want the positive coping skills. But she’s so young and if she can get the proper help and tools she needs, she will be better off for it in the long run. Not to say it’s a cure all but it can help make things more manageable.",Lost-lesb_shes-alone,15pn3jn
6,"After a long talk with her, she said she didn't understand what she was saying, and when we explained what that meant she said she didn't really feel that way she was just mad. The reason she was so mad is because she got in trouble by making poor choices and had some stuff taken away. Her exact words where ""I feel like I'm gonna kill myself if I don't get my stuff back"".

I learned it from my dad bc growing up he struggled with intense depression and let his suicidal ideations out on me so I thought it was normal to think that way, fucked up my brain big time
U meantioned ur bpd, is there a possibility u have mentioned negative thoughts to her? Also the meds are quite a lot, that can absolutely mess with a young childs brain but I'm no expert

20,"poor choices .
well, taking things away just causes more frustration and less critical thinking 
she act on emotion no reason to be exact
better way to handle this is
lets go for a walk .. then you talk to her about her choices and how this affect you and the one that lover her.
she needs a mom no a mom-ster 
you are dealer with a young people that can't control emotions yet . even as an adult you don't control emotions and when you fight with your husband you most likely would say thing to hurt him mentally too.
take a walk and spend some good quality time
then talk about this things.

22,Yeah I wanted to say I’m 18x and autistic and I was disruptiveeeeee as a kid 😭 but that came from me not knowing how to express my needs if I was given food and it wasn’t on a pink plate I’d just start crying and refusing to eat because as a kid you don’t know what’s wrong you just know you feel bad and you can’t articulate your needs the way you can when you grow up and I was seen as defiant for questioning commands from adults but that’s because I didn’t know how to say why should I listen to you because you’re older than me  or why am I not allowed to ask questions without it being seen as rude or disrespectful when I’m genuinely curious so I think I lucked out somewhat being diagnosed late because I can 100% see myself being drugged up if I was an early diagnosed kid or living in America where they seem to be a bit trigger happy with medicating children and I think parents of autistic and adhd kids need to realise communication and understanding will do a lot more for your kid growing up than medicine when the problem is usually something tangible like sensory input,Putrid_Resist_1304,15pn3jn
23,"We did this. Well, sorta. We sat her down in the chill space and had a talk about consequences. Why her stuff was taken and why she made the choices she made. (She was irresponsible with said stuff). We talked a long time. She also deals with RSD and that's always a toughy. I assure you I'm not a momster. Her consequences were plainly laid out (if you do/don't do xyz this is what's going to happen) at the beginning of the day. She made bad choices and when it came time for the consequences of those choices she got pissed. She flat out said during our talk that she didn't really feel that way and she was just mad and wanted her stuff back. Again we talked about why the stuff was taken. This is a very string willed child and if I don't follow through on consequences, behaviors get 10x worse.",Puppy-with-paws,15pn3jn
