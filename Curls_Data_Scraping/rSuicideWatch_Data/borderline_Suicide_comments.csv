1,I‚Äôm on medication and the therapy is ongoing. The fact that I may have sabotaged my beautiful relationship hurts more today. I wish I was diagnosed earlier so I could talk about this with my ex and sort things out. Now I have lost my relationship and on top of that I have to live with this regret and guilt and this diagnosis. Didn‚Äôt ask for all this when I was born.,SpursySlytherin,1cj9h4i

3,I don‚Äôt feel guilty for being who or what I am. I feel guilty for acting in a certain way because of that. I am loser and I have self sabotaged everything that good that has happened to me,SpursySlytherin,1cj9h4i
0,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear this, have you tried finding an agency that can help you get into any kind of customer service role etc, they tend to have opportunities they get you?

There‚Äôs a company called Webhelp that tends to advertise work from home customer service jobs that tend to be quite easy to get into, and bank customer service jobs I‚Äôve seen people get into easily 

Are you also able to get support from food banks to help some of the way?

My last real family member my sister cut me off recently and I can‚Äôt face living alone and only having myself as a support so I‚Äôm also just thinking ending it will be better than carrying this grief ontop of the possible difficulties that end up coming with having no one. I think balconies can result in failed attempts and worse physical complications so you might not want to choose that method though, I hope you manage to find an opportunity come your way to help you",AllGoneNowzz,1c4sb04
1,"I've spoke to the job centre and citizens advice but it's not really lead anywhere its not for lack of trying it's just nothing seems to be coming of anything and I like having the freedom to work I like having money and being able to treat my daughter I'm not the sort of person who thinks well fuck the system I'm not gonna work which is what makes this suck even more, being caught in a situation where I'm literally a criminal and having people think I'm a criminal when in actuality im trying my hardest it's just not working and I don't know what else to do. 

I've reached out to the few food banks local to me I've asked 3rd parties to reach out too, like my family services worker, but I've had no response. I know they're probably overwhelmed i can't be the only one in this situation it's just frustrating.

I'm sorry about your sister that sounds awful I know what it's like to have family out there and yet have no family at all :( I can imagine how u must be feeling, just sucks any of us are feeling like this at all. I know it can result in failed attempts I guess even if I ended up on life support or in a coma I'd have someone looking after me for a change and not having to worry about even getting dressed in the morning sounds pretty good right now.

I'm sorry you're going through this, I hope things turn around for both of us.",wicxaphase24,1c4sb04
0,I can relate to EVERYTHING you said. Very similar to me. Been there. Done that.  You have been through soooo much. Let that go but look deep inside for the silver lining bc the light shines through darkness. You can help others and in doing so you can heal. Write it all down.

If it makes you feel better about the cost, call ahead and ask about financial aid; my local ER has this for those who don‚Äôt have insurance and it covers the ridiculous US price every time I‚Äôve had to go. Most ERs have a social worker as well who may be able to get you in touch with someone who can get you your meds faster.

If you‚Äôre apprehensive about going, maybe consider calling your hospital and asking for the nurse line? They‚Äôre usually good listeners and have convinced me to go when I otherwise would have probably felt a bit silly. If your hospital doesn‚Äôt have a nurse line, just start calling random hospitals and ask for theirs

7,"I blocked her everywhere. I know she's no good for me or anyone. I just got addicted to the funny, energetic, empathetic person she presents herself as but I've also seen the intolerable, eternal victim, liar side of her. You're right about latching on. I had just moved to a new place and she latched onto me immediately.

8,"Everytime she apologized it was insincere. She only took responsibility once but that was short-lived, then she blamed everything but herself. She teased me and weaponized her attractiveness, because she is a fucking bully who admitted to being on a power trip.",Flecktones37,na106v
9,"People with BPD are really good at making themselves look good. They are like masters of subtle self promotion. Just recognize that as long as you don't engage, it's over.

You can step away right now, and keep living your life as you did before. The only difference is that now you know. You know that some people lie.

If I just talk to the same person, I can't look in their eyes for more than a couple seconds without feeling nervous and I have to look away frequently, I feel awkward in any kind of social situation and this made me quit college, twice (this year and last year). I'm currently without a job, I have a few friends that I've had since I was a child, but I completely abandon them, and hence getting abandoned by them. No one actually knows I feel this way, and think that I quit school to play computer games or just being a nerd, while it's simply because I go day in, day out, without talking to a single person, feeling like a ghost in society. Suicidal thoughts have frequently been coming by, but I love my family too much to say good bye to this world, even though there is, as of right now, no point living in it.

I know how difficult it can be when you have no friends (even more so with the anxiety) but at least it can give you something to talk about and discuss with others. 

What about meetup.com? Maybe check out some of the groups around your area and see if anything even remotely catches your interest. Not sure how useful that site would be to you but just thought I'd throw it out there. In my area I've actually discovered an anxiety support group.",chocofish,iepcq

Your camera is not the limiting factor when you're taking pictures.

Depression and anxiety are often SYMPTOMS of personality disorders, so, take heart. The meds you are taking for the depression and anxiety will also help you cope with a disordered personality. I encourage you strongly not to further victimize yourself by getting too caught up in diagnostics. They‚Äôre highly subjective and can vary greatly from clinician to clinician, and diagnostic episode to diagnostic episode so, try not to focus on ‚ÄúBorderline‚Äù or ‚Äúdepression‚Äù or ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù as labels or categories within which to box yourself. It‚Äôs counterproductive and just encourages a cycle of further victimizing yourself. There‚Äôs MORE good news, too. While there might not be a ‚Äúpill‚Äù to take as an intervention for BPD, there IS a highly successful, evidence-based, and easily accessible therapy called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy you can participate in (across all settings, too: Group, individual, etc) which WILL offer you the tools and skills with which to better cope with the characteristics of BPD.

He also has [two recent books](http://psycheducation.org/about-this-site/book-versions-of-this-site/) on the subject, either published or soon to be published.

My story follows. I'm not sure it is detailed enough or is relevant to your experience, but if you have any further questions I'll do my best to answer them.

*

I have diagnosed bipolar. I also have some BPD-like traits, including long-term severe self-harm. My therapist thinks it's possible that I have BPD, but I have no formal diagnosis yet.

I didn't get the bipolar diagnosis until 15 years after my first mania. The delay was prolonged due to a psychiatrist's early failure to screen me for symptoms of mania. He misdiagnosed depression.

I finally got diagnosed when I showed up at a clinic after months of drinking and suicidality. I was at the end of my rope. The doctor gave me a standard mood test, and I guess I checked whatever signaled something more than depression. He got me into a psychiatrist that very night. The psychiatrist diagnosed bipolar in the first few sessions.

The bipolar diagnosis was not a surprise to anyone who knows me. For me, it was like a light went on. It explained the euphorias and hyperreligiousity. It gave a name, ""mixed states,"" to the episodes of terror that I sometimes get. It accounted for the rages, insomnia, racing thoughts, hypersexuality, some of the suicidality, and, in general, the trail of wreckage that is my life.

I am not yet well. In the last two years I've made significant strides toward wellness, but I lost most of it recently due to the failure of a relationship. My mood is mostly under control, but I am low-functioning. I struggle to keep my sleep and diet stable. I still have a host of problems that call for explanation or treatment: social anxiety, panic, some obsessive-compulsive symptoms, instability of emotion (as distinct from mood), dissociation, poor executive function, unstable relationships. The list goes on.

Edit: order, clarity, and detail.",,5wyv3v
3,"I have Borderline Personality disorder. I was diagnosed when I attempted suicide. I will feel suicidal and depressed for short periods of time (anywhere from half an hour to 2 hours) then I'll almost immediately feel happy or at least ok. I think about a Fantasy of how I want things in a situation will turn out and get disappointed when they don't, or the exact opposite where I envision the worst way something could happen and I am glad when they don't go that way. BPD gives me bad impulse sometimes. I'll shoplift, drink a lot, smoke, or smoke pot just to do it. My suicide attempt was impulse. Something bad happened and I freaked out and felt so many emotions at once that I broke. (I'm better now though.) I get overly attached in relationships. I'll think I NEED that person. Some days I won't eat, drink, or talk to anyone, I'll just sleep. Others I'm super social and can't stay in one place. I take things too personally and overthink it in the worst ways possible. If my S/O would mention that they're unhappy about something in our relationship I would freak out and overthink it to the point that I won't eat, sleep, drink for a day or two. I'll idolize someone one day then not really have any sort of attraction towards them the next. The list goes on and on.

Since I've been diagnosed though, ive learned that these are part of BPD and I've learned how to rationalize all of my thoughts and not be as consumed by it. Now I do a pretty good job at keeping my BPD down. You should check out r/BPD if you need a community to talk and relate to about it.",A7XfoREVer15,5wyv3v

1,"Hi there. I have friends who have had BPD, and they are without exception lovely people who I'm honored to have as friends--even though it hasn't always been easy on either of us. I do know that going through the emotional wringer of BPD is exhausting, and that the derealization and derealization that accompany it can also be terrifying and a source of despair.

I want you to know that you're okay and lovable exactly as you are--even when you're hurting and feeling broken, even if you make mistakes or act in ways that you wish you wouldn't, even if your relationships with others in the past have not been healthy--you are lovable *no matter what*, and there's nothing in this world that can take that from you. 

It's also okay if you're having trouble believing the previous paragraph... so much of what BPD is stems from never having had the experience, even or especially in childhood, of feeling stable and secure in your relationships. And it's completely understandable that it feels to you like this pattern will extend forever into the future, that the root of this pattern is something unchangeable within you.

It's true that the emotional experiences and thought patterns that come from never having had the safe, loving relationships you deserve are not easy to change--as I'm sure you've realized, in your struggle. It's also the case that therapy can do a lot to change this (DBT, especially)--it's a long process that can pass through times of despair like the one you're going through right now, but even so it makes a difference.

I really liked Rachel Reiland's autobiography, ""Get Me Out Of Here: My Recovery From Borderline Personality Disorder"" as a narrative that shows one way one person moved through this process. [Here's a short article that gives an overview of that journey.](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stop-walking-eggshells/201106/recovered-borderline-and-author-rachel-reiland-embarks-radio-tour) I also highly recommend reading the [Borderline Scorpion](http://borderlinescorpion.tumblr.com/) tumblr if you haven't already, just to get a sense of the fact that this is something other people are going through--and also to read [the Asks](http://borderlinescorpion.tumblr.com/tagged/Ask-borderline-scorpion), which provide lots of helpful, compassionate information from young women who struggle with the same issues.",circinia,1tlmsn

0,"I have BPD. The first thing I'm going to say is, whether or not you have it, you should see a professional. Only they will be able to help you and start the long healing process towards mental health, whatever your diagnosis may be. 

The next thing I want to say is, don't fall prey to the idea that you are unwanted. As someone who is diagnosed and who had fucked up a lot of relationships, it's important to remember that you are loved. Let that sink in, you are loved. A lot of what you are feeling is your own mind trying to manipulate your situation and tell you that you are unloved. Another part is that mental illness allows you to forget that there is forgiveness and acceptance in this world. No matter what I've done to my family and certain friends (and I've done a lot), at the end of the day they forgive me because they only want me to be happy and secure and they want me to work towards feeling better. They understand that a lot of what I do is a part of my illness. I'm sure it is the same for you. 

And if it isn't, know that I care. I know that I am one person out of many, but I care deeply and I hope that you choose to stay with us. I hope that you choose to put in work to better yourself and one day come out the other side. I hope one day you can look back and think of this only as a rough patch...

One last thing, and this holds true not just for those with BPD, but for anyone with a serious mental illness. We can have serious, fulfilling relationships. We can be good partners. We can love and feel love just as much as anyone else, if not more. It may take more work, and you may have to spend some time alone to be healthy enough to get there, but it will be worth it.

Yes, sometimes she had made my life an absolute hell.  I've also learned so much, and I'm a better person for it.  I wouldn't trade it for anything, and I love her beyond words.  DBT and medication has helped her somewhat.  There is help, love, and a future, even with BPD.

Marsha Linehan developed a new kind of therapy to treat BPD. I did an intensive year-long dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) program and it changed my life. BPD is not a death sentence. 

I worked really hard to get where I am now, where for the most part I can regulate my emotions using a set of skills I learned through DBT. What I want to stress that it's okay if you don't have these skills now, you can learn them. I lot of what DBT teaches you is that you can tolerate your emotions, and no emotion is going to kill you.

You need an escape, weed and alcohol certainly are such things. I admit myself to being weed friendly, it's not the worst thing in the world.

Straight up, everything is a ""drug,"" in that a great many things are addictive. Think about it, everyone's got addictions. Drugs, gambling, over-eating, physical violence, adrenaline rushes, what have you. Consider it for a moment. Take stock of what these things achieve. Certainly, good can come from any of these things. Drugs gave us classic rock, gambling wins us lotteries, over-eating allowed us to buy ice cream in huge buckets, physical violence brought us Mortal Kombat, and adrenaline rushes are just plain fun.

Consider though, that a lot of addictive behavior can be destructive. In a situation like yours it is very effortless to find yourself resorting to destructive behaviors. But before you make that choice, consider who and what YOU are. Take stock of yourself, but try and do so with the best... I should say, perhaps from an outside perspective. You say your bi-polar, you say you're the problem. My personal view on life is that there are no such things as labels we apply to ourselves or are put on us. There are no ""mental conditions"" just massive amounts of organic adaptations and evolution. What's normal is what we accept as bi-polar. In my world, neither you nor me are bi-polar, we're just different. Also in my world, there are no problem children. As I put it, the kids are aight. 'Cause for reals, they is.

You're kind of not a child anymore. At sixteen, you're still a developing human being, to be sure. People don't mature at the same rate. But you're around that age where you got to think about a lot of things. Now is not the time for doing, you've got the rest of your life ahead of you in which to be doing things. Nows the time to consider what you could be doing in that time.

Nobody wants to be sad, nobody wants to be lonely, or angry, or full of sorrow. Nobody wants that for their whole life, people in general just want to be happy.

I dunno who you are, I'm not going to pretend. What I know is you need an escape. What I'm saying is let that escape be something that is, at the very least, not destructive. Productive? That might be a bit much at this point. Right now it's more simply you gotta stop hurting yourself more than you have to. You're hurt and being hurt, to be sure. But you can't control other people. I can't control you, I can only do my best to persuade. Hopefully, to the ends of you not hurting yourself.

When I was your age, what helped me was putting my head into headphones. Music is addictive as all heck. Destructive? Yeah, actually. Doing that was destructive, I don't here none to good no more. But at least I wasn't drinking and winding up like everyone else around me who does drink. Is that what you should do? No, only you can decide what your escape is because only you know what it's going to do for you.

If you are a goddmnnerd though, you have a plethora of hobbies to choose from. I never played D&D myself, but that's 'cause I was the type of nerd who didn't have any friends.

That's my two cents. Stay strong in the struggle.",zombicidal,e26xn

4,"Well don't kill yourself, that is the easy way out, and there is so much more to life than dealing with your parents.  The least you can do is stop the drinking, and slow down on the weed.  The best thing you can do be with your friends, and if you kill yourself you are going to hurt them really bad and your siblings and your parents and all the other people that love you.  Get pro active, join some sports program, speech and debate classes, do art, do something, depression is never a good thing.  Talk to your teachers at school, I know they are your teachers and suppose to be evil but I bet there is at least one that is willing to listen to you and help you work things out.  It is hard being 16, life sometimes does not seem to work with you, hell I am 27 and life still doesn't seem to work with me.  I have dealt with my own emotional shit and have considered killing myself on a few occasions.  I had a step dad that beat and abused me from the ages of 9 until about 3 years ago, I finally stood up to him and man did that feel so good.  I now make more money than him and my mother combined.  But he was not a bad man, he just need to talked to like man.  And yes there was some crying involved.  But any how life gets better, and it is what you make it.  You need to find your happy place and go there, mine was fishing on the river bottom.  Don't let drugs and alcohol be your happy place because that will only make you even more depressed.  And if you feel that your parents are getting out of control then leave, you are 16, but be warned, going to a halfway house is not fun, and quitting school will only make things worse for you. Stick it out for two more years, goto college and enjoy life.  And yes you can go to college, I am 54,000 in debt and it was worth every penny.  So cheer up, put down the joint and the shot glass and put on a happy face, do what your parents ask of you and go something constructive.  And talk to someone that is local that can help, and tell your mom to stop hitting you. ",Just_brew,e26xn
5,"If you are still going to school I would strongly recommend talking to some one you trust there be it a teacher or counselor or administrator.

6,"I'm so sorry you have to deal with that. I'm 31 and had a rough scenario but was fortunate enough to be kidnapped by my father. at least that's what the law would have said...there's a lot back story but I essentially asked him to please take me away from as early as I could speak and finally he did when I was 3. 

That being said I had to grow up with the horrors in my dreams of what I remembered growing up with. My mom would beat me and I vividly remembered it. My grandmother found a picture of me with iodine marks on my wrists and insides of my elbows. My mom said it due to mosquito bites. Her drugs of choice at the time were coke and speed and they said I woke up in a daze usually. Actually my father had to pay $5k a weekend to see me and if he went to the courts she was going to take me to Columbia.

I basically grew up very quickly and had to learn how to survive on my own. I tried to kill myself when I was 13 by turning to drugs and alcohol. My father and closest family member died when I was 21. he was 46. That was actually the last nail in the coffin for me regarding organized religion...not so much the well god has a plan shit as much as a family friend who was my father's C professor and a deacon at a church (dad was going back to school) ...asked if he could come over to console me...he came with some guy I didn't know and asked me a lot of personal questions that in retrospect seemed geared towards opening up my vulnerability. Then after an hour busted out with have you found jesus? that was the the nail in the coffin...right there...because I realized what was going on and said ""no..how did you lose? I thought he was nailed to a cross?"" sorry for the tangent...

I think you need to first go easy on the drugs on alcohol. I smoke pot pretty frequently and drink on occasion. When you're young they give you a lot of propaganda as to why it's not a good idea...I think it's not a good idea because you are depressed, dealing with hormones running wild and no concept on how to put them in perspective yet... and you're using depressants which only solve your problem on an immediate basis of providing an escape and numbing the pain. but tomorrow always comes... I see how you feel you have no other alternatives but clearly you are searching for one if you made this post. 

I want to point out that I'm a little high myself right now and I don't believe I'm qualified to give good advice. I'm a high school drop out, my business is falling apart and I have no idea what's going on with my marriage...with that said...

have you considered trying to talk to them seriously about the fact you feel like they are abusive and leading you to a destructive path instead of being the supportive parents that you feel they are not? 

maybe there's some miscommunication or they are taking out stress  undeservingly (that doesn't sound like a real word) on you. The economy is bad right now and everyone is freaking the fuck out...crime is getting higher people are worried about the future and we tend to forget the little things and the people around us ...if you have that many siblings maybe with the tough environment we all live in now they are finding it hard to coupe? maybe they need counseling...which is like trying to get a republican to admit he's really a homosexual...

I think if you allow them to continue to be this way it becomes a norm for their stress outlet or whatever it is that's going...and damages you long term. You should learn to stand up for yourself and be assertive especially with your parents. They should be there for you to help you succeed and find your way and pass down the knowledge and guidance to get you through these tough spots. not send down a darker path that could lead you to horrible mistakes.

It's also not kewl to be hit. If they are finding it ok to call you I think it's ok to call the police. because you have rights that no government or parent can take away from you. you have the right not be treated as substandard anyone let alone those that say they love you.

I'm not sure how much experience you have with doctors, but in my experience they get things wrong *a lot*. Like more than half the time. Just something to consider. I hope you are reading up on your diagnosis big time. It might take a few days, but you will probably know more about this illness than the doctors before too long. Don't be afraid to question *everything* they tell you.

Meanwhile, is the situation with the suicidal images in your head getting worse, or is it about the same as a week ago (your last post)? How much success do you have just moving the image aside and thinking about something else? I ask this because I think most people have pretty gruesome thoughts pop into their heads sometimes (with accompanying dialog suggesting nastiness), but that's just part of the thousands of images that pop up through the course of a day. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong, it just means you saw Friday the 13th when you were 9 because your sister's friends were having a sleepover and you were peeking into the living room through the heating register.

Watching YouTube is wonderful. Personally, I like the video subreddit to find new things to watch. Usually very high quality stuff. Of course, there is also Hulu to catch up on Family Guy, and Netflix to watch all 7 seasons of Buffy (as well as Angel). Sometimes you just have to ""check out"" and let your brain rot on TV (or TV-simulated experience).

But lets say worst case is that you are going to die in like two days (and you don't know it and can't control it). I mean, you are literally (definition 2) living the life of ""If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, what would you do?"" So do you want to spend it watching YouTube? If you say 'yes,' that's totally okay. Or would you rather spend it doing something else?

You seem to write pretty well. Got a short story in you (you'd better make it short, you could be dead any time)? How about learning a new piece of music (if you don't play an instrument, [spend $73 for a ukulele](http://www.amazon.com/Kala-Makala-MK-T-Tenor-Ukulele/dp/B001731R6A/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&qid=1376979106&sr=8-14&keywords=makala+ukulele) and through the miracle of YouTube, learn to play complete songs within a day!). Can you paint? Whip up some 5x7 portraits that make you really feel being alive. Now that would be irony!

But seriously, I'm not really suggesting that you need to do anything. I understand your feelings of being overwhelmed to the point of inaction. Believe me, I understand. Sometimes I'm able to get out of this funk myself by just doing something random that I really enjoy and haven't done in a long time. ",frisco3,1kptaz
2,"As I said, my illness is rare enough that it is not well diagnosed and would easily identify me. I know that it might kill me at any time because it almost did recently, and would have but for a fluke of luck. That part, at least, is very much not theoretical, not predicable, and not preventable.

The imagery is about the same as a week ago - which is to say, more or less everpresent. I'm hearing it now, I'm feeling it now. I have been all day that I have been conscious at all, which is to say not when asleep or exercising or the like. There's also just the pain - pure, mental pain with no source, no cause, no solution save for dissociation or drugs, neither of which is a road I want to go down (and hardly merit the term ""solution"" withal, being mere patches).

I have had no success in moving it aside. I can think of other things, but it stays in parallel. Some things make it go away briefly. I'm not yet sure what those are systemically, and it feels only like temporary quelling, not real relief.

Do I want to do other things? Yes, actually. I have a pretty major project that I have been trying to work on. My progress on it is crippingly, humiliatingly slow - entirely due to my depression. I can't focus on it, I can't work, I can't ... bring myself to come out of the malaise of passivity and get shit done. On the other hand, it's a project that will require a couple years of effort to blossom, and I don't honestly know I will be alive that long.

I do practice a musical instrument; it is some small solace, though I am just as often frustrated at my incompetence in it.

Even something as simple as organizing the mess of papers and envelopes on my desk feels too overwhelming to deal with. The project... it's big, but it has bite-sized steps. I can't blame that; it's clear what I need to do next, and it is totally within my professional skillset to accomplish.

Or it would be if I could spend more than a few hours a week doing something useful. :-/

My mental ability - and the professional skillsets tied to it - are pretty much my only value to the world. With that all crippled by depression and anxiety and inability to concentrate, I am doing nothing more than existing. That's no kind of life.


I've been thinking of whether to tell my girlfriend about this account. I've taken steps to make it untraceable - Tor, etc. I've told her some of what I'm going through, though not in this kind of vivid detail, and I'm afraid it would only hurt her to be have a more ... accurate image.

You're allowed to cry when you're sad, never let anyone tell you otherwise. Being strong doesn't mean you never fall, but you keep getting up. And as far as I can tell, you're doing amazing with that so far.  
Don't worry about still living with your parents. I know many people older than you who either still live with their parents or get the rent money from them (myself included).  
I broke my arm when I was still in school and I was shocked how thin it was when it came out of the cast. But it gets better pretty quickly. Just start slow, doing the regular daily things like holding cups or writing a few lines.  
I'm very sorry about your dog. My mother has a cat and she (the cat) is getting really old by now (14). I don't see her very often, but I still cry at the thought that she will die soon and I probably won't even be there for her. Max was very lucky to have you. Try and remember the good times with him.  
Can you talk about your suicidal thoughts with anyone? Your mother maybe? Or a professional? It's not good to keep them bottled up inside.

1,"i am sorry about your diagnosis.  BPD is scary, and I completely get why you would feel guilty about your actions.  The truth of the matter is you could not stop yourself.  But there is a bright side to this.  Now you know and now you can get help.  I'm not going to lie to you and say this will go away, but it may just become manageable.  It's not the same but I have PTSD.  I can relate to your auto-pilot mode quite a bit.  I've done things I regret because of it.  I wan't so badly to help you.

2,"Don't lose hope! You can do something about it. 

There is an effective treatment for BPD that has been empirically supported with research spanning over 20 years. I have used it with success on a number of clients, but in order for it to work it takes dedication to learning and practicing the material. You've lived most of your life this way, and it will take awhile to unlearn your unhealthy patterns. The treatment is called Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)...and it works. 

Here is a link to find resources in your area. 

http://www.behavioraltech.com/resources/crd.cfm

The most effective treatment is to have a skills training group and individual therapy, but one or the other is better than none at all! I can answer more questions for you if you like, but do some research about DBT and I believe you will find hope. ",drummer9,e3tiv
3,"What's wrong with the psychology  profession is that they can 'diagnose' you with a disorder and then it sticks with you for life. Trust me, they don't know everything, and if you believe what they say, you'll find yourself in a hole that you cannot dig yourself out of.

Maybe some of this will help you:

The book that turned my life around, not even exaggerating: Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz.

You are a redditor, you should be able to find it online..wink wink ;)

The main thing is CHANGE, everything sucks now, cuz it's the same, you've gotta change something, anything, or everything. It's the only way out.

On another note, exercise is proven to increase the happy chemicals in your brain, just start some sort of light workout routine, walk around the park, do push ups and sit ups.

The other thing that helps me is the realization that no matter how bad it gets, I know things will look up eventually. I have this sort of motto that I've kind of lived by since I was like 16. ""Nothing Lasts"" At first it sounds depressing right?

Well, yea, it might seem that way, but when you really think about it, it's kinda awesome. Nothing good is going to last forever and nothing bad will either. It just means that everything is always changing, and the best way to get out of a bad situation is to change something, anything will do. Your depression won't last as long as you change something!

There are tons of places that offer a first yoga class for free. Even if you've never done it before, it's pretty cool. Or, some colleges offer free classes for anyone.

Also, you should check out some new music, youtube is actually awesome for this very purpose. I find that when I'm feeling down, listening to some death metal gives me a vicarious release and I feel better!

I don't know if there is anyone who is 'truly happy', it's more of a state of mind than anything else. We have to constantly reevaluate and readjust ourselves to the world in order to stay in that state of mind, it's hard and you will fail from time to time, but it will get better, with change.

For me, it's all about curiosity...We are all going to die eventually, why not stick around and see what happens next? There is a pretty big world out there, the problem is that we get stuck in these little boxes and we think we cannot escape. So you've got to change something in your life, find something new to experience, then life will be interesting and maybe you'll get your curiosity back again :)

It's a lot of work but you can make this better. You've overcome one of the biggest obstacles people with BPD have: You've accepted the diagnosis. You really don't need to kill yourself. You can make it better.

I'll add this: Of the girls who I was with that had this and did the most damage to me, -I do not hate her. In fact I still love her and think of her all the time.

But just over the guard rail, past the dead end sign, through the thick, dark woods is a neighborhood of people who are experiencing similar obstacles, and those people have no one to talk to, they have nowhere to turn.

It isn't until the person who has reached the ""dead end"" but hasn't given up, the person who sees the guard rail but steps over it and pushes forward into the vulnerable, and the unknown, the uncharted and the uncomfortable, that those future, alone and tormented others, can find a friendly ear, an understanding face, a friend in the trenches.

The dead end is an illusion the illness wants you to believe. Push past this moment, get more vulnerable and ask for more help. There are people out there who can help. And someday, when you make it through the dark woods, you'll be the one to help others who are staring at their own imagined dead ends.

25,"Sounds to me like you're asexual with anxiety that's giving you the idea that you're a pedophile. Just like my anxiety gives me the idea that I'm a horrible abusive person (but my friends would say, no she's just kind of weird and flighty and detached, not even close to evil) yours has given you a delusion.

Don't look up abusive images (that keeps the abuse alive). Maybe you'll find someone who has the fetish of dressing up or wearing diapers, that's a whole thing in the fetish community, roleplaying children. With an adult pretending to be childlike, it is completely legal. And, with the inside of your brain, you can fantasize about anything. If you're satisfied to wank for the rest of your life, who cares what makes it go?

You're not dangerous, you're not plotting to kidnap and murder a child. Just don't put yourself in places where you're alone with children or around lots of children, live an adult centric lifestyle doing things that kids aren't drawn to, like, eh, drive a bike cross-country or something. You say you like living life, great, keep doing the adult-centric things you love, and just stay away from real kids if you're at all worried you'll hurt them. It doesn't sound like you're anywhere near being a person who might hurt kids yet, just someone who has some gross masturbation choices to contend with. You should only kill yourself if you're like ""it's this or I kidnap, rape, and murder a child who I've picked out""... which, well, you're not even close to being at that level, you describe yourself as having wanked to a cartoon image of a child, which I think is still kinda gross but not worth murdering yourself over. You didn't even rip open the past abuse of some other victim for your own entertainment.

I've thought about gross things. I saw a gif once of someone with a split penis and I wanked to the thought of that. I can never unsee it. It horrifies me to this day that I saw that and was like, ""hey this is kind of hot""... so I use it as my favorite example of ""mistakes made while masturbating"". Yours was an illegal mistake, not some kind of messed up body modification horror. Let me stress, though, you can think about whatever you want. So long as your fetish never touches anything other than a consenting adult, you can do whatever you want. If it stays in your brain, it's with a consenting adult. If it's an adult dressed up, it's fine.

&#x200B;

If it's a drawing... ehhh I think that's starting to get into questionable territory and you shouldn't do that, I think you'd get in trouble if you crossed country borders and were caught with anime children pictures obviously intended for personal private enjoyment... but then there are plenty of people who draw child-like images of adult characters, that are not technically of children but embody the things you might find sexual about teenagers. And there is chibi art, which is distorted in a way that makes it very hard to tell the difference between a child and an adult character. I don't know the graphic detail of the image you looked up for the purpose. I do know that child abuse drawings are illegal in my country, Canada... but what if you just looked up Luke Skywalker in a baby costume?

Look, man, I agree it's gross what exists in your head and you should never offend, ever, and if you do many people would agree you deserve to die. You haven't yet. You're just fucked up inside. TONS of people are fucked up inside. That's no reason for you to give up everything you love about life as an adult. Stay away from kids. Make it impossible for you to ever be alone with a kid. Find some other freaky person to roleplay as littles or just never have sex, whatever, tons of people will never have sex. You describe yourself as basically asexual, though, so I feel like you might be okay if you just yank the chain all by yourself for the rest of your life. There's other forms of partnerships and friendships you can form which will never involve sex in any way, and those are worth living for. Stay here for your potential writing buddy, your potential barbeque pal, your potential sangria sundays, your new career as a DJ, your cross country motorcycle tour, your bull riding tournament, your child free adult fun events of the future.

Yeah, you'll carry the demon forever if it's true, but whatever, sex is something that's fun but unnecessary to get the most fun out of life. Unless you wanted a family, there's so much more you can do without kids in your way. Tons of people are electing to be childfree these days, so it's not something to feel bad about; the world is heavily populated, you need not have any guilt about not contributing. The best way to protect a child if you're indeed at higher risk of offending is to not have one who lives with you and trusts you and loves you. Grim, but if you stay a bachelor or at least, with a childfree partner, you'll have far less of a chance to ever hurt a child and you can keep doing the things in life you love without having to set them aside to care for the needs of a vulnerable person you know you might hurt.",Metruis,fzu0jt

You called yourself a pedophile and acknowledged it. That's brave. 

Statistically, people in your position tend to be white men in their late teens, early 20's. Usually a pretty good childhood. They're smart, too. Above average and often well educated. Downside is this type tends to have a higher attraction to kids, more so than the people who are ""contact offenders"". The upside is the online guys are a lot more pro-social and, because they know its not right,  they are actually less likely to act on it. This is not every online offender- its a very mixed bag.

43,"So glad to read your edit that you're going to look for more help.  According to Time magazine, there are only about 3000 therapists in the US who see convicted sex offenders.  I think these numbers are abysmal.  If we want to work on preventing these crimes, we need to help those people who are at the source.  That's why I've chosen people who suffer from pedophilia as my population when I graduate with my Masters in Counseling.  I was a victim of a pedophile and I have forgiven him, plus I have empathy for the fact that he didn't have access to help when he was a boy.  Not that it gives them an excuse but most pedophiles have been victims themselves.  They still know right from wrong so they can choose not to victimize but I'm sure it's difficult - just like me not drinking during hard times is difficult.  Here's the thing, according to what you wrote here, you haven't committed any crimes - you haven't looked up illegal pics and you haven't actually hurt a child.  Those are some really strong positives.  You clearly have empathy - that's the best quality I think a person can have.  Based on what you said about your OCD, it is hard for me to believe you are actually a pedophile because a lot of people with OCD have these torturous thoughts but don't actually feel that way.  Even if you know that children are what you are attracted to, that's not your fault.  What you can control is not committing a crime.  I really hope you don't stop taking your meds and I hope you stay on this earth with us.  I think your voice is important - when you come to a healthier place you can help educate the public on OCD and possibly pedophilia.  I would support that 100%.",edtheroach,fzu0jt

For me, it gradually crept into my mind. A seed was planted by someone saying something similar to 'dont trust him he looks like a pedo' when im not. After that  the anxiety took over and gradually fucked me, then decided to uppercut me as of recently. The root of my problem was anxiety. I still get major anxiety today about it, as i have a family already.

If you can manage your anxiety, you can beat this. You masturbating to a picture is you giving in to your thoughts and trying to get it over with, its only going to make you feel worse when your anxiety hits.

 I can tell you're a good person as you feel bad about it.  I'm keeping up  my hopes, but still fear it, thus im in the same predicament, the fear and the thoughts of killing myself. But ill tell you what, im a lot better than i was.

My anxiety revolves around what other people think if me also.(if they found out) Society, friends, and family.Ive always been a good guy, never hurt, steal, lie to anyone, and I've always had the fear of people finding out about my OCD. I've told my mother about it, she accepted me with open arms, it was a huge relief. So remember the people you love and who love you will always accept you and anyone outside of that can get fucked.

Im not attracted to kids, and feel bad about the thoughts, and i see that you do too. The thought of death before you hurt someone indicates to me that you are not.

I can assure you that if you fear of doing something to a child cause of your sexuallity you defenetly won't do anything.

Look at it this way, an avarage man who likes woman is not going to start randomly raping woman, especially not if he has a fear of doing these things.

These thought loops just exist cause of overworrying. Thoughts are not really you, they come and go, your intention is a lot more real and if your intention is not to hurt anyone than you won't do, especially if you are afraid of hurting anyone.

--- 
Fear that you may be a pedophile and continuously rationalising it continuously is clearly an intrusive thought. You need to be aware that it is an intrusive thought and you are not your intrusive thoughts. 

Take a step back away from your intrusive thought, let your anxiety subside by distracting yourself with something else. 

I know there are people saying that we shouldn't believe our intrusive thoughts. But as a fellow ocd sufferer, I understand that we are constantly doubting ourselves and it is difficult not to judge and conclude. Just do that when you are in a better state of mind, when your anxiety has fallen. 

Then try to look at the issue objectively from the perspective of an outsider. (E.g. 1. This person has intrusive thought A.  2. This person felt XYZ and performed action ABC. 3. So if I were to judge this person, what conclusion would I make, based on the facts of the case?) 

On a side note, I strongly recommend not to stop taking medication. I've been there , done that - trust me, it only makes the intrusive thoughts and anxiety harder to handle. (In fact, I had a relapse  previously.)

Anyway, back to the main topic - If you still conclude you are a pedophile after doing the above, it's okay, so long as you don't hurt any humans.

Even if they can't treat you from where they are, they probably have a ton of places to suggest that you might not be able to find easily on your own. 

Depending on your age, 4 hours is higher than avg. Especially if you say your sex drive is low.

Regarding the fear of offending, its really important you have empathy for any possible victims. It makes it a lot less likely you will act on it. 

Do not listen to some advice here suggesting you lean into questionable porn to avoid offending. It does NOT make you less likely to offend. It feeds the fantasy. Instead, managing depression/anxiety is great. Aversion therapy is pretty good and easy. You get fox urine and essentially smell it whenever a deviant fantasy starts to kick up. We LEARN sexual behavior- people are not born pedophiles. They also rarely want to be one. But you can work at negatively reinforcing it and try classical conditioning to try and reduce a favorable response. 

Also, we wary of support groups that are not professionally facilitated. They can become dangerous echo chambers. 

Suicide by someone who is actually being honest with themselves before they have a reason to be is tragic. I have dealt with the most prolific pedophiles who live and breathe for abusing kids and they live long lives.

He needs mental help, and because of how his attraction is vilified, he feels that killing himself would be a preferable alternative to getting that help.

147,"In my opinion and time dealing with the research, individuals, conferences, trainings, books, and the years of constant work with the offenders every day...etc- Orientation is what you're born with. People are not born attracted to shoes or going too far at parties with drunk people. Being interested in having sex with horses is not an orientation. Those are lack of understanding, caring and/or paraphelias. I'm actually offended you would compare pedophilia to the LGBTQ community. NAMBLA disagrees- but that as the only justification they've got to go on and its fucking weak. 

 There is a lot of controversy on what makes someone a pedophile so I can't expect everyone to agree. Any source you want is indeed subjective, so I won't bother trying too hard digging it up. Professionals don't agree on it. I just go with what I've seen. Sexual behavior is Pavlovian in my opinion. Orientation is not. Gender is not a specific condition. Its not a fetish. Once you're classically conditioned to have a sexual preference for children or dogs, however, you're unlikely to ever stop. 

I think citing sources on internet conversations in a suicide subreddit is obnoxious. Pretentious to ask. Pretentious to provide. But a good read is Predators by Anna Salter. She pioneered a lot of the early research, but its always changing.There is also a huge difference between juveniles and adults.

I was reluctant, but I did the full 6-month program and am now starting my second time through to reinforce things.  It's not a magic pill, but it can (and will) help you deal with life.

In my remote small town, we have an organization that gives DBT classes every week.  This makes me think there is probably a class near you somewhere.  There are 3 cycles: Interpersonal Effectiveness, Distress Tolerance, and Emotional Regulation.

Personally, I think almost EVERYONE could benefit from DBT.  Most of us didn't have perfect environments growing up and we didn't learn all the skills needed for a healthy life.  Being in a group that teaches you these skills and lets you practice them is really helpful.

1,"A lot of people picture depression as the typical, textbook experience.  Crying for no reason, comatose bed days, actively wanting to die.  Sure, sometimes depression looks like that.  But that's hardly the universal experience, and its arguably not even its most dangerous form.

For most people, depression starts one day when someone tells a joke, and you smile, but not with your eyes.  Like, you laugh because you know you were supposed to, and it \*is\* funny, but for some reason it just doesn't hit the same.

For a lot of people, depression means executive dysfunction.  Like, I know my room needs cleaned, and I know it would only take 5 minutes to get to an acceptable level, but I just... can't.  But for many people, depression doesn't mean executive dysfunction.  They see the problem, they fix the problem, it just didn't make them feel better.  I would argue this is more dangerous, because almost paradoxically, if you \*can't\* do anything, you still believe your life could be improved, even if you can't bring yourself to do it.  Maybe tomorrow you will.  There can be a lot of hope in that maybe.

The side of depression that isn't crying and dirty rooms is just... bland.  Things aren't bad, but nothing is good.  Your emotional range becomes a spectrum of beige colors.  Hell, you might even miss being sad, because at least that meant feeling \*something\*.  This side of depression means looking forward to a game/tv show/book release or whatever, and walking away from it after a few minutes, because it didn't bring you any happiness. If the things that you know should bring you joy, the things you've been looking forward to for months, don't do anything, what will?

If one is sticking around for the sake of others.. and just kinda waiting it out .. might as well use the time they are buying to experiment... lol.. i laugh but its kinda the least i can do... almost like a bucket list.. or an openness to different experiences . Not caring to be here has afforded some freedom.

22,"Have you considered working with a Coach? 

I‚Äôm a life coach / prof at a local community college and I have seen versions of this question before. Since each person has a distinctive path that led them there, I can‚Äôt exactly give you ‚ÄúOne-size-fits-all‚Äù advice, but here are a few of the things that have helped people I talk to:

‚Äîfind/use Curiosity/self-reflection: what might be contributing? What might help?
--find some goals. How might working toward something fun or exciting shift your thinking? 
--search your life memories like an alien watching your life on FF: Where we‚Äôre you happy? What made you happy? How can you add more of this or forms of this to your current life? Where were you motivated? How can you add more of that to your current life? 
‚Äîread more. No really. There are incredible books out there that have totally changed my life. I wonder which books might totally change yours. 
‚Äîgo get therapy or life coaching: nothing like hearing words come out of your mouth that you didn‚Äôt know were in your head to make you think differently. 
‚Äîsurround yourself with better thinkers and more positive minds. No really. Go to volunteer or to a support group or to a social group that does something you find fun. Don‚Äôt know what you like?
‚ÄîTake a Community College continuing education class for fun, like painting, writing, guitar, photoshop, acting‚Ä¶ there are SO MANY to pick and they‚Äôre like $50-100. 

There are plenty more but I‚Äôm hungry. :) 

Oh one last one:
‚Äîthe quality of the thoughts in your head are directly connected to the words you choose. Want better thoughts? Sometimes one way to start small shifts is use better words. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt picture a future where you‚Äôre happy‚Äù? Could become ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt picture a future where you‚Äôre happy yet.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWTF is the point‚Äù could become ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find a purpose.‚Äù See the difference? The first two are points.

I have found the following information to answer your question relating to your suicidal watch post. If you have any questions about lifestyle changes, coping with those lifestyle changes, diet changes, medications, etc please post here and I will answer them throughout the day. I am working under the supervision of my instructor, however, the education I give is not to replace that of your primary care instructor. I would like to ask a few questions. I noticed you edited your previous post and you stated that it was comforting to know other people feel this way too. How are you feeling since you have posted this? Have you been experiencing those same thoughts? How have you been coping with the diagnosis of Borderline personality disorder? Do you have a plan to hurt yourself? Having a better insight into your illness may help you understand why you feel the way you do. These individuals often have a fear of abandonment which makes them emotionally unstable and impulsive. ‚ÄúBorderline personality is associated with a higher rate of self-harm and suicidal behavior than the general public‚Äù (‚ÄúBorderline,‚Äù 2020). Just letting you know I am not a medical doctor, please follow the advice of your Primary Care Physician.

30,"You are certainly not alone, although I thought I was the ""only"" one for a while too. Thoughts have been in my head since I was a teenager. I finally brought it up to my therapist because I figured I should, but because it seemed so normal and routine to me, I was surprised at the severity of her reaction. I just thought this was normal. 

The way I've tried to describe it is that it is like playing a game and things just keep going wrong. You win sometimes but you lose enough that playing eventually stops being fun and starts being stressful. You keep playing because you have to, but in the back of your mind you have this comforting, worst-case scenario: you can always force quit the game and then all the stress, pain, and fear (and the world that caused the stress, pain, and fear) just won't exist anymore.

But if you poured that same salt into a river, everyone could still draw water from it.  It is the same with our hearts.  If you cultivate your compassion and understanding in each moment, your heart will become like a river.  You will be able to receive whatever is given to you and still be fresh and happy.  Nothing can poison such a heart.  Be patient with your strong emotions, embrace them, look deeply into them, and transform them into understanding and compassion.

What suicidal people say after the fact is inherently skewed because that question is usually being asked to people long after their attempt, meaning that they ended up continuing to live. So it's reasonable to assume that the portion of people that deeply regretted being found and still desperately wanted to die may not have stuck around long enough to be able to answer the question. Or that the portion of people who initially felt neutral or upset about being found and didn't attempt again out of fear or lack of drive later ended up finding happiness in life, so their brains retroactively altered their memories of how they felt to fit that narrative.

0,"I'll be honest with you. I'm significantly younger than your daughter. In fact, closer to your grandchildren in age. With that acknowledgment of my limitations in understanding the weight of your dilemma and the reality of parentage, I will do my best.

You mustn't ever agree to her plan or concede a lost battle. The stakes are too high here for a surrender. 

Sit her down with everyone that cares about her. Tell her that it's not her fault that she's this way. Rightly commend her for proceeding tirelessly until now with a decades-long effort to claim her life. Show her that she is completely mistaken to think that nobody wants her around. The evidence is just too strong against it.

Tell her that you're going to throw every remedy dreamt of by man at this thing. ECT, neurofeedback, Transcranial magnetic stimulation. Tell her that you are going to get her every week and take her to a place of worship. You and she needn't believe to feel the spirit. She will need it.

Explain to her that this war will never stop. She will fight until time drops her. This is how it has to be. This is how we are measured, and God is watching. Embrace her until your natural end with all the attachments of fierce love.

She will be ok. And you will as well. With compassion and respect, I am

2,"In the community info section of this sub, there is a talking tips guide which provides extremely good information on how to provide support to a suicidal person. Basically, to listen, to empathize, to give the person the feeling of being understood, only then can you give suggestions, if the person is not receptive to your suggestions, then go back to listening, showing empathy and let the person feel that she is being understood. This guide is written by some mods of this sub who are crisis hotline volunteers, using their experience and the research they have done. 

From what you have said, it seems to me like you are not listening or empathizing with her. Instead it seems to me that you are imposing your views on her. Even if your views are right, it doesn't help her. I think it must be exhausting for her to talk to someone who doesn't understand her, and it must be exhausting for you to tell her things which she is not receptive to.",SaucyVan,17t79fh
3,"For someone so young, you have an amazing capacity for empathy and compassion. 

We are all fighting for her, but she feels we‚Äôre fighting against her. The good thing is it‚Äôs not yet legal in our state. And, in the states where it is, the patient must be mentally competent. Any good psychiatrist would not consider her mentally competent.

Thank you for your insights. You‚Äôve given me hope.",Only-Ad7751,17t79fh

0,"In that situation, tell her to calm down and put down the knife.  Speak calmly and tell her what you‚Äôre arguing about is not important currently and tell her that you love her.  When not, ask her why she did that.  Also tell her that you love her and that she shouldn‚Äôt need to threaten you with her death.  Remind her you love her and try to help work through this together.  Also she might need a therapist.  Be gentle when mentioning that.  I‚Äôm not a therapist or counselor etc, but that‚Äôs my advice.",Alien760,1c8glj4
1,"Does she have a diagnosis?    Sounds possible borderline.   The suicidal gesture combined with what sounds like fear of abandoment where she kept saying you didn't love her.     

Dbt can help her with those impulses.    Even if she does not have borderline and just emotional person dbt can still help.   

If she meets 5 out of the 9 criteria with history possible she has bpd.

I often get told that my suicide attempts have been 'for attention' by psychiatrists because every mental health professional hates people with borderline.
