0,A lot of people with mental illnesses swear by micro dosing mushrooms.,SadieSadieSnakeyLady,pkn4xf
1,"Don't do it. Our emotional states are pretty volitile and I can tell you firsthand that it's very likely to turn into a bad trip, even if you have a perfect environment for it with supportive people.",,pkn4xf
2,"personally, I do a once weekly microdose of .25g, and it's been wonderful. been doing that for about 8 months or so. however, I've also graduated from DBT and have a pretty good handle on staying in control of my emotional state! only you can decide what's right for you. but if you're gonna microdose, start small, always use a scale, and work up slowly until you find the dose that works. r/microdosing is a great resource!",throwaway3084373,pkn4xf
3,"I didn't try psychedelics for ages because I assumed my volatile emotional states would lead to a bad trip but if anything it widens my window of tolerance so far that I always feel chill and playful when on mushrooms, LSD too.",heather_whisper,pkn4xf
4,"Personally, I’ve benefitted greatly from microdosing. I also feel much more “normal” on shrooms, even a full dose. I control my emotions much better on psychedelics, but I’m sure it isn’t the same for everyone.",More-Context-7182,pkn4xf
5,Micro dosing and one large dose a year  has helped my body so much.,Cubez,pkn4xf

8,"Not completely related but I watched a doc series on PBS and listened to an audiobook, both of which pulled the black shroud off of ECT, especially for depression. I felt the same way, a little bit hopeful that there are options left still and apparently a very effective option when it’s decided to be used.",perpetualstudy,pkn4xf
9,"The last two times I took mushrooms i ended up crying A LOT. I went to a really deep dark place and while that sounds awful and dangerous in hindsight I felt like the mushrooms really clarified my core insecurities and since then I've had a lot more compassion for myself and the way I've been reacting to things my whole life. But be careful and stay safe. While I was crying it was a really fucking low point for me, that classic bpd complete and utter despair. It did not feel good.",Fit_Definition176,pkn4xf

0,"You are completely justified. This isn’t something you just get over. Your mom and boyfriend are being awful. You will probably need a trauma therapist to help you work through this and reach a healthier place. You don’t just get over it, you work through it and reassure yourself that you’re going to be ok. 

I don’t know if your bf and mom are saying what they are because they can’t handle the trauma or because they are being heartless. 

None of what happened was your fault. None of it. You didn’t deserve it, it never should have happened. You may be able to find online support groups to help you validate your experience and feelings. Your trauma is real, your feelings matter, and you deserve support and healing.",Ghost-Music,j47cr9
1,"You are very justified. That is a very scary, very horrific thing to have happened. I wouldnt expect anyone to ""just get over it"". Its not like you lost a bracelet! You lost you! You lost those memories, probably some dignity, some trust in yourself, and some clothes.
 You should probably go to therapy for this if you are not already. Maybe couples therapy with your guy because it's not okay that he wouldn't listen to your feelings. I'm also diagnosed with BPD and I know how emotional you can be or how the rambling/ranting works, BUT my husband still listens because it helps me. It's not okay that he isnt supporting you emotionally when you need it. 
You should also set a boundary with yourself about going out with the friends drinking. Even though you are not drinking, you dont need the extra anxiety that being there puts you through. Hopefully your friends will be welcome to the idea of alternative activities. Maybe if it is was drinking at someone's place would have less anxiety and they could still drink. 
I'm extremely sorry this happened to you. You are 100% justified in your feelings. I hope the pain lessens.",ThisOneChick99,j47cr9
2,"I'm so sorry for your experience. I experienced something similar long ago. It is so hard to process and get through. 
You honestly need therapy. I know that's difficult and scary, but it is necessary. I tried to get through mine alone and just subdue it and everything turned out so much worse over thr years. 
There is a wonderful book ""thr body keeps the score"" that talks about things like this, and the end of it is techniques for overcoming. There are so many things you have to process and understand. It is difficult. 
Getting over it is kind of impossible. It changes you. Its terrifying and shameful. You have to process through those emotions and fears. 
You didn't deserve it even if you made poor choices. You did nothing to ""earn"" it. 
Your choices do not mean you have to continue living with it. You do not deserve punishment for it. You deserve to heal and improve.
It will take work but you can do it! Find people who support you and can talk about it or at least listen. A therapist is most important. Betterhelp is an online therapy tool that is a wonderful option. It has helped me immensely. 
Much love.",sydneychase,j47cr9
3,"That must be horrible. I can't relate with your unique survivor experience, but I can relate with the fear and sadness that comes with being a survivor. If this person uses judgmental statements like, ""get over it"" you can either express that is not helpful with no solutions or consider if they are healthy people to have in your circle.

I'm lucky to know some other folks with bpd (or bpd-adjacent) experiences, so I want to pass onto you what a friend said to me: take what works for you and leave the rest.

2,"I feel like it’s the soul-crushing emptiness behind the boredom that gets me. And my solution is to do meaningful things like volunteering that make me feel satisfied and fulfilled. Helping people, even just leaving nice comments could help. Or anything that really satisfies that itch without self harming. You’ve gotta experiment and find what that is. You could also try talking to AI psychologist about it before it gets to the point you wanna self harm: https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=Hpk0GozjACb3mtHeAaAMb0r9pcJGbzF317I_Ux_ALOA. They would keep you company and help you figure out what is leading to these feelings and this behaviour and what you can do about it. 

There’s also other feelings like anxiety and depressed thoughts, or unbearable thoughts about the trauma possibly mixed in there with the boredom. I think it’s the combination of all those really unbalanced thoughts and emotions at the same time that makes the boredom worse cause as soon as we don’t have something to distract us we focus on how bad we’re feeling inside.

0,"Gonna mostly ignore the unique formatting choices there. 

Addiction is an escape from reality and facing its limitations, including our own. It's the brains attempt to correct dysregulation which instead fuels more. It's an avoidance of the pressure of our own high ideals or sense of failure. It's an attempt to soothe dysregulated emotions, trauma and neglect. It occurs when mechanisms and drives intended for our survival, spiral out of our control and rewire out brain to the point it's nearly impossible to break. It's a brain that's been hijacked by supernormal stimulus or things that mimick the chemistry of its own neurotransmitters. It's certainly not a habit (but habits maintain it). It's a symptom of disconnection. A symptom of poor self-nurturance, physicallly, and emotionally. It's a way to live with self-hatred, internalised capitalism and shame. It's a disconnection from your true nature (spiritual or natural), and therefore your connection with reality, self, other beings and nature. It's an animal brain trying to cope and survive in a world that is no longer suitable for it. It's a misguided attempt to care for, and give ourselves love. It's a hijacked limbic system, and an already dysregulated and faulty one in the case of BPD. It's a complete impairment, and loss, of many executive functions. It's a brain thinking it needs your substance or behaviour of choice or else it may die. 

Carl Jung used to believe that only a profoundly spiritual kind of experience could lead to any meaningful, lasting recovery. 

Every single one of us is addicted in some way. Even to our noisy thoughts. 

Until we address each area I've just mentioned, nothing would change.",,tzlkn9
1,"I’ve had a chaotic relationship with stimulants and inhalants in my past, and now I’m just addicted to weed and caffeine.

2,"I have stayed sober in the program for years but, to your point, it was a struggle the whole damn way. I thought it was a personal failing until my recent BPD diagnosis. Now I see it wasn't necessarily the best thing to help me maintain in the long run, personally, but it certainly saved my ass and probably my life at the start. I wish I got clearer sooner that there were other things with which I needed help.
That said, all of my dearest friends came from the rooms, they are real ones even as I struggle again and still, and they truly get it.  So I wouldn't trade my time there. Also I like being sober and do think it's my best chance of making personal progress.

Spiritual is a loaded word that not everyone is drawn to or interested in, and Carl Jung is a controversial figure, but an influencial and significant contributor to several of these fields who can't be ignored. I also thought he was worth mentioning to make my list comprehensive.

I'd just say keep up with therapy at the same time. The program is sort of deliberately indoctrinating and I'm sure it save lives for some, but in my case I'm afraid it hindered my product a little because I believed if I was still struggled my program just wasn't strong enough, when in fact I now am of the mind that I needed some much more intensive help in therapy.

I am sure, that, if nothing else, there are some people there who will understand you and who you will understand. And it's a great space to practice skills learned in therapy.",bmcspillin,tzlkn9

Related(?) aside: recently, I read Fighting for Space by Travis Lupick, which was a very well-written and compelling recount of harm reduction activism in Vancouver from the early 00's to today.

I think, at a brain level, things like the rat-park model, neurological hijacking and neuroplastic changes are all occurring simultaneously, and all true in their own regards, all playing a role. In fact, I think most of the seemingly contradictory concepts out there all have more elements of truth in them than conflict. I await the day people realize that a poor environment, can cause a diseased brain, sustained by that same poor environment, but not then easily fixable by only addressing one. Putting the ideas at odds with each other is so counter-productive. It's like wondering why your plant is dying when you water it badly then trying to fix it by drowning it.

1,Predisposition to develop it. + just leaving the parents and getting adopted can lead to the child brain thinking it's being abandoned even if logically you understand the situation differently.

The biggest thing I personally needed at that age would have been compassion and understanding. A hug, someone to tell me they loved me and I wasn't alone, someone to say they cared. I'm not saying it would fix it but maybe just telling your daughter how worried you are and how much you care about her well being will help. 
I might also talk to the therapist and see about a joint session where you bring up concerns and have a professional to help mediate.
Also, mentioning she is still texting the ex and seeing if there's a suggestion on how to approach that because she is only hurting both of them and he deserves some space if that's what he needs.

1,"I second the idea of talking to a therapist. Try to find one with some experience with BPD or at least DBT. Discuss how to set clear and specific boundaries - having CLEAR rules that she can repeat back to you is very important, as is understanding what the consequences will be if she crosses a boundary.

A residential program might not be a bad idea, but do NOT just spring it on her. It will feel like a sudden betrayal, and that can be hard to erase even if/when therapy gets her to a healthier place.

I very strongly recommend looking up the SET-UP method of communication. S is support, E is empathy, and T is truth. And the truth might be that if certain behavior continues, then you will have to send her to a residential program. Right now, it also may just be that you're worried about her well-being.

BUT the S and the E are EXTREMELY important. It can be hard for us to hear the Truth without getting angry if we don't feel supported. Chapter 5 of I Hate You Don't Leave Me covers SET-UP, and one of the examples it gives feels like it could be a pretty good model for this situation (as well as examples of how to reinforce that S and E). But I imagine there are plenty of online resources as well.

This sounds like an extremely difficult situation, and I'm so sorry for both of you. She's likely going through hell, and especially at 16 probably doesn't really know what's going on or how to handle it. I certainly didn't.

BPD is treatable, and it sounds like you've already started in the right direction - DBT is one of if not the leading recommended therapy for BPD. I recommend learning some of the emotion regulation and distress tolerance skills yourself as well. She may not take kindly to you saying ""let's use a skill"" (I hate when my partner says that), but if you're able to help cue her to do part of a skill (""why don't I do some jumping jacks with you"") that might help get through the harder moments. You may have to force the issue, maybe give two options and she has to pick one. My partner has half-forced me into a cold shower before, and as much as I did not want to do it it absolutely helped.

It is a long and difficult journey, but having someone who is willing to support you in those moments is huge. It's also great that you're starting early - neural pathways are a bit less set than at a later age like 30 (when I started treatment).

I wish both of you the best of luck 💛",solidparallel,10gkwgl

I try to hug her (I usually get her mean face and she pulls away) so I'll just hug her arm briefly or kiss the top of her head. I'm trying so hard to be supportive and empathetic. It's really hard watching her life fall to pieces.
The DBT program is very structured and they do not offer more frequent visits. They also don't want her to get other therapy so as not to confuse her with possible contradictory methods. I will update her therapist about today's events. I agree that she needs to let her boyfriend go.

But it can get better. I was taken away from my home when I was 14, I was just like your daughter. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 18, and until that my life was utterly chaos. I'm still regretting much of the stuff I did. I often my felt like ""shooting the school"" as well and stuff, but as mess as I was, I would've never did something like that and I don't believe your daughter really means it either. (of course threats like that  still need to be taken seriously) 

I haven't been part of DBT therapy, but I know lot of ppl that have benefitted from it. Also mood stabilizers like SSRI and SNRI can help with the impulsivity (I'm still on venlafaxin and I don't  plan stopping them soon). 

I wish I could help more, but just know that there's light at the end of the tunnel and usually BDP will easen as we mature. I'm glad your daughter got her diagnosis, it can only get better from there. I'm 22 now and honestly when I was 16 I didn't think I would even be alive now.",mutkikas,10gkwgl
9,"if there are questions you have about her experience and her pain then the best person to ask is her. she knows her experience better than anyone. she can tell you how her pain is manifesting and what helps when she is experiencing pains intensity. it sounds like right now she’s managing her pain with self harm and substance use. that makes sense to me. rather than approaching it from an abstinence perspective, i might do some harm reduction. if she’s cutting, ask her if she’s using clean tools, how she knows she’s gone too far and needs medical assistance, etc. and then, if it was me, i’d ask her if she wants some extra support because no one deserves to experience this kind of pain alone. i think with our children it’s easy to get into a response that involves restriction, control and punishment. but in my experience, those kinds of responses are rarely, if ever, helpful.",,10gkwgl

33,"i can only speak for myself but peer support has been really helpful. finding people like myself who have felt and experienced similar things, people who can sit with me while i’m in pain and not respond with things like hospitalization or medication or treatment - have been helpful. if she is suicidal, you could look into the wildflower alliance alternatives to suicide support groups. 

non traditional supports like art and creative projects have been a helpful outlet for me as well. 

i wonder if she’s spent anytime thinking about what makes her feel safe and cared for. you could ask her about that directly and then see what you can to try to replicate that. 

i can tell that you care a lot and want what’s best for your child. if she can’t or doesn’t want to talk to you about what’s going on, allowing her to identify and access someone she does trust to talk through some of this with could be really impactful. i hope you’re taking care of yourself as well. it’s really hard to watch people we love struggle in pain.",,10gkwgl

If he's not giving you reasons to think he is cheating, not being even secretive with his phone, you're saying he's present for you and the kids... (No, being defensive about it even if you calmed down it's a normal reaction about feeling ""controlled"" over something small) 

In this case I think you need to process the feelings (take your time, try to think about it in a realistic way, journal about it, talk to your partner calmly about it when you're both in a good headspace, tell him why it's important, etc...) and just let go of them. Don't ruin your family that you're happy with just for a small trigger of your brain. Cheating ""back"" won't hurt anyone but you, and your kids in case things go down...)

Just because I'm afraid of bees doesn't mean every bee I encounter is going to sting me.  The fear makes me behave wild as if every bee was going to sting.  I still don't trust bees enough to hold them, but I can walk by knowing that every time I'm afraid one will sting me I know it probably won't.

The reality of the world is that cheaters are going to cheat.  You will find out about it someday and you will be sad move on with your life.   Or they are not cheating and you will move on with your life as well but together.

If you are really serious about seeing if he is cheating, save everyone the drama and hire a private investigator.  Otherwise, process the fear to calm it down so you can both work on having a good relationship.

My reasons may be different to yours but from what you said, you could be feeling this way because your internal voice is telling you that you don't deserve the love they give you and everyone else that cared about you gave up on you so they will too. It could a protective measure your brain is using to avoid rejection, if I reject them then I can't get hurt. I know I have done this to people in the past. The good news is that DBT can help you with your disorder and get you to feeling good about yourself. It can take a few years but it's worth it.

If you get into DBT they will help you with this sort of thing. And I don’t know how long you’ve been sober or if you’re receiving targeted therapy regarding the drug abuse (that would be good) but keep in mind that drug abuse messes with your emotions.

From the way you write i’m guessing you’re in your teens or very early 20’s. A lot of what you’re both experiencing sounds to be the sort of stuff that comes with figuring out how to handle your own package of personality traits. It’s really good that you’re focusing on the communication aspect, but both people have to communicate for it to work. Both people have to be willing to work on it for therapy to work, too. 

My advice is genuinely that you both seek out treatment. Maybe you doing so will make it easier for her to do it too. You can suggest all day though, but you can’t make her do anything. If she continues to turn down the idea of therapy, it may be time to ask yourself how much work you should do for someone who won’t do the same work - but that’s down the line and for you to decide if it’s ever relevant.

3,"I think whether you ""should"" or not depends on what it means for you. For instance, are you (even deep down) hoping that they will respond? Or are you truly wanting to send them happy tidings - without getting anything in return? 

If the former, then i think it's in your best interest to abstain. Likewise, even if it's the latter, my opinion is that it's in your best interest to show yourself that you don't need to reach out. HOWEVER, it is your life and it's up to you what you do with it. If you really want to reach out to them, I would suggest sitting and thinking on the question of why you want to reach out to them (why is it important to you?). 

It's primarily about lessening your negative impact on yourself, and it's ultimately up to you what that means. My vote is to not reach out, but my vote doesn't matter, only yours does ♡

PS 
Anytime you find yourself using ""should"", recognize that you're placing expectation/judgment.

That being said, it doesn't mean that you are not suffering from a _psychotic illness_ such as schizophrenia! **People who have schizophrenia are not constantly in a psychosis.** My sister who suffered from it her entire life, mainly knew that what she saw was not real. Outside of psychosis of course. 

While BPD is known to have micropsychotic episodes, they typically do not last for months, they're typically measured in minutes. At least I have never heard of BPD hallucinations, despite having worked in psychiatric wards as a nurse, treating fellow BPD's.",Melthiela,13uhugc

1,"Congratulations on your progress! I watched Dr.Fox’s YouTube video on families with BPD patient and this is normal for someone to try to (unconsciously) drag you back to the old pattern because they are familiar of how the family system used to work (some of the family are indeed the source of the person’s BPD, some are not). Sometimes in an unhealthy family system there is power struggle in it, when the vulnerable member becomes better, the other may feel they lose powers, then they will use “jokes” to provoke the vulnerable member to regain the power. You can tell them not to mention it and set a boundary on that, and if they continue to do the same thing, get away from it. Most of pwBPD’s family is not validating in the first place, hence the development of BPD. Don’t let the guilt consume you. Remember you progress and celebrate your own victory!",cad0420,zt24wy
2,"First off good job on the progress. 

2nd, you don't sound quite as self aware as you think you are. You may be making progress but it has been a very short time since you weren't doing well, despite likely feeling much longer for you. People likely still feel VERY uncomfortable about it, hence their bringing it up. Or maybe they just suck, I cannot say, but thats always the less common answer in my experience. No one here knows as we don't know exactly what your interactions look like or how you are behaving.

I think it'll still be a couple of years before you can TRULY understand how the others feel at the moment, and I say that from personal experience. You'll keep making progress and you'll keep learning/understanding and you'll see more and more nuance to how you made them feel.

Part of being self aware is complete acceptance of your own actions AND how they come across to the world/make others feel. That includes your actions during the episode AND now. You will get there, but as I already pointed out, it still hasn't been that long so no worries if you can't get over the guilty feelings stage yet (which really needs to end before you can properly consider the reactions of others). 

But in the meantime, you should try not judge yourself for the guilt you feel from your actions, and any self-soothing actions as a result of that guilt, right? 

And at the same time, try not to judge others too harshly for how they feel or how they are dealing with the uncomfortableness either. I doubt any if them are experts, and most people just aren't equipped to deal with someone they know having phychotic episodes, and that's ok. 

In the end, you have to accept that not everyone will be able to handle you in the exact way you want. And that's all ok, cause you're still making progress and that's all that matters. :)

Edit: made some changes throughout to better get the idea across and be more sensitive.",,zt24wy

When it does come up it usually is in a sense to tear me down or use it against or in a joking manner that is hurtful. They don’t mention what I have done to them but rather how my actions back then were outlandish. I wasn’t aware I was mentally ill and I was not recieving any kind of support professionally or others. I am trying to move on and do better things for myself and others but nobody is mentioning the good things i have done for them since, only the bad things i have done for a brief period of time.

If I would be able to go back and change that I would, however in my defence I did act out bc I was dealing with emotional/ mental and physical abuse from them so I made sure to destroy them as much they have done to me. I have never hurt anybody that hasn’t hurt me first to begin with. I have forgave them bc they changed and I wouldn’t bring up what they did before so I thought it was fair for them to do the same. I agree with you that I still need time to change how others see me and I struggle with self-esteem as I get mainly validation from others. I am not judging them, I understand where their concern is but I am trying to move past what happened and would like for them to be a little more supportive rather than tearing me down. It serves for me as a reminder that “no matter what you do, nobody will ever forget about your mistakes and nobody would ever think of you as a person of value” i would like to thank you for taking time out of your day, your honesty and not trying to sugar coat things for me because that helps me put things into prespective.

0,"For me it was a brutal breakup, and I mean BRUTAL. For three years I thought things were going great, but the truth is that she was just afraid of criticising me and when she finally ended things, she did me the courtesy of telling me exactly why. She told me how my behaviour ruined her, how scared she was every day of my outbursts and dependence on her. Honestly I didn't think I would survive that and find the will to keep on living, but somehow I did. And I also realised I never ever want to abuse someone like that again, not in a relationship or in any other way. At first because I dislike want to be left again, but eventually because I just didn't want to be that person who hurts others. Today she remains one of my best friends, and she can vouch for me when I say I am a different person now in many ways.

That was years ago, and it's only now that I realise that there isn't necessarily ""one big low-point"" that fixes everything afterwards. Because I feel like I later hit a different low-point, which was becoming a full-blown stoner and nearly ruining my life in that way. After that went on for a few years, and I realised once again that I am not the person I want to be. Although I'm no longer necessarily hurting others with my BPD, I'm now directing everything inwards and thus ruining my own life. I no longer had anyone to blame but myself, but that also meant it's up to me to change things. So now I'm working on fixing my habits and setting goals for myself so I have something to live for that isn't a relationship or a physical thing.

I think my point is that you always find new things you need to work on with yourself, healing isn't a journey that has an end stop and then your life is forever wonderful with no bad weeks and no pain.

And that is a good thing, despite what it might seem.

We are prone to black/white thinking, and that also extends to the concept of being ""cured"". You can be 90% free of symptoms and still have bad weeks, but that doesn't mean you haven't healed. And if you always go around thinking that you aren't healed and happy until you feel good 100% of the time, then you will always feel like you're mentally sick even though the truth might be that you are way better than you were 5 years ago. 

You seem to have a lot of insight on the things you want to change in your life, and that is the most important quality you can have imo. Most people just generally feel unhappy and don't always know why, but when you know you also get to pinpoint what needs to change. 

And I feel you when you say that you feel like maybe you were expecting too much or that your life feels wasted.  But you're only 30, there is still so much time to get your life to a place you want and now you have much more experience to tackle life's ups and downs. Many people say that their 30s was when they really found out who they were and started living the life they wanted, without the added pressure of ""omg I'm in my twenties and I should be doing this and that and having a blast all the time"". In all fairness, maybe you were expecting too much, because we're fed this unrealistic idea of how life should be and what happiness looks like. I hope that you continue to try and see what that means for you and that you use your strength to persevere, as you have done for so long now. The fact that you're still here, asking how you can improve your life shows me that you have what it takes to make that happen ❤️

I hope I didn't ramble too much or made this a sappy, confusing mess. And at the risk of being cliche - I hope what you really take from this that it isn't too late for you to live a fulfilling life worth waking up for every day ❤️",finickyfingerpaint,z32l0b
1,"Hi, I really feel for you and the way you described your experience, especially feeling like a big bucket of wasted potential.  I feel like when my worst symptoms started emerging every hour of every day, that's when the tides turned in favour of my desire and capability to improve my mental health.  Fury just a hair's breadth awaay when i live a peaceful life, I was genuinely concerned it would result in a physical altercation.  Then other symptoms poppped up and life was exhausting and scary.  

Taking this on in waves was helpful.  First and foremost I had to draw big, thick boundaries around myself and cut off most of my family.  They happened to be part of why I have BPD, and they have done nothing but continue to violate my boundries to the present day, I'm almost 50 and they've just gotten worse over the years.  It's just sad.

Then it was waves of medical help, therapy, and clearing my assumptions ab out what I thought my life needed to look like, and implement goals for fitness.  I used to be a couch potato, now I'm a couch potato who works out six days a week because it helps my mental health.  I've injured myself a lot in the past by pushing myself too hard physically, as a result my left shoulder and knee are gimped out and get rehabilitation exercises each day.  

It's a long row to hoe, but the goal is searching for healing and pursuing recovery.  Right now I'm struggling

TW: food and w issues
with focus and motivation a bit because I've made all these changes for the betterment of my overall health, but the number of the scale is not going down, which makes me feel like a failure.

0,"Why aren't you on an acutal mood stabiliser? That's kind of the first thing for bipolar. You can't get those mood cycles under control without them. It's a chemical issue. I've never known a doctor to let anyone with a drug addiction have valium, because it's also addictive. 

I find both of my disorders cycle, and I seem to cycle with my best friend who's bipolar and lives on the other side of Australia. Looking at my facebook memories shows I seem to struggle with the same symptoms at the same time each year, but I forget until it's happening. I really struggle with emotional permanence.

I'd never call anyone a dickhead for getting addicted to anything. I've been addicted to self harm for over half my life. I know I'd end up addicted to booze/drugs so I've never tried drugs and rarely ever drink. Never went through the 'typical' teenage alcoholic stage either. 

Are you in therapy? I know in a lot of places (US especially) it's either too expensive or just not accessible, but it's something to at least try.

4,"Because they wont take my bipolar seriously, my doctor is the only one who does but the last psychiatrist i saw was actually atrocious. He just kept asking me about current events and blaming my moods on those and comparing how i was feeling to him getting over a cold. WTF?! 

They like to throw the term 'Personality Disorder' at patients in the UK because its cheaper for them because they often wont or cant put you into the therapy you need and BPD technically cant be medicated, just the symptoms and that can interfere with bettering yourself with therapy and management of emotions, often because you are an addict or suffering from something else that gets in the way they refuse you treatment. BPD cases are often seen as lost causes because it cant be fixed with a pill, needs hours of psychotherapy to rewrite the negative habitual thought patterns that cause the symptoms and they just dont have the resources, understanding or patience. Not all of the UK is like that but unfortunately i moved to a city thinking that i would get better mental health care but turns out im in one of the parts of the country that has the least funding in regards to mental health. When i moved here from my old town i was supposed to get a direct transfer for care and it took 9 months and i had to start all over again after 3 years of actually getting somewhere. Sounds stupid of me leaving but i just assumed - city - better care...

Little background for anyone that doesn't live in the UK, our NHS is separated into physical healthcare and then the Community Mental Health Team. Each county has different funding for CMHT but they are literally scraping the barrel everywhere. I've been in and out of therapy for 5/6 years now. Only once consistently really which was 18 sessions one on one with a psychologist and he was helping me work through current issues (and at the time i was going through rehabilitation as well). Unfortunately he had to leave and then after not doing drugs habitually for nearly 8 months it started to become quite obvious to me that i had been having these cycles for years and even though drug use affected it the root wasn't addiction (that was just a bi-product). So i was left like half helped because it had taken a long time for him to breakdown my walls and then he left.

I've lived with all this stuff since i was 10 and im quite well read on a lot of conditions, i fucking hate labels but they do help you understand the care you need to pursue. When i first got the BPD one it really helped as id just come out a savage relationship and my main symptoms were 100% personality disorder at that point. That was 6 years ago and i haven't been in a relationship since so now the symptoms are still there but you notice what else is going on. It was actually only recently when i started doing more research into other things that my keyworkers had pointed out that Trauma was a massive part of my mental make up and i was compartmentalising all my shit and not dealing with it.

No psychiatrist likes it when you go in and tell them whats wrong with yourself... and thats what i did recently lol. The thing is im not stupid i do research from every single point of view and when i was really young (up until now) i cared for my mum who had quite severe Bipolar among other things so i knew what it was, how it manifests, triggers etc.. I knew her having it and being brought up by her alone meant it was likely it could manifest one day but i always thought Bipolar 2 because im nearly always depressed. It was actually when i stumbled across some American research (written by physicians for advice to other physicians) regarding their approach to both Bipolar & BPD and how they can be synergetic in the right scenario, or trigger each other. Say if we are looking at BPD as a product of nurture, being around negative things at a young age and being buried into your subconscious so we re-enact them over & over again! And Bipolar being genetic but often masked by the severity of BPD symptoms, it gets overlooked. Another thing that was interesting is they were saying that Bipolar can sit in the background and not properly manifest till you're quite a bit older. Or it can still fuck with you but sitting secondary to BPD almost waiting for the 'right' time. The big realisation for me is i always thought i was an introvert but could also be massively extrovert at times (or manic as i now realised). I would become hyper productive and get really elated and almost high off of what i would be doing... and then crash and just let it all burn! I just thought that was how i was, always had been and i just got really depressed because i couldnt continue a steady flow of productivity, just a personality flaw. Also pushed a lot of good friends away when i was younger for no explanation, best friends just ghosted me one day.. But i realise now (as its happened again and again) its because im fucking hard work when im manic...

I'd never heard of comorbid disorders before reading this american research and also the statistics surrounding them were new to me as well... It was interesting to read it from the other side of the pond as in America more people get diagnosed with a type of Bipolar over BPD, where as in the UK its the opposite. I've always known i had more than one thing wrong but i was always told it was 'a symptom of my bpd', but i knew there was a chemical imbalance (especially when the drugs were out of the picture). Reading about how likely it is that if you have either bpd or bipolar they can trigger one another. I kinda then realised that my BPD didnt come first, it manifested itself fully during a really negative relationship, working 40+hours a week and 16 hours college. I had a massive breakdown, got hard into Benzodiazepines and other drugs again, got my first proper mental health diagnosis, got diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and then relationship shattered. All leading into a 3/4 year identity crisis, which is when i first managed to get properly engaged with the Mental Health team & all these recent things became the main focus of any therapy i received. (Sorry this is so long) Anyway i moved away to try and get better help and be closer to some people and more culture etc. But just went round in one massive circle just to realise i was a shit load worse off where i moved to (apart from the place, its awesome haha) because of serious strain on the system.

But 3 years later i now have a doctor who believes me and a psychiatrist who doesn't (and is a condescending prick), always ends his sentences in '...James mate', so unprofessional. But I need the psychiatrist so my doctor can prescribe the medication ffs. Seriously its all jumping through hoops in the UK, unless you end up in hospital from harming yourself or become threatening towards other people they don't do fuck all and even then we have no room for inpatients.

But... I have actually found a medication that i think will help me and its an a-typical anti-depressent so my doctor will be able to prescribe that (hopefully).. For anyone who is interested this is the one i found, Bupropion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion) (If anyone has any experience id really like to hear). I've always been dead against prescription meds (yeah i know valium, ill get to that). Tried multiple SSRI's, anti-psychotics and gabapentinoids. This is apparently a medication that is given to people who dont react well with first line defence anti-depressents like a lot of the SSRI's like fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline bla bla bla... Reading into this one though it sounds mildly promising, weirdest thing is its related to cathinones!?

Anyway i was addicted to valium, was having withdrawals as couldn't get them all the time went to my doctor and she put them on a weekly prescription which i have slowly been decreasing. When i first went to the doctor i was taking up to 100mg a day but she prescribed me 50mg and im now down to 20mg, the very hardest bit left to go - evil things.

Its weird you say about cycling the same time as your friend as i have the same thing with my mum, not exactly the same as i rapid cycle quite a lot but always around placement of the moon weirdly enough. We always know when each other are down and she also lives not as far as Australia but far enough away. 

Sorry this is so long, i kinda just felt like i needed to write it out to read it.. There's so much in there thats useless 😬 One thing to take away from it is the NHS is failing hard when it comes to mental health, to the point where they don't like to diagnose if you're a non-psychotic patient as its one more to care for. Don't get me wrong i've had some amazing bits of care and advice but in all honesty CGL (Change, Grow, Live) the substance abuse trust have helped me more with my mental health than anyone else here ever has.. And the NHS have started taking advantage of that by pushing anyone they can over there and overloading them. Politics and healthcare! Yaaaaaaay...

Anyway so yeah gonna ask to try that medication, its not a mood stabiliser but it is used for major depressive disorder and doesnt carry with it the shitty effects of SSRI's apparently so fingers crossed 🤞🏻

Since the day people evolved into a hierarchy we have fillled themselves full of greed full of greed to the destruction of the fundamentals of right and wrong, lacking empathy & understanding. How could we not only exploit the system that gave us life, consciousness ffs and beyond our, fellow people, animals, eco systems, diverse cultues and ideologies and have become more and more content with causing pain, force and destruction to prevent the preventative... So do 'proper meds prevent living creatures that give life to more of the eco system than they destroy - imo only when done in a holistic manner. The true meaning of proper medication, a lot of doctors, surgeons, psych professionals may never of heard of and these are the once that have been deemed as the substances we 'continue to fight on a daily basis in 50+ year on drugs'. Half of which we created to concentrate something or created from a bunch of natural elements which can have ungodly effects on the mind, the body, the soul, the EGO probably being one of the biggest and GAIA. I left (ish) this bit for last because life is a battle between instinct and ego and ego in a world such as we live in tends to gain our attention more... Like i say i have deep rooted beliefs that i don't personally think are offensive unless you feel some one might feel threatened, but that tends te be ego when looked at it from aa non-obective state. Ego trying to make sense of a really confusing place we have been brought into. People, hide, lie, cheat, kill, steal & justify everyday.. Especially when we struggle mentally or with addiction and then anything physical wrong with a loved one or yourself or your celestial home that we can see but cant have an opinion on without fact which is often based upon theory - cant build a house from a cracked foundation 🤷🏻‍♂️

5,"Wow congratulations!!!! Law is indeed such a conservative field with regard to these things, and it's SO impressive how you've navigated all these challenges and persevered. 

> Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can’t do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

Fuck yeah. This is the way and very inspiring for me personally!

Do you think I could ever talk to you about preparing for and applying to law school since you've got this unique perspective? I've always thought it could be my calling, but I've sold myself short since graduating with my BA out of fear of failure and complacency.",MentalHealthAlt1,131yk11

0,"Hey! I'm really proud of you, stranger. I too am a pwbpd and have a long and complicated history with opiates (kratom included). I'm still fresh in my journey, so I don't have all the tips...but I can say that it will be in your best interest to start looking up PAWS now. Understanding what I was potentially in for gave me such a feeling of relief, and even control, even though a lot of it is like...suckass af. Educate yourself about what you might experiences, remind yourself that it will pass, and ALWAYS keep it fresh in your mind why you want to do better for yourself by quitting. 

Second tip: work with a therapist or join a recovery group. These battles are really hard. You have to have support. Like, HAVE TO. You're going to want to set yourself up for success, so do this asap if you have resources available. 

Best of luck w the visit, I believe in you and you will be so much happier 6 months down the road when you're back in control of your actions and thoughts. I found that opiates actually wayyy worsened my bpd, it left me in a constant tailspin about whether my feelings were real, valid, too extreme, blah blah blah...basically, I'm a lot happier now and though it was worse at first, it's so so worth getting through that storm to the other side.

I think that could be between any two friends sort of thing but it sounds like she's a bad friend because instead of comforting you and being a voice of reason if you were being out of line in your situation, she brushed you off dismissively and a bit demeaning.

And just to add- I don't think people with bpd are always in the right but other peoples actions are not always 'normal' I've started thinking if this was the other way round would this be acceptable?

If somebody is taking time off to go with you to go camping then technically speaking their day is free and so they're not doing anything but spending it with you

So if it's your birthday and you want to go camping and then go to a restaurant I am confused about where the selfishness is coming from in her objections, since you are offering to put forth the cost for this restaurant?

The only thing you can do is stop bringing the cost of things up with her, and make it more about how having her there for you on your birthday is really all that matters, friendship and birthdays are about the memories and those are worth far more then having to pay for dinner.",KrissFlavored,oxlx4g

0,"i’ve noticed weed has definitely made my bpd harder to manage. sure it’s helped temporarily, 100%, but i’ve noticed long term how much it’s messed me up. and it’s scary tbh. it sucks when you keep trying and trying to find different ways to heal and end up in the cycle of temporary comfort and long lasting emotional disregulation and emptiness. that was my experience at least 

i’ve been trying to slowly get myself off of it, addiction is hard period but bpd ontop of addiction certainly doesn’t make it easier. for me i try to use cbd joints with low low thc, im basically gaslighting myself into getting better. i’ll be honest, now that i’m not smoking as much and am weening off of it more, it’s a bit easier in some regards",fuckwormbrain,128ubhw

When I stopped using my symptoms got extremely bad and almost cost me my marriage. I’m on meds now so no cannabis or alcohol and the symptoms are manageable.",craign_em,128ubhw
3,[deleted],,128ubhw
4,"For me, it's a bit of both, but I feel like I've gotten to a point where it's more of a medicine. Letting yourself actively feel your emotions without dulling them is certainly important... But I have bpd. I don't experience emotions like most would.

Sometimes it feels like my insides are on fire, or like I've been poisoned. In cases like that, weed helps me to calm down a bit, and instead of feeling that searing emotional pain, I feel closer to what I'd assume is a normal amount of emotional pain?

If I'm feeling awful because of a situation, weed helps me be able to view things in a different light, which makes future similar situations easier to handle even without weed. This is also helpful for splitting, as I can actually work through the splitting feelings instead of feeing stuck in them. And if I'm just feeling awful because of like, a general looming bad feeling, weed will help calm me and let me see that there's nothing to worry about.

It completely depends on how you use it. And, in my personal experience, it's better than scrolling social media to numb the feelings, since you're not just ignoring them- You're doing something about them.

My argument would be different for certain other drugs. Alcohol- No good. Shrooms- Probably the best for working out feelings, but can be risky for people with bpd or who need immediate calming.

This is all just my own experience though, and it may/will vary from person to person.",puppyworm,128ubhw

I've tried many and they give me brain fog, flat affect, and I never feel better, just more empty. Why is it socially acceptable to feel numb (when prescribed pills by a doctor) but not high from a plant? I get it though, people say things are bad for a reason and my disordered thinking tends to spin things the way I want to see them. It's so hard not being able to trust your own judgement.",emelre,128ubhw
6,"i’m in australia, so you can only access cannabis through a Dr., it’s one of the most highly controlled medications here. 

for me, i have BPD, C-PSTD and about a decade long struggle with anorexia. i also have pretty bad insomnia and night terrors due to my C-PTSD. 

to medicate i take 1ml of a full spectrum CBD in the morning, and in the evening 1ml of a 25% THC oil a few hours before bed, and i have a herb vaporiser i probably consume maybe 1 bowls worth of weed in also before bed time. 

i stick to this very rigidly because when i first got my script i was vaping it all the time just to eat. i’ve gotten to a good place in my treatment where i can eat during the day comfortably, and i only take THC to unwind and prevent night terrors, for me THC has been the only effective way for me to stop the night terrors aside from heavy sedatives which impact me a lot more in the morning, so aren’t really an option for me. 

i definitely view my cannabis as medicine, for me i can comfortably manage my dose and i only get a set amount each month so it’s easy for me to not spiral in to the over use a lot of people end up in, understandably so. 

i prefer natural options where i can and i’ve been using cannabis as medicine for almost 2 years now and it’s changed my life in terms of the insomnia, night terrors and appetite. I’m very spiritual so i see cannabis as medicine given by the earth, but i know that’s a hot take lol. 

id say 1. look in to CBD! if i ever needed to go off THC i think CBD would get me through, people definitely overlook it! and 2. if you’re struggling to manage your intake you should try and set a specific dosage amount and see if you can stick to it, if you can’t it may be time to look at alternatives. 

best of luck with it all ❤️",beepdoopbedo,128ubhw
7,"Yeah, I’ve noticed a similar cycle with myself ever since I got my medical card, but I’ve also noticed that it is a very forgiving medicine and as long as I am gentle and intuitive with it, and using it when I know I need it (and obviously having a healthy relationship with it), I can titrate down relatively easily and the dysregulation will fade very quickly. That is absolutely just me though, as it’s very very different for everybody. Plus access to vape cartridges, extracts, hundreds of strains, various edibles and tincture forms, even patches; it’s a game changer as opposed to buying weed off the corner and smoking it every night lol.

0,"Then go directly to what worked in the past. Get on some meds, see your providers, exercise your skills. 

You know what works to get you back on your feet. Being on medication doesn’t mean you’re weaker, it means you found something that works. Strength is doing what needs to be done to get back on track, even if you don’t want to. 

I accepted a long time ago that I would always face these periodic dips in stability throughout my life. And I started thinking in a “Okay. Game on, bitch” attitude. I decided I’d learn how to master them over time. Get better and better at catching it sooner, and getting through it sooner. Every “dip,” I learn a little bit more, I dip a little less deep into the dark, and I put together a pattern. I learn my opponent and the rules of their game. For some reason it’s a lot easier if there’s that disconnect between me and the problem. 

Step one: Every time I start to feel like you are right now, like I’m losing my grip, I write down what happened in the past week or two. Doesn’t matter if it seems significant at the time, I just write much as I can remember. I put this info aside to “study” once I’m on the other side of this thing. 

Step two: I go to what worked in the past. Always start alllllll the way down to the bottom of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and start slow. A tiny bit slower than you think you should go, at first. One task a day. Some of my first few days are: take a shower. Wash and/or change my bedding. Put all the bad food from the fridge in a garbage bag. Take out the garbage bag. Clean the toilet. Clean the litter box. Order grocery delivery and put away the cold stuff. Put away the rest of the groceries. 

I do ONE task a day. Because on day two, I’ll be rewarded with not having to look at the rotting food in my fridge, and that motivates me to do day 2’s task of taking the bag out to the curb. Also, keeping my bar that low makes it pretty hard to fail. So every single day I get the improvement of quality of life resulting my previous day’s accomplishment (don’t have to look at the rotting food when I go to grab my pitiful meal replacement shake), the sense of accomplishment from that goal, AND the immediate encouragement to do today’s goal (take that bag to the curb). Even if I did nothing else but lay in bed and sleep, I still know the next day will be slightly better than today. It really snowballs after a couple weeks. 

Step three: you’re on the other side. Make a list of strategies for the next time your brain decides to be a little shit. So you can recall what works best, what you’d like to do differently, etc. Also, review those notes you took at the beginning. When you read them and compare what you’ve compounded over the years, you get really good at catching yourself earlier and getting back on your feet without dipping as low as you used to. 




Sorry for how long this was. I just really empathize and I figured it wouldn’t hurt to suggest. Feel free to ask for clarification, anyone!

0,"Similar situation with my wife. We’ve turned to couples workbooks and have a weekly time to do them together. We started with “High Conflict Couple” and it’s going well. We also have specific days set aside for no processing, only having fun, so we stay connected through the hard stuff and remember why we’re in it. Remember, therapy is only a means to an end. Yes it helps, we do have therapy too, but if you don’t have access to therapy right now, just remember that no matter if you have a therapist, a book, or an online support group, the transformation happens inside of you and inside your partner. All the rest is just tools. 

I’ll also say, remember not to split on him about doing drugs/withdrawing money. I don’t know what kind of drugs or agreements you have in your relationship, but we all have different ways of coping with hard times. And this year, for everyone on this planet, is a very, very hard time. So cut him a little slack even if he is fucking up—we all are. What matters is him agreeing to do a workbook with you every Tuesday, or whatever. Let him do his drugs and make his mistakes and hopefully you guys can figure things out when the dark cloud passes. If you feel like he’s truly going down a dark road and you want to have an intervention, do it with care and with his best interest in mind. I’ve had to do a lot of work with my wife (I’m the BPD, she’s not) around whether I’m saying something for MY benefit or for HERS. Because at one point, I would have totally lost my shit on her about taking some cash out... but it would have been about me being pissed she was off being irresponsible... and without me, at that. Not because I was actually concerned about her spending habits, or drugs (she smokes an enormous amount of weed, we had to just build it into the budget).

0,"More often than not, addiction is secondary to underlying mental health issues. That's why therapy is so important to addiction recovery- addressing those underlying issues makes you less likely to relapse. 

Look at the DSM diagnostic criteria for BPD and see if it resonates. It might, or it might not. If it doesn't, seek a second opinion.

Personally, I had been diagnosed with comorbid Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder for almost 20 years, but standard treatments for those disorders were not effective for me. I tried every antidepressant on the market, multiple types of therapy, even got my brain fried my ECT, and nothing helped. I felt like I was broken, and that there was no hope for me to get better, and my eventual suicide was inevitable. 

During my fifth hospitalization after a suicide attempt, a clinician suggested looking into alternative diagnoses, particularly BPD (which my long-time therapist had dismissed because ""all those symptoms can be explained by my ADHD, depression, anxiety, and trauma history""). She gave me a memoir called ""The Buddha and the Borderline,"" and it was like a giant lightbulb lit up in my brain. I swear I could have written the first few chapters myself. 

Suddenly I was filled with hope. Treatment for depression wasn't helpful because I didn't have depression. BPD has a high remission rate with proper treatment, specifically DBT. While the work is overwhelming a lot of the time, I still feel like there's light at the end of the tunnel. I am not broken, or a lost cause, or any of the things I believed for so long. I can get better, and I *am* getting better all the time... and you can, too!",thepolywitch,gn4jlt
1,"Hey there, I am someone who fits almost all of the DSM qualifications for BPD. I find that knowing this has clarified many things for me as my behaviors finally make sense, in a way. Knowing why I do what I do has allowed me to better work on my stuff. My biggest things seem to be the fear of abandonment, suicidal tendencies, self-harm, and splitting. Self-harm is my only addiction, though I go long periods without hurting myself. I tend to go on binges of things that are dangerous/unhealthy for me, but am always able to stop after a bit.",mjiyn2010,gn4jlt

0,"The post-diagnosis limbo just sucks. You get confronted with so much information and then left on your own, when you really shouldn't. It seems like your therapist isn't doing a good job, I'd strongly suggest you talk to them about it or consider changing therapists if you have the resources to do so. I know it sucks to seemingly start over again, but I can tell you from experience that it's worth it. Like yes, you have to do a lot of the work yourself, but that doesn't mean you have no right to get supported or get treatment. You deserve to get help and you also deserve some rest when you're that tired, because not everything has to be a challenge, not everything has to be that exhausting.

I was also diagnosed this march (I'm 22, but in therapy since like 16) and I threw myself fully in that ""I have to work on myself now that I know"" and it just made me even more miserable and burned out. So when I had to go inpatient again because nothing worked out anymore, I couldn't really work on anything. To just keep existing was hard enough, but it was also enough. And it still is. I'm not going to disappear because I'm not working in myself. Instead I got some positive input, I picked up hobbies from my childhood again, indulged in all those ""cringey"" hobbies I talked myself out of to fit in, while also finding new things that excited me. Some of that worked, some didn't, but it was enough to keep busy, keep existing and give my brain some much needed serotonin. Much of those interests don't involve any direct contact to people, so they're relatively safe and low-pressure. And that's what got me on a basis to do therapy properly and work on my issues.

So what I meant to say, I know everything's shit right now. I've been there and I still get there sometimes, and I hate it. But I'm still here and can watch Dinosaur documentaries, play video games, write stupid fanfiction and shitpost about brine shrimp. And that gives me everything on those days and I'm sure you can find those things for you too. Maybe it's something like that, maybe it's sports or art or birdwatching or whatever. 

I also can understand if you'd rather have something you can work on actively. Starting with ""skills"" against sh and to calm down in certain situations has been incredibly helpful. There should be tons of resources online for that with examples and all that. And starting with that is enough for now.",continued_confusion,14h8fwq

Drawing them in situations I find myself in makes them understandable and somewhat comical at times. It gives a name and a face to something that otherwise you feel you have little to no control over. AND it shows you are separate from the feelings impulses ideas thoughts etc that you have. They do NOT define who you are. Only your actions and sometimes intentions (mostly when hurting others) define you.

0,"I was a frequent lifter at Wally World at one time as well. I had just had a child (and I was very young) and I mostly just took stuff like diapers and formula that I “forgot” to scan. Since I had a kid, when they would check my receipt at the door and say I didn’t pay for the diapers, they’d just believe me when I said I forgot. This went on for a long time. Then I read on Reddit years ago that most stores keep a log of what you’re stealing and they wait until it’s over $2k so they can get you for grand theft. I stopped doing it cold turkey (had to go into debt to do it, actually, because I couldn’t afford to feed my kid) and even though I now have $5k in debt with a 22% interest rate… at least I’m not in prison for stealing formula.

1,"vws, ty for sharing your experience.  I believe a misdemeanor on record also interferes with your ability to cross the border.  I was easily influenced as a kid (heck, also as an adult) and hung around some kids when I was seven or eight or so who made shoplifting look easy and fun.  I got caught, didn't tell my parents, then I got the living shit scared out of me when my mother said she needed to hire a lawyer to get this expunged from my record when I was maybe ten or something.",,ww6m1q

I have never been in a bad situation like yours, I have def been followed and almost caught too many times to name . I've had a few close calls recently and I want to stop voluntarily before I have to stop bc I have gotten myself into some shit. I have been fucking up. Life is hard rn, and I'm making it harder trying to deal with hard feelings without dealing with them directly. 

Thank you for this post I really mean it.",,ww6m1q
7,"Yeah that fact definitely freaked me out too, and I knew about it the whole time I was shoplifting. So when the plainclothes people said, “Come with us,” I instantly thought I had gone over that grand theft felony amount and my life flashed before my eyes. This experience on top of already being in the middle of a mixed episode *and* suicidal made me think that my only option was to kill myself if I got charged with a felony. Not a route I would ever want to go down anymore.

I’m so sorry to hear that you had to resort to putting yourself on the line for diapers and baby formula, no one should ever have to be put in that situation in the “Best Country in the World”.",withdiana,ww6m1q
8,"That’s a valid question. This was never an official diagnosis of mine, but I also grew up very poor. When I discovered shoplifting, it felt relieving, like I was finally able to get the things I’ve always wanted and didn’t have to burden my parents or family with my wants, and I didn’t have to budget myself to death to get things like better quality shampoo or multivitamins or name brand medication.

After I discovered how easily I could get away with essentials like these, I tested the waters into getting more things I always wanted but could never afford. I rationalized it like, “The rich shouldn’t be the only ones who can have this better lifestyle because they can afford it - I deserve it too,” which, to be fair, made complete logical sense to me at the time. Some would argue there’s some truth in that, and at the time it felt like I was finally able to regain some power I didn’t have based on my low-income socioeconomic status. I wore nicer clothing, better makeup, nicer accessories and shoes and handbags. It started off small then rapidly accelerated  into frivolous wants instead of needs, whereas I started out with just basics. (And by “nicer,” I literally mean clothes/shoes from places like Target or Hollister, not expensive luxury brands.)

I’m not saying that shoplifting or kleptomania is a symptom in BPD because it definitely isn’t like in your case, but anecdotally, I know others with the diagnosis who also find great pleasure in shoplifting. I think in my case, maybe it was a perfect storm of my BPD wanting me to make reckless behaviors, manic episodes giving me the go-ahead with impulsive decisions, and growing up low-income feeling like I deserved more than what I had. I hope this answers your question the best I could!",withdiana,ww6m1q

You aren't alone in this thinking process. We moved so rapidly between hope and hopeless, I've learnt I can legit only take the loudest emotion in each moment and that's my cheat sheet. I tell all the other emotions to rack off since I'm dealing with 'anger' or 'elation' or 'despair' or 'superiority'.

Oh, and many, many years of learning to keep things to myself including my outbursts, etc. I figure I may not get support like I give nor do I get to be the victim of anything (even though I have been, I'm oddly not allowed to be) but at least I'm not making others feel worse or further annoyed by me.

I strongly encourage you and others to forgive yourselves for past transgressions, but I just know I can't let go of that guilt. To be honest, I don't want to let go of the guilt, it reminds me who I want to be and how I want to conduct myself. Again, my experience is different, in that you find it empowering, whereas I have felt humiliated and ashamed. Reading books and coming to terms with the fact that I was abusive and manipulative was so hard. I'd find myself trying to convince myself I didn't carry these actions out or I'd notice my thoughts were always attempting to justify my behaviour. It was exhausting having to analyse each thought during conflict. The result is that I am now an incredibly open and honest person and I explain my thought path, then I explain how that makes me feel, and then I actively listen to the opinions of the other party. I also think before I speak. I feel I need to stress that I still fuck up every now and again, I close off, I catch myself gaslighting someone and when I'm in that headspace I cannot drop that pride and admit fault, the angers rages in my stomach and I don't drop an argument when I should or in the way I should. I know I have come such a long way and I am proud to say I have done so alone, but fuck me, it sucks that after all this hard work, one occasional appearance of BPD during conflict can still cause complete chaos to our relationships. We cannot take back what we say and how we hurt people and it sucks we sometimes have no control over this. Well, not yet. I sincerely hope I can rewire my brain enough to eradicate all traces of BPD. Knowing my luck the final step of my transformation will be a year of silent meditation... Is being a good person really worth it? Sometimes, I do wonder.",kitamajita,fgek26
7,"I'd say more of an educated guess, to be fair. I don't feel a degree in psychology is necessary to evaluate my symptoms and come to such a conclusion. I mean... I had the vast majority of the symptoms associated with BPD, my primary source of information was the DSM:V and a previous psychiatrist stated they would diagnose me with BPD had diagnosing me with a condition been the purpose of our meet. I perceived your comment in such a way as to make me feel you are jumping to conclusions, perhaps assuming I am not educated enough, nor do I know my self enough, to know if I have a condition and what the correct terminology for that condition is. I must state clearly that I am not a person who seeks attention via umpteen fake diagnoses and a different issue every week. Do not assume I am stupid.",kitamajita,fgek26
8,"Absolutely. This resonates with me. First and foremost that the change, as hippy dippy as it may sound, really does come from within. A person must have the desire to change for themselves, not for others and especially not when given an ultimatum. I.e... you must change or I will leave etc. It's incredibly difficult for me to maintain boundaries and I still struggle with my expectations of others, but this is now internally, I am careful to express how I'm feeling but emphasise my awareness that I may not be feeling a certain way justifiably. Having ADHD can also inflate traits of BPD but I generally feel I have a good handle on both.",kitamajita,fgek26
9,"Ooo very tough one! Okay, after giving it some serious thought. The first book was 'Loves me, Loves me not'. This, along with 'Love me, don't leave me' were transformative. As I have ADHD, I really struggled with perseverance, but I cannot recommend these highly enough. My final recommendation isn't a book, per se, it's a subject matter... Read and watch all you can on Dialectical Behavioural Therapy or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Really delve into these subjects and if you think they can help, buy the DBT workbook (or download the free PDF) or the ACT workbook. I have both and I committed to doing both workbooks to the best of my ability. I still go through these books and utilise what I have learned, very often. I hope this helps.",kitamajita,fgek26

2,"I personally don't like to meditate but I think thats because I haven't' developed enough patience to sit still for too long. But that is something I might have to work on. Instead, I take long walks whenever I feel like meditating or clearing my mind. If I'm really emotionally charged, I exercise or run. I think meditation serves the purpose of trying to have intentional and guided thoughts rather than rampant or unorganized and scattered thoughts that only bring us deeper into our illusions and deactivating strategies. I also talk to myself out loud to avoid splitting to affirm what is reality and what is just a thought that i am giving too much power in my head. This is a conclusion I came to after I cut out drugs and alcohol. We have a lot of trouble, as humans, determining our individual way of thinking and trying to differentiate it from what society wants us to think or what we have involuntary learned or been taught to think. Do your best to really pay attention to yourself. It is really painful actually and it will be very difficult and messy before it gets better. But it is best that you start now. 

I used drugs to cope with splitting and it made me worse. It put me in really dangerous situations where I could have died. It is not natural to want to die, this is just a learned response to cope with the pain. Your body is trying to tell you to stop sabotaging itself.

I think it is also a good idea to realize how similar we are to each other as humans.

For me, I talked to my GP about my mental health and she referred me to a psychiatrist. First, I was assessed (two hour long appointment talking about mh past and mental health) by a very kind assistant, then she brought those notes to a team of psychiatrists. I already had a diagnosis (moved here from the USA) and the team validated my diagnosis’ and now I have appointments with a psychiatrist. 

During your assessment, feel free to talk openly about how much you relate to BPD symptoms. I was worried that they would take my BPD diagnosis away from me, but I brought a notepad of my history with BPD and how my behaviour, attitude, lifestyle, and mental health correlates with one with BPD. 

Everything will be okay. I’m proud of you for reaching out and for making steps towards bettering yourself. Remember to be kind and patient with yourself. You’re not alone.

There’s a post in here that someone shared with google drive documents for self-help books for BPD and PTSD, along with workbooks for DBT. I highly recommend using the workbooks and mentioning it during your assessment. They will ask you what you’ve done to better your mental health and it helps them knowing that you’re taking those steps for yourself.",deadrs,bshpx4

3,"FUCK THAT! I am so angry reading your post. 
Im so sorry that you too, have encountered the awful attitude of a health 'professional'.

I read your post as if i was reading my own biography.  I had been told too many times in the past that 'I'm doing fine' 'its a bad patch' or my absolute favourite 'there are people much worse of than you'......No shit! But by that logic,   why have hospitals when there are people out there that are dead. 

Grrr, sorry for my rant.  I just hate that the logic suggests you can 'trick' someone into being better......

Stand your ground and hold out.  It took me 15 years to get a diagnoses. With all the above statements i battled through many periods of my life feeling like i was an absolute piece of shit.  

In the end,  i was studying psychology at uni,  because like you, i wanted to understand mental health better, when i was almost immediately pulled Aside by my academic advisor and she suggested i pay a visit to the wellbeing team.  Well shit,  it wasn't a month before the uni paid for me to have a private diagnoses and the psych,  within the first 15 mins already suspected bpd.  They wrote steaming letters to my gp about my care and the gp then sent me for a psych evaluation.  Well guess what,  they also diagnosed me with bpd....

I was so relieved to finally start to understand myself better and im excited to get on the road to recovery. There is a lot of stigma attached to bpd for some reason and just last week i encountered a horrendous health professional who was completely hostile and arrogant about my diagnoses and tried fobbing me off saying 'that just sounds like depression'...... i nearly lost it!!!! 2 pychs say bpd but he knows better??? 

Anyway,  my point amongst all of my rant is to try and offer some suggestions with my history above to back it up. 

I would try and get a private appointment to get a diagnosis.  It feels like a private psychiatrist isnt as concerned about being held accountable by the nhs wheras it seems like the NHS almost frown upon their staff giving a diagnosis.  (My own opinion to be fair but it has been shared by nhs staff too!)

Once you have a diagnosis,  ask the psych about recommended treatment and have them put it in writing.  Once you have that,  you can go back to your gp and they can refer you for therapy via nhs.


Be warned,  i was told i would first get 6 weeks of therapy and then get signed off as 'cured'. I would then have to go back and say it hasnt worked and i would be offered 6 months of therapy.  Yep, again i would have to go back after this to get a proper programme in place. 

Im gunning for you man,  i am lucky enough to recently have had outside support to give me confidence to stand my ground and i hope my post does the same for you in some way. 

Pm me if you wanna know/ talk more

51,LSD told me to get off my meds and I never looked back,ArachWitch,pnk1fn
52,"After a while the Wellbutrin was giving me severe brain fog, memory impairment, and slurred speech. I felt like my brain was just dying. It wasn't worth it anymore. It also caused chronic constipation for the next 4 years after quitting.",ArachWitch,pnk1fn
53,"It's honestly how I've worked through most of the trauma I have managed to. It also was what changed my perspective in such a profound way that I quit drinking after a decade of alcoholism. It's been four years now since the last time I had a drink. Incredibly clear headed. No thought loops or confusion even at higher doses. It gave me back the untainted love and compassion that I had as a child before the world made me so jaded and fucked up. It physically showed me what that felt like and made me remember who I am in my most basic and true form. I carry that with me every day and trip once a year so I won't ever forget again.

Edit: It's in a league of it's own as well in that it's a phenethylamine hallucinogen and not a tryptamine like shrooms or acid. Because of that it shares somewhat similar empathetic qualities to mdma.",an-echo-of-silence,pnk1fn

55,How did you start weening yourself off,Boopface34,pnk1fn
56,Ive only been on meds since April,Boopface34,pnk1fn
57,So like... how do you get that from the cactus?,MaudlinEdges,pnk1fn
58,"You can't abuse LSD lol I mean you can certainly try I guess but it would be REALLY fucking hard to get addicted. It's exhausting. Even if you did magically somehow become ""addicted"", LSD can never kill you. No one has EVER died of an ""overdose"". It's perfectly safe as long as you're not schizophrenic.",ArachWitch,pnk1fn
59,"I didn't lol I immediately stopped which was probably stupid but the LSD after glow helped me survive the withdrawal feeling. I was taking Wellbutrin which was destroying my brain. The LSD was like ""this shit is killing you"".",ArachWitch,pnk1fn
60,sure,madchenamfenster,pnk1fn
61,Thats exactly what i am on….,Boopface34,pnk1fn
62,I don't expect you to understand LSD but I highly recommend trying it before writing it off. It is the most spiritual thing I have ever experienced and completely shifted the way I see life. It made me a better person full of empathy because it showed my how we are all connected. This substance is pure love.,ArachWitch,pnk1fn
63,How do you feel?,ArachWitch,pnk1fn
64,Just by reading how you talk about a drug has convinced me never to use it. Thank you for that,madchenamfenster,pnk1fn
65,They're already dead,MaudlinEdges,pnk1fn
66,"Lol good. You'd probably have a bad trip anyways. Too close minded. Maybe ""god"" can help you. Good luck!",ArachWitch,pnk1fn
67,Huh?,ArachWitch,pnk1fn
