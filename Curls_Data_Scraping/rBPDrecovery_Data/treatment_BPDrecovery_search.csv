2,Botox as treatment for BPD,"I listen to the podcast Stuff You Should Know, and they did a mini episode called [Short Stuff: Botox Brain](https://podcastaddict.com/episode/156780876). They talk about Botox as a treatment for migraines, depression, anxiety, and BPD. I have been receiving Botox for migraines every 3 months for about 8 years. I didn't realize it till just now that I've lapsed and haven't had a treatment in almost a year. The past 8 or so months have been some of the worst mental health wise I've experienced in a decade. I left a message with my doctor so I can get treated again. I didn't think much of it since I wasn't getting a lot of migraines, but maybe the Botox was doing a lot for my BPD.

3,Struggling with some things in regard to DBT treatment.,"Hi guys. Thanks for your time. I'm living in the UK, and have had CBT and counselling. I found that neither of those were helpful. DBT is, but my only option to self administer. I've already noticed that distress is much easier to tolerate, I'm more mindful, etc. It's nice.

However - there are certain things I'm struggling with, and dont know what skills to apply to combat. These are two things.

The first of which is the awareness of futility, and fear of the future. I am painfully aware of the fact that tomorrow, my entire family could die, or I could face brutal abuse, and no amount of therapy skills could help me. Frankly, the world can be a horrible and cruel place, and it makes any amount of self improvement feel almost counterintuitive, and as though as the smart solution is to...Off yourself. I won't, I'm just aware of this thought pattern, and I think it impacts my commitment to the treatment.

The second is my struggle in identifying which of my interpersonal needs are valid, and which may be unfair. For example - my boyfriend and I had a fight last night because I felt as though he never listens to me (I was showing him YouTube videos, and he rolled over and groaned). Objectively very rude - but what degree of response is warranted? Or the time I got upset with him over something I completely made up in my head, and was quite unpleasant about? In the moment - how do you distinguish, find, and calmly communicate your own fair needs as a person from mental illness symptoms when they often feel identical?",1698636329.0,False,6,6,recovet,None,17jkbv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17jkbv2/struggling_with_some_things_in_regard_to_dbt/
4,treatment resistent,"After going to many therapists for many years I was finally diagnosed with the correct thing: bpd. I’m so glad to finally have some clarity after years of feeling lost and not making progress.

I’m not doing so great right now and I’m starting to notice im basically treatment resistent. I hate going to therapy, I actually dread it, and all I do is get frustrated with my therapist when I’m truly frustrated with myself. I feel like I hit a dead end. I want to quit therapy so bad, but I know that’s a terrible idea.

I keep trying to tell myself its just a speed bump, not a dead end, but I’ve been broken up with by therapists before for being treatment resistant. I keep splitting on how I feel about my therapist, I’m frustrated with how little progress I’m making, I know I just want an easy fix thats not possible.

5,Going to start treatment tomorrow,"I (M23) was diagnosed with BPD last month after I went to the hospital for suicidal and homicidal ideation. I also scored super high on antisocial and narcissistic traits, and I'm not sure how to feel about that, even though I know it's true. I know that having this disorder doesn't make me evil, but it felt like the psychiatrist was calling me that. The hospital people put me on Latuda (I'm on 3 other things too, and one doesn't work so I'm tapering off) and told me that I have to get a DBT therapist instead of the psychodynamic one I've been seeing for 6 years and love very much. They also referred me to a partial program, which I start tomorrow.

I'm really nervous. I'm in a lot of pain. I have rage episodes when I'm alone, and panic attacks, and I drink and cut myself. My mood swings are intense, and I go between being tired, and just hating everyone and wanting to hurt them. I'm also bipolar and am having a depressive episode right now. I know I have to stop these behaviors, but I don't know much about DBT or the coping skills that are part of it, and I'm afraid that it won't help me. I want it to, but part of me is scared to get better. I know I have to talk about the negative ways I think about people and myself, and the violent impulses, but I have so much shame. I'm also autistic and have meltdowns from overstimulation and social situations, and I struggle with communication and talking, so it's hard to gauge what is BPD and needs to be fixed with DBT, and what is autism and would be harder/unethical to try to change. I don't want my therapist to mix up the two and hurt me.

The doctors also want me to go back on lithium. I was on it for 7 years and it really helped me, but the side effects ended up being sooo bad. I think it might be best to go back on it, though, because I feel like my mind has been punishing me since I went off.

I'm not asking for advice, just maybe responses from people who can relate, especially if they've been in a similar situation and been successful with treatment.",1686707295.0,False,2,1,Simple_Blueberry276,None,148vf5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/148vf5c/going_to_start_treatment_tomorrow/

I have no friends, I find friendships exhausting and I tend to ruin things anyhow,, I live alone, everyday is tiring and lonely. My doctor says I'm almost infertile for whatever the reason. I really want a family but I can't hold down a relationship to save my life because everyone leaves and push everyone away nothing lasts longer the six months if I'm lucky. This is no life.

I have ADHD and BPD, and ive been in treatment for a year (schema group and individual therapy). Its been real hard and slow work, but it has been very beneficial. 

However since ive been put on the appropriate ADHD meds (dexamphetamine) that actually work for me and dont make me feel horrible, ive been making progress wayyy faster than before. I can think clearer, i dont dissasociate as badly so i can actually work through emotions better. Im more present in the group, and its easier to connect.

Overall its a whole new world for me. I had never experienced actually being calm in my head, without also feeling numb (used to be on ritalin, which had very negative side effects in my case). And it feels like i can finally profit from all the hard work id been doing in therapy.

“Because treatment with esketamine might be so helpful to patients with treatment-resistant depression (meaning standard treatments had not helped them), the FDA expedited the approval process to make it more quickly available. In one study, 70 percent of patients with treatment-resistant depression who were started on an oral antidepressant and intranasal esketamine improved, compared to just over half in the group that did not receive the medication (called the placebo group).

24,Saying goodbye to CPN,"Hi all. I'm looking for advice and insight...
I've been having treatment for BPD for 4 years now. I've had different treatment forms and with different professionals for each, though I've consistently always alongside this had my designated Community Psychiatric Nurse. She is the first professional I came into contact with from the beginning, was the one to diagnose and treat me for BPD (her speciality area) and the first person I opened up to about everything; my past, my childhood, my raw inner self, my perceived 'worst' parts, with no judgment and an almost 'motherly' type style, something I'd never had or experienced before. Needless to say, this relationship although kept professional, has had a profound impact on me in both my discovery and recovery in dealing with BPD and with general life. As I grew and evolved and got better through combined treatment, our appointments got spaced out more and more and I no longer felt the lifeline type 'need' for her, and certainly don't have her in my mind as a sort of FP at this stage. However, I'm due tommorow to have my required '6 month break' from all treatment. She has informed me that if I need to come back for more treatment after 6 months of being discharged, that it won't be her I get assigned to again, so this is goodbye, not necessarily to treatment but to her. I think that this would be difficult at any stage but I've just come off the back of the hardest few months in a long time, and am only just getting back on my feet with things, so despite I am a lot better at coping and understanding myself than I was when I first started treatment with her, this mandatory break and goodbye, although required, couldn't have come at a worse time. She is the first and only person to have understood me, more than myself, given me insight, support, and non judgemental compassion. The one and only person who gets 'me' and this disorder in a way my family, friends and partner could never, something so priceless with BPD. Although I don't require her support in quite the same way as I once did, I still don't feel ready or confident with the idea of facing life and its struggles, my struggles, without her. I knew this day would need to come at some point, but I don't feel ready, probably magnified with what I've been through lately. I don't know how to face this. It's tommorow, I'm dreading it and what comes after it, how I'll cope with the uncertainty of the future and what it may bring, without the comforting thought of knowing she's there in the background IF I ever really needed her... I liken it to the imagined comfort and confidence a child has knowing they're cycling a bike unsupported for the first time without their parent's hand on them stabilising them, but watching on, waiting to be there if needed and that being the thing that makes the child feel able to keep going and doing it alone.

29,How to help my spouse with BPD?,"TLDR at the bottom :) 


Hi everyone! I (M24) have been with my partner with BPD (enby 24) for 5 years, married for 2. Neither of us knew they had BPD at the start of the relationship; only about 6 months ago dots started to connect for them and they told me they think they meet the criteria for Quiet-type BPD. A diagnosis isn't likely at this stage as we live in the UK and the waiting lists are... intense for NHS mental health treatments.

At the moment I think things are a bit fresh, my partner has said that they've just come to terms with the fact they have BPD and aren't ready to look at formal treatment options yet but we've been working on a few strategies, for example we have an analogy we call ""the mountain"" where there are three basic levels on a 1-100 scale (the hyena pit at 1-10, a stable camp at 45-55, and the peak where the air is thin at 90-100). We try to check in about where on the mountain they are before we have a potentially triggering conversation and I'm trying to be more conscious of how/when I say things. They also have listened to Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents and Recovering from Emotionally Immature Parents, both by Lindsay Gibson, which has helped quite a bit prior to learning about what symptoms have been from BPD. 

My question is: how can I set boundaries or offer support and understanding without unintentionally discouraging improvement/healing or enabling? I've felt a few times that there's a fine line between offering accommodation and allowing unhealthy habits to form, but as someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with BPD/BPD recovery I'm not sure where that line is.

40,Is this behaviour actually healthy?,"My 19 year old sister has BPD and gets angry really easily. She gets mad at our family over mistakes we make that we often have little control over. I understand that with BPD you have a lot of emotions so it’s hard to control anger and I don’t hold that against her. But it’s still really exhausting. When she gets angry, she deals with it by locking herself away in her room and not talking to anyone for the rest of the day (and sometimes this can go on for days). She says that it’s healthy because she needs the space to deal with her emotions and if she stays around other people she might scream at us and she doesn’t want to do that. I appreciate that she knows her limits and understand that needing space for yourself is healthy, but I also feel really uncomfortable and anxious at the fact that she spends that much time alone and not communicating with anyone. Getting silent treatment is difficult and scary. I’m completely fine with her needing time for herself, but I wish she didn’t need that much time. Like a few hours is okay, but a whole day or more makes me feel really really anxious especially because she’s angry over mistakes people make, with no one intending to hurt or upset her. Am I overreacting? Should I talk to her about how I feel? She sees a therapist so I could suggest that they talk about my sister’s anger. 

Tl;dr: when my sister with BPD gets angry over people’s mistakes, she locks herself away and/or gives everyone silent treatment for the day (and this can go on for days).

She is the love of my life but she has mistreated me in every sense possible since the start. I tried my best to be patient but I am losing my ability to. Everything you can do wrong to your significant other in a relationship she has done to me (cheating, violence, manipulation and everything in between). I forgive her every time because I know she is dealing with BPD. One day she loves me even tho theres “something missing” (even tho that something missing is unhealed trauma. She needs to fill that void for us to have a stronger connection) and then the next day she hates me and wants nothing to do with me. 

The story of her upbringing is the worst Ive ever heard from someone I personally know. Everybody in her life mistreats her. From her family to her “ex” who she still thinks of because he was a narcissist and used her/played her to get what he wanted. I learned the NPD/BPD tie is horrible. Her family allowed horrific things to happen to her that include sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. I am at the point where I’m about to give up.

We have a 4 year old son together so I’m trying to save our family. The hardest part is she treats literally everybody else in her life amazingly. Her friends, her fucked up family, coworkers. Literally everybody gets amazing treatment from her but she constantly mistreats me all the time. I don’t understand. I have been nothing but loving, loyal, forgiving, understanding, compassionate and everything in between. I love her and want her to get better. She is contemplating starting treatment and I have been trying to push her to go. I read somewhere people with BPD treat the person they love the most the absolute worst. Is that true? 

I know she loves me deep down. I know in her core of cores deep within her spirit she loves me and wants to be with me. I’m not delusional. But she keeps pushing me away and pulling me back and mistreating me and I’m tired. I don’t know what else I can do. Please help. I love her with all my heart she is the love of my life.

49,Jobless desperate 24 yr old,"Long story short. 
I have been told by my psychiatrist that I had ""borderline tendency"" but didn't meet the disorder criteria yet. I suffered a lot of trauma and pain in early childhood and young adulthood: abandonment, constantly changing caregivers, abusive NPD father, domestic violence, abortion, emotionally abusive and controlling husband, went through hospitalization because of a stupid overdose, went to casinos, spent money recklessly out of revenge for husband's treatment, guilt, more guilt, more self discovery, more fear, and more desperation. 

I now am the mother of a baby boy and I really don't want my disorder to get in the way of me taking care of him or being his mother. I'm certain I have a lot of love to offer him and I am seeking all the help I can get...

I hope all of you are having a good day. I'm just checking in to tell you that during our last appointment, my therapist of 3 years told me that she thinks I no longer meet the criteria for BPD and am what she calls ""a therapeutic success"". We went over how I got there over the course of my treatment and how some things will stay–""borderline traits"" that are part of my personality but no longer a handicap to my day-to-day life; and dissociative episodes that are now few and far between but not entirely gone. I know that setbacks are possible and even likely, but it does not scare me nearly as much as it used to! I have grown more confident in my skills and myself as a person despite previous therapists and medical professionals telling me there was no hope for me.

I wanted to share this feel-good news because I know that ""recovering"" from a personality disorder is so often seen as impossible that it really feels like there's no point in trying to get better. But there is!! I will be borderline my whole life but it doesn't have to be pathologic forever. I want to tell you that it does happen, changing is possible and work pays off. There's no way I could have imagined this just a couple years ago. You deserve care and your life is worth living, in and of itself, but also because it can and will get better.

52,I'm terrified my partner is cheating,"I've been diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable.

59,Strategies/skills to cope with unstable identity & chronic emptiness,"Looking for feedback or solutions to cope with this symptom of BPD.

I was fortunate to go through DBT treatment at a young age and it changed my life completely. I know other efficacious treatment methods exist. The end goal is to increase quality of life, reduce unwanted behavior patterns, cope better etc. I'm curious of any strategies or skills that have helped people most when dealing with this issue. This symptom creates difficulty when relating to self, specifically self-trust, self-validity and stable identity. I don't always feel secure within me or doubt my ability to maintain my base, ie. consistency with maintaining internal locus of control. 

The skills given to me have helped reduce or totally eradicate most symptoms. One thing I continue to struggle with is unstable sense of identity and feelings of emptiness. 

Any life-hacks, feedback, coping strategies or specific skills to improve this symptom would be greatly appreciated!",1581191416.0,False,19,4,recovering_nihilist,None,f0wnz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/f0wnz0/strategiesskills_to_cope_with_unstable_identity/

My dad is getting suffering through horrible cancer treatments, my partner is so sick and having a life saving surgery soon. I’m so worried about both of them. I’ve been trying to hold it together for others. I’ve been working at a super sketchy, hazardous job but it’s destroying both my mental and physical health.

I’m calling them and quitting tonight. I have to because I’m headed towards a break down otherwise, and I’ve finally saved enough to take a few weeks off. I feel guilt, shame, fear of the unknown. 

I believe in radical acceptance and I’m leaning into it now. Some things are out of my control. I can do this. I decide not to sh or contemplate dangerous and unhelpful thoughts. I won’t take it out on loved ones.

62,My partner gets mad at me when I'm having a panic attack,"His used silent treatment alot on me in the past when we have a argument. He will wait until I beg and beg until he will talk to me again. 


He used to chase me but he never does anymore. Because his used the silent treatment on me so many times, I'm now paranoid when he doesn't answer for long periods of time. I tend to end up in a panic attack begging him to answer. 

He will get so mad at me for blowing up his phone. I've told him maybe 4 times now whilst crying that if he needs space or doesn't want to talk then he needs to just say so. But not saying anything makes me go into a panic attack. 


I was crying like crazy and told him he needs to tell me. he said ""NO ! DONT YOU DARE TRY TO PUT THIS ON ME! DONT YOU DARE!"" then followed by ""I'm going to play video games now bye!!"" (He plays video games all the time and ignores me) 


Am I asking to much for him to tell me if his busy or doesn't want to talk? He always become enraged and does this. I'm scared to say anything. He says I'm always arguing but it's only because when I calmly try to communicate he gets extremely enraged and tells me it's my problem. Uses things off topic againist me or as to why . Like tonight he said he shouldn't have to text me to say he doesn't want to talk if I don't want to commit and use him as a ""toy"". Reason I'm not jumping back into a immediate relationship with him after a previous argument is because he needs to work on himself and how he treats me. Until then, I'm single. And I can also date who I please which he hates. But I'm scared of him and his behaviour never changes. He says all his friends say I'm abusive and toxic. Idk. There's alot.

64,Going through a breakup,"I spent a LOT of time focusing on myself afyer getting out of an abusive relationship a few years back. I spent time alone finding hobbies and working on so many of my own issues as well as coping with what happened during that relationship. I ended up getting clean from self harm and I even went back and graduated high school and started working again. I was so proud of myself and thought I could handle a relationship again finally. 

I may have been wrong.

We moved really slow at first, we took our time with dates and spending the night. We didn't want to force anything and I didn't want to get addicted so fast. Things went really well until around the 3 month mark I had a bad week, I was crying a lot and upset and for the first time, I brought up how when I feel like a mess I want to selfharm. I thought he would be able ro handle it since after a while of dating I told him about BPD and he read up on it and even highlighted and annotated a book about it, just to study and better handle what could happen. But he did not handle the stress well when I break down did come, he tried to leave but ended up wanting to stay, and I felt good about his choice at first since I did not beg or freak out when he brought it up, I tried to just talk about our issues. However trying to leave 3 months in really set something off in me, immediately I sowed seeds of abandonment and left me paranoid. 

As time went on I still had breakdowns over something dumb every few months, but when he'd bring up something to me that upset him or hurt him, I'd always take the steps to start changing, and more often than not I'd stop the bad behavior he pointed out. I was lucky of he pointed it out though, he had a fear of confrontation and as he told me ""I didn't make it easy for him."" I know it should be easier for me to see what I'm doing wrong but sometimes it was hard, I told him he'd need to spell it out for me, and there's times I'd get really defensive and mad when he did. I'd always apologize afyer the fact and tell him I overreacted and that he's in the right to feel that way. I ALWAYS made sure to tell him his feelings were valid and good and I tried my best to take accountability, even of he had to point out my wrongdoings. 

Though I'd have these bad times, I will say I didn't insult him, I never uses shoes like or SH as a threat and I'd take accountability for myself feeling like that, when he was upset with me I'd even be sure to avoid talking about those feelings so he wouldn't associate them with his own emotions towards me. 

But eventually he tried to leave again, showing me no warnings and coming home and breaking the news to me a year into the relationship. I yet again, just sat there and tried to talk about it and we worked though things... only for him to do it again the next day and decide to stay AGAIN. At that point I was horrified. Always scared he's going to go and not knowing when it would happen. He wouldn't talk to me about any issues he had when they came up. He would give me the chance to talk about anything or seek any help cuz he wouldn't even let me know when he felt I was doing something wrong. I shouldn't have been so blind to it and I know that, but I thought I was trying. I tried so hard on the things he wanted fixed. I tried.

He stayed after that though. Flash forward 3 more months, I have the worst week I've had in our relationship, I was very aware of my wrong doings and told him everytime, but it didn't change how I was feeling. We were on a time crunch to get my me drivers license, I have college starting up in 2 weeks, and he's supposed to leave town for the first time for a week. This is all happening at the same time and I was horrified. I even broke down crying during my behind the wheel test and things hadn't been feeling too real for a few weeks, I didn't feel ready for any of it and because of it I felt like a failure. On top of that I felt I needed to be afraid of him leaving, like I NEEDED that fear. I knew he was stressed too because of how I felt and I knew I wasn't handling stuff well. Eventually I broke down, I was sobbing and yelling about how I wanted to die, I told him it's cuz I felt like a failure, because if I couldn't handle getting my license how am I supposed to handle school. This break down soon flipped into me yelling at him that he's going to leave. I KNEW my breakdowns were too much and I felt like he was going to go again for it, it felt inevitable.

The next day happens and all the bad feelings built up, and for the first time in 2 years I relapsed on self harm. When I got home that night i told him, and I told him I stopped because it wasn't worth it to myself to fall back into that behavior. I also told him that I was scared to tell him because I thought he'd leave if I got that weak and hurt myself. I was right, he left. He told me after he saw the mark on my leg he gave up on me. I know it's selfish to expect him to stay after that, but I really wish he did. I didn't want him to fix me, just to be there for me and talk about ways to get over this stress

After everything he came by to talk to me and told me all these things i had no clue he felt during our relationship. Things that I felt, if they were talked about, really could have been worked on and fixed, but he told me ""it's just not worth it"". He didn't want to stick around and work on anything. If he had mentioned couples therapy I would have done it in a heartbeat, if he had just needed space I would have done it in a moment, no guilt involved. 

He mentioned feeling like I didn't want him to see his siblings alone BUT HE NEVER TRIED. HE NEVER BROUGHT IT UP ONCE. I even asked him ""why haven't you seen you siblings in a whileyou should make plans soon."" But he decided that meant nothing. I tell him ""hey you should play the piano or do *insert hobby here* today, and I'll just play a video game"" but he decided I wanted him glued to me at all times. And undeniably there WERE times like that. I wanted him in the same room as me a lot, I wanted to he near him, but he never once told me that wasn't okay. He always entertained it, I didn't know. If he wasn't happy I wish he would have at least told me. Inwish he would have at least given me a chance. 

He also said i shouldn't ever ""subject"" someone to my thoughts of SH. I feel so destroyed. This was supposed to be my first healthy relationship and I did mess up, I did breathe down his neck too much but if he had at least talked to me I feel like i could have tried.

Always through restriction of my food, or sleep, NEVER cutting . Either way my suicidal ideation has gotten insanely worse since I started. I was feeling this urge so I decided to write my feelings down hoping that would process some of this emotion.

This writing upset my horribly. I’ve never been this into suicide in all of my 10 years of dealing with Depression and BPD. I’m very scared to be alone with myself . Have any of you experienced this?

I know I am the problem, and I want to fix it because I feel so bad and resentful towards how I treat him, I sometimes think it would be better if he just let go of me. But even though he is visibly hurt, he said we can find a solution.
I am just afraid that if I don't do anything now this is just a preview of how our relationship will be always, if it continues.

Some quick context: we were in a long-distance until we moved in together last june, in a completely new country where neither of us know the language.
So I have seeked help, but since I cannot speak the language at an advanced level, there are not enough resources, meaning English-speaking therapists here. And where there are, in a different city and can do video-sessions, they are extremely expensive for me to be able to afford now.

Now, I know DBT is the main treatment for BPD, but since I have no way of going to therapy right now, I was wondering if there is any way to self-teach?

72,What Is the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD?," Mental Disorders (DSM).

There's no biologically based test to definitively diagnose borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, mental health professionals often use screening instruments such as the MSI-BPD to help identify the likelihood of BPD and the need for further evaluation and treatment.

Scoring of the MSI-BPD

Each item is rated as a ""1"" if it is present and a ""0"" if it is absent, and items are totaled for possible scores from 0 to 10. A score of 7 is considered a valid diagnostic cutoff, meaning that a score of 7 or higher indicates that you likely meet the criteria for a BPD diagnosis.2

The first eight items of the MSI-BPD represent the first eight DSM-IV/5 diagnostic criteria for BPD, while the last two items assess the final DSM-IV/5 criterion, i.e., **paranoia/dissociation.**

## Uses for the MSI-BPD

Clinicians use the MSI-BPD to diagnose BPD, sometimes in conjunction with other screening tools. Research suggests the MSI-BPD is helpful in detecting BPD in the general population,3 but more studies are needed.

The MSI-BPD test has been shown to be very effective in detecting possible BPD in people who are seeking or have a history of treatment for mental health problems.

## Psychometric Properties

The MSI-BPD has demonstrated valid, reliable psychometric properties. It has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It has also demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for detecting borderline personality disorder when a score of 7 is used as a diagnostic cutoff.

[**Coping With Borderline Personality Disorder**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095SHGB9N) 

## Other Screening Tools

The MSI-BPD is only one of several that clinicians typically use to diagnose BPD. These include the following.  


Structured Clinical Interview

This official clinical interview of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is an update of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) but is very similar.4 Your mental health professional may use this screening tool to help determine your diagnosis by asking you questions directly related to the criteria for BPD that are listed in the DSM-5.

This screening instrument also has an optional self-reporting questionnaire with 108 questions, but not all clinicians who choose the SCID-5-PD use this. 

Causes of Borderline Personality Disorder

PDQ-4

The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, 4th Edition (PDQ-4) screening test consists of 99 true-or-false questions that can help screen for various personality disorders, including BPD.5

Zanarini Rating Scale

The Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD), also developed by Dr. Zanarini, is used for patients who have already been diagnosed with BPD to test for changes over time.1

Which Tool Is Best?

A recent study comparing correlations, sensitivity, and specificity among the MSI-BPD, PDQ-4, and SCID-II in adolescents and young adults showed they were equally effective in predicting a BPD diagnosis.6 On the other hand, another study concluded that the PDQ-4 ""should not be used in clinical practice as a screening instrument for PD assessment.""7

## Impact of BPD Screening

BPD is challenging to diagnose and treat because it's so often misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder and other conditions. Further complicating the issue is that BPD often exists with comorbidities, including bipolar disorder, and poses a significant risk of suicide.8 That makes accurate screening tools such as the MSI-BPD particularly important.  


Once BPD is diagnosed, the clinician can develop a treatment plan to address it. This might include such targeted approaches as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), which has been shown to be effective for people with BPD.8  


## Potential Pitfalls of the MSI-BPD

Tests such as the MSI-BPD provide a picture of person's mental status only at a particular point in time. Astute clinicians additionally take into account the person's patterns of behavior over time.9

&#x200B;

BPD is a particularly difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. Research indicates that the MSI-BPD is a valuable tool in this effort, however, and takes very little time to complete. Based on the results, a clinician can then help you address BPD's challenges and learn healthy ways to cope with and regulate your emotional states and responses.",1647850548.0,False,3,1,redditerX75,None,tj6rq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/tj6rq5/what_is_the_mclean_screening_instrument_for_bpd/
73,"FPs are a trauma reenactment response, and I think this isn't talked about enough at all.","Why is it that wherever I go around finding resources and support on how to cope with FPs, it's always either:

- romanticising the FP relationship as ""omg extreme crushy dopamine obsession!""
- expecting the FP to fulfil all your BPD needs/being genuinely toxic as hell towards them (because surprise, what we have is a DISORDER) and then calling them ableist for daring to speak up about it
- like it's a normal thing with BPD (which ventures into anti-recovery territory)?

I find it genuinely disturbing, honestly. 

FPs are at their core a *trauma reenactment response*. They form because subconsciously, that person reminds you of a past caretaker or abuser, whose treatment of you as a child caused you to develop BPD to begin with. 

I theorise it's almost the brain's way of gaining control over past trauma or recreating past scenarios as it's what it subconsciously knows and grew to cope with.

Maybe they are nice to you in a way you wish your past caretakers could have been, or maybe they're dismissive because they're busy and then give you a lot of attention when they do have the time. They're most likely not abusive like your former caretakers, but unfortunately your brain gets hooked. 

That's why we split on them. If they were normal healthy things, we wouldn't freaking split on them. We wouldn't subconsciously *project our trauma onto them.* 

And yes, when this happens, it is very very easily to unintentionally hurt and be very very toxic towards an FP. They don't exist to heal our trauma, and they can't, anyway. At least not permanently nor healthily. Keeping you in that dopamine spiral is NOT it.

I hate how there's so many ""how to create a healthy FP relationship"" posts too. I feel like that term is a contradiction in itself, because an FP relationship is never going to be inherently healthy if the root cause is a trauma reenactment bond. If it's healthy then, well, it's not an FP anymore. 

Long textpost (not sure about flair either) but I'm just disturbed by the lack of research on what causes FPs and the blatant disregard for their roots, aka trauma that should be healed.",1667542978.0,False,100,20,Illustrious_Mine_915,None,ylqrjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ylqrjv/fps_are_a_trauma_reenactment_response_and_i_think/

We lost contact for 6 months afterwards and he came back because he couldn't stop thinking about me. And neither could I. We both were going through alot at the time so we had drifted apart. But now we were both single. I traveled 12 hours to see him. He was going to see me but I told him I wanted go for a road trip instead. It was instant chemistry. I'd never felt this way in my intire life (I'm 33 he is 30) about anyone before and I did not know it was possible for human feelings such as this to exist. He was the same. Even being in long-term relationships before, felt like nothing compared. We kept crying because I had to go back home eventually. But when I got home, things changed. I changed. I wanted everything and more for him. I wanted to treat him amazing. I wanted to be everything he deserved... But no matter how hard I tried, I knew my bpd was sabotaging it before my very eyes...I tried so so hard... I had been going to threapy for many years prior but I have been told that my case is incredibly resistant to treatment. Even since I young age. I have been on every med under the sun and every different threapy known to man. Even shock treatment. I have also had brain damage which has made my emotions ten times worse and I just try the best I can to achieve some kind of help from this exhausting disorder whenever I can but it's definitely a diffcult journey!! Anyhow, seeing my disorder slowly destroy my relationship Infront of me felt like someone else was taking over my body and deciding to react in all these types of ways I did not want to react in. It was like watching someone else take hold that didn't feel like me, but yet I couldn't control at the time regardless if the tools I used. 

Watching someone you love so so deeply being hurt by you is the most painfuliest thing I've ever gone through...
And the 1 thing I'd never in this world want to happen to them was happening by me! It's now been 4 months and I am blocked on everything and I don't expect a message back ever again. I truly hate myself for this and it seems the more I love someone, the more I must hurt them . I only wanted the very best for him but I couldn't even do that .. I know he wasn't the best ether sometimes but given the circumstances I can understand why. As much as it hurts me, I just hope he finds happiness and someone who can give him everything that I cannot archive or have not achieved in the last 10 years of threapy. I just want him to be happy ... As I write this, I'm crying non stop because I don't think I will ever find someone like that again. But it's not about me or what I want. It's about what they need, and they need someone stable. And after the horrific childhood I have endured for many years, bpd is the least of my concerns for the disoders I have.

76,Feeling Lack of Social Support,"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with BPD about six months ago after years and years of being told I just had anxiety. And while my psychiatrist is really really good, I feel like I need more reassurance and time to talk then just one person can provide. And in the course of my recovery I keep hearing that social support is so important, and while I’d love to be able to reach out to friends, I’ve kind of lived my life in such a a way that I destroyed most of my relationships over time .

I guess my question is that I just feel really lonely a lot of the time and I’m sometimes hopeless about the possibility of things ever getting better. Has anyone managed to rebuild a healthy support system after treatment?

77,I think I’m recovered,"never thought it would be possible even a year ago. But after my last hospitalization I told myself I was going to change my life and was no longer gonna let my life be ruled by my BPD. It’s almost exactly a year since I was hospitalized and I don’t recognized the person I used to be. I used to be so skeptical of DBT or any therapy/therapists because I thought I was smarter than them/it. It seriously seemed so dumb to me for so long which is why I never received treatment when I was younger. I can’t attribute all of my recovery to DBT but I did find it more helpful than anything else. Anyway the point of this is that YOU CAN CHANGE NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CANNOT. I realized I’m too smart to be blaming my mental illnesses and instead dedicated months of my life to researching how to heal myself and change my life. At this point I no longer fit the criteria for BPD diagnosis. There is this indescribable sadness or emptiness that came with recovery though- after realizing how much of my life I missed out of, how much my identity was tied to bpd, how many of my life decisions came out of my inability to regulate my emotions, etc. but there is hope in this emptiness … I can create the person I want to become and u can too",1675293186.0,False,17,2,pinklilies27,None,10r9fw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/10r9fw1/i_think_im_recovered/
78,Remission/Recovery Resources for the Sticky Temperamental Traits of BPD,"Thanks to a year of DBT, my BPD symptoms are in remission, and I've been below the diagnostic criteria threshold for about a year and a half. 

I continue to practice DBT. I consider myself to be really rigorous and recovery-oriented, much like someone in substance abuse recovery might. 

I know that people like us have functional deficits, even in recovery, that are linked to temperamental traits (irritability, mood lability, negativity bias, impulsivity, etc). These deficits are the reason that only half of us go on to achieve normal interpersonal and vocational functioning after our BPD symptoms have gone into remission.

Here's the question: Does anyone have any post-treatment resources for those of us whose BPD symptoms are in remission but who want to maximize our functionality at work and in our relationships? Any resources that deal with temperamental problems as opposed to just behavior/thoughts?

82,Relationships with other people w/ complex comorbid psychiatric disorders?,"(26m) Over the past 10 years of my life I've seen a multitude of therapists & other mental healthcare providers, and I've been diagnosed with Bipolar I/PTSD/BPD/OCPD/anxiety/SUD. 

I've had 3 serious relationships in my adult life, all of them with other people who have complex comorbid psychiatric disorders of their own. Partner no 1: Depression/BPD/anxiety. Partner no 2: Mania/anxiety/SUD. Partner no 3: PTSD/DID/Bipolar I/possibly ASPD/SUD.

Each relationship was it's own spectacular disaster, each one more unhealthy & intense than the last. The final one especially has left me feeling broken.

As someone with BPD/OCPD and other psychiatric issues, am I just not meant to have a partner that has problems similar to mine? Is it just too much strain on a relationship, period? Or was the issue with my specific partners not being willing to get the treatment they need? I'd like to think someone who understands could be compatible with me.

It's just that I'm on disability too, and I really could have used that $600 towards food and clothing for my daughter and I.

That said, I was approved for group therapy paid for by the government, so she has expressed feeling as though it's unfair that she either has to wait for a spot or pay for it herself.

He had experience with an exwBPD. He frequently brought up how she hurt him so I felt pressured to conceal all of my BPD traits. If I came even close to criticizing him, he accused me of splitting. This further pushed me into idealization.

Yesterday, he told me that he never loved me. It hurt. But I realized that finally acknowledging to myself the bad parts of the relationship and the bad things he did is not pathological. I can even choose to place emphasis on the bad rather than the good to help me move on. I don’t want to make the mistake of going back to him; this is not the first time that he broke up with me.

Maybe some day I can remember him more fondly. Today, I can say that he is a sad little egomaniac who fed on my love and gave me nothing but anxiety.

90,THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to. 

Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

(FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.)

EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

“The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.”

91,Triggered by being minimized,"I just realized today that my biggest trigger is being minimized/invalidated. When somebody pushes these buttons I get incredibly angry and I sometimes can’t control myself. This can lead to me latching on to a problem/situation with a person and not be able to let go. 

I realized this because I was having to interact with someone at work who kept saying things to me that made me feel minimized. It also felt like he was not acknowledging his mistakes or the work I had done to fix said mistakes. I blew up at him because I felt like he was not listening to me and minimizing what I was saying. For example, I was upset that he was contacting me/expecting me to fix his mistakes on my days off so I told him that that was inappropriate to do. His reaction was “I understand that you don’t like being contacted on your days off” this felt minimizing to me because it made it seem like I was the one asking for special treatment when in reality he was expecting me to do work without compensation. In my mind it doesn’t matter what I think, my coworker having that expectation is inappropriate full stop. 

I got in a little bit of trouble with one of our bosses for doing that and had to have a sit down conversation where I was told that I should have handled it better and used a nicer tone of voice. I tried using a nicer tone of voice and tried to talked to about five other people before I blew up at this guy and nobody was listening or fixing the problems. The manager did reassure me that my anger was reasonable and the complaints I brought forth were fair. 

It’s just embarrassing to be told that your’e too much by people who push you bit and bit past your anger point. I don’t like exploding but I don’t know how else to be heard. 

I guess my questions are:
- Now that I know being minimized/not listened to/invaladated is a trigger, how do I go about managing it while also not being a complete push over? 

- How do I let things go? I feel like a dog in attack mode who is latched onto a bite and can’t unhook my jaw but everyone is just treating this like it’s an easy simple choice.

92,Questions fo Men with BPD,"I see that most people with BPD seem to be women, but I read an article saying that its because of men not seeking treatment, so the institutions can't record them as often. This gave me a relief as I thought me having BPD in the wrong gender made things worse (I know, that sounds stupid). I have never met a male with BPD myself, but I would like to ask these questions to the guys here. 

\- How do you deal with hiding your emotions in public/group settings when you get triggered? Men have stigma to show any extreme emotions after all, so I bet its more difficult than it is for women. 

\- Are you on any medication to treat BPD?

\- How do you deal with being alone for too long? Do you try to talk to absolutely anyone you can reach to avoid the feeling of being invisible? I know I do, it is very common for me to lose touch with reality and feel like Im vanishing from existence if I stay alone for more than a day.

I've been diagnosed with BPD last year (April), since then I was on meds for my symptoms (antidepressants and antipsychotics) it's been more than a month since my psychiatrist took me off meds.

95,"I know my brain is trying to protect me, but I don’t want these feelings anymore","It’s been a long journey. Lots of pit stops and roundabouts and detours and wrecks and repairs and general surreal debauchery along the way. I thought I was starting to get better at it. Until They (ex partner/ex fp) left and never came back. Never offered a gesture at closure. Not even a lazy shrug or flick of a finger…just nothing, forevermore.

I did DBT, CBT, and prolonged exposure for years. Worked my ass off. Poured endless sweat and tears into treatment and recovery until my heart was caked with the saltwater. But my heart also became large and strong during that time. I could feel the weight starting to lift, the demons start to retreat from my head. Then my lover, my best friend of almost 10 years, left me. I still do not understand why. Perhaps that was the problem. Why it happened I do not know, but I do know I shattered. Completely and utterly broke.

In September, it will have been 4 years since I spoke to that person. Not a word between us. Just empty white space where profound love used to be. Those years were spent desperately, clumsily, agonizingly trying to piece my jagged remains back together. To reform myself as a stronger individual and to once again be able to see a person staring back at me when I look in the mirror. A person who, while flawed, is growing and reasonably content and moving forward. 

[I think that might be the hardest part. Looking in the mirror and seeing yourself, but not seeing a person. I haven’t been able to make one out in my reflection for 4 years. Just hollow black circles meet my gaze. Nothingness.]

Try as I might, I cannot seem to even begin to put myself back together. No matter how much treatment I get or support I seek or love I give or receive, my shattered pieces only seem to degrade further. Turning slowly but surely to naught but dust. I have had 2 long term relationships since They left, and both were spectacular disasters. Beautiful, incredible, loving, passionate, toxic, dramatic, exhilarating disasters. As I write this, I am feeling the deep sting of losing another partner/fp, the second of those two disasters. There is nothing I can do to rid myself of this pain—there is only acceptance, which has started to feel incredibly numb and pointless. 

tl;dr—my BPD (along w comorbid trauma/anxiety/substance abuse/mood regulation disorders) symptoms have grown so monstrous. So inhuman, so horribly broken as they well up out of me. That I cannot seem to even start to heal from one lost relationship, let alone begin to think about starting a new, healthy relationship. Or even more importantly, that I cannot seem to find any minuscule way to start the process of healing and finding myself at my core. My emotions are completely out of control, and they consume and burn relationships and people like fire when they rise through me.

I have had around 10 years of therapy (of which three years of CBD) and  several diagnoses (attachment disorder, childhood abuse/neglect, ptsd, adhd, ED,  unspecified personality disorder among other smaller stuff). A lot of these have not been taken seriously or disregarded by other specialists because I was too young, too unstable or the diagnoses were clashing. Which is all valid. but i felt like I am in a calmer and more stable environment so I can get properly diagnosed.

Now they told me that I do seem like I have a high functioning personality disorder that seems to be BPD. BUT. i am too high functioning. they literally told me I seem to have ""beaten"" it already. I am 21 years old, which seems kinda unlikely to me as neither myself nor any of my friends or family think I am mentally healthy enough to go without any diagnosis or treatment and now I am stuck with the diagnosis of reoccurring depression - which in no way explains my extreme mood swings, dissociative episodes and occasional psychotic episodes. Feeling depressed is honestly the least of my worries.

BPD is rooted in both sides of my family and several specialists have told me I do check most of the boxes. I don't know what to do, my FP just left me because I am too difficult and too depressed and dysfunctional for him to handle. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this and I don't know how to get a second opinion (I'm in the UK). In the meantime I am unable to do any uni work and am without a job due to the pandemic and I just spend all day in bed trying to get through the day without making things worse, while my mental health gets worse every day.

My symptoms are fucking up my life so much and I am so done feeling this way and being so dysfunctional all the time and not having any stability regarding the people in my life. I just wanna be normal. I don't wanna drink or get high to not feel anymore, I don't wanna keep isolating myself from the people I care about because I'm scared I'll hurt their feelings or do something that'll end up in them leaving me. I don't wanna be this way I wanna work my way to being somewhat normal, and yet I am ""too high functioning"" to be treated. I feel hopeless and like all this is never gonna go away and I don't know how to keep living this life without any proper help or understanding from my surroundings....

What do I do? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

99,intensive DBT program without any processing work is destabilizing me to the point I'm terrified,"I have bipolar 1 as well. I was seeing a one on one for years doing processing work for trauma but once I was accepted to the BPD DBT program my other services were no longer covered (in Canada, while some services are govt covered, there are often stipulations). 

I see a psychologist who specializes in DBT for an hour every Tuesday and have group every Thursday for 2.5 hours. I also have access to phone coaching. While I'm beyond grateful for this support, I'm realizing how vital the processing piece is for me. Like many of us, I have C-PTSD and multiple events of PTSD. 

My mood is really destabilized, not just emotional dysregulation, but the bipolar component too is being deeply affected. I feel like I have no time to recover between sessions so I'm just always feeling unstable these days. I can't afford therapy that isn't covered. I don't know what to do. 

Group yesterday triggered me so hard, a particular group member, and I slept on and off for 16 hours since. I had to disconnect twice because I was about to lash out at her.

It's very painful and frustrating for the closest person to me to doubt my truth constantly. I see no other solution but ending the relationship to find a partner who doesn't have the same history with me bc my partner seems incapable of seeing me as I really am now, and just sees what he expects to see - which feels like, no matter what I'm upset about, it must be splitting or attachment issues and couldn't possibly be valid. That's the message I get, and I don't know how to have a healthy relationship with someone who believes this. Not to mention it makes me much less likely to catch when I am making assumptions or have an unnecessarily negative read of a situation because I'm distracted by pain and frustration of his Invalidation as a default position.

However, the difference is, I have done a lot of work and I no longer feel I fit the diagnosis nor react or feel or show any symptoms or BPD much at all anymore. I'm now in my 30s and was diagnosed very young. 

My partner has not had much treatment and is easily triggered and reactive. I do walk on eggshells util we see a psychologist because we are on a waiting list to see a couple and individual therapist. 

Im just having trouble with the emotional stress it's putting on me when he splits. Especially because I suffer seizures and trumua which is triggered by stress. He changes completely it's like night and day. And then he just threatens to leave me atleast twice a week and threatens suicide to make me feel bad instead of just owning upto his actions its always a victim mentality. You can't talk sense into him while his like this. He just gets worse and worse and pushes me away more and more unless I show affection towards him and then he will slowly let down his guard. But in that highly stressful moment I'm not feeling like being affectionate or loving towards him because it's not cool what his doing. He doesn't stop and if I ignore him he sees it as abandonment and gets more upset. But when he calms down his able to finally apologize. To a degree. He never used to be able to do that so it's been a big step for him. When his completely calm he now realizes he needs help and this can't continue. But I need advice on what to do when he gets like that. Being stern or telling him to stop makes it worse. But so does being silent. He is incredibly giving and nice when he is not triggered but when he is it's like a completely different person who says things about me and others he never normally would. He sees the world and everyone in it so drastically different when he is in this space and he even sounds Abit psychotic because sometimes it doesn't even make sense what his ranting on about. We live together and I have come accustom to how his mind works and he has told me he is sick of living like this. But in the meantime I need to find a plan so we can both remain sane when he starts getting triggered. Because he refuses to say his mad or triggered while his triggered and can take offense to it. Whilist I need a way to isolate until his calm. I also wanted to know why he keeps breaking up with me because I never have threatened that before even though I have BPD. I never completely understood it. It's like he wants me to beg him to stay or else he wants to leave. I feel it's unfair.

104,Therapy session too long? Dissociation / zoning out during session,"Hi all, I've had my diagnosis years, and due to a couple of very scary crises over the past couple of years, I'm now under the local mental health team (UK) and am starting my referral to the PD team. I've started having monthly one-to-ones with a specialist PD person (therapsit? nurse? I'm not sure of their title but they are full-time personality disorder worker). 

My session earlier this week was maybe my third of fourth session with them, and it just seemed soooo loooonggg. We did a catch-up, talked about some extreme emotions that I've been through this week, and then did some worksheets and paperwork. Then we started on relationships, and discussing healthy vs unhealthy. 

The thing is, by the end of the session, I was totally zoned out, I have no idea what we were on about, I had totally checked out. This is common for me when personal interactions have gone on for too long, and I have no idea how I come across to the other person. I feel like there is a lot of me just nodding and mm-hm -ing. 

I know is is kinda normal-ish for me, and probably for people with PD in general. Should I discuss this with my therapist? Should I say I have no idea what happened in the last part of our session? I don't know how to handle this going forward, and how to get the most out of our sessions if I just start checking out during them. 

I would love to hear your approach to this, and ideas on what I could do. I know I'm incredibly fortunatle to be getting this treatment. I had my origional EUPD diagnosis in 2002, and this was reconfirmed last year as 'complex' BPD (same thing, their words, not mine) with a bit of ASPD.",1582879340.0,False,10,22,badgerhoneyy,None,fars15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fars15/therapy_session_too_long_dissociation_zoning_out/

I was so shaken up when I started..it felt like preemptively mourning parts of myself, if that makes sense. But I stuck with it and 3 months in I'm seeing a tremendous amount of progress.

 I have an hour with a one on one and 2.5 hours of skills group every week in addition to phone coaching during business hours. The appointments with my one on one have shown me so much about how and why I developed the patterns I have. Getting to the root of... everything...is helping me cultivate self compassion which I have never had previously and learning to use skills and consequently reducing destructive behaviours is helping me gain a level of confidence I didn't think possible. It feels like every week I'm having a breakthrough...it's wild. Mind you I'm 38 and have been ""doing the work"" for 4 years now, (I didn't receive the BPD diagnosis until 2 years ago, I just thought all my symptoms were from bipolar disorder, which I also have).

 It's just so wild to me to feel like recovery is actually possible. Not like I expect BPD to ever fully recede but I do believe it's possible to experience long periods of remission. I want to siphon every drop of this 6 month program. I know I'm lucky and not everyone can access treatment and that is enraging because we all deserve it..but yeah...if you can access DBT I can't recommend it enough, if you're ready to do the work.

108,BPD/EUPD Support Group! <3,"My name is Daisy Sky (she/her) and I am a Couples & Family Therapist in training! Nice to meet you, fellow BPD brains <3

I will be offering a 12-session support group for those who struggle with borderline personality disorder/emotionally unstable personality disorder this summer! This group is for you if you have trouble regulating your emotions, you struggle in your interpersonal relationships, you find yourself making impulsive and potentially destructive decisions (do they even feel like decisions??), you have an unstable sense of identity, and/or you find yourself frequently ruminating on the past or future. This group is also for you if you have a loved one who is struggling with these symptoms. While the group is centered around the struggles of those with BPD/EUPD, you do not need to identify with this condition to be welcome in the space.

Group will be held on Zoom from 7:00-8:30pm PST on Wednesdays, dates listed below. In group, I will share a new skill each week, and open up space for sharing and discussion. This group is NOT a substitute for therapy, rather a supplemental peer support space. I have been managing EUPD for over a decade, and I have lots of resources and compassion to share with those whose lives have been touched by this painful condition 📷 Influences will be drawn from my own personal therapy, as well as teachings from my MACFT program. I will be drawing from evidence-based treatments for BPD, and this group will have a strong mindfulness component, with recommended weekly journaling/practice assignments. Please share with anyone who you think would benefit; I think it's going to be a beautiful space!

Energy exchange/financial support is negotiable on a sliding scale, with discounts given to those who sign up for the entire series, BIPOC, and trans folx. NOTAFLOF! Drop-ins are also welcome! If you would like to have your camera off and remain anonymous, that is also completely acceptable, and we will have group agreements regarding communication and confidentiality. Sessions will not be recorded.

109,Relationship dilemma,"BPD, CPTSD, Bipolar 2

Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688449467.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q68cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14q68cv/relationship_dilemma/

111,I don't know what to do with this realization.,"  If I sit still for more than a little while, my mind starts to fantasize suicide and self harm for all the perceived wrongs I've done. I become filled with hopelessness and desperation. So I clean, I can't sit still. I must distract myself. I work until my back locks up (I have a herniated disc) and then I sit until the spasms stop, then I have to go again or I will start wanting to harm myself. The next day, I will wake up and be angry at myself for being in pain from pushing myself so hard, then I become despondent at my inability to distract myself, so I push through the pain. This lasts about 4 days then I give up, I lose myself in a game or watching videos, falling deeper into self loathing until I melt-down. I spend a day in complete mental crisis, suicidal ideation and self destructive thoughts, affecting those around me, lost in my own head. The next day I am renewed and must do things to keep myself from falling down again. It feels endless.

I didn't realize the constant stress I was experiencing just from the worry that he was dying. Now, no more pain for him, no more breathing treatments, no more making him eat.

112,My friend with bpd seems to hate me,"My friend was recently diagnosed with bpd, she’s also recently divorced. We got super close after her divorce even had something sexual for a time after. She would call and text me all the time, call me venting about life and I’d just listen. This went on for almost a year, we became extremely close spent most weekends together and she would always either ask to hangout, or be down to do something. Recently over the last month things have changed. In June she found out that her ex husband had moved on and found a new girlfriend. She called me crying and wanting to hurt herself. I talked her out of it and went over cuddled her until she fell asleep and then I left. Since then she has started changing, she seems annoyed to be around me, if I ask what’s wrong she flips out, she’s kicked me out of her house twice for trying to hold her while she’s upset. She admitted to me about a month ago that she and her ex husband and her never stopped sleeping together, that they had only been living apart. I asked why she kept it a secret she said she didn’t want to lose me. She then admitted that two weeks after seeing the exs new girlfriend she started talking to a guy she met on a site. They in just a month they are talking all day, have been on 8 dates, FaceTime at least three times a week, and they are going on weekend away trips. She’s rescheduling her kids and other friends to make sure she can squeeze him in, all while complaining she has not time for anything. I told her therapy is something to look into. She got herself set up and started going. I went with her to her first session and after the therapist asked if I was aware that she showed traits of bpd. I asked what it was and the therapist explained. They set her up for an evaluation and the doctor said it bpd was indeed the case. The therapist set up therapy for us together because she doesn’t have much family. The first session was brutal she never liked me, she couldn’t stand me, I wasn’t her type, she finds me disgusting, I’m annoying, I’m a bother, I’m a crybaby, I’m not her thing, I force her to sleep with me(not true at all), I cause nothing but drama. She goes back in the timeline and say she felt a particular way at whatever point but I can tell you the things she says didn’t happen and I actually at that time got something completely different. She does this with her ex husband as well she says she felt certain ways but he says that there was no way, that they actually were really good at the points she says they weren’t. The therapist says she editing the timeline with intrusive thought to try and justify behaviors. She We had , had  sex two weeks prior to the session and she actually asked me for it  and about two weeks before that same thing. When I asked about the guy she’s going away with she gets angry, she gets dismissive and says I’m bothering her. She’s been talked out of quitting therapy twice because if the therapist brings up the guy she gets big mad. When we see eachother I get the complete opposite treatment as long as I don’t bring up the guy. Shes also when given examples of fp or devaluing says she doesn’t see it that everyone is just making it up to make her sound crazy, she’s living life as a normal person would. When you point out that she’s doing thing out of the norm you are the issue. I miss my friend take away the sex and this is my friend someone I care about a lot.

114,It actually does get better,"I was cleaning my kitchen today, and the song Wake Up Alone by Amy Winehouse came on.

This song and the whole album (Back To Black is basically BPD: The Album, seriously, if you haven’t heard it and feel safe to do so, have a listen CW for substance abuse) are associated with one of my lowest times of my life ever.

I started crying immediately as I felt those feelings flood back. The desperation, the loneliness, the overwhelming fear. All the nights crying, staring at my phone, calling them over and over and over in a dissociative haze. The way I only felt like an actual person when I was with someone, actively being focused on, giving myself wholly and completely to them. The numerous attempts to find ANYTHING that would dull the ache inside of me. The pure fear of night, and the crushing blow of waking up alone.

There’s a part in it that used to resonate with me so much:

“Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets”

I used to fear night time and being on my own so much. But here I was, it’s the evening, I’m alone in my kitchen cleaning after a nice meal, happily singing along to music. No fear, no dread, actually a “silent sense of content.”

It’s been about 10 years since that awful time, and things have changed. I got treatment, found a loving stable partner, who I have great communication with, have a pleasant and safe life. I’m not saying I’m cured, or I’m 100% happy all the time, in fact I’m currently in therapy to do trauma processing.

But I don’t feel THAT feeling anymore. The desperation doesn’t hit me like that any longer. I don’t have that crushing pain in my chest that drives me to do ANYTHING I can to get rid of it, no matter the cost. I still feel a version of it on occasion but it doesn’t command me.

I’m no longer living my life running away as fast as I can from that feeling.

10 years ago I could have never ever believed it. I thought I’d be stuck with it for life. I wish I could have told me then it wouldn’t last, there was relief ahead.

So, if you’re in the thick of it right now, please believe me, from someone who’s been tear stained and aching too, one day you’ll just be happily tidying your kitchen, and the feeling you feel right now will be a distant memory.

115,hitting rock-bottom,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439573.0,False,1,7,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ad08qo/hitting_rockbottom/
116,Skills for dealing with intense emotion,"I posted this in the regular BPD sub but had zero responses and I'm feeling desperate and alone. I'm hoping that I'll have more luck here. The situation: I'm in my second week of inpatient ED treatment and I've never felt so emotionally disregulated IN. MY. LIFE.

I have (quiet) BPD, and my emotions are UNBEARABLE lately, especially since I don't have access to my unhealthy coping mechanisms (food restriction, substance abuse and self-harm) OR a one-on-one therapist. I just feel like I'm going to go nuts if I don't figure out skills that actually help. They're not teaching us formal DBT (the handouts are ""inspired by"" Linehan's DBT sheets) and this isn't going to change so I need to find some alternatives. My biggest struggle rn is whether I'm ""sick enough"" or that things were ""serious enough"" to warrant me being here, and I've been looking up narrative therapy because I'm a writer and feel like this could help give me perspective. Does anyone have experience with this? Or can link me to some reliable resources? Are there any other skills other than TIP and accepts?

117,How do you manage to ever get out of a BPD relationship,"Im diagnosed CPTSD but early last year saw the downward spiral of a seven year relationship and I found myself full of excruciating emotions that wouldn’t let up. I’ve lived in a constant state of dysregulation since. I initiated the break up because I wanted to focus on myself and getting more stable but within a month he met someone and quickly started a full-blown intense relationship. I lost my shit and reached out to him and he reciprocated. It’s been a downward spiral ever since. We have a seven year old together and he basically lives 25 percent in my apartment 25 percent with his gf and the rest of the time on campus. The first few months of his relationship we were hooking up and he was telling me he was looking for the right time to end it with her. I realised pretty quickly he was lying to both of us and was fine carrying on these toxic cycles because he somehow had a system to justify it all. I am NOT fine. At first I didn’t even understand what was happening to me. When he is around I’m dysregulated down to every cell. I can’t eat because Im so anxious. I cry and try to tell him how his choices are devastating me and are going to devastate that other woman. I’ve tried so so hard to detach but every time I think I’m making some progress my white knuckling and ignoring him as if he were heroin he catches me in a vulnerable position and I cave and the cycle starts again. I was able to put real distance between us for a couple weeks and felt better and more in control but he came by last night and I just felt so weak and alone and wiped out from battling this new me that I don’t even recognise that I fully caved, had sex with him, told him how I felt AGAIN and then as soon as I fell asleep he went back to the other woman‘s house. All day today I’ve spent trying to convey over text that he is destroying me and begging him to stop. Ofc I got nowhere. I don’t know the person he’s become either because despite ups and downs our relationship was healthy for the six preceding years. I don’t know how I’m going to make it through this when I’m already so weakened and I can’t even manage to go two weeks without doing the same thing. I’m so tempted to just contact the other woman and tell her everything so at least there’s some kind of a cut. But it seems s fucking petty. I feel stupid. I feel ashamed but mostly I feel so fucking weak anxious and exhausted. I am in fear and trembling that I’m always going to feel this way. If all of this is Bpd related and the only treatment is years of dbt just so the same thing can happen the moment you find yourself attached to someone what’s the point.

118,Idealization Comedown? Help???,"As many bpd relationships seem to go, I had an intense and toxic relationship with my ex where I idealised them. Even after the breakup, even after I got over my ex in a romantic light, I still measured my self-worth based on their commentary and expectations.   
However, after much time apart and almost a year of treatment, I saw them recently and realised just how completely...human they are. They're not unattractive but they're not the Adonis I made them out to be. I'm no longer attracted to them. Their behaviours and hobbies don't appeal to me anymore. I genuinely don't see how we could fit whatsoever as oppose to before where I thought they were everything good that could possibly happen to me. My rose coloured glasses have come off completely.  
This marks incredible progress and while proud, I'm also...at a loss?   


After spending so much of my time devaluing myself and measuring my worth by their ideals, I realise that part of my motivation to get better (even though I tried hard not to do so) was to prove my worth. Now that I recognise how unnecessary and flawed that is, I don't know how to direct that lingering energy and time I normally spend now that I'm no longer romanticising them.

119,I have BPD and I’m very concerned I won’t be able to have healthy and happy romantic and non romantic relationships.,"Hi. I have BPD (I think quiet borderline) and have done a course of DBT, which was very helpful. For the first time, I felt I was in a group with people who had similar experiences to mine - they are also some of the most thoughtful, reflective and caring people I’ve met. We have a WhatsApp group so we can text each other and suggest skills when someone is triggered and in a crisis. I have been resisting the label of “BPD” It’s very hard to read the information out there, especially on Reddit. 95% of people say “run” or “they are monsters”. I do have sensitivity to feelings of defectiveness (BPD) so this is majorly triggering that “panic button” but I also haven’t found any real positive stories to encourage me. I had a very emotionally abusive relationship with both parents - I think my mother has untreated BPD and absolutely explodes at anything. My first long term relationship when I was 20 was a toxic disaster. I really did try my best but I was not good at dealing with my emotions - I had pushed them away in order to focus on getting into university, otherwise it would have overwhelmed me in a debilitating way. My second serious relationship, when I was 26, was a lot better - it was very different to the first. I was much more considerate and aware of my emotions - I made sure never to neg him and give lots of validation etc. But I did still manage to make him feel like he was never good enough, because I would still be very down - it wasn’t lashing out exactly, but I would talk about my feelings of defectiveness and feeling of being unloved and I cried so much for no reason - I think saying I felt unloved felt very accusatory to him and like he was not measuring up / failing. He broke up with me, saying I had a “negative worldview when I had so many positive things going on”, but would also approach me after the breakup looking for emotional support, then just detach, which was really distressing and confusing. The last conversation we had he said he couldn’t communicate and didn’t feel heard or understood, but it’s also the way he’s felt his entire life. He also apologised for “emotionally unloading” on me, but that it was because I’m a good person and one person he “could really trust” but that he didn’t love me anymore. I felt absolutely deflated and hopeless after this experience because I had tried very hard to do things the right way, although I still acted in the way I described above. I’m very scared that, even with treatment, the relationship will still be too much for a “normal” person and I’ll end up driving them away. I isolate myself because I’m scared if I get to know people they’ll discover how I am emotionally and leave - that pain would be too great to bear.

Anyway I was told I'm be referred to this group session they have that last 6 months. And since they already one going I gotta wait till the fall.

So I was told to go do some research and what BPD is and way to cope till then. So far I found a bunch of video on what BPD is. And how to deal with someone who bpd. And what are the sign.

But finding video telling me how me as a person living with this condiction ( I don't wanna used the other word) I'm hard pressed to find anything. I swred expasaaly if you a man. It seem the general opinon is stay away he dramatic and lost cause.

122,(Crosspost) This video was extremely helpful,"I haven't intriduced myself, but have been following for a while, I am a 37 year old woman with BPD, diagnosis made a few months ago. Besides being an immediate danger to myself- which I am in intensive treatment for, the biggest issue is between me and my husband of 13 years. He still has a lot of trouble understanding what is going on, he feels like he is walking on eggshells (though I am more of a quiet pwBPD, he just does not want to make any depression worse). He says he feels like he s being asked to change things over night which is hard- I did a decent job hiding my symptoms for years and years. But right now I am not asking him to change anything, I am just asking for a lot of support and reassurance, more than he has ever given me before, because I am pretty much in crisis, the negative self image and abandonment issues are wildly out of control.

I think I was lead to Dr. Daniel Fox's You Tube page by a post here. He talks about so much stuff, it was a little overwhelming at first! I rarely check You Tube for new content, so I also added his account on IG. He posted a new video a few days ago called ""BPD and it's cause."" I've read a lot, so I didn't feel super unclear on that, but I like him, so I gave it a listen.

Please please please watch it. Whether you are a pwBPD or someone close to a pwBPD. Yes there is some discussion of cause, but it is a very clear picture of what BPD looks like and feels like. The first part he is reading from a textbook, which I didn't feel described me 100%, but then he takes it an puts it in simple terms. It is very hopeful and helps explain when a lot of us are not 100% sure how to understand or even explain what happens inside us.

My husband, who has been somewhat resistant to learning about BPD even though I really feel it would help us communicate better even said it was helpful.

123,FP left over a year and a half ago and I can't move on,"I'd like to preface this by saying I am not interested in hearing how pathetic I am that I haven't moved on yet or how unhealthy it is. I am well aware. I am seeking advice on how I can move on and am wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation.

I had a pretty intense relationship with my ex FP. She (I am also a woman) could be very kind and sweet, was there for me, was patient and understanding. Sometimes she'd suddenly turn cold and would give me the silent treatment for a week knowing how much it triggered me. Then she'd go back to saying she loves me so much and I'm such a wonderful and amazing person. At the end of December 2020, I ended up splitting from the stress of the relationship and when I woke up the next morning she had blocked me everywhere without a word.

I haven't been able to move on all this time. I know it was unhealthy but it was also the only relationship in my life where I had felt seen and understood and loved. We has so much in common, liked all the same stuff. We'd talk for hours every day. She encouraged the FP thing, saying she liked that I was attached to her/dependent on her (I realized that was unhealthy too). 

Despite being able to recognize the unhealthy aspects of it, when it was good, it was really good, and I miss that so much. I have comorbid autism so it's extremely difficult for me to find friends who are willing to put up with me. I've been alone most of this time. I've seen a few therapists, and they all have different things to say, some think it's possible she was a narcissist and others think it was a mutually unhealthy relationship... None of them have had any advice on how to move on, other than pointing out that it seems like I'm now in complicated grief and possibly a trauma bond.

It's so scary to go from talking to someone every day to them not even acknowledging your existence. Sometimes I worry I just hallucinated our whole relationship. I'll still admittedly reach out to her every once in a while in hopes that it'll have been long enough I could at least get some closure, but nope... I think the lack of closure is one of the hardest parts of it since she ghosted me.

I feel like an empty shell without her. When we were friends it felt like I finally had a purpose, a reason to get out of bed. I wanted to be there for her in any way I could. I did have romantic feelings for her that were unrequited, but she had known about those a year and a half prior to her leaving. 

Even knowing it was unhealthy, I want her to come back. I feel like my time stopped when she left and it can't move on until she comes back.

(Sorry for rambling, I think it's an autism thing but I struggle a lot with being concise and overexplaining)

TLDR: Can't move on from ex FP. It was a pretty intense relationship and the first time I ever felt loved and understood, though it was pretty unhealthy.

124,need a reality check please: reflection after a breakup :),"hi all! i havent yet been officially diagnosed with BPD as it’s extremely difficult to get an appointment with a psychiatrist and I’ve been completely blind to my issues (repressing them lmao) and my family and friends enabled me for so long I could never take accountability + always making myself be the victim. anyways, i met a guy in the summer..who after the first date told me he was scared to kiss me because I was “too pretty” for him etc. we clicked instantly and spent a lot of time together and got very personal and close very quickly. i was in a pretty level headed mind at the time, i was focusing on myself and wasn’t really looking for anything serious as i just got out of a treatment center 6 months prior (ED). 2 weeks into us talking he told me he has Bipolar, and I told him that I liked him for who he was and if his illness ever became too much..we would reevaluate but I enjoyed my time w/ him. after that conversation he told me he loved me. things were amazing still, and i continued talking with him and he asked me to be his girlfriend maybe a week or two after that. i told him due to an abusive ex I had trouble with insecurities and trust. after we started officially dating I noticed many girls on his Snapchat and made an immature remark to him regarding it and he got mad and I’m sure I continued to do other things that I don’t remember. he then deleted a message in front of me a few weeks later from a girl..on my birthday wishing her a happy birthday. i told him calmly that I don’t get mad at him for talking to women, but when he deletes things it looks suspicious. i found out that night that he was sending her paragraphs about nothing romantic when I had to beg him for a goodmorning text and he was talking horribly about me to his friends, we broke up. 
then to make a long story short, we were good from end of august to october (except I found out he was telling his friends I was crazy, which I probably am) I began to be very insecure and controlling/manipulative..I would get upset if he didn’t text me, and mad at him for liking girls instagram pictures, if he was too nice to women (and for some RIDICULOUS crazy things, like bringing my girl friend lunch so she didn’t feel left out). But my super irrational crazy behavior and clinginess didn’t start until I found out he texted the same girl from the first breakup again (I set the boundary that as long as I hung out with her since they were “friends” and he didn’t hide messages I had no issue, but neither happened) and he threatened to break up with me again, and then turned it around on me that I was being hypocritical (that I had a guy friend of 6 years who also has a girlfriend, and is not my type). Then admittedly I became the problem even though he had changed for the better, and he could not deal with me toxic behavior and left. It was going to be a break until he found out I told my ex-coworker about him having Bipolar after our first breakup and someone else told him I was crazy to my ex when I was 14 and dated for 1 month.
Anyway, I did victimize myself and make him look bad (I think???) to family and friends. But I hate myself for fucking this up, he was amazing to me and I wish I didn’t get so insecure and mad and clingy over some SUPER petty things and I wish i didn’t overshare his personal information to people whenever I felt hurt. But my question is, am I as crazy as I feel and was this all my fault? The girl he was texting called me crazy and blocked me, but he admitted to me that she was into him, I am always questioning my sanity and whether any of this happened or if my brain made it all up to again paint myself as the victim.

I self dx bpd a few months ago. I know I have it; it isn't a mystery. I've made almost my entire life about it. I've learned so much. I've talked with others and posted in different subs to get advice, or to even give advice. I've listened to so many different podcasts and read studies. I've read treatment plans from therapists. I've done more about this than I've done about anything else in literal.years. and he rarely ever notices or gives me credit. Even if he does give me credit, it seems like he takes it all back after a while. 

It absolutely kills me. I know that if i wasn't in a relationship, I wouldn't need to work as hard as I am but I am, because I want to be with him. I've only ever exhibited these behaviors with him. I think, almost positively, that the stress I endured when I moved in with him broke me and I finally snapped and it came to the surface. I'm not saying I wouldn't work on myself if I were alone. I'd be way more efficient, feel way less shame, awkwardness, guilt, self- doubting and loathing if I were doing this on my own, honestly. But, instead, I choose to take on BPD with being a sp, in financial ruins alongside him who is also in financial ruins partially because of me, being the person he wants and needs me to be all of the time while I've never been the person I myself need while with him -- y'all, it's a lot.

128,Looking for resources,"I started seeing a psychiatrist, who specializes in TFP, 2 months ago. She diagnosed me with BPD. When I questioned the severity she said I’m “on the healthy side”. She explained that now that the assessment portion is over, the sessions would now be twice a week ($80 a week with my insurance). That was going to be a lot financially, as I dropped to working part time this year to help care for my baby. My husband supported my therapy and we agreed I would proceed with therapy and take a financial hit for one year for my well-being. I started to get a bad feeling about the psychiatrist when she prescribed me a sleeping medication and my insurance charged me $100 for the medication management code that she billed bc the insurance company said two codes were billed so it appears that 2 separate visits were completed when the medication management was discussed during our visit. I emailed her and told her I can’t afford $80 a week plus $100 every time she mentions medication to me so I would have my PCP take over this sleeping medication bc I don’t get charged when he writes me prescriptions. The psychiatrist then proceeds to send in a new prescription for a higher dose, which I didn’t ask for, after I was clear that I didn’t want to discuss medications with her again. This resulted in another $100 charge. She then took a 2 week vacation and we picked back up last night for our first real treatment session. She started the session by saying she needs to charge my credit card for the second medication charge. I let this go because I’m working on not cutting ppl off after a bad feeling. Then she says she has two requirements for me: 1) I need to “start a weight management program like weight watchers”. I gained a significant amount of weight during my pregnancy and can’t get it off. My PCP started me on Ozempic which has already helped me lose 40 lbs. I told the psychiatrist that I’m already taking steps to help with my weight (which was discussed in previously sessions) she replied “ya but you’re really not” and implied she didn’t trust my PCP of doing enough to manage my weight 2) since I couldn’t have her manage my meds due to insurance, she wanted me to have a regular psychiatrist manage my meds (vyvanse for ADHD and have been on for nearly 10 years and trazodone for sleeping which she put me on last month) bc she didn’t trust my PCP to manage them. 
All that was going through my head was this is more money I have to spend for things my PCP is doing for free. When I pushed back she said these two requirements were necessary for us to start therapy. She said it would be irresponsible of her to not have me do weight watchers and said it was the same as if I was an alcoholic and she required me to go to AA. 

She told me to cut my mom off and “have a hotel on speed dial” when I visit her but then later apologized and said she shouldn’t be giving me advice. She also made numerous little digs about my husband. Again, I brushed those comments aside bc I’m working on not being impulsive when it comes to cutting ppl off. But I’m really uncomfortable with her giving me an ultimatum and now  talking poorly of a third person on my life, my PCP. 

I emailed her and said I’m not comfortable with her two requirements and I understand this means we can’t move forward with therapy. I feel like the past two months of assessment and building trust with her was just a waste. I’m not ready to start with another therapist so I’m looking for other resources like books, videos, workbooks, etc that you feel helped you. Any advice or helpful tips on where to start would all be appreciated.",1673362420.0,False,3,2,yensid408,None,108bpy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/108bpy6/looking_for_resources/
129,BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I’m trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I’ve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I’m not sure what’s real, what’s a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that’s why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn’t have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don’t have a father. I don’t have siblings. I don’t have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought “it will never get better” for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there’s still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don’t even know what “this” is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can’t just give people psychedelics and say go crazy—it needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,14,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/
130,What Support Groups Have You Found for BPD?,"It sucks to be alone! It also sucks to not be able to afford group therapy! Share your experiences with free support groups from whatever perspective of recovery.

I've been going to two, with a generally positive experience. My experience so far is that it's lovely to have a support group at all; that's about 80% of the benefit. The details of the remaining 20% vary.

1) Emotions Anonymous is a recovery group modified from traditional 12 Step recovery programs like AA or NA. I've been going about once a week for about a year, now. The only requirement to join is a ""desire to become better emotionally."" It's very diagnosis-agnostic, so there are a diversity of psychological geogrpahy. Most of the people I meet there are bipolar, BPD, or suffering from PTSD, with a couple of DID cases. Meetings are supposed to be safe sharing spaces, meaning no unasked advice or commentary on others sharing. I'd say the major benefit other than a sharing space is the anonymity. The structure of the 12 steps might help some people and might frustrate others. The major con, to me, is the higher power stuff. 

https://emotionsanonymous.org/

2) The Icarus Project is a mutual-aid network and support system for people dealing with Mental Health Challenges that normally get called mental illness. I've attended about three meetings in my lifetime. Groups are organized autonomously and non-heriarchically, and groups provide a variety of functions. It is implicitly anarchist, and as such a lot of the literature it offers links mental health policy to repressive political apparati like the prison system. The major thing I like about Icarus is that it is harm reductive and self determinative regarding diagnosis, medication, and treatment options. The hardest part of making the groups happen is that it's hard to get political activists interested in mental health and it's hard to get emotionally debilitated people interested into politics. 

https://theicarusproject.net/

Oh, and Icarus has tons and tons of really good resources though, including a 1 page handout of crisis advice and space to write an advance directive. I highly recommend that anyone with BPD fill out a 1 page sheet on your needs during a crisis rather than let random medical professionals guess at your needs and preferences.

131,Trying to recover while in a new relationship,"Hey everybody ! I have recently been on the journey to start recovery right now after going through a really rough and challenging time after starting a new medication that brought out the worst parts of myself and a new relationship that i realized heightens my bpd symptoms (even just having the context of being in a relationship had me triggered). I want to further my growth as much as possible so I want to make sure I work towards my growth instead of against it. So I share this in hopes of getting feedback or really any response! I want to know what other ppl think from an objective POV ! This is a long post so be prepared for that ! 

I am currently tapering off this medication and working through dbt workbooks and in the process of getting started at an outpatient dbt program ! We both have mental illness and they have gotten treatment/ are going to therapy and taking meds however unfortunately things started turning toxic unknowingly and there was a dynamic created where I started burdening my partner and they felt like they always had to be there for me even if they didn’t have the capacity to otherwise in their mind who else would and over time started revolving their whole life around me (even isolating themselves from others just to b around me and try to be there for me in crisis). They took me expressing some of my intrusive thoughts and fear of abandonment to heart and made themselves suffer to make me feel “better” or not to abandon or leave me.

 I would word vomit and over share a lot of things I definitely should’ve kept to myself but that I never knew was making them feel like this. Our communication was off because they thought it would make me feel even worse and I would in turn internalize any feedback or criticism and also sometimes they didn’t even know how they felt never mind to then tell me. We got into a habit of them reassuring me no matter what and a routine of seeing each other all the time. After a major meltdown from me and a long day of work, we got to the point where we both got triggered and had an emotional night which lead me to initiate conversation about the issues that are there. 

As we uncovered more, it was disturbing to see how something that we both thought was going pretty well to see how actually unhealthy our start was.  

We have granted each other space as we definitely need to think, reflect and let ourselves read the situation/our feelings more. Last night, we talked about it and took accountability and shared feelings that were scary to say and admit but were needed to be said. We decided instead of breaking up we both are going to put forth the effort and time and patience to try and care for ourselves more and in turn make it so that we rebuild and unlearn all the misconceptions that we had in our relationship by creating and actively writing down different solutions to our issues and putting in a plan to how to achieve it to give us another go but I wonder if even this is a way of being toxic. 

My worst nightmare of burdening someone else’s mental state bc of me came true and while it was on them for the lack and dishonest sense of communication within themselves and with me I just don’t want to make more toxic decisions and hurt us both in the end :,( 

Any feedback would be appreciated and I guess if anyone relates to this it would be nice to know I’m not alone in this position. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed that I let myself get to the point where I was hindering the growth of my partner and weighing their life down but I’m trying to accept that there’s nothing I can do about the past and just to take accountability and change however if anyone has suggestions on how not to feel so guilty/bad/ashamed please lmk !!",1625235134.0,False,5,4,lotus-pea,None,ocawyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ocawyx/trying_to_recover_while_in_a_new_relationship/
132,I've run my relationship to the ground,"this post might be a bit all over the place so tyia to anyone that reads it. and I will preface by saying this is worded as a venting post, but i am open to advice/criticism because I want to accept accountability here and hopefully fix things but please, please be gentle with wording as I'm super sensitive and don't want to spiral more.

my 6 month relationship just ended a few weeks ago. he ended it. however at the same time he ended things, I was already spiralling and very mentally unstable and suicidal. so he has kept in contact with me and tried to support me as much as he can. he even was willing to give me another chance, but I have been so unstable that I haven't been able to do what I told him I would do- truly we should be waiting a bit until I'm more stable before he gives me another chance (and we both acknowledged this a few nights ago). I learned shortly before I met him that I had BPD, and I thought that I recognized all my symptoms- well I was wrong. our whole relationship he has told me that he was unsure if we would work. and I always thought he meant that he wasn't sure he wanted me. since the very first time he said it, it's never left my head and caused my bpd to spiral even more with the thoughts of not being loved and why am I with him if he doesn't want me? ever since then it's only gotten worse, with me picking out every single behavior he does as proof he doesn't want/respect/love me. the fact that his love language didn't match mine made me feel like he didn't love me, and I'd try to share it with him, but I was sharing it over every little behavior. we were having ""conversations"" or ""tiffs"" weekly. it has been exhausting for both of us. I'm constantly splitting. I love him so much for who he is, but every time he does something that I view as proof he doesn't like me, I split, and I see it as completely black. I feel no love for him because I feel like he doesn't have it for me. I get so upset at him. every single time, I think ""this isn't going to work, we can't be together because if this is how he treats me then how can we be together long term? why should I be with someone that doesn't want me?"". I genuinely thought he was the reason we weren't thriving and I wasn't feeling loved.

the past few weeks, ive been looking more into BPD and resonating with SO much of it. almost every single thing. it explains almost all of my behaviors. I didn't realize what I was doing was splitting, and seeing it as black and white. when he does the tiniest thing, I literally can't feel the whole of the relationship and I focus solely on that one thing. 5 minutes after we fight, I'm totally in love with him again and fine, and then I get upset because he doesn't bounce back the same. well duh, of course he's not going to. he's a normal person that was just yelled at for his normal human actions. he's confused and hurt and probably wondering why I love him one second and hate him the next? I'm wondering the same thing. I always thought we just weren't compatible. but I'm realizing more that I'm the reason we're not doing well. I'm so fucking sensitive. I read last night the quote about how people with BPD are like burn victims, and I was like holy shit that's what it feels like.

I pre-imagine what I think his reactions or actions will be, and when it's not that, I get upset. why am I not able to let him be a fucking human being? why do I need him to act exactly how I expect him to act? and why do I have expectations in the first place? 

I don't want to lose him. he is the first person I've ever truly loved, not someone I've been infatuated with as my FP. I don't feel like I need him to survive, which is another first, I WANT him. I love and value our time together. when I'm not making him feel like a terrible fucking human being, things go so well. I want to stop treating him like this, but it's not intentional. im not intentionally degrading him. it's a deeply rooted feeling that he doesn't love me, and I bring it to his attention when he does things that remind me of it. he's never treated me bad. there is only one specific instance where I can remember him treating me ""poorly"", but in reality he was just so fucking done and defeated and didn't know what to say or do and just wanted to go to sleep. but from that specific night, my mental health and our relationship has just completely declined. he tried to break up with me the next day. we've had so many instances of almost breaking up. I was thinking it was because he didn't want me. but in reality it was because he couldn't handle me always pulling out the worst in him and ragging on him.

is there any hope of saving this? after everything we've been through, he's literally still here. he has stayed this whole time. even after we broke up, were still hanging out and texting every day. he clearly has love for me. he clearly cares. but why can't I see it? why can I only focus on the things he does ""wrong""? last week he brought me flowers and an activity book for us to do together, and then this weekend I got upset with him twice over literally nothing but in the moment it felt like everything. when it happens, the feelings are so intense and I there's nothing I can do to pull myself out of it. 


and on the flip side, I'm the most understanding and caring person to him. he has a lot of his own issues he's deal with himself, and I've supported him through all of it. I tell him frequently how much I care for him and I try to help with his grief and his mental health and try to tell him to give himself grace. how can I say that in one breath and then in the next be mad at him every other day for literally nothing? his mental health has deteriorated from this as well just from me flip flopping on him so frequently and calling him out on everything. 


how do I fix my thought process? any sane person would've blocked me a long time ago. he said last night that he sees I'm trying based on how much research I'm doing and me apologizing and taking the accountability, and I'm looking into therapists that specialize in PTSD or BPD, and other treatments. but I don't want to lose him. even though he deserves to not be in this rollercoaster anymore. he deserves to be loved, and I want to be the one to love him. he's willing to give me a chance, and I so badly don't want to fuck it up again. it's hard to say officially because of everything weve been through, but part of me feels like he could be the one. I have never been able to picture a future with someone before. I've never wanted kids with someone before. I've never wanted a life with someone. until I met him. about 3/4 months into dating, I felt like this might be it. I want him.

133,I need some advice.,"Hello everyone. It is going to be a long one. Also I apologize first for my poor English. 

My fiancé broke up with me 3 days ago after of 4years dating. He kicked me out of his house, so I pack the stuff I can grub and went back home with my mom and cats. He blocked me on everything so I can’t contact him at all. He is texting with my mom for the moving out stuff. 

On the day he broke up with me, I thought he was joking and left the house at 10pm during a big fight. I thought he’d come back as always, he happened to do that a few times, I mean I did few times too.
He never come back, I started to feel anxious. He used to say if he ever break up with me he’d kill himself, so I started to feel so anxious and worried. I went down to the town to look for him in a windy rainy night for an hour at 2am, I’m sure I looked so suspicious. I couldn’t find him, I went back home, spammed his message by texting & call. I was in a panic so I threat him by I’d kill myself, asking if he’s ok. He blocked me on everything at this point. I regret for how I acted. 
But still, I never gets updates if he’s ok. So I decided to call at his work. Called his step mom that I respect too. Which is not a good idea.. I did bunch of times enough that he’s work had to cut the phones line and caused so much problem. I feel so sick of myself that I put him this through. All I wanted to know is if he’s ok.

Days go by, my mom isn’t perfect at English so I was texting him for my mom about moving out, and the situation. (I think he knows that he’s talking to me by how I write down the words)
He mentioned that I was manipulated, abused him, depending on him too much in mentally and financially (that made him on debt), and so on.
Yes, one time I stub my thighs with a knives when he told me he cheated on me with two girls back in the day, I freaked out. But after that, he was royal to me this whole time, as I can see. But this feel of he might cheating on me again feels will not perfectly go away, even though I had the access to his phone anytime(he was nice enough to even tell me that I can log in to his sns), you know. Now I think of it maybe it was the symptoms of BPD since I had this feels of maybe he’s lying still.
Well he pretty much blamed on me on so many things in this relationship, of course there were few things that I went what?!?! But you know, I have my own side point of view so it’s just different I guess.

So I started to search about BPD in online. Back in the day I was on medicine for bipolar, and I found that it’s kind of similar. But the way most of the ppl write the traits of BPD were bit too official, so I couldn’t understand that much. I found this one article that explained really good, that matches everything for what I did. I completely realized, I woke up of this whole my world of why me? I hurt everytime thing.
I was abusing him mentally, physically, enough him to be completely shut off with me to heal himself.
In that moment, my love towards him, I felt that become colorful again. Yes, I’ve been felt dull in this relationship by so much stress at work, situation, etc.

The reason why this relationship were hard was me. I was causing the fight most of the time, when I was blaming him for it. You know, everything changed how I see things. Now I understand it, I started to take counseling for BPD.

In one of the conversation with my “mom” (it’s me texting since my mom isn’t good at English) he said: In my heart, there is a hope that she will get better and we can be happy one day.  I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.  Maybe that's still possible later on down the road. I'm hopeful.

And also, when I ask if he don’t love me anymore, he replies: My feelings are all mixed up, I don't know if I can answer that right now.
(My name) was the only girl I fell in love with so it's really hard.  But I began to resent her as the relationship went on.
My feelings are complicated so I still have love for her, but there is still no way I would be back together with her.

But again, he want me to be gone gone. I’m still confusing. I know he is fighting himself for life because I was such an toxic person.. I understand he’s struggle. I start to understand everything how he feels. You know, I want to be with him still that never change.
Well, he said he will contact/explain to me everything how he feel after I completely move out from his house and feel safe from me (About how he’s done with me)

Now, I’m in this hope that maybe he will give me a chance if he see the progress that I’m trying to get better about myself? But I read that these kind of act is called hovering.. which I don’t wanna believe. I genuinely love him so much. But after reading these thread of broken up with BPD threads scares me that maybe I’m in one of this diseases traits, which I don’t want to believe. 

I think he’s idea of separating is good for us regardless, but I still want to be in the relationship as a new start, not like in a previous one which were toxic.

When he going to discuss with me about this situation that he decided to make a move, I’m thinking maybe I can try give him an offer(?) that maybe he can give me a chance on as a new relationship. Like, I’ll take this counseling and the medicines for PMS(because pms might be triggering the BPD traits more.) also I’m going to get all re-check on my mental health, so I can find a better solution to help my self get better. (I don’t want to ever hurt him again.) and, we can stay live in a different places, and we will meet/talk whenever HE is able to, I won’t bother while I’m getting treatment, completely set the wall. and I will help him financially since I am the one of a reason that he’s on debt, because I can find better job in this town. But again, maybe this traits called hovering and maybe I should not try ever again so he won’t think I’m manipulating/convincing him to stay with me. 

Of course I want to be with him, I really love him a lot. But at the same time, maybe, as these threads saying I’m doing the traits called hovering and trying to get what I want out of him and that’s it, which I doubt but if it is, maybe I really need to leave him for good.
