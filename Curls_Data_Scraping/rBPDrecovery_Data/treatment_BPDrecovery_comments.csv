0,I’m looking into doing an IOP program… five days a week so I can continue working/ keep my friendships going (what’s left of them.) I’m really nervous for the time commitment but I know I need it. I don’t know much about residential treatment! I think I’d rather do residential short term than this IOP over months though… best of luck to you :),saladpal777,1cb9tv3
1,"I worked in a tier 4 adolescent psychiatric facility for about a year. While you’d be in a lower tier facility (assuming your stay is voluntary), there are some things that will probably be relevant. Residential facilities are not as effective for treatment as they are meant to be, but they are more effective than they are generally portrayed as being. The vast majority of residents aren’t there bc they want to be, they’re there because they or their guardian wants them to get better. Even if someone has a specific established treatment plan, their treatment as well as daily routine will follow the general path of the unit’s goals - so finding a facility with the closest specialty to your needs or dx is important. I.e., a depression/suicide unit’s rules group therapy and routine will all be centered around harm prevention and treating depression. If a resident wasn’t a troublemaker, a lot of their time beyond treatment and routine was avoiding boredom. The more they focused on reaching treatment goals, the shorter they needed to stay. The food will almost certainly be bland and follow a 1-2 week cycle. My one main piece of advice to someone expecting to be admitted would be to get in, get done, and move on. In-patient treatment’s main advantage is the accelerated pace of treatment and recovery. You’ve heard of what happens in Vegas? People do crazy stuff in mental facilities they’d never do outside it, because it’s the safe place you can get it out. As long as you remember what you’ve learned, it’s okay and in fact beneficial to not dwell on the things you do and people you meet. Holding on to those means you don’t move forward.

I’m sorry for the infodump. I was raised to be scared of therapists and mental hospitals, and now that I’ve worked in that field it’s really important to me to help people see the full truth if that makes sense.",TabbyCatWren,1cb9tv3
2,"Thanks! I did a PHP and found it pretty helpful. :) I think you’ll like an IOP, they’re pretty nice. Thanks! I’m doing my consult now. :)",dashtigerfang,1cb9tv3
3,"Don’t worry about the info dump! This treatment place is voluntary so I will be able to leave if I don’t like it. Judging from the amount of DBT being done every day it seems like a good unit for me to be on. The reviews are also very good. I’ve been in a virtual PHP before and did really well with that, but my pdoc thinks that a residential would be good for me to unwind, get away and just generally kind of reset my medications. It’s about 4 weeks long.",dashtigerfang,1cb9tv3
4,Ah thank you for your encouragement :) i believe it’s going to be a great step in recovery for you! I hope everything goes well.,saladpal777,1cb9tv3
5,"Gotcha! DBT works really well in that setting, just be aware that it’s a little bit more of a toss-up with group therapy if that’s what they focus on rather than individual. Inpatient is a great place to work your way off meds though since you can have more freedom to work through issues that present themselves with that. Make sure they’ve got good certifications on both the therapeutic and medical side. Good luck!",TabbyCatWren,1cb9tv3
6,Thank you! I am so sad to leave people like my boyfriend back home but he keeps saying he’s going to visit and that we can FaceTime all the time so it won’t be too bad. Good luck to you too!,dashtigerfang,1cb9tv3
7,Thank you so much! I’m so excited to go.,dashtigerfang,1cb9tv3
8,Ah yea <3 I understand !!! I thought about that myself and was worried about friends- but ultimately I just couldn’t afford it…. I’m glad you have support though with FaceTime etc ! And you’re making a brave decision- I wish you healing!,saladpal777,1cb9tv3

1,"I’ve heard of botox having this effect on emotions, but tbh it doesn’t sound like a very healthy method to me… 🤕",,135dw5r
2,"Part of recognizing & processing others' emotions is mirroring facial expressions, including micro expressions. It makes sense that botox can decrease painful hypersensitivity to others' moods and emotions, by limiting the ability to mirror everyone's emotions.",gray_wolf2413,135dw5r

8,"It is indirectly affecting the brain. They've done MRI studies that show reduced activity in the amygdala after paralyzing a specific area. There's several studies that show this happen. People with BPD have overactive amygdalas, which can help explain why we have such frequent and intense emotions. Doesn't it make sense that making our amygdalas less active would lead to less intense emotions, making symptoms more manageable? Studies on this show people with BPD reporting more manageable symptoms about 4 weeks after getting the Botox.",spicypotatosoftacos,135dw5r
9,"So on the podcast they talked about this. When Botox is injected into a specific area of the forehead (glabellar region) it paralyzes and prevents the person from making facial expressions aligned with feeling angry and tense. Making these expressions triggers the amygdala in our brains that does emotions. So, not being able to make those expressions actually reduces the ability to feel them. They've proven this in MRI scans (that Botox causes the amygdala to not be as reactive). It lasts about 3-4 months.",spicypotatosoftacos,135dw5r
10,"Okay, well I'll Google if I can actually get any sources backing this up, it still does sound extremely made up. Anger is an evolutionary base emotion designed to protect us. While our body does signal our emotions to our brain, it doesn't stop or impair us from feeling something and it takes some time to be able to calm down this way. 

If this is the mechanic how it's meant to work, then this is the same thing than making yourself smile when you're angry. Honestly I'd just do that rather than waste money on it. The effect is similarly effective. In that it's not very effective. 

Not being able to feel anger to the same extent (even if true) does not really impact the rest of BPD. Anger is only one emotion.",Melthiela,135dw5r
11,"Making yourself smile more & having diminished ability in those muscles are entirely different things. If forcing yourself to smile more has shown positive results, then doesn't it stand to reason that creating the same physicality without considerable effort is inherently better? Especially when we often battle our own thoughts.

It's also important to highlight that OP has been super clear about the key biochemical process: stunting our overactive amygdala. If our body no longer receives cues that we should be in fight/flight/freeze, it's much easier to process & to work on other avenues of distress. 

Thanks for sharing this, OP!",kdew22,135dw5r
12,"Inability to make facial expressions is certainly not going to stunt fight or flight. Common symptom of Parkinson's disease is inability to make facial expressions. They must be chill people then, if this 'biochemistry' without sources is right.

I'm sceptical because people need real treatment, not money sinkholes with more than arguable results. Most of us struggle to afford therapy or even a psychiatrist, spreading questionable stuff is well. Questionable.

I Googled some research and the studies done seem to be very mixed. It's known facial expressions can affect your emotions but it is in no way shape or form powerful enough to stop base emotions created for your wellbeing and functioning.",Melthiela,135dw5r

1,"Hi there I'm in DBT and still new. I'd say for your first difficulty, that's where the dialectical part comes in. Yes we could all die tomorrow BUT we need to carry on as if we won't because both options exist. I struggle with death a lot too. 

I think my therapist would respond to the second part by saying check the facts. Is this something that happens all the time? When you mention how it makes you feel does he sincerely apologize? If so, you have to move on but if you can't, from whatever it is, you need to break up. Hardest thing ever for me to learn. Even if he doesn't apologize or is huffy about it, is he having a bad day? Do you need space?

0,I can relate. I’ve been on almost 40 different meds and seen over 20 professionals inpatient and outpatient combined. I’ve heard that meds often don’t work for people with BPD because a lot of their symptoms are actually caused by genuine shitty distressing life situations/circumstances (like living in an abusive household). Not sure how true that is though,sadgirlflowers,wbiiic
1,"Healing takes a long time. BPD wire is your brain to see things a certain way, and of course when you start challenging your own brain, it’s going to fight against you. But the fact that it’s fighting against you means that you’re healing journey is working",CodeRound4851,wbiiic
2,"You say you do therapy, is this just talk therapy or is it DBT therapy? Because talk therapy does not work for alot of people with bpd. We need something targeted towards bpd behaviours. I have cptsd as well, so I am currently doing emdr as it is specifically for trauma.

If you aren't already doing DBT see if you can get into it, whether with your therapist or even start looking by yourself, becuase although it is not near a cure, it really does help alot of people.

There is also CBT, which although not always effective on bpd, can help depending on why you are treatment resistant. It may even help change your thoughts around the therapy itself.

I was classified treatment resistant for a long time. It took years of dedicated therapy and several dedicated therapists to get me to the point where I will be discharged at the end of this year once I complete my emdr. It has taken me over 9 years to get to this point., do not give up, you may, like me, need multiple people and have to work on multiple different therapies to get anywhere close to better. My therapist now says she can't believe I am finally saying things she never thought she would hear from me - in a positive way.",chanely-bean1123,wbiiic

0,"Hey there! I’m so sorry you’re going through this. BPD is a really tough illness to battle but you aren’t alone. I was admitted to a psych ward earlier in the year and have since been struggling to get my life back in order. I have yet to do DBT therapy, but Dr. Fox’s videos on BPD on youtube can be pretty helpful in you understanding what you’re going through more. There are also workbooks you can purchase. As for me, lithium was the biggest game changer for my treatment plan coming out of the hospital. It has been the one thing that keeps my mood swings stable. If it has worked in the past it might be worth going back on. I would definitely talk to your doc about all this. 

Remember to have grace with yourself. Your emotions and feelings are valid and you are never alone, even if it may feel this way sometimes. Good luck!",Little-Atmosphere542,148vf5c
0,With my dbt outpatient programme if someone refuses therapy they are discharged as therapy is the main treatment option aside from medication semi-suppressing certain symptoms alongside the therapy. It may be different w others though! I also do uni alongside it and it’s 2x a week! x,,x3fooa
1,"Think of it this way - how well will you perform at uni if you’re struggling so much mentally? You’re more likely to perform poorer than you hope, and probably more likely to drop out. If you have those coping skills in place, you are more likely to succeed and have a better time at uni (both socially and academically).

I did terribly in my A levels, and was also struggling a lot with my mental health at the time. I was diagnosed and then treated when I was about 21. I have no doubt that if I were to do my A levels now, I’d do much better.

I found out I have BPD a couple weeks ago. I dont have insurance and I dont have a real support system; knowing that, and knowing myself, I went on a two week long binge learning everything I could about the disorder. Undeestanding cause and effect are really important to me, and it has been extraordinarily helpful. Reading other people's stories/ listening via podcasts also put things in perspective for me. Just with those two things alone, I've been able to get a better grasp on myself, acknowledging where I'm at, that it's okay, and that I'm at least recognizing when I'm going south. 
I've printed out countless workbook sheets from Google and am putting together a binder full of them so I can do them when needed/ on days when I can handle doing them, even if nothing is actually wrong. A part of that binder will include self care techniques in all the forms possible: physical, emotional, self soothing, etc. Also, adding info pages for reminders that this is happening/ happened due to something I wasn't previously aware of, but am aware of now- leading me to make a better decision in the future. 
Self acknowledgement/ self awareness is a huge step and I highly recommend beginning the practices. Again, worksheets are great for this. Journaling as well, but I know that's hard to do for some. 
Podcasts, reading here on reddit, YouTube, worksheets/ workbooks, gaining knowledge have all been so very, very helpful.

0,"I understand your frustrations because I go through them myself.

First of all, medications don't work well for BPD.  The only thing that's really worked for me is Ayahuasca which isn't something many Drs or clinicians are going to suggest for you.  I did the SSRI maintanance thing and it did help keep me stable enough to get a mindfulness practice going but eventually everything fell apart and because I was on an SSRI I couldn't take Ayahuasca anymore.  It also left me addicted to SSRIs.

Now I'm back to using what works.  I don't use a shaman.  I take it myself.  There are Drs that will administor it depending on where you live (Gabor Mate, who lives in Canada and is one of the leading MDs when it comes to trauma surivival, uses this medicine to treat his own trauma).

Second, DBT is an offshoot of Buddhism (I don't care what Western psychology says).  But it leaves out a lot of things.  Buddhism has helped me.  DBT doesn't go far enough.  It's a great mindfulness practice but it misses the mark in a number of respects and acts as though Buddhism is the path of mindfulness when that's only one part of the path of liberation.

Human beings need connection to other human beings.  In Buddhism we call this Sangha.  You can practice mindfulness with a regular Buddhism Sangha.  You can also practice it in a DBT support group.

Either way, you need to be with people that are also struggling and suffering or you're going to continue to think you're the only one going through it.  For me what this looks like right now is a men's support group.  It's just a place to go and connect with other men about our struggles and our suffering.  It also includes subscribing to the BPD forums here on reddit, but online isn't enough.

We need real connection and part of that is being vulnerable enough to let people in and meet them in real life.  To cry with them.  To grieve. To laugh.  All of these things require community and connection.

  
I know it's scary.  But you're not the only one that feels the fear of making yourself vulnerable.  And until you do, you won't see how much everyone is struggling right now.  The planet is sick because our culture is toxic.  You're not alone.",,zh2rna
1,"I have had almost all of the experiences you describe. 

The only difference is that I feel relief at the prospect of not having children. It is the only way I can be sure that my trauma won't disturb anyone else's childhood -- even though I know I wouldn't harm a child intentionally or even accidentally, my trauma has so completely warped my personality that any exposure to my personality at all needs to be prevented (there are studies of the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, and findings suggest that the trauma affects multiple generations mentally, psychologically and physically). I want my pain to end with me. There are other reasons why I think having children would be immoral, but those aren't relevant to what I'm trying to say here.

There is a lot of evidence that childhood trauma causes brain damage even if no physical abuse took place. People who experienced trauma often have enlarged cerebral ventricles (the space between the brain's two hemispheres is larger than in people who didn't undergo trauma). The brain is actually smaller as a result of abuse. I personally have cerebral ventricles that are so enlarged that I have been examined repeatedly to make sure that I wouldn't need to have brain surgery to correct the problem.

There is only one reason I have not committed suicide. I can't accept the possibility that my death will cause pain or problems for who love or need me. I live because of an obligation to not cause pain. One of the main reasons I have owned pets is because I am still responsible for their lives after I die. On more than one occasion, my dog saved my life because I knew he might starve to death I was not there to feed him (it's not like I could say ""would you mind taking care of my dog from now on? I'm committing suicide tomorrow""). If you don't have a pet, you should consider getting one: not only can the responsibility keep you alive, they will love you even if nobody else does.

I've been through a million meds alone and in combination. At best they're a kind of life vest -- I keep floating above the surface no matter how stormy the sea is. I have had some luck with ECT, although it's become clear to my doctors and I that at best, I will need 4 -6 treatments every year for as long as I live.

I don't suggest that you try getting relief from psychedelic drugs -- they are very powerful substances and it's necessary to be very careful when you use them. I am not against their use in any way -- in fact, they have helped me a lot. I just know that they can do a lot of damage when used in the wrong circumstances, especially by people who don't have extensive experience with them. I have taken hundreds of trips on LSD and other substances, but it's not something that even I do without great care, consideration and preparation. The only reason I have stopped having ""bad trips"" is that I know that all trips have periods of doubt and fear, and that I have experience processing that pain in the moment and after I come down. Again, I'm not against using psychedelics -- I just want to people to be prepared and stay safe. You might want to look at [EROWID: Documenting the Complex Relationship Between Humans and Psychoactives ](http://erowid.org) for unbiased, scientific and experiential information about psychedelics and most other drugs that affect the brain (including 'regular' psychiatric drugs).

I can't offer you hope. I can't guarantee that life will get better. I can't tell you that you have a responsibility to stay alive. 

I can only tell you that my own pain comes in waves, and that there are times when I almost forget that I'm in pain and that I have done some good for others (I worked as a teacher for many years and gave people practical skills that help people live better lives). Even though I feel life has no meaning, I feel that meaning is overrated. For me, helping people and physical pleasure is enough to get me from day to day. Sometimes they're even enough to make me feel like I have a reason to live -- tomorrow's barbecued steak or a concert ticket is enough to look forward to sometimes... Sometimes, a scoop of Haagen Dazs is enough.

Life may not get much better, but it might. Furthermore, I've found that it takes effort to make it worse. So -- even when you can't bring yourself to make it better, doing nothing can be enough.",Cascando-5273,zh2rna

Honestly what helped me the most was talking about all this in therapy, I did cut off a lot of my friends when I was in recovery, slowly I realized it made me feel better. I couldn't still meet some of my friends or anyone in general, I know it feels hard but after a while I started accepting I wasn't okay and taking time to make friends is okay.

I still be mindful when I go out, some things trigger me when I see but most don't know and some don't even care when I bring up the topic, actually recovery helped me a lot on understanding myself.

Don't be hard on yourself, take it slowly. Start with one person and then carry on, it'll be fine. Seek therapy and talk about it if it helps or read some books. You are enough as you are, do not feel bad that some aren't around you because you're in recovery. 🖤✨",_ackerman_69,ronsj1

0,"Technically there's no medication for BPD because it's not like Bipolar Disorder which is a chemical thing. People are usually medicated to control the anxiety and depression though. I'm on a mood stabilizer and an anti psychotic, but I also have Bipolar which is probably why these meds work for me.

Treatment for BPD is usually DBT. DBT gives someone with BPD the tools to deal with our emotions and chaos. It's something that you have to actively work at, and put into practice for it to work. It's hard work, so hard but it really is worth it.

In saying that you can totally recover from BPD. For me I can't ever say I'm cured because a relapse is never not a possibility, I say I'm in recovery like an alcoholic is. I will always have to work at being in recovery, but right now I don't meet the criteria to be diagnosed. It's been a hard road and has taken me over 10 years but it's totally doable. I went through a major relationship break down in October and had ZERO BPD episodes during or since. Before getting stable break ups made me that completely stereotypical BPD girl, now I handle things a lot more rationally. I'm even friends with my ex, purely platonic friends.

You can do this. You'll have victories and failures on the way, but the other side is so worth it. The first time you handle a previously triggering situation without flying off the handle is so amazing. I remember sitting there and being so damn proud of myself.

DBT is also a miracle. I found it really difficult, but it’s helped a lot. I did private DBT because no public services in my area. A full round of DBT is typically 6 months to get through all the modules, but I ended up doing a second round and I found that very helpful!

I'm on state funded Medicaid, I had to get a referral to mental health from my position, then a referral from my physician to therapy in order to have it covered by insurance. Many private insurance companies will pay for personality disordered therapy (especially if you have any past cases of hospitalization or run-ins with the law) there's also a few websites that have Dbt papers online... Unfortunately, the only affordable cost-efficient option I can think about is betterhelp, it's a lot cheaper than most therapists

To be completely honest with you though, doing DBT workbooks at home we're honestly much more beneficial to my healing than It ever was whenever I went in person.  I didn't have to deal with the uncomfortability of going out in public or being there in person, and as long as you have the self-discipline to make yourself do it on a schedule...

The problem is she is in prison and cannot get access to other treatment or a diagnosis.

I thought some therapy would be better than nothing but I'm not sure if she is not doing right by her or if maybe my partner isn't being completely honest. That is a possibility

My first red flag was when she asked me why I was tired and I told her I had just had a therapy session. She asked me why it was emotionally draining for me and said hers is easy.

Then she told me that she won't diagnose her because she may have had it but doesn't now because people grow out of it

So all the work to realize what was wrong is going to be out the window if she thinks she's better when she gets out",Full-Pineapple3052,1ceql3r

5,"I appreciate the comment. My concerns are that she doesn't know what she needs right now because she's getting inaccurate advice from the person who is supposed to be the one in authority and in the knowledge you know what I mean?

If the therapist herself is saying people grow out of this and I don't see that in you and that may have been how you were but I don't see that now etc and she makes the decision to leave prison and go to a halfway house versus a treatment facility because she's following the advice of the prison therapist then that's setting herself up for failure

And I kind of feel almost like that's not entirely her fault if she's following the advice of the prison therapist that's what I'm trying to get at. Exactly what is being said obviously I won't know but this is either a person who is not a doctor or not experienced a personality disorders or simply on the prison payroll to keep people reoffending

I gave her the previous comments in a message hoping that she would be more inclined to believe people that have been through this

And I pointed out that you can't even tell me her name let alone her credentials so at this point in time I keep thinking you don't have anybody if I step back but at the same time I have to realize it's my codependency speaking

That you in fact do have yourself. You're a grown woman you know what's wrong with you now and it's up to you to get the information as best you can now and then really do your own research when you get out

I sent books I've sent articles and you choose whether or not you read them. And when it comes down to two people telling you the exact opposite it comes up to you to research your own answer

I've provided proof of everything I've ever said to you and it's a direct opposite of what this person is telling you. My only goal would be for you to get better where hers could be either to just get through the shift or possibly not really give the best information because that keeps people getting rearrested which keeps money flowing into the system

Inmates equal income in this world. So I blocked the phone again and I'm only sending messages that have information in them. Because every time I hear her voice I start the cave and especially if I'm hearing information that's wrong it makes me jump into gear and feel like I need to get the right information to her

Like I said she's 43 years old and knows what's wrong now. And now it's up to her to learn that what she feels isn't fact and just because she feels like she could do this now off by herself doesn't mean she can't

It's been 3 years and a year and a half of knowing it's BPD and trying to get the information to her but it's only been fairly recent that she's wrapped her head around it and accepted it

I sent the big book on borderline personality disorder, Dr Fox's borderline personality disorder workbook and a DBT workbook as well as a journal

I transcribed YouTube videos into text and send them in messages

That's the only access to real information she's going to get in there.

The problem is is that transition. Between getting out and getting help. If she goes into a 90-day treatment facility that at least provides a physical barrier between her and the drugs she's got a chance. If she goes into a halfway house and is meant to find her own therapy I don't see after 23 years of addiction and an untreated mental disorder such as this allowing for that success to happen

She did tell me yesterday that arrangements are being made for her go someplace safe because she realized after thinking about it but asking to come back and live with me again was not only out of line but also not smart because she can't even be in this county let alone be with me

So when sitting and thinking she comes up with the right answer but she still immediately making impulsive decisions

So if she makes an impulsive decision to go to the wrong place and what's up with access to drugs I promise you she'll be high in a day and it's only a matter of time for she's rearrested and we do this all over again

So I decided I can't keep going on this Merry-Go-Round until she shows me that she's doing the right thing

Right now all I've got is her word and over the last 3 years the compulsive lying gaslighting projection only shows that her word is no good right now

And that's another thing she doesn't understand. One day she'll agree that she understands why I don't trust her and then the next minute it's at some point you're going to have to trust me again. Which is true but that has to start once you stop actually lying and start doing the work

So I basically got nauseous when I heard that she was told she grew out of it because it's almost not fair to blame her for listening to the person that's supposed to be her counselor

I appreciate the form to vent and all the help that you guys are giving me because it wasn't until I found groups of people that actually have this disorder and are indifferent levels of recovery that I've really gotten a good understanding of what's going on inside her head

She hasn't been able to really Express anything until recently. And it took a three week no contact for her to get to that point

So another thing I told her is that we can't look at the actual growth we have to look at what caused the growth and what caused the growth was a no contact.

And what started my healing process was the no contact

What started my healing backsliding was ending with no contact

And we went from no calls to back to trying the daily calls so that's her growth being stunted because of the ending of the no contact

So while it sucks that's what has to happen because I can't be a crutch and she can't be my only purpose

The prison system really is designed to help people continue to fail. And I just feel like if she was out and had her own access to everything then I would feel a lot better about stepping back and saying it's up to you. But since she doesn't have the access and she's trapped basically and limited to what she has access to I feel like I can't let go until I know she's going to be okay I make the correct choices

Quit alcohol mid 2019. Alcoholism was basically a giant tarp thrown over the BPD and related issues, keeping me or any counselor from getting to the root issues. I certainly *had* BPD before then.

Had a kid mid 2020.

Diagnosed BPD late 2020.

Started barely looking into DBT throughout 2021 while I looked for another counselor (the one that dx me ultimately wasn't a good fit). 

Got another counselor late 2021. Started doing DBT in earnest.

Left my abusive relationship early 2022. Also started reading up about CPTSD and trauma, which was very helpful.

Got a couples counselor to try and work through the abusive relationship in early-mid 2022. Found out quickly that my ex was aggressively against any kind of help and was actively sabotaging my own attempts to get better, practice DBT, etc. Dropped the couples counselor and chose my mental health over a garbage relationship in mid 2022.

Started doing DBT and looking into IFS therapy approaches from mid 2022 onward. Did it like it was my job. Books, workbooks, reminders all over my house, etc. Shit, I still have an emotion wheel on my fridge. This *was* my main hobby for almost a year.

Started a new relationship with an amazingly grounded, patient, understanding person in mid 2023. That turbo-charged everything I'd been working on because I had a supportive partner.

Literally this past Tuesday my counselor said I no longer fit the dx criteria for BPD. My homework for our next session is to decide whether I want to drop to monthly check-ins or quarterly or as-needed, etc.

I have only recently really feel I'm ok, after two years of no splits or overwhelming negativity feelings.

At first it also felt like all I did was learn to not show it, to ""appear"" normal. To hold back. But with time, I realized that wasn't it. Distress went down. I stopped policing and controlling who was my FP (still in my life, closest to my heart together with my family just not my ""FP"" in the bpd sense anymore)

Not in a romantic relationship by choice but loving myself. Not chronically lonely. Going to work is not the worst mental drag. I can handle stress.

2,"It does with a lot of time. My psychologist has undiagnosed someone before because she no longer met criteria. But it took about 8-10 years of continuous DBT and self work. But it’s entirely possible, it just takes a lot of time and that duration of time especially during our worst moments/when we are triggered can seem like an eternity. But it’s truly just a fraction of our life compared to the fuller life we can lead afterwards. You will have hiccups, and regressive periods often triggered by massive life events (deaths, relationships ending, even positives like a new job). But you’ll know better how to manage and be prepared so it won’t set you back as many steps. It does get better, have hope in that🖤",Legitimate_Tangelo41,1b9yxxt

My husband and I just celebrated our 20 year dating anniversary, and he is so happy with how stable I've been in the last 2 years because we talked about my mental health, and I wanted his thoughts :)

Yes... it does get better.  I feel very good about saying I'm headed in the right direction and into remission :)  And as a P.S. needing to leave my family for 2.5 months was one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do.  It was worth it though!!!",SailorCredible,1b9yxxt
4,"Yes. If you MAKE it better.

It took me a year of DBT, then four months of Schema therapy (because you don't do trauma therapy before you can regulate your shit lol), concurrent with individual therapy. It took actively working the skills especially when it was easy so it'd come more naturally when things were hard. I've learned I can't drink anymore, can't fuck around anymore, and had to clean out a lot of unhealthy people in my life. There are environments I don't spend time in and I figured what works best for me (not for everyone, for me) -- a small, quiet life with few close friends and a family who loves and supports me. I'm connected with my communities, I'm involved with my family. I'm whole.

Am I always happy? No, of course not, because happy is an emotion and emotions are fleeting, but I AM content and that's such a blessing. I'm deeply grateful for the life I have, for everything I have.

Remember that this is about literally changing how your brain works. Changing your behaviour changes your brain but it means that in EVERY instance you have to do the new behaviours, not just when it's easy or suits you. This isn't about tolerating distress because all of life is about tolerating distress, it's about doing it effectively without hurting yourself OR other people. 

Life is hard and it'll never stop being hard. It's hard for everyone (not that that helps lol), and we have a little extra difficulty sprinkled in because of our big feelings and poor interpersonal skills, regulation skills, and self-soothing skills...but things got easier to manage once I figured out how to utilise those skills.",elegant_pun,1b9yxxt

Themes that helped me were things like self-discipline, delayed gratification, self-love, compassion, virtue, radical self-accountability, accepting personal responsibility, kindness, imperturbability, detachment, impermanence, etc.

32,"Hi OP!! I hope you are well today. I have a complicated situation kinda, i'm also bipolar 2, ocd,adhd and the bpd. So i kinda call it CBPF (COMPLEX BPD). 


The gold standard care for bpd is DBT. dialectical (something being two things at once...example: i love him, but he's upset me), so it's dialectical behavioral therapy. 


Its like cbt, but with western ideologies. Like mindfulness (being aware of feelingsh emotions-reality), meditation (and things like the DIVE effect... when you ground yourself in stressful situationsh you practice 4x a day until it's second nature, so when you get triggered you can remember how to cope), staying in what we call ""wisemind"" instead of ""rational-mind"" or in ""emotional-mind."" Staying in this 5 minutes (instead of in the past-where i usually find shame, or in the future-where i usually feel helpless and anxious. 




Now i take lexapro (ssri approved for anxiety as will as depression), a mood stabilizer-vrylar, and valium (long acting benzo to present panic attacks and basically sedate my overacting, over talking and over active mind. 


Realizing i need boundaries, to accept others boundaries, and i wanted to say that i set alarms for mt valium 3x a day. I call it the ""gratitde/h.a.u.l.t"" alarm. I open my notes on phone, type something meaningful i'm grateful for, and i assess myself with h.a.u.l.t. hungry? Angery? Upset? Lonley?

Another reason why i got better is bc of my therapist helping me break through certain realizations that i never thought would be true. I genuinely thank this woman from the bottom of my heart for helping me. She helped me realize where did my fear of abandonment comes from. She helped me find the grey area in situations where I could only see the bad in(or the good)(black and white thinking). And since then I can say that my life has gotten a little less chaotic. I still get episodes and I still split a lot but not at the same intensity and has much as I did as a child or when I was a younger teenager. One thing about me, is that I really, really, really do believe that ppl can get better. A few years ago I was ready to end my life bc of all the abuse I was getting. But now here I am.

38,"DSM-V criteria for OCD; THEN BPD
Specific Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Criteria

The physician or mental health professional will determine whether you meet the specific obsessive-compulsive disorder criteria listed in the DSM-5, during the psychological evaluation portion of your visit. Your symptoms must meet both the general and specific characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

To receive an OCD diagnosis, you must meet these general criteria:

You must have obsessions and compulsions
The obsessions and compulsions must significantly impact your daily life
You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable

Your obsessions must meet specific criteria:

Intrusive, repetitive and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that cause distress
The thoughts do not just excessively focus on real problems in your life
You unsuccessfully try to suppress or ignore the disturbing thoughts, urges, or images
You may or may not know that your mind simply generates these thoughts and that they do not pose a true threat

Your compulsions must meet specific criteria:

Excessive and repetitive ritualistic behavior that you feel you must perform, or something bad will happen. Examples include hand washing, counting, silent mental rituals, checking door locks, etc.
The ritualistic compulsions take up a least one hour or more per day
You perform these physical rituals or mental acts to reduce the severe anxiety caused by the obsessive thoughts.





The Borderline pattern specifier may be applied to individuals whose pattern of personality disturbance is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:

Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.
A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, which may be characterized by vacillations between idealization and devaluation, typically associated with both strong desire for and fear of closeness and intimacy.
Identity disturbance, manifested in markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.
A tendency to act rashly in states of high negative affect, leading to potentially self-damaging behaviours (e.g., risky sexual behaviour, reckless driving, excessive alcohol or substance use, binge eating).
Recurrent episodes of self-harm (e.g., suicide attempts or gestures, self-mutilation).
Emotional instability due to marked reactivity of mood. Fluctuations of mood may be triggered either internally (e.g., by one’s own thoughts) or by external events. As a consequence, the individual experiences intense dysphoric mood states, which typically last for a few hours but may last for up to several days.
Chronic feelings of emptiness.
Inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger manifested in frequent displays of temper (e.g., yelling or screaming, throwing or breaking things, getting into physical fights).
Transient dissociative symptoms or psychotic-like features (e.g., brief hallucinations, paranoia) in situations of high affective arousal.

Other manifestations of Borderline pattern, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following:

A view of the self as inadequate, bad, guilty, disgusting, and contemptible.
An experience of the self as profoundly different and isolated from other people; a painful sense of alienation and pervasive loneliness.
Proneness to rejection hypersensitivity; problems in establishing and maintaining consistent and appropriate levels of trust in interpersonal relationships; frequent misinterpretation of social signals",Born-Value-779,1b9yxxt
39,"i would like to at times think other things are the root of my problems than BPD, add it's so serious and pervasive. I believe that my percieved abandonment, and swells esteem issues relay onto my relationship. Inevitability of us having hard interpersonal relationships it's going to follow HEAVY bc of this. Does you ocd effect other parts of your life? Do you feel like the rocd is in more than romantic relationships. We do have a much talked about favorite persosituation to think of too. I have a VERY affirming partner who understands my triggers and does EVERYTHING possible to eliminate them, as well as reassure me... does your partner do this? I want what's best for us and we need the reassurance with real trains why we matter and are different and worth the extra effort
 


I also believe having r-ocd doesn't just come out of nowhere from what i've been reading. Out seems to be relsted to ptsd? 


Do you associate with 5/9 of the bpd? 
Icouldn't find dsm-v criteria on r-ocd... i couldn't find it quickly, doesn't mean it isn't there tho. 


What are you thinning?


Do you radically accept your bpd? Or that you have traits? 
-radical acceptance: accepting it as fact, NOT LIKING IT, not wanting it to be, but simply accepting.

I spent the better part of the afternoon before my session looking for a gift to buy Robin. The most fitting depiction of my time with her was one of great significance yet it came in the form of a simple visual: a lighthouse. No matter the frequency and the duration of the waves, the light was always on. For the first time, it was nice purchasing a gift that did not represent one of persuasion, but one of gratitude. 

To say the last session felt bittersweet is a lie. There is pain, sadness, and a little bit of regret for getting better enough that my time with Robin has to end. I feel real emptiness. It scares me. It is not perceived emptiness or heightened sadness. It is real because throughout my journey with Robin I finally have an accurate emotional baseline for comparison. 

I am not sure if Robin will ever know that she is the most influential person in my life. I don’t know if she will ever comprehend the gratitude I have for her saving my life. Not from committing suicide, but saving my everyday life. I don’t know if she will ever know that some part of me will always want to pay her back for what she did for me. Of course, I won’t, because in those moments I remember all the times Robin reminded me that it was okay to receive a gift and just say thank you.

Part of what has helped me improve is this awareness and part is being aware of when I start to feel that Adrenalin rush I go for a walk with my headphones on, partly to distract myself with scenery music, partly to burn up the cortisol adrenaline that is now in my bloodstream, if I don’t it will just get worse and worse. In 2 years I’ve gone from making massive street scenes of yelling drama to being pretty contained. Hope this helps.

(Maybe another reader can reply with a worksheet link?)

I’m proud of you for having this awareness. Doing a chain analysis will help you further build on this perspective of the situation. 

My question for you to ponder is: what is it that you are getting out of your target behaviour? If you verbally abuse someone, do you feel powerful, in control or like you want or need to win? Is there any other behaviour you can do that is not abuse that gives you a similar feeling?",Maleficent-Sleep9900,19cl8co

I have a friend with anxiety and she was worried about gossip at her old job. Which doesn’t matter, she doesn’t talk to anyone there. We did breathing exercises and did one where you identify 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, and 1 thing you taste. It took like two minutes. 

I asked her if she still cared and she got wide eyed and freaked out because suddenly she gave no shits. It made her realize how much she lives in the past instead of the present.

0,"Gonna mostly ignore the unique formatting choices there. 

Addiction is an escape from reality and facing its limitations, including our own. It's the brains attempt to correct dysregulation which instead fuels more. It's an avoidance of the pressure of our own high ideals or sense of failure. It's an attempt to soothe dysregulated emotions, trauma and neglect. It occurs when mechanisms and drives intended for our survival, spiral out of our control and rewire out brain to the point it's nearly impossible to break. It's a brain that's been hijacked by supernormal stimulus or things that mimick the chemistry of its own neurotransmitters. It's certainly not a habit (but habits maintain it). It's a symptom of disconnection. A symptom of poor self-nurturance, physicallly, and emotionally. It's a way to live with self-hatred, internalised capitalism and shame. It's a disconnection from your true nature (spiritual or natural), and therefore your connection with reality, self, other beings and nature. It's an animal brain trying to cope and survive in a world that is no longer suitable for it. It's a misguided attempt to care for, and give ourselves love. It's a hijacked limbic system, and an already dysregulated and faulty one in the case of BPD. It's a complete impairment, and loss, of many executive functions. It's a brain thinking it needs your substance or behaviour of choice or else it may die. 

Carl Jung used to believe that only a profoundly spiritual kind of experience could lead to any meaningful, lasting recovery.

The program is sort of deliberately indoctrinating and I'm sure it save lives for some, but in my case I'm afraid it hindered my product a little because I believed if I was still struggled my program just wasn't strong enough, when in fact I now am of the mind that I needed some much more intensive help in therapy.

I think, at a brain level, things like the rat-park model, neurological hijacking and neuroplastic changes are all occurring simultaneously, and all true in their own regards, all playing a role. In fact, I think most of the seemingly contradictory concepts out there all have more elements of truth in them than conflict. I await the day people realize that a poor environment, can cause a diseased brain, sustained by that same poor environment, but not then easily fixable by only addressing one. Putting the ideas at odds with each other is so counter-productive. It's like wondering why your plant is dying when you water it badly then trying to fix it by drowning it.

0,"I had TMS! Just finished about two weeks ago. Here’s what I noticed. 

1. My physical symptoms all went away. My *physical* depression (fatigue, brain fog), anxiety (stomach aches, nausea) etc. all disappeared. It also helped greatly with binge eating. I don’t find myself craving unhealthy habits anymore, for the most part lol. 

2. I still get sad and anxious as any other human, but I’ve found it’s appropriately placed. For example, instead o being anxious all the time, I’m anxious when a cop turns on their light behind me, as most people would. And then I’m able to calm down pretty quickly. I get sad when something sad happens, but I am quick to address it. 

3. I’m able to address and cope with my emotions much easier. I still deal with mood swings, but instead of being held down by my moods, I’m able to use my coping skills and self care to address them. I’m able to say “okay, right now I’m feeling angry. What can I do in this moment to deal with this?” And then I follow through. That’s been the biggest improvement for me - being able to actually follow through on the emotional regulation.

4. I have more energy to do things. I picked up hiking as a hobby and it’s been going great. I usually quit things easily (ADHD) but with hiking I stick to it and I don’t get discouraged when it gets hard. 

The way I view TMS is not a cure for the symptoms, but it’s like taking the huge weight that’s crushing you off in order for you to be able to address what you need to address. The physical symptoms are gone, the trauma is still there, but I’m able to work through it because I’m much more clear headed. 

If you can get it covered I’d highly recommend it. In total, I had to spend about $600 out of pocket, but the total cost would’ve been somewhere near $16k without insurance. 

I’d highly recommend also finding a clinic with a good technician. Some technicians just turn on the machine and leave you alone. My tech actually did some CBT and DBT skills while the machine was on, and I feel like it really helped to solidify those therapies in my head. She would have me journal or would talk with me about something stressful that happened and it was really helpful.

I am a completely different person now, I feel much more emotionally regulated and stable and I built up my self confidence enough to follow my dreams and I’m now an artist (living off unemployment money but whatever, my jobs were making me sick too lol!). Every day I remember how privileged and lucky i am and how much hard work I put in to working on myself in and out of therapy, how hard it was to set boundaries and over come conflicts, and how I did all this and I’m functioning and feel joy and love a lot and accept I’m really emotional but grateful I can communicate my emotions now.
I have now been in a relationship for 8 years, in the last 2 years it has become actually healthy. my partner has adhd and struggles to emotionally regulate and communicate emotions too, which helped me apply some DBT skills and teach them how to regulate, whilst I’m learning to regulate as well.

I still struggle with disordered eating, I still struggle to keep to 1-2 alcoholic drinks when I drink, I still am a highly sensitive person and sometimes reactive, but I’m compassionate as hell and I show myself a lot of that compassion.

When I had my last therapy session, my therapist said to me that he felt so proud and warmed by how I threw myself into DBT, that I did everything with 100% even when it was really hard work, and I told him through my tears that I had to because I really really wanted to get better, I wasn’t scared of getting better anymore. 

I remember the shift if me that went from wanting to get better but petrified of the change and safe in the comfort of who I knew I was, to needing and wanting this journey, seeing how unjustifiably fucked up i was feeling, that it really wasn’t my fault- it just was… I think the shift came from a place of self compassion and self acceptance, and surrendering myself to therapy and I let all the hard stuff come at me in giant waves that knocked me down over and over but I got back up stronger. Like ripping open old scars in order to heal them properly so they don’t cause you pain anymore. Only discomfort.

Im a success story, and i feel so proud and privileged to remember this every day ❤️",r0sebudbean,yvi78t
2,"I've been recovering for a little over 4 years now and no longer qualify for BPD. The biggest thing for me was sobriety and finding a good meds regiment to keep me even and energized. The other big thing was to try and cultivate as many emotionally supportive friendships with positive people as I can. 

Having multiple close friends and not focusing my energy on any one of them has made a massive difference in keeping myself in my wise mind all the time. Now I haven't been able to have a stable romantic relationship yet, but I have a couple dozen solid friendships, and several very stable emotionally close ones. 

This all took a long time and it wasn't steady at all, but keep with it and try to practice DBT skills once a day if you can. I like to take a little break at lunch and sit in the sun for a bit to meditate and practice.",dreexel_dragoon,yvi78t
3,"I had BPD, CPTSD, Anxiety Disorder and Dissociative Disorder. I started treatment when I was 15 because I was suicidal and deeply depressed. I got weekly supportive counseling until I started CBT psychotherapy at 20 years old. At 26 years I started DBT and went it through 2 times. After that I got trauma therapy but because I had already learned very good distress & Mindfulness skills in DBT, we ended the trauma therapy early and at the age of 30 I was diagnosed to be in recovery.

I'm now 37 and haven't been suffering from BPD symptoms in years. My life is healthy and in balance. I'm optimistic and generally love my life. I know my limits and triggers and avoid pushing them. I'm happy and self-confident. 

I have truly recovered from all of my diagnoses and haven't had any contact to mental health services in 6 years. I also don't take any madications anymore. I take care of myself, do sports, eat healthy and sleep well. I don't allow toxic people into my life and enjoy my solitude. 

Mindfulness is my saviour and it works with everything! I use it every day and with mindfulness I'm able to survive all and every trouble, trigger, negative emotion, impulse or challenge. It's just amazing how effective mindfulness is. For me it's a way of life now.",the_end_of_mind,yvi78t
4,"YES that's me! I've done so much since my initial diagnosis of BPD in August 2018.

First, DBT saved my life. I did DBT in a group therapy setting twice. That got me over the worst time period of my life when I was barely surviving.

What has helped me is meditation (I use the Headspace app), journaling (I use ""shadow work"" prompts I found on Pinterest), exercising, and my medication. I was diagnosed with ADHD in May 2021, so when I started taking meds for that, it also helped some of my overlapping BPD symptoms.

My therapist and I also talk about the concept of self-compassion a lot, which I think is hard for pwBPD to practice. My self esteem was really low when I first got diagnosed, and I was really mean to myself. I wouldn't forgive myself for \_anything\_ but tolerated so much bad behavior from others. Learning about self compassion and applying those skills to my life really helped me heal and believe I had a life worth living.

As far as relationships go...that sometimes just requires some trial and error. During my last relationship, I just trusted myself enough to know that I didn't want to be with that person. I recently went on a date with someone else, and ultimately decided I don't want to date anyone right now.

The cool thing about having BPD is learning about yourself, the ugly bits you don't like to talk about and the beautiful versions of yourself that no one knows about. Sometimes we want acceptance and validation from other people when we don't even accept or validate ourselves.

I still have BPD but I'd consider myself a ""success story"". I was also hospitalized last year, so I don't think I ever ""recovered"" from BPD completely. I just have learned to live with it and adapt it to my life if that makes sense.

If you want to chat let me know! I'm sorry for the wall of text.",moods-,yvi78t
5,"I no longer qualify for BPD. I struggled for two decades, one of those decades I was plagued with suicidal thoughts and urges. DBT therapy saved my life.

I am now the most content I have ever been. I turn 40 in three months. In a few short weeks I am marrying my love, who has stood by my side for six years. I dated him for months before I told him about my BPD and I was terrified how he would react. He was unfazed by it. Accepted me wholly for all my struggles.

A few years ago I found myself in a full place of recovery. The suicidal thoughts and urges are completely gone. My mood is stable. I am much more mindful in how I interact with others, what I share, and how I listen. 

I have so much compassion for my past self and all the pain and heartache I went through. 

Recovery is not impossible. You have to want it and work for it. It takes years, but you can get there if you put your all into it.",RadicalAcceptanceFTW,yvi78t

7,"I've been married for 12 years. The first 5 were the worst I was untreated for bpd and misdiagnosed.  I was hell on heels in the most literal sense. I wasn't a good person in any way shape or form.. idk why my husband stayed he's an amazing man who saw something in me I hadn't seen in myself at that time. I was diagnosed as bpd and I stopped all the prescribed meds for the misdiagnosis and stopped all addictions that solved about 60% of my problems. I then did cbt, dbt, emdr and trauma therapies in addition to traditional talk therapy.  I exercised, eat healthy, drink water...I worked, and worked, and worked until I could be healthy for myself and my spouse. Today you wouldn't know I have bpd if I didn't tell you I did. It's very possible it just takes a tremendous amount of work and consistency to get well enough to be in a healthy relationship.  I have the house, thr happy marriage, the car, the white Picket fence but only because I fought tirelessly for it. I also went NC with family it's the only way I can maintain my well-being... if I let them in I know what will happen so it's not an option. Good luck op if you want it bad enough you can succeed.  I'm not saying I don't have days of struggle because I definitely do I'm just more well equipped to handle those days than I was before.  I wish you the very best. Bpd isn't a life sentence of loneliness and despair unless you choose that.  You got this.",Ambs1987,yvi78t

9,"Unfortunately, I’m no where near started on my recovery process (other than downloading some DBT apps that were the first to go when my phone storage was full), but I have found someone- somehow out of the miracles of the mysteries of the mind, that is the most patient, understanding, wonderful man that he is. I start having a blowup and he can deescalate me in minutes. I am out of control, he tells me to take space and deals with my kids and my mom and my pets or whatever needs to be done. I go for a smoke break, cool off, come inside and my dishes are done, the kids are fed, and he’s reading them bedtime stories. Shit like this every single day. 

I’m terrified he is going to leave me. I’m terrified I’m becoming dependent on him. But I’ve never felt so good about myself and so eager and willing to allow change to happen within myself. He’s relit my soul when I didn’t think I could take any more traumatic events in my life. I was so drained. I hated life. I was miserable. I never smiled. I was giving up. And he makes it all seem so easy. He makes me feel special and like I am lovable just how I am. 

Do not stop until you find your person that makes you feel 100% safe in all ways in life- even with yourself. I’ve ruined so many relationships, shit… I’ve ruined so many people. I could never do any of that to this man. He’s never given me a reason. He sets boundaries but addresses me in the calmest sweetest ways so he can explain before I jump on the defensive. 

I don’t know about doing it myself, but it sure saved my life having someone come in that showed me true love, acceptance, care, compassion, and vulnerability. If I found a way, there’s got to be more.",SnowflakeGypsy,yvi78t

I was finally able to get into a new relationship after being emotionally unavailable for soo long it’s a shame how it’s needed up but last year when i got cheated on i tried to kms, didn’t eat for half a year, self harmed and cried constantly. i just truly hated myself. i’m on seroquel now so i think that’s GREATLY helped but i am dealing with it amazing right now i know it’s not a reflection on me and i have not went bitter and went crazy to my recent partner i have also not really cried i’ve just accepted that’s a reflection on them and i’m just so pleased with how i’ve continued life right now",o0mingmak,yvi78t

13,"I consider myself successful. I still have some BPD traits but much less than before and I cope much healthier :) I still struggle with emotional dysregulation but that’s likely due to my other disorders. I’ve been doing DBT and other therapies since 2017 (when I was first diagnosed with Borderline at 23). 
I have a host of comorbidities— autism, ADHD, complex ptsd, bipolar disorder, OCD, anxiety, dependent personality disorder traits….. buuuuut with A LOT of therapy, self care, 12 step groups, sobriety from substances/eating disorders/self harm, mood stabilizers and ADHD meds… oh and coming to understand that I’m transgender… like damn I’m so much better than before. I’ve also done EMDR / IFS therapies for the trauma side of things— can’t recommend enough! But again this is simply what has worked for me. But I agree with some other responders on here…. I used to not want recovery, but now I finally have had enough of being sick. Now I embrace that I’m neurodivergent and accommodate my needs but also work towards mental health recovery",adhd-dog-guy,yvi78t
14,"Not fully recovered but guess dealing with things (esp relationship) better than before I was diagnosed and got therapy. I got diagnosed sometimes in 2021 and went to therapy consistently until now. There’s a caveat tho: I found a suitable therapist I can trust. Been on meds for some time too, not for the bpd per se, but for increasing my energy level in my depressive state. In my case, keeping the meds to minimun dose is the best way to keep my mood and energy level stable so I can work on other stuff. But eventually, I tapered off and stop it completely.

My last relationship went south, it’s failed (though this time not from my end). The difference is I can pretty much handle it well. He is someone I love dearly. My favourite person. If you have bpd, you know what it means to lose your FP. It’s not without tears and such. But I managed to not SHd during this breakup and used other healthier coping mechanism.

That being said, the symptom is not completely gone. I still relapsed (particularly in SH), though far and fewer in between (twice in a year?) and that’s due to extreme stress and heavy trigger. Relationship wise, I’m doing pretty good nowadays even tho it’s with my dear circle of friendship and not in romantic sense. I can express my needs and concerns assertively instead of being passive agressive then suddenly cutting people off. I make an amend to not ghost people anymore, to the point that when someone had crush on me and I cannot return his feeling, I would tell him so to save his and my time.

Now I am off meds for half a year already and I am doing just fine. Even though I’m still prone to feeling empty and lonely, but I am pretty content with myself for now. To give a realistic picture, it’s not always like this. But the most important thing is low days are more manageable.

Best of luck!",aneyexltl,yvi78t

Choosing to not recover, it’s so frustrating.

Like I hate this perspective of “you actually have to work for it” to me it implies that people are lazy for “not trying”. Which isn’t true. Surviving everyday is trying. It sucks that people with bpd get traumatized, get bpd, and then have all this pressure on them to recover and if they don’t cuz bpd fuckinf sucks then everyone thinks they “aren’t actually trying”

I had a friend a few years ago diagnosed with BPD and im ashamed to admit I struggled to understand and definitely judged them for it (probably because it hit far too close to home) as I’ve recently been diagnosed myself) I’m 27 and have struggled for years with feeling like there is something wrong with me but knowing i needed to change. Very scared to tell people about my diagnosis but I know it’s the truth and also know I need to accept it in order to fix the parts of myself that are destroying my own happiness.

22,"Because I keep telling people that you have to want the help and actually work for it. I tried going through BPD without medication and without therapy or any aid for a very long time. I did good on my own (through research and reading) but I was still not in a healthy place and I obviously did not have the right tools. My first year in therapy/DBT alone was very successful and I accomplished a lot more than I had in the past few years on my own. I sought out help because I truly wanted to change and be a better person to myself and those around me. I imagined that if I gave up I would lose the people I cared about the most and ultimately I’d always be in pain so I worked very hard to change that and I stuck to it. People also hate hearing that routine, good health, sleeping habits, therapy, exercise/going outside actually works and can reverse a lot of symptoms of trauma and poor health. Someone here the other day kept saying how they hate how often their therapist tells them to drink water. I said that unfortunately sometimes it sucks to hear it, even I myself thought my DBT lessons were silly and corny, but being hydrated and taking good care of your body can drastically improve emotional dis-regulation. They accused me of being dismissive and saying water cures depression lol. Now that I’m at this point tbh I realize that many (not all!) people *want* to be stuck in the struggle. It lets them victimize themselves, make excuses, or they’ve made it their entire personality and don’t know who they are without it. I totally understand because that was me at one point, but you can’t do that and claim that you’re trying to get better. You’re not - and that’s okay. Everyone’s journey is different but if you want it you can have it. That’s probably my biggest piece of unpopular advice.",johntitorswife,yvi78t

25," It's a trauma response, remember that we didn't choose this it was forced upon us by the people who should've loved us unconditionally but instead chose to abuse and neglect us. Now of course as adults we got shafted and have to be responsible for undoing the damage they've caused but we are this way because it's a survival response.  No one tells a person with ptsd they're bad or evil we shouldn't be told that either. 

We all know that life isn't fair but we can balance the scales if we try really hard and dedicate ourselves to unlearning the bad behaviors and learning the healthy ones. That's all this is. Unlearning some things and learning some new healthier things. It took me a long time and I still have struggles I imagine I always will so don't think it's all smooth sailing lol it's not. But because I unlearned some things and learned some new healthy things I'm capable of managing much more efficiently. Like the ""normies"" do.. You'll get there when you're ready 

I also want to say I'm 35 and as I aged the explosiveness I had when I was younger really toned down on it's own so therapy is amazing, truly life changing, but aging really helps too. My heart goes out to those who post and are in their  teens and 20's because it's already a difficult time without bpd, add that in and instead of getting over a mole hill y'all have to climb everest.

I'd say that sometimes the challenge is to not be influenced by others maladaptive and/or dysfunctional patterns that they actively normalise and even enforce, particularly in the arts scene (I'm an artist). Also, having a strong community that you know has your back and you have theirs. Where there is open dialogue and responsibility. People who can hold you accountable with compassion and gentleness but also steadfastness. 

I'm not in a relationship but I am dating someone and it's very healthy. There is plenty of open communication and dialogue, and I am honest about my fears and anxieties.

30,"I do! I’ve been with my boyfriend steady for 6 years and of those 6 I’ve only been recovered for the latter half. I will say that the first half was rough because in general I was at a very low moment of my life and not the healthiest mentally (no treatment). I don’t think anyone should stay in a shitty relationship - but in my case I was very fortunate to have my partner believe me when I said “I’m going to change”. He was willing to stick it out through the hardships and in turn I showed him that I was serious about it. Now here we are in a much healthier place living together, traveling, and now planning for a home and babies. Which btw, I held off on having children until I no longer qualified for BPD and until I knew in my heart I was healed enough to not pass down anymore trauma. It is absolutely possible for this to be your reality but you have to really want to improve and even then wanting it is not enough; you have to really work for it. I think though that I would have realistically wanted to do all of this healing before getting into a relationship but it’s kind of just the way things turned out for me.

Does that sound about right?  Kind of like you all are in trouble for doing something wrong, and now need to be perfect or else?

6,"She gave me some exercises to practice when I was triggered. She taught me to reason with myself and calm down.

For example, my partner does x and I immediately think the relationship is awful and I want to lash out. So I get some space (sometimes it just means watching some videos by myself, I don’t need to be alone) and think about what happened. If it has happened before and we talked about it, what did he say to justify it? Did it make sense? Does it apply now? How really bad is what happened? What other good things are happening at the moment? What other good things does he do for me?

It helps me see things from other perspectives, it calms me down and it avoids repeating the same argument over and over.

But most importantly I learned to communicate. Once I do all these exercises I see if there’s something new that I want to discuss with him and think about the proper way of doing it. Not accusing him, with actual examples and what I’d like to do to fix it, or what my needs are. But also being understanding of what his situation is at the moment and what he needs.

I have also learned to wait for the right time to discuss things. In the past I would just blurt it out and ruin the whole day and then regret it. Now I wait. It helps finding the right moment but it also helps because I have cooled down and it’s a lot easier to talk this way.

It takes time but it also takes commitment from her side. If she’s open to it, it’s good if you let her know how it makes you feel. Honestly I asked my partner to be honest with me because it’s the only way I can learn.",diabolikal__,xt8wnv

The first therapist was treating me for anxiety, the current one diagnosed me with bpd. It was pretty quick to pick up there coping mechanisms but I still get triggered and have bad thoughts. In the begging I’d take longer and I would still choose the wrong time or wrong words etc.

I still improve every day, and I’d say I became quite functional a year ago, so one year into therapy. Today for example I got triggered, I went to the couch to watch a series and thought about what I wanted to say. An hour later my partner came to me and I just didn’t say anything. After 30 minutes my mood was gone and now I don’t really feel like I need to say anything.

1,"To answer the question in your title, no. The idea that abusive behavior is inherently tied to BPD is a harmful stereotype. BPD creates incredibly powerful and unstable emotions but it doesn't cause a person to make the choice to ACT on those emotions and commit relationship abuse or violate a person's trust. People with BPD are full human beings who are capable of being (and should be) held accountable for abuse.",rena-something,12ypkfd

4,"For me, this is true. It's like that person becomes our punching bag because they're always around. We hurt the ones we love the most. It's a weird combination of thinking we aren't good enough to be loved so we push you away but then our fear of abandonment kicks in and we love you and need you like crazy. Treatment is needed ASAP because this is a life long illness. Coping skills and DBT are a big help. Good luck!!",inmyfeelings2020,12ypkfd
5,"First, I am so sorry about what you're going through. 
No one deserves that.

Second, people's BPD can manifest in so many different ways. We're not a monolith. Some people may be more likely to be abusive toward their favorite person, but others are much more likely to wind up with an abuser as their FP. 
I have BPD myself and part of the trauma that gave me it was being raised in a broken home. Both my parents had toxic and abusive traits, and I'm very certain one of them had undiagnosed BPD. 
Speaking as a child of dysfunctional parents, it's not necessarily a better choice to stay with their other parent. A unified family is not the best option if the parents are toxic or abusive to each other.
You should also know that your child will be at a greater risk of developing BPD if he's being raised by someone who has untreated BPD. Or any sort of abusive or neglectful parent.
 It might present a bit differently because he's male, so it's important to be on the lookout for signs he's developing it or any other long-term issues like CPTSD. He's also automatically prone to developing it if he's already a sensitive child. 
No matter how much you love this woman, the safety and well-being of your child needs to come first. Even if it's not with both parents. You need to take the steps to make sure the cycle isn't repeated. Even if your son doesn't develop it, you probably wouldn't want to see him in a relationship like the one you're in. Don't show him that this is okay. 

The insight on how she treats you vs others: 
She treats other people better because she sees them differently. She puts you on a pedestal and when you show any signs of not being the caricature she has of you in her head, it's devastating. The love that people with BPD feel can be similar to that of a child's, and one of the reasons the love for a favorite person can so easily become an obsession. 
It's a disorder that emotionally stunts people, and building emotional intelligence your brain lacks takes time and effort. 
 She may not understand how unfair or detrimental that is to you. In the moment when she's going off, it's likely her own emotions blind her to other people's. 

She absolutely needs treatment. That's a fact. She's unlikely to change without it, even if she does make an effort. It's just too hard on your own to break your patterns.
 DBT won't solve BPD, but it can be invaluable for recognizing and breaking patterns of toxic behavior. She may need regular psychotherapy before that, though.

 If she doesn't decide to try it or tries it, quits and refuses or puts off finding another therapist, you need to leave. No room for leeway. It's not her fault her trauma manifested this way, but it's her responsibility to make sure others don't suffer because of it.

Please don't stick around because you love her. I'm not saying she doesn't feel love for you, but that feeling of love on its own is not enough to fix your relationship. 

First and foremost, prioritize the safety of yourself and your child. You love her, but you also love your child. And that means protecting him, even if it's from the person you love most.",Sun_and_Shadow_,12ypkfd
6,"TBH, that is a loaded question when you're talking abt someone with a personality disorder. Truth is it can be perceived that way and is more often than not. The person they love see's it and experiences it more than others bc they are with that person more than anyone else and are also the person closest to the intimate core wounds they have so there are more instances of episodes. They subconsciously look to their partner (or FP) to regulate their emotions. BPD is not just a disorder of emotions but also a disorder of relationships, especially intimate ones. Also add in compounded trauma and impaired ability to emotionally regulate themselves bc of a lifetime of acting how they feel. Yip, complicated mess. No one deserves abuse in any way, period. And yes, any relationship where one (or both) ppl have issues like bpd that aren't being treated, it will continue.

There are lines that in my opinion OPs partner has crossed, but if OP is willing to move past them then getting this person to treatment is the only saving grace.

0,"We had similar suffering in our home and we were able to reduce the intensity of the Emotionally Dysregulated Events (EDEs) but they are still going to happen. I fundamentally changed how I responded to the EDEs to protect my own mental health and help my family.

There are a lot of things that have to happen for this behavior to diminish and it can take a year or more. The improvements will be gradual and hopefully you can maintain your sanity throughout.

One of the most important things is that you can not control another person's behavior only influence it. It is much easier to prevent EDEs from happening by not engaging and following simple house rules before it starts rather than spending your limited mental health resources dealing with the actual event (splitting) in a crisis situation.

First off, phone time is regulated in our house due to smart phone addictions.  The basic frame work is our young adults get their smart phone between 7 and 10 at night. There was a lot of push back on this, but it is a rule to stay in our house, if you want free room and board. They know that they have an addiction and that it is bad for their mental health, especially if they are on it all day. They know about the dopamine cycle and the ""feels good"" that comes along with the phone time is not normal or healthy to everyday life. Life is boring. Life is work. Life is hard. Excessive phone time distorts this reality such that all they want is to be on their phone and nothing else. We have had numerous arguments and physicality over the phone, but over time it has stabilized. I control the router setting for wifi access but I never ""take"" their phones, they have to hand them in respectfully and on time. We all agree during our family meeting that this is important for family unity and to prevent conflict. Phone time is the main commodity that we use to reward good behavior. It is important to have something like this for motivation. Note one of our kids (Non BPD but still complex mental health concerns) is attending an alternative school and he gets to take his phone with him because he is passing and being successful. However he still has to take pass it in at 10 at night and take a break between 5-7 everyday, this is not unreasonable as it aligns with supper time and our family meeting hour.

In our household, we have both House rules and Family Connections rules. House Rules are straight forward - clean you room, Personal hygiene is important. etc while family connection rules are more behavior related - No Putdowns, say I love you everyday, etc.  These are custom to our family and are based on the things we need to do as a family to keep everyone safe and to respect our property. We sit down as a family for a maximum of 60 minutes, every day at 6pm.  In practice 3-4 meetings go the full hour, 2-3 meetings are 30-45 minutes due to late start and 1-2 days per week we may skip the meeting but this is only if it is unavoidable and things in the household are going smoothly. One of the rules list (house or FC) are read out everyday so that everybody is on the same page. New rules get added as needed. Often we play a game of trouble (dice popping game) for the last 15 minutes. Family connections are about increasing the positive interactions.

The meetings are simply a conversation at the supper table talking about everyday things, concerns, feelings, whatever. Sometimes we do ""therapy type stuff"", such as how to handle emotions, self esteem, etc. Other days, it could be whatever is on the kids minds as this gives them a channel to voice their concerns. We then problem solve different ways to deal with their concerns. The essence or tone of the meeting is very important, as the meetings are not  a ""He said She said"" type battleground but rather a ""Help me to understand your concerns and how best I can support you"". So while disciplinary actions and consequences may be necessary, they are delivered in a ""I am putting this support in place to help you to control your outbursts so that we keep our home a safe place. Do you agree? any suggestions?""

Another thing with my loved one with BPD ( lowBPD) is that they are very focused on the present with little regard to the future. So when a new rule or consequence is put in place, it does not impact the past behavior just the future behavior. Some people might say that you are letting them get away with it, but my response is that I would much rather get solid agreement on how to manage their future behavior that I know will happen again. And when it happens again, I enforce the rule that everyone agreed to 100%, no changing conditions, no backing down, no second chances because you agreed to it. I play the long game rather than dealing with shorter term objectives when introducing new rules. When they complain about unfairness of the new rule I say this is not ""my problem"" - this is a you problem as you agreed to the rule - you have to change your behavior.  I simply do not engage, the rule stands.

Some parents might say that they do not have another hour in the day right after/before supper to discuss, but my response is that you will easily save that 1 hour or more throughout the day. If something comes up during the day, and I am feeling pressured for an answer then I will say, let me think about that and we can talk about it at our meeting. By having the 1hr family meeting everyday - I save wasted time throughout the day managing the outbursts and other little things. As well the conversation and support offered can improve your relationship as your lowBPD knows that you are trying to help them regulate their emotions.

A fundamental rule in our house is a 5 minute timeout when emotions are starting to emerge. We named the 5 minute rule ""Purple Giraffes"" as it is funny name and is intended to break through the emotional mindset when things are getting heated. The 5 min timeout is not a punishment, although it appears that way.  For adults, the rule is usually applied to one self.  ex: I see that you are getting upset and I am also starting to get upset, I am going to take a purple giraffes to calm myself down. We can continue this conversation in 5 minutes if you like. I'm going to put the timer on and go to my room to breathe. When the kids were younger, a purple giraffes meant they had to go to their rooms to calm down for 5 minutes like a timeout to calm yourself down not as a punishment. The only other thing is that the once the child was sent to their room, they had to ask for the timer to be started respectfully.

If your lowBPD is emotionally dysregulated (splitting)

a) Purple Giraffes -  leave the room so they can figure out a way to calm down on their own. I would use this once the voices are raised and definitely as soon as yelling starts. If you can't have a conversation then you need to calm yourself down.

b) Leave the house (if possible), say this is not a healthy environment - I do not feel safe.  I am going for a walk to calm myself down and to give you time to calm yourself.

c) If they escalate the situation in any way that is physically threatening or otherwise unsafe to themselves call emergency help line (911) or the mental health crisis team (if available).  Note: threats of suicide are always accompanied by a call to 911. There will be one warning before I call, but guess what happened after we had our second 911 visit - no more threats.

I will say that the first time, I called 911 - I thought I was abusing the service but nope, the mental health team that showed up was fantastic and greatly helped defuse the situation.

In response to your original question about how to handle the splitting. If your loved one is dysregulated then you should leave them alone to soothe themselves. By interacting with their poor behavior you are validating the behavior, by giving them attention. You can not soothe or calm down your loved one. They have to do it on their own and when they have an audience it is much harder.

This is all very overwhelming but keep in mind progress not perfection. It can take months to put a system like this in place and for it to become part of your everyday routine.

Hope this helps.",PhotojournalistCalm3,1bxjx4a

My Psychiatric NP diagnosed me, I have seen her for about 10 years.  I began seeing her with run of the mill depression- which has been a factor in my life since middle school, but as time went on, life events became heavier, BPD symptoms magnified intensely.  I internalize mostly, so have done a decent job hiding it or distracting people with something else and generally polishing up my practice of ineffective coping mechanisms. The carefully constructed house of cards fell eventually, and hard.  

I, too felt like some things just totally didn’t fit. I have been in a committed marriage for 15 years- how could this be?  I googled “What does BPD look like day to day” and read around.  Mostly the thoughts and feelings were so so so relatable, more than anything ever in my life.  I read The Buddha and The Borderline- the author is younger than me and showed her traits at a much younger age, she also had some more obvious trauma, where my trauma is emotional only- mostly my family not recognizing and meeting my emotional needs.  But again, she writes her book with lots and lots of her internal dialogue, and so much of it was right from my head, down to the exact word.

I went for the full DBT model for treatment, I’ve tried damn near everything else on the planet.  Weekly DBT skills group sessions, weekly individual DBT sessions, with the diary card and coaching calls and all.  This took about a year.

Physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and social health are all key components of your overall health (that includes your MH). The more self-aware, the easier it is to fight intrusive thoughts and feelings. Learn about mindfulness. Figure out what it really is and how you can use it.

So there are BPD recovery places if you have the money for that. I don’t know the names, but you can look some up. It’s kind of like a mental rehab basically where they have nice outdoor activities and it’s focused on BPD. The environment is soothing basically and very calm. I would look at a place that focuses on BPD versus just any place that’s just “fun” because then they’re gonna come back with absolutely no skills to use in the real world.

I often find that for me what I feel is lacking most in my life is emotional support, validation and empathy.

I’ve always been decently capable so I can manage jobs and finances.

But god, internally, it feels like a void. My one and only romantic relationship was unfortunately with a guy who was likely a covert narcissist who was enmeshed with his family.

I was dismissed, invalidated, ignored or shut down and gaslit at every turn.

If I shared anything I was excited about, or wanted advice, maybe achieved something or wanted to do something together, he met it with silence or annoyance and be brushed off.

I could not talk to this person about ANYTHING.

And he was so cruel and manipulative and was never ever sorry for it. He’d purposely say or do things to hurt me because he knew I was sensitive.

Once the mask came off and I learned about who he really was when I first started dating him my whole relationship felt like a lie.

I felt like I saw him for who he really was for the first time and it rocked me to my core.

I realized how sheltered and naive I was. I was trusting and gullible.

And he would blatantly not give a flying fuck about me in more ways than one.

You can only imagine the pain I felt in that relationship. It’s hard being alone, but I’m relieved to be away from the stress.

And of course, my childhood was like this as well. My father for a while was supportive and helped me build up confidence in myself.

But he had an affair and left and my mom was unstable and so so abusive.

So I went from a neglectful environment to another neglectful environment.",SoftBoiledPotatoChip,xrsqyt

0,"The most highly recommended therapy for folks with BPD is Dialectical Beahviour Therpy (DBT). Some swear by it, while others are more critical. In any event, DBT offers a lot of skills and tools to help focus on mindfulness, managing your emotions, learning to respond in ways that are less detrimental, and interpersonal communication. 

If you're looking for this kind of assistance, I would Google ""DBT skills and tools."" I believe there are a number of free resources and YouTube videos available. Whether you do or do not fit the criteria for a BPD diagnosis, if you struggle with overwhelming emotions, I think you may find some helpful stuff. 

I'm not sure that ""complete control"" is attainable in any sense, but I try to focus on every silver lining. The silver lining of overwhelming emotions can be feeling overwhelming positive emotions, like beauty or love or determination or appreciation. My responses to intense negative feelings have been detrimentally explosive at times, but the consideration and loyalty I can offer is top-notch. My journey has involved a lot of internal questioning, appreciating myself, and reality for the good, the bad, and the neutral. I've also realized the need to focus on positivity, as negativity had become my default. 

I'm sorry that you've experienced so much in your short life. You are so young and have so much ahead of you. You've made it through all you've mentioned (and what you didn't), and you're still here. More than that, you want to improve yourself to be the best mother you can. At 24. After everything. You're a superstar, and don't you forget it!!

1,"1. What age were you when you were diagnosed with BPD? 23, but from shadow searching I learned that I have always had BPD mannerisms.

2. What advice would you give to someone recently diagnosed with BPD? Do not look up what it is online. Find a GOOD Dialectical Behavioral Therapist or even get ahead of the DBT course manual by Marsha (can’t remember last name)

3. What symptoms of BPD are your most pronounced? Suicidal and homicidal intrusive thoughts but number one would def be self sabotaging 

4. How does BPD affect your everyday lifestyle?
It has been controlling my lifestyle so it’s not just effecting me.

5. Do you find it easier or harder to connect with other people who have BPD, compared to non BPD patients? It honestly depends on the day. Everyday I get along with BPD people but sometimes I can’t work well with others. Currently a struggling “chameleon” as my therapist likes to say

6. What have these treatments affected your BPD? You never listed any treatment styles so you figure it out on your own

7. Do you think that you having an understanding of BPD makes it easier to live with? Lmao yes and no because the god complex is disgusting. I am a sexual assault survivor and I still haven’t worked on trauma related therapy. If you are in DBT you MUST finish that type of therapy before you start another (psychiatrist at a psych facility told me that.) 

8. How have you researched BPD since your diagnosis? Ihate you- don’t leave me. Sometimes I act crazy. How to lose your mind and create a new one. And the DBT course manual are all books I have been using and still use

9. How do you think BPD affects your core personality? Affect lmao. It CONTROLS, most of the time, my personality.

10. Is there anything else you would like to discuss about BPD? Find a good therapist who is DBT based and actually ENJOYS working with DBT patients. A lot of therapists will fire BPD patients because they don’t understand the extreme internal problems that we are faced with. Look for a good psychiatrist too, not just one trying to get money but one who knows how to work and properly handle BPD patients",Messy_brainnerd,p6toiq

Last week I surrendered all my cards to my parents. I have also been unemployed since the beginning of July because my homicidal and suicidal thoughts literally made me have visions and hear voices but therapist believes it’s because of all the medication changes. I need to get medication changed A LOT because I am apparently a fast learner when it comes to the DBT book. I just suck at actually going through with the skills by myself because I do not have anywhere to call my own personal home.

If he's not giving you reasons to think he is cheating, not being even secretive with his phone, you're saying he's present for you and the kids... (No, being defensive about it even if you calmed down it's a normal reaction about feeling ""controlled"" over something small) 

In this case I think you need to process the feelings (take your time, try to think about it in a realistic way, journal about it, talk to your partner calmly about it when you're both in a good headspace, tell him why it's important, etc...) and just let go of them.

The reality of the world is that cheaters are going to cheat.  You will find out about it someday and you will be sad move on with your life.   Or they are not cheating and you will move on with your life as well but together.

1,"A decade is a good assessment.  Not that you'll need to go to therapy sessions twice a week, but this shit is FOREVER and ten years of actively practicing treatment skills is a reasonable amount of time to be able to mimic ""normal"" function.

As far as the shame goes, awareness of it is 90% of overcoming it.  It's not you, it's your disease that causes the shame.  Recognising your shame-spiral triggers and either rewiring them or avoiding them is the big skill to cultivate.  Even when you're a master of mental kung-fu, the shame still happens, you just learn the skills to be able to choose how you react to it.

I'm 52 years old.  I still shame-spiral sometimes about an incident that happened when I was 5, and it was a nothing situation.  My dad wanted to pick me up so I could ride on his shoulders.  I freaked out because I was afraid.  He was all ""Okay, no problem.""  I still remember that, and think how it must have made him feel that I didn't trust him enough to do that, and it ricochets around in my head until I'm a gibbering mess for two days.  or it used to, until I realised that he probably never thought about it once, and I was projecting my feelings onto him.

2,"First, you should realize that a lot, probably most, of the people who've called you crazy have some sort of mental health issue of their own. Some probably just as serious as BPD, even if they're unaware. 

 As you continue with DBT, one thing you might realize is just how much of the population lacks emotional intelligence. Ours is more significant than most, but a lack of emotional intelligence is a societal issue as well as a personal one.

Unfortunately our BPD minds can be impatient, and that plus the black-and-white thinking can cause an, ""I don't see the desired results, therefore it's not working."" 
But DBT takes time, along with work. If it was instantaneous, it wouldn't truly be changing your patterns. They took years if not decades to form, and they'll take time to learn to control. 

 On society/other people being assholes: 
I don't mean to say that everyone else is the problem or that BPD is not a significant mental illness. But that most of the stereotypes surrounding BPD don't fit everyone  with it, and the most harmful traits can also be found in people without BPD, or without any diagnosis. 

Recognizing that there's a problem doesn't fix that problem, but you can't work on the problem without recognizing it. 

When it comes to shame, realize you didn't have a choice in developing this disorder. But that doesn't mean you have no choice at all. No one said it'd be an easy decision, but it is a decision. 

It's not fair that you should have to work to keep the pain you're in from transferring to other people or fight the blame you constantly put on yourself. It truly isn't. 
But the alternative is not better for yourself or anyone else.

The biggest thing, is realize that having BPD means it will require work to be good to both others and yourself. 
But you're not doomed to be miserable or a horrible person, even if it's a lifelong condition.

8,I will definitely join one of those programs I’m just waiting for school to end. Did it help you? Like what kind of skills did you learn? Does it help with the shame and the emptiness and the ego death?,beepbeep123345432,12w2uzx
9,"Also, I was very skeptical of DBT as well at first, but I just went through with it and these techniques actually helped me a lot, also with emptiness.",NovelCheck7371,12w2uzx
10,"I understand. But that’s the truth of the matter, I’ve come to accept I will always love or care about someone more than they do me. It’s just a part of the disorder. I have found that aside from my romantic partners, I am no longer bothered by that notion.",Suspicious_Dealer815,12w2uzx
11,"My program is 2 years. I've now just completed a year. At the beginning they ask what you what to change about yourself and they will teach you the tools necessary to do that. For example they teach you how to cut off toxic people in your life. It's certainly changed my life and made me balanced.

Quiet BPDs may be able to control their reactions outwards, but that doesn't still mean you have good emotion control. It contains so much more than that. You also need to be able to calm the storm _inwards_, because _that_  is the source of our struggles. DBT focuses a lot in what's happening _in_  you, and how you can use your body to calm your mind. 

I'm not ashamed of who I am. I have used my DBT skills: applied a meaning to my disorder. I became borderline because in the environment where I grew up to be, I had to be what I am. I would not have survived or I would have had a fate significantly worse had I not developed borderline. Now I am not in that environment anymore and don't need it to survive. Now I need to learn to turn it off.

As such, it's not shameful. It's your way to protect yourself. We can learn better ways, healthy ways. Well that's the logic I use, it might not work or apply to you. But all in all, I'd suggest trying to look for a greater meaning, a purpose behind all this. And no this does not mean anything religious necessarily, unless that's your thing. :)",Melthiela,12w2uzx
12,"I’ve only just finished the first month of pre-assessment, but it absolutely addresses shame (which is a big one of mine), emptiness, and any other strongly charged emotions. You can do this during school too! In fact, it will probably help you with both schools and the program to be in a situation that may be stressful to you so you can target those triggers. There’s usually a long wait list for these programs, so I’d try to sign up for one now. It took me about a 4 month wait to get in.",lady__mb,12w2uzx

I hope I can get there too and learn how to control my inner storms",beepbeep123345432,12w2uzx
15,"I’d assume if you go into remission and are no longer exhibiting symptoms, it would be evenly matched. But bpd is with you for life. It can lessen over time, but it takes a lottt of therapy and consistency. I’m not quite there. Not even close actually. So, I don’t know. I’d just say don’t give up. Also if you like podcasts, YouTube has some from doctor fox, and HealthyGamerGG. They’re helpful to me at least",Suspicious_Dealer815,12w2uzx

0,I’m gonna be real honest here. You are not ready for a relationship. Eventually you’ll snap and be rude to her. At least that’s what it sounds like. She won’t deserve that. Stay in therapy and consider medications even. You need to understand no one is perfect. Especially not us people with BPD. Would you want someone to be that annoyed with you all the time?

0,"stick with it if you truly want this career. im in the same boat as you as well. have bpd but want to b a psychotherapist or smtg in that area. 

my advice is while youre studying classes, make sure youre also getting better. im not sure where youre at rn so maybe what im saying wont b as “beneficial” but try doing dbt courses, r/dbtselfhelp is also a fantastic sub that offers help from others, but also many many many resources like websites, work sheets, videos, etc. 

imo, having bpd allows us to really & truly connect with someone who is struggling. we understand & feel their emotions (maybe not everyone feels them, but for me i can feel their emotions & sense when someone is upset, angry, happy etc.) allowing us to b more help than someone who just uses logic in that field. of course, its a good balance of both, however, too strongly of one or the other can b a little tricky; general statement as well. 

while working towards lessening severity of symptoms & learning how to manage them & stay there (its a up & down journey though, but its worth it & the downs only make us stronger), & learning what youre doing rn & eventually getting into that career, itll balance itself out. it will prevent what others say or feel or are going thru not b as much of a trigger; youll know what to do in those kind of circumstances to prevent it from debilitating you, while also helping the patient. 

you can do this & honestly learning abt psychology alone will help anyone who struggles w any mental health issue. you learn how the brain works, why people behave the way they do, etc. itll give you more awareness while youre helping yourself.

growth mindset & a positive attitude will help a lot negating those negative, discouraging thoughts. what ifs are what ifs for a reason :). it takes time to get there & work, but giving yourself that time is so important. remember to not overwhelm yourself too much at once as well. that can put those bad thoughts back into a place they dont belong. step by step, one thing at a time.",,18ajdv8
1,"Hey there! I’m almost done my degree in Social Work and currently working as a community counsellor. I’ve lead DBT groups. I’ve also struggled with not only imposter syndrome but feeling like I cant handle it either. 

Self compassion and self management are extremely important. You need to be very on top of managing and being aware of what you can handle. My advice is to advocate for yourself, and when you’re done your program to start slow. Take on part time clientele not full time. Do online if it works better for you. Have your own therapist, and the cliche eat, sleep, and take care of your own needs. 

Personally, I’ve reconsidered my entire life plan of what I can and cannot handle and after completing this degree and starting to be a therapist myself, realized I cannot have children on top of it, so I’ve made the decision to be child free. That’s a personal choice for me. Your accommodations and balance might look different. But figuring out what it is and sticking with it is so important. And also, you CAN do it. Your lived experience makes you perfect for the job. You’re human, helping humans having a human experience",PinSpirited8787,18ajdv8

0,"Thank you for your altruism -- it's always pleasant to encounter people who have something valuable to offer and are interested in giving it away.

There are so many people without access to mental health services, either because of waiting lists or because of the absence of services in their location or nation. 

Because that is the case, I think that the best way to maximize the impact of your gift is to either offer:

1. short-term, time-limited structured DBT groups

2. short-term, time-limited psychotherapeutic groups for people with BPD

3. some kind of (weekly) chat room for a limited number of participants on a first-come, first-served basis but allowing an unlimited number of observers -- possibly either on particular DBT skills you have chosen for each week, or offering informal, psychotherapeutic groups (again, first-come, first-served) dealing with common problems experienced by people with BPD

I don't know what platforms would be best, although my personality disorders program uses Zoom; rooms can be closed to people with the right password. I'm sure there must be video-streaming platforms with controls on the number of active participants.

Here's another possibilit: I don't know how the content could be developed, but how about a YouTube channel for which you compose mindfulness meditations and follow them up with presentations on particular DBT exercises or skills? In other words, you could start with a guided meditation on living in the moment, followed by a presentation on ""Check the Facts"" or a few techniques for surviving moments of crisis (e.g. 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear etc.; using cold water; paced breathing; etc.).

The one possible issue that comes to mind is that real-time groups with audience participation could get unfocused or worse -- imagine, for example, someone having a crisis online or being seriously triggered by something another participant said or did or showed, someone trying to hijack the group online for any number of reasons, or the awful possibility that someone could self-harm in public.

0,"Commenting as I would also like to know. Even at my most mentally stable I struggle with this too. 
Sometimes I use two skills in one - I used to use a distraction technique of creating little goals for myself to accomplish; then the existential feelings of dread and chronic emptiness disappear for a little while while I am focused on something else. This only works for me when no major depression is present, so I have enough energy and determination to accomplish these goals. 
In the end - it only works temporarily, but its better than nothing.",quadendeddildo,f0wnz0

I know acceptance based skills can ease us into change oriented skills-like you said, Distraction can help reduce intensity of distress and in turn this can allow for greater accessibility when using more difficult skills.

1,"He sounds like a piece of shit. Communication is crucial in any relationship, romantic, family, working or otherwise. You are not wrong for asking for it. Whatever feelings he has on your situation are his to deal with, and you’re not at fault just because he doesn’t like the boundaries you set. If he doesn’t like the situation, he’s free to leave it. 

That being said, ANYONE who puts or leaves you in a dangerous situation doesn’t care for your well-being, and should be cut out immediately. You need to protect yourself physically, and he clearly doesn’t care as proven by him laughing at your injuries. That’s some straight up fucking bullshit, and I would punch someone if I saw them do that to one of my friends. You deserve better people in your life than that.",seraia,rumive
2,"From a person who went through this too, I was not diagnosed back then but my ex did the same, I dropped out for an year due to bad suicidal thoughts and SH, but honestly it's been an year and I'd always choose this path than being with him ever. 
Even I used to beg, I went and begged his friends too, it was really bad, I was never like that in my life and back then I was only emotional and needed him. 
Even my ex used to always get angry and told me I didn't need therapy when I told I wanna seek help and he could handle me. You do not need such a person in your life who tells you you're the problem, you may have issues but it's better to fix them in therapy than being with someone who makes it seem mental health issues are your fault and make you feel horrible about it. After I got diagnosed with BPD I realized all my issues when he made it seem like I was the worst person alive so much so I wanted to kill myself because I thought I hurt him. 

Trust me, it's not worth it. My ex also had told me to go do it when I told him I was suicidal and once told me to go tell my parents and why I was bothering him. You deserve better, and for now you deserve a better health, not him.",_ackerman_69,rumive

He knows how much abandonment hurts me. I feel he gets a high off using that againist me to his advantage. His done silent treatment so many times that when he doesn't reply now I just start having a panic attack and try desperately to contact him. He will say his asleep or something but I know that's not true. I know he doesn't sleep for 24hrs. He can barely sleep 5. No matter how many times I've begged him to atleast tell me he will be busy or can't talk for that night , he never lets me know. Then tells me I shouldn't dare put that on him.

The book is written by Doctor Daniel Fox who is an expert in the field. He has YouTube videos that are amazing and gives advice on managing BPD including suicidal ideation and self harm. The way he explains it is so kind and sympathetic: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDOl0iZi2wA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDOl0iZi2wA) 

It has helped me to understand and better manage my BPD. I am almost finished it and I've seen a big difference already. I still have bad days, but I just practice self care on those days and accept that the feeling is temporary and it will pass and tomorrow will hopefully be a better day and tomorrow usually turns out to be a better day.

DBT skills are also excellent. I recently purchased a DBT skills workbook and even though I've just started the book, it is amazing. It starts with distress tolerance DBT skills, which is great for reducing self destructive behaviours.

0,"I appreciate this post a lot. ""FP"" culture in online BPD discussion is, frankly, awful in trying to normalize and romanticize one of the worst aspects of our disorder. It's the entire reason I don't really feel comfortable on r/BPD, and I dislike how this inevitably bleeds into every decent sub. 

On specifics though, do you think that every FP is a trauma reenactment response? It's an interesting concept though I'm not sure I would always agree as I feel like it may be generalizing. I would prefer a more open classification of ""'insecure attachment style' relationship"". Still 100% an unhealthy relationship, and based on a failed attempt at establishing a healthy interpersonal relationship that should NOT be encouraged or normalized, let alone romanticized, but open to the idea that these attachments can form with anyone, not just a reflection of a primary caregiver and/or abuser. Less ""It happened because of this person being who they are"" and more ""It happened because I have a poor understanding of healthy relationships and in this case failed to establish a healthy one"".",,ylqrjv
1,"Really insightful post - I agree wholeheartedly. There is so much romanticism around the concept of FPs that I think people ignore that these attachments are unhealthy at their core because they are maladaptive attachments as a trauma response. 

That level and type of attachment to someone is always going to be a problem because it's essentially an addiction to the feeling that person gives you, and I find so often in FP relationships you aren't even seeing that person as they truly are, just through the lens of what they make you feel. 

I hate having an FP and couldn't think of anything worse for my recovery than trying to encourage an FP attachment.

Personally, all of mine have been, but I wholly believe there's plenty of other equal cases where they're not e.g. they don't remind you of a past caretaker subconsciously, but rather they're like, I don't know, hella loving and funny, something that you wish your caretakers did.

Mental health in general becoming an accepted topic of conversation in contemporary society is a recent development. Overcoming the stigma of BPD is unfortunately up to us. We have to do our best to recover, to be with people who see us for us instead of the diagnosis. Eventually that circle of people will expand with more exposure to mental health education.

I wish it was different. It makes me angry that it was up to me to break the cycle of abuse, it was up to me to parent myself, and now it's also now up to me to recover from BPD and deal with its stigma.

A lot of things are inherently so unfair for us. But if you think about it, if we keep going forward, if we keep working towards educating society about BPD and mental health in general, the world in the future will be better so other people with BPD won't have to suffer as much.

2,"BPD can be extremely convincing because it uses real traumatic past experiences to tell you how your future will be BUT it is really important you start pushing back. Why would the future be exactly like the past? Afraid to get with a guy you really connect with because the last time you trusted someone it went poorly? Let yourself feel that fear but be clear where it’s coming from. Are there important differences between that last person and this new person? Either way, be true to yourself and establish boundaries early on. Don’t deny your feelings, POSITIVE or negative. They have to coexist to be healthy. 

In order to get balanced, people with BPD have to have a positive devils advocate (we’ll call it an angels’ advocate) that really thinks about benefits of relationships, things that feel good about connection, specific people, even love in general. This will not happen naturally for people with dismissive or avoidant attachment styles, it requires practice, intention, and honesty. I know this may be counter-intuitive when you are trying to stay safe from all of these real and perceived threats about other people, but you will starve yourself of life itself if you do not push back.

In my opinion, the best time to do this is when you have some support in place. It helps if you have a therapist, if you are working through BPD workbooks, if you are journaling, if you find yourself aware of these patterns you feel helpless to, if you are so fed up with this disorder you are ready to prove it wrong, and if and when you feel READY to take positive risks and invest in yourself. 

This is not unbeatable, but it will require work. Learn everything you can about BPD and attachment styles. Journal. Get some separation between your true personality and this disorder that warps reality. Feel free to PM me. It’s going to be okay.",mashedfig,k5rig1

3,"I have BPD and Bipolar2. I take Lamictal 300 mg for bipolar, but as far as I've been told meds don't work for BPD. 

I don't really hide my emotions. Can't actually. I'll cry out in public. Even at dinner in a crowded restaurant or on a busy street on a Saturday night. I'll get into loud heated arguments wherever. I'll laugh and act stupid and make a scene (drinking and drugs helped with that). I follow my emotions wherever they want to go. Up, down, sideways, diagonal. They are so extreme that holding them in isn't an option. Of course, afterward I'll feel guilt and shame and beat myself up forever and ever about it. I've known no other way.

I've had a very bad case of social anxiety all my life, so being alone makes me feel most at ease. when I'm alone for too long I disassociate, which in a creative field like the one I work in is not necessarily a bad thing. I dive head first into coping mechanisms and that helps me turn off the self abusing parts of my brain for a bit while I'm working at home. I am very social and I don't have a hard time making friends, but I get very emotionally drained if I hang out with people for too long.",,gtxrft

I do not take any meds but im impulsive and i have kinda unhealthy coping skilll..im a pothead so i smoke a lot weed but when i dont have weed with me i will smoke a lot a cigarette like 1 pack is just one day for me..im very addictive to cigarette and I don’t like it..i prefer weed over cigarette because weed make me feel better and i dont addicted to cigarette when im high..weed also help me to sleep at night...i also just quit drinking alcohol 3month ago.

I had a few friend so if i feel lonely i just go out hang with my friend but they can’t be around 24/7.i dont really like loneliness but sometimes when i feel overwhelm i will seek the loneliness..im not really good at media social and texting people so when im alone I don’t really have nobody to talk....several hours of loneliness is very long for me especially at night weed kinda help me getting through the loneliness.but when im sober loneliness is Like hell to me because i feel depressed,restless and inability to sleep at night.also being lonely for too long doesn’t make me more productive instead it make me lose motivation to become more productive....basically what i do when i get too lonely is go outside..",,gtxrft
5,"This is so relatable it hurts lol I have been part of so many different online forums where after an episode I just vanish, and almost never come back. If I do return to a certain forum its months later.

But even with the forums, I lost that feeling of safety that I got from them when I was younger. One day I just realized how none of these forum people are real friends, none of them will help in actual danger or real life situations. So this idea of 'fake' community still bothers me to this day, but I try to see it as a workplace environment, where you can still talk to people, but you try not to get attached to anyone, as that can lead to trouble.",Ant0on,gtxrft
6,"Yeah, I think BPD is hard to diagnose, as it also is often confused with depression, Bipolar and OCD (or all of them together).

Since I feel like a ghost most of the time, I dont care if something I do fails. So I can say there is some benefit from BPD in that creative regard, as its either no emotions whatsoever or an extreme non-stop rollercoaster. 

Also, I do get drained when I stay with people for too long, but I also cant be alone for too long, so a classic BPD case.

Since I’m not creatively invested it comes across as uninspired. Flat. With a quiet house for a couple days and some pot I can take myself fully out of my head and into the story. I just quit pot a few days ago, so not yet sure if I can achieve the same effect.

One of the biggest problems to this day I have is not getting enough sleep if I have to meet people the next day. I keep getting that same cycle of anxiety that if I dont get enough sleep I will mess the social event up and everyone will hate me (thus abandoning till the end of time). Do you have sleep problems?

&#x200B;

About bisexuality, it is an interesting thing I've noticed. I can't quite point it out, as it seems to be fluctuating. I thought I was bi, demisexual or pansexual for the past few years since my BPD was discovered, but something never seems to click when I think of the idea of being married to a man, or just being a couple. It confuses me also because I cant distinguish sometimes if Im platonically attracted to someone or is it actual sexual attraction. After long periods of solitude a sudden interaction with someone I can trust makes me kinda hyper and I become blinded by this feeling of being considered a friend (again, classic bpd case). I think they call it 'Favorite person', so I sometimes struggle to figure out how I am actually feeling towards that person, as it can feel like I would do anything to make that person happy. Now that I think about it, most of the time it is a guy. But thinking about sex with the person never quite sits right in my mind.",Ant0on,gtxrft

It’s gotten even worse since my last major manic episode, which landed me in an inpatient for suicidal ideation after I lost my last job just over ago. (Actually “lost my job” doesn’t explain the half of it. It was major fireworks.) I’ve gotten much better since I took time and sobered up, but my sleep hasn’t. Probably because my new drug of choice is anxiety.

I don’t know if it’s similar, but my attraction to men is physical not emotional. I think I would file it under “unstable self image”. Like the person in the comment above I have chameleon like qualities, so I feel the subconscious need to blend in to be accepted. At the time I realized I was bi I was living in San Francisco, working in the Castro, and hanging out a lot with a group of gay men my gf befriended. Was that BPD? Probably. I hadn’t thought about it before now. It’s a depressing thought considering I thought it was one of the few stable aspects of my character I could hold on to. Shit.

Hate to say it here where so many people are struggling worse than me, but in some ways I like BPD because it forces me to see more of life through these forced adaptations. Very unstable, yes, but emotionally I feel in technicolor and Dolby digital what most only experience in greyscale and mono. 

I’d often say even before I was diagnosed that since I don’t fit in anywhere I tend to fit in everywhere. On the other hand when I look inside to find the core of my character it seems to just be made up of BPD symptoms. Not sure if that makes sense.",,gtxrft

Hope it can help.",Ant0on,gtxrft
18,"""Technicolor and dolby digital"" haha I like that analogy. BPD is pretty good in creativity, and if I didnt have a creative outlet like animation Id prolly be dead by now. 

It's also interesting about the identity core of a BPD person. I feel like 100 different people if I am put in 100 different situations. Adapting and being a chameleon is so common that losing a perception of self on a regular basis is the norm for me. I remember I used to wake up as a teen everyday and it always felt like I had to remember who I am and what my values were. I guess why I hate mornings to this very day. 

&#x200B;

I wanted to ask about self-harm. Do you do it sometimes or have you done before? I think BPD folks like to punish themselves and be overly harsh in general on oneself. Self-harm can be also psychological of course, so thats what I tend to do during some bad moments. Depraving myself from any joy or pleasure is what usually happens if I dont get my social fix.",Ant0on,gtxrft

0,"BPD can be a really ""invisible"" problem for a lot of people, because they don't see the inner turmoil that we go through. As someone who grew up with parents who didn't believe in the concept of mental health, I would suggest to not bring it up to them for a while. It's just not worth it. Work on yourself, keep seeing the professionals you're seeing, and try to seek support from friends or from people like us online. I know this is disheartening - but this is YOUR journey and your parents and brother are making it about them, and how they see your issue versus understanding how you see and FEEL about your own issues.

You deserve your own space to work all this out. If you're not in DBT, try to get into a program or with a therapist who does DBT. If neither is possible, work on DBT workbooks and try apply those skills in every day life. You just can't change people's minds who don't understand. It's unfortunate but it's true; you deserve to recover and you deserve people who believe in you. We believe in you, and your feelings deserve to be validated.",Creative_Lettuce_630,q57hsq

3,"My family are unsupportive. They didn't help me, they stigmatized me. When I get better they are super happy n relived but they are quick to turn around and use my mental health issues against me at the first opportunity and say that I will always fall back in my old patterns (which is not true). They said I'd never change a few years back but now they tell me I changed a lot and that I am doing better -\_-"". They were never there when I needed them and they are still not. I learned to be my best friend and to be my own savior.  


Your family seems unsupportive and from what I understand they are actively harmful and puts your recovery at risk. I had to get away from my family to get better. I literally moved towns. It was a hard decision but I had to prioritize my self and my recovery. I don't know if it's a possibility for you but I think it'd be best. If not have some clear boundaries and let your brother know that what he said was unacceptable even if he was angry.  


You can get some DBT workbooks if you did it in the past and it helped. I don't think people will be your mentor for free because it's a lot lot lot lot lot of work to help someone to deal with mental health issues. You always got reddit to ask stuff but I think some work you got to do on your own even if it's hard as fork. I know how hard it can be I went thought that. But I also have some friends I can write to if I need, some of them have BPD.

I also try to explain my condition to my parents but my mom already read the stigmatizing stuff about BPD and wouldn't listen and my dad doesn't really cares or listen so. I think you shouldn't spend time trying to explain your disorder to your family. I understand what it's like to really wish your family would support you but you alone can't make that happen. It has to come from them. I think that the best thing you can do is to reinvest that energy into getting better.   


Remember that recovery isn't linear and can be heavily affected by environmental factors. It's ok if something bad happens to you and you get a ""BPD flair"" because of it. Have some empathy for your self when it gets worst. It'll really help to not go too deep and to get better. The sun will shine again.",,q57hsq

It’s like positive reinforcement, it encourages you to keep trying and let’s you know you’re doing well. What you received from your brother was the exact opposite. If they won’t hear you out, try writing them a letter explaining how you feel.

6,"No. My parents and I have a tumultuous relationship at best. When I opened up to them about my diagnosis and they inevitably asked why, I was honest and told them that it's not clear cut however there were many experiences in my childhood regarding their treatment of me that could have contributed.

My parents scoffed, told me that there are different ways to parent and that experts in this field are always changing their minds about what constitutes good parenting. In their mind, because they had good intentions, there is no need for them to ever apologise for any inadvertent damage they caused me.

The biggest thing that has helped me with my parents is radical acceptance and going low contact with them. I moved out of home at 18 as soon as I could, and we only speak every couple of months. 

The reality is that my parents are never, ever going to consider that what I - and my siblings too, if to a lesser extent - experienced was abuse. They are never going to consider their actions, and they will never learn how to properly apologise (both my parents have some narcissistic tendencies). While it would means a great deal to me if they did, it is harmful to me to try and make it clear to them just how badly they messed me up because they always just turn it back around on me.

My parents are the way they are. This doesn't mean I need to change them. It doesn't mean I need to continue to act as if everything is okay.

I do what is best for me. I don't call them. We speak only when they call me, and if they call too often I will moderate this by  accepting the call only when I want to.

I will never stop feeling like I need them to understand, or wanting them to recognise their actions. It was very hard, but I've let go.

I also notice it conflicts with the idea that you'll never be rid of the pain.  My intuition is telling me that the sentence should be ""it feels like I'll never be rid of the pain."". You've proven that you don't exist in pain as your default state, read your first paragraph.  You have been rid of the pain but it takes hard work.

I am not diminishing the hurt you feel.  I am certain I have very little understanding of just how big and crushing it must be.  But this type of pain is, by definition, temporary.  If you choose the suffering, however, that is much more permanent if you can never apply acceptance.

I hear your emotions saying the pain is too much right now, it's not time to accept.  That's hard to hear, but it's a bit different perspective.  What are your thoughts?

I know it sounds weird, but a period of 24 hours where there is no phone coaching available after self harm is because you have already done the behavior at that part, past the point of coaching.  Also, Marsha began initially developing DBT after realizing that destructive behavior can be unintentionally reinforced by someone jumping to the person’s aid.  

The instructions for how to receive coaching calls, even in the event your therapist is unreachable are pretty clear.  They’re trying to best to get patients to reach out before target behaviors happen- this is a key principle in distress tolerance.

I'm still working on it, but I don't sabotage my relationships anymore and I SH much, much less often. So I won't lie and say this is easy, you and I both know that'd be untrue as heck. I will say this, though. It is worth it. As far as we know, we only get one shot at life. Give yourself all the time you need to heal, and try not to compare your journey or progress with others'. You will find your way. <3",AspenObscura,kqyf1z

0,"Do you mean dual diagnoses as in a mental and chemical health? Because I have that. When I first started DBT, I became unstable. My therapist explained it to me that DBT requires us to rewire our brains and that rewiring can cause us to become unstable. Our brains aren’t easy to rewire. I stuck with DBT and became 95% stable (I say it like that because seasonal depression is a bitch). I was involved in a house fire on May 19th. Because of the house fire I’m currently 60%-75% stable. Without the DBT skill, I fully believe that right now I would’ve relapsed and be 0% stable. Stick with DBT and once your brain rewires itself, you’ll become stable again.",gooseglug,ns25ml
1,"I am diagnosed with many things including Bipolar 1 (with mixed features) and Borderline Personality disorder, OCD, ADHD, history of trauma and eating disorders. I also struggle with diagnosed learning disabilities and sensory processing issues... ANYWAYS YOU GET MY POINT.

I have been where you are and while none of it is ever 100 percent behind us, this sounds to me like you need a change to your treatment plan.

I currently see my talk therapy therapist 1x a week (unless more is needed) and I am in a DBT skills group 1 x a week. Honestly, i first started DBT in 2017 and I HATED IT and wanted to quit ... because my meds weren't stabilized for the bipolar part AND my traumas were not processed or talked about at all so I was still unable to see the point in DBT and its usefulness.

I am grateful that I have made progress this year but I did treatment programs and for years I was in therapy 2x a week MINIMUM... so yeah it's different for everybody. I also acknowledge my priviledge when it comes to my treatments (I am nearly 27f, my parents have been helping me but I am working towards fuller independence--currently in graduate school for creative writing and working part time. I share this about me because no one person's path is right or wrong. 

Idk, I'm rambling, but I hope this helps. I guess my point is that if you stick with DBT it may eventually work for you, as in my case. AND, I believe talk/trauma/processing therapy should be alongside the DBT and the bipolar meds.",kmac2018,ns25ml
2,"I'm so sorry you're going through this :/. I don't have a dual diagnosis (though I have DBT, ""manic depression,"" and PTSD--- I'm kinda dumb about this so idk if you that counts?) 


I've had the same services you had though in reverse order. I was part of a 6 month DBT program. One of the things I really struggled with was the lack of processing therapy-- which I, at the time, I didn't know that that's why I wasn't doing as well as I wanted to. Once I started regular therapy after the program, the skills I learned along side the processing truly finally started to help (took almost 2 years of 2 weekly therapy sessions though). 


One of the things I complained about on my last of the DBT program was that I felt like I couldn't really share wamhat was happening me. My therapist told me that while the goal of the DBT program is to teach me skills to destabilize, they're also open to hearing what's happening with us. Though I don't think they're specialized in reprocessing and trauma work. 


Have you brought this up with your psychologist? Do you also have access to other people (psychiatrist and therapist). They all probably specialize in DBT but maybe you could ask them? Be prepared, they may say that that's work that's reserved for after the program. I think it would be beneficial to open up and say how group has triggered you and how this has been making unstable.",sunmochi,ns25ml

I also have multiple traumas and I am finally addressing this through prolonged exposure (which can be done in conjunction with DBT, it's the DBT + PE protocol) but I couldn't have done this until I learned the skills and was able to apply them consistently. I have been doing DBT for almost 2 years now, with the group part for the first year and prolonged exposure off and on for the last year. I think it is really helping me and I feel drastically different from when I started. I also have OCD and the skills have helped me manage that even though it's not really meant for that.

Stress of any kind can trigger a mood episode which often requires hospitalization and medication adjustment. So it's a bit different, that part of my brain can't be rewired. 

I will stick with DBT as I know it will teach me to regulate my emotions on a day to day basis but I will always be at risk of a bipolar episode.

I have access to a psychiatrist if I need a med adjustment, so that's an option if it comes down to it.

I told the group leaders yesterday that I was triggered and they were compassionate and said they'd be addressing the individual directly as her behaviour violated group rules, she was super militant and disrespectful, swearing at one of the group leaders, invalidating me.

I threatened to quit so many times, I went through periods of hating group, not trusting my therapist, believing the whole thing was a huge scam, etc. etc. and now I feel so much different. My way of thinking has shifted and I can cope so much better and I don't feel like my emotions control me in the same way. It's just such hard work.

Typically, BPD and neurodivergencies are handled with Dialectic Behavioural Therapy, usually referred to as just DBT. 

I’m recently diagnosed as well and was signed up for a five week DBT intro course through the government healthcare here. 

I would suggest immediately asking and looking into local DBT programs. Having access to a social worker if possible will also help. The biggest issue with social work is often not that there aren’t enough resources, but rather, the resources available are nearly impossible to locate or access without the support of someone familiar with them.",greendippypoo,nemm8c

6,"If I were in your situation, I would start with investigating neurodivergence, specifically the way autism and ADHD present in women and girls, and see if either of those diagnoses explain any of your symptoms. The best way to do that is to see neurodivergent women describe their own experiences on TikTok. 

Those three conditions occur together alongside each other at suspiciously high rates. But autism and ADHD are much better researched than BPD, and there is much less social stigma attached, so it’s easier to get the help you’ll need. 

Support for autism or treatment for ADHD won’t necessarily resolve the symptoms that led to your BPD diagnosis, but it will make it a hell of a lot easier for you to do the hard work to address what’s going on. (If you have either of these associated conditions).

ADHD in particular is affected by estrogen levels. You mention symptoms worsening with pregnancy — maybe something to tell your doc to convince them to evaluate you.

2,"I went through something similar very recently. A break (i.e. still together but taking mental physical and emotional time apart) helped a lot. My boyfriend acted the way you described your boyfriend's actions and it was difficult and discouraging having someone so close invalidate me when I felt like I was being more fair and healthier. 

I think it's due to a lot of resentment built up over the time you guys were together while your perceptions went unchecked. It's hard to see past that and forget about it especially during arguments. I'm not sure about you but my boyfriend tried to be very understanding and work with my unhealthy needs in the beginning of the relationship. This built up a lot of resentment because he felt like everything he's done went unnoticed and the dynamics were very unfair and unhealthy. My relationship and the dynamics we had became so bad that we were more unhappy with each other than happy even though we were both trying our best to stay together because we love each other so much. 

We fought so much that It got to a point where I needed a break from the relationship. I didn't want to break up because I felt like we could still work through things but I also felt like we needed space from each other to kind of rest and have some time alone to think about things. We live together so I ended up going back to my parents place for a couple of weeks. We barely talked to each other during those two weeks and just got in touch with ourselves, reflected on what's happened and how we want to see our relationship in the future. I spoke to my therapist about the kind of boundaries we should have in our relationship and also how to respond when I feel like I'm being invalidated. 

My boyfriend also reflected on what he wants our relationship to look like in the future and what he was comfortable with/uncomfortable with. For the most part he left me alone while we had the break because we were both just so angry with each other. My fears of abandonment grew high so I checked in with him once to let him know I care and love him and afterwards I felt a lot better because I could see he felt the same way and wasn't thinking of breaking up with me. After that first check in, we still kept our distance but texted very briefly to communicate when I would come back, and how much time we both need away from each other.

When I came back two weeks later, we both just missed each other so much that a lot of the resentment went away naturally. We spent time enjoying each other's company before we talked about anything important. The time apart also helped stop many of the unhealthy expectations and patterns we were engaging in beforehand. 

It's only been a month since I came back from our break but I feel like our relationship has improved SOO much since then. We still have some fights but it feels a lot better/healthier now. We also still need to talk about new boundaries and what we were upset about before but for the most part I feel like our break helped us understand each other's points of views a bit more and be more open to changing for the betterment of our relationship.

Like I keep saying, there are different types of dissociation. Educate yourself. ✌️",gooseglug,fars15

19,I’m not a dr but you just talk about rather weird when it’s a supposed to be more of a private matter. I’ve heard people say that’s dissociation when you zone out like everyone does and ADHD which is not dissociation. That’s the over exaggerating part there. Everyone does this and everyone ain’t got DPD or even ADHD for that matter. That’s why it takes someone who’s experienced to diagnose you with this. I’ve had drug induced dissociation before and it’s not like what some of you people describe at all. It’s like losing your mind and forgetting who you are at the same time.,rocco1256,fars15
20,I already have. I’m not a dr. I got accused of having this by a dumbass. I was in Colorado and did not like this dude and would look at the mountains on the way back from work and the dumb fuck told the boss I was dissociating and had DPD. I wasn’t saying you guys don’t know about it I was saying it’s more than just zoning out and looking at scenery like everyone does. I just feel like when people say that it’s just zoning out it gives these dumb fucks a reason to falsely accuse people of having it. He also said I was borderline after putting up with his shit for six months and telling him to finally leave me alone. He lied about that to. Then acted like a victim. The guy was paranoid and this is why dumb people shouldn’t be allowed to use webmd.,rocco1256,fars15

Yes because people don’t know me here. For the record, I do openly talk about my mental health in my personal life. But there are certain aspects I don’t openly talk about.

Let your partner know afterwards that thats what you were doing and how they can help you by giving you space. this works for any skill, keep them informed!! my favorite skill is opposite action bc its clear and you really cant fuck it up. you either do it or you dont and you have a choice once you realize that you;re in a moment where you can use opposite action.

You just do the exact opposite of what you want to do. whether its open up to your partner or not pick up your phone to text while driving or go to the store to get food.

i never thought id be where/how i am today and for me it was all DBT and my partner's support. my anger outbursts are less common and when they do happen i catch them faster, analyze why they happened, and dogmark that in my head. and explain to my partner or whoever i lashed out at why i think it happened so they are aware that im aware of it and working on it and they can be sensitive to similar situations/triggers in the future

2,"Hey yeah I've been there. I'm just now coming out of an episode really. Had to get high to reset. 

I'm also self diagnosed, so with that you need to... Be aware you could be wrong or have another thing also. 

So my advice,  first off talk to your therapist. tell them you want to look at your meds and maybe try something else or a maybe a different dosage. 

Next, pick up meditation. Work on breathing and clearing the mind. It helps with those intrusive thoughts. Helps you let them go easier.


Also pick up yoga.  Staying mentally calm and focused while your body is uncomfortable really helps with all kinds of things. 

Not to get too meta but I just realized something. 
Meditation teaches you, you aren't your thoughts and yoga teaches you, you aren't your body. 

Other than that, good luck

Edited to add, I mentioned getting high. I want to be clear I'm not recommending that. Depending, it can cause all kinds of other issues.",Johnismyfirstname,g9djym

4,"DBT is difficult, but ultimately it's worth it. I hated going to DBT and I felt like it wouldn't help me in the long run, AND I forced myself to go by saying that if I went, I would treat myself to something like my favorite meal or maybe I would buy art supplies. You know, something small like that. In the long run, I met beautiful lovely people who helped me to unlearn the shame surrounding my diagnoses and past behaviors and wonderful therapists who taught me a lot. 

Have you actually attended a DBT group session? Reading the skills alone is not as helpful as being guided through it by counselors and other BPD sufferers in the group, though I understand not everybody has the resources to do so. 

I would definitely try to talk to a therapist. A mental health professional is the best way to learn how to manage these symptoms and to set goals regarding your own recovery. For example, my biggest goal is to go a full year without SH. My therapist holds me accountable and helps me feel proud of the progress I've made when other people in my life can't see it. I think a therapist could also help you process your parents' reaction to your symptoms and also help you come up with safety plans to either avoid the arguments/blow outs or to minimize the damage when they happen.

0,"First off I'm sorry for the situation you are in. As a woman with BPD, I can tell you straight up she is using your friendship to get what she is lacking romantically and emotionally from her male companions which isn't fair to you because it seems like you want to be with her. Personally, I would take sex 100% off the table but make it a point of discussion at the next therapy session so that her response is neutralized by the therapist. She will more than likely get mad at you for this but I would tell her that losing her friendship is more important to you than having a sexual relationship with her and that if ending the sexual nature of your relationship is an ultimate for her she needs to explain to you why. If you do want a relationship with her please for the love of god don't go the route of sleeping with her while she dates other men. I honestly think that this will make her split on you even more because she is going to perceive you as the reason her relationships don't work. I know it's difficult but you need to put the ball back into your court and define how you are allowed to interact just because she is going through a hard time does not give her the right to treat people like a POS. If you want to make this friendship/relationship work while she is actively in a BPD episode which it sounds like she is you're going to need to be patient, very forthcoming, reassuring, and have clearly defined boundaries.",FerkinSmert,16hql3t
1,"I stopped sleeping with her after the comment was made that I forced her. I also strangely don’t want to be with her, I did at one point but that faded after I noticed the lies along the way to this point. I see her as my friend some would say best friend, I’ve spoken to her ex husband and he said he got a similar treatment at different stages in their marriage. She told the therapist she doesn’t want sex from me but, it was a lie. The therapist confronted her about it in a session we had last week and she said “oh I haven’t wanted to sleep with him in a long time, I never found him attractive I had to force my mind to let me do it”. When the therapist asked what was unattractive she took like 5 mins and said “he’s really tall and doesn’t have green eyes”. The therapist just sort of looked at me with a smirk and said “is that a serious reason or are you winging it” and she went on a tangent about how she’s saying how she really feels and everyone is saying she feels different. I left the session early because it broke my heart, to see her like that. I don’t want her romantically at all but she’s an amazing person and it kills me to see her so different. I spoke to her yesterday and she told me that she wants to go to a friends party on Sunday, I asked if she felt up to that, she said yea. But Tuesday in our session she will say I asked her to come, I made her go, I can already see it coming, so I told her I wanted to go alone and that I thought she should spend the day with her kids to which she said ok",Fire-bird67,16hql3t
2,"The forced thing is tough because she could have easily wanted to have sex with you but also didn't want to for a variety of reasons and she is now allowing herself to say it was forced to excuse her own actions. I would literally ask her, ""So, you feel like I took advantage of you?"" because that's essentially what she is alluding to when she says forced. I would want her to say to my face that she genuinely felt forced and to explain her perception of the incident. Also, if she really felt like you forced her to have sex I can assure you she more than likely wouldn't be trying to maintain a friendship. I would also tell her how the way she described the sex as ""forced"" has affected YOU, not everything should be about her.

Also, can I ask...Do you actually care if she's attracted to you? Especially if you don't want to be with her physically or emotionally. I understand that as a friend it would be hard to hear that they aren't attracted to you but if you're not romantically interested in her why care about her opinion? I'm sure 10 million other people find you attractive who could be better looking and nicer than her so why put so much investment into what SHE thinks of you? Personally, I think you should distance yourself a bit until she can view your and her relationship the way that you want her to. This isn't a one-way street where she only gets what she wants and I can tell you the perception that I get from the way you describe things is that she's not super great for your self-confidence. I wouldn't end the relationship but I would for sure take a big step back to make her realize she needs to treat you better as a friend. Again BPD or not the world doesn't solely revolve around her.",FerkinSmert,16hql3t
3,"The attractive thing was more of a “huh?” Type thing because it’s literally one of the things she’s said most often was how attractive she found me. I just was so opposed to what she literally says all the time that I was more confused in that moment. I’ve made it clear to her that nothing romantic is going to come from this. It difficult to explain how quickly all of this has happened I’m just stunned by the speed everything was good with her and it was like over night bam a complete 180. She doesn’t hurt my self confidence it’s just not the best feeling to hear someone seem so cold and completely different. I have stopped texting her as often, and I’ve set up a rule that we cannot see eachother so often and that I’m going to be doing my own thing for a while that I’m happy to support her if needed but I’m not going to be revolving my life around it. I also feel really bad for the guy she’s talking to because he does genuinely seem like a good dude, and he shouldn’t have to go through it. She admits he knows nothing that she’s lied to him about most things. What really got me what when she said I like being with him because my kids are not around and I like life without them. That’s when I got her ex husband involved. Because she’s pawning the kids off to do things. I do have a question though. Does she actually know what she’s doing, because when she does have moments of clarity she says that she just doesn’t see how she’s doing anything wrong it all just seems normal to her? And she does get quite emotional and you see glimpses of her and she says she’s sorry to us and she knows something is wrong but she just can’t see it no matter who points it out she can’t take herself out to see it , it just feels like she’s doing thing how everyone else would.",Fire-bird67,16hql3t
4,"You're going to hate this reply but more than likely no, she doesn't know what she is doing is wrong until after she's reacted but she still needs to be held accountable for her actions. I have been in a relationship for 10 years and to this day there are instances where I perceive my actions or words as ""normal"" when in fact they are the complete opposite. It's also difficult because he also faced a decent amount of abuse and neglect as a child. One example I can give that's always stuck with me was when I was watching a TikTok of a woman who recorded her abuser verbally harassing her and I was genuinely confused at what everyone was so upset about in the recording thinking, ""Ahh he wasn't that bad"" (He was 100% saying awful, vile things). Yeah...I literally didn't realize a video of a man berating his girlfriend about how worthless, ugly, etc was an abusive situation...YIKES...and it wasn't until I went to the comments and realized ""Oh, people actually aren't supposed to talk to each other like this,"" but I honestly didn't know...I know that sounds stupid but it's a sad reality for many with BPD especially those with negative internal dialogues and past trauma. Truthfully, I can really only see things with clarity once I've already acted on it which means I have to be surrounded by strong, compassionate, forgiving people who know that I am seriously trying my best. So to get back to your original question...more than likely no she doesn't know she's being horrible but you need to hold her accountable for her actions and get her to care about more than just her own feelings. Also, I hate to say it but it's probably better for the kids to be with the dad and not see her if she truly thinks her life is better without her children. Sorry if that's harsh as someone trying to conceive I'm sick of hearing about shit mothers. Again sorry, I know this is your friend but to not want to see your own children to see a man or a friend is the most pathetic shit I've ever heard. Godspeed to you and your patience!",FerkinSmert,16hql3t
5,No I thank you for the honesty. What your saying makes so much sense. She told me just two days ago that she doesn’t see things right away that after a few weeks she always sees the problem. She told the therapist and i that she doesn’t understand and wants to but anytime anything happens in her life she never sees her role in it or that something clicks until we’ll after it’s over.,Fire-bird67,16hql3t

I get a certain amount of government funded appointments a year, so why waste them on check in appointments? It would be the same if I was paying. If I'm doing ok at handling things myself why would I spend the $150 to tell her that. If something comes up that is a ""I definitely need help here"" thing, she will always find an appointment for me ASAP.

So I don't think it's unethical at all.",SadieSadieSnakeyLady,k54cus
1,"Many therapists (the *more* ethical ones, typically) see therapy as something that shouldn’t last forever. They don’t want to siphon your money away from you for the rest of your life— ideally, they want to help give you the tools you need to be somewhat self-sufficient before sending you off into the world again.

However... I’ve had a therapist tell me this when my problems had absolutely not been solved with her whatsoever. I’d been working with her for a year at that point. I think she saw my self esteem issues tied to my siblings as “the main problem” and once we had sorted through that I’d be fine on my own. But I proceeded to be transparently not-fine for the following eight years, and had to stumble through a spotty and inconsistent treatment history the whole time. It was frustrating. Some therapists just can’t help you anymore because they’ve given you all they know, I guess.

Back to the point: If your therapist has broken up with you and you strongly disagree/want to find other solutions, you could request a call to discuss alternate options. I personally might recommend something like Betterhelp, where you have continuing access to a therapist for a cheaper price. Alternately you could start investigating therapists who specialize in different modalities that you think you could benefit from— aside from the obvious shorter-term DBT, there’s also schema, mentalization, and transference based therapy. I believe those are all promising options for treating BPD specifically, though you may struggle to find folks who fit your insurance if they fall too far outside of typical CBT.

If you’d like to take a break from therapy for a time and see how it goes, though,  that could be interesting to track and see what happens. Considering non-therapy self-care options is a valid treatment approach too— what would it be like to spend that time and money on regular massages to help you relax, or on volunteer work to build your sense of purpose & community? Is there a self-improvement endeavor you’d like to join, like an ADHD skills coaching group or a kickboxing class? What are you getting out of therapy now that you could potentially find in a non-therapy context? I wonder if that’s partly what your therapist is encouraging you to consider.

But if you know that you have other pressing problems that you need the extra professional support in untangling, you could certainly start investigating some new therapist options. It’s your life and you get to choose how to best take care of yourself moving forward.",twigathon,k54cus

1,"Thank you for your post.

While reading it, I had to stop a few times. For half a year I ve been treated with fluoxetine and sodium valproate for the depression and anxiety that have been tormenting me for the last, I d say, 10 years. For the first couple of months, I felt good, relieved, I thought I m cured  (from mental illnesses) and  I did enjoy life and my head and  my chest pain were silenced.

This couldn t last long. In the last couple of months, the overwhelming me came back to take me. From a small, the smallest, trigger, I was destroyed. I called my friend and she came as soon as possible at my house and found me surrounded by knives and scissors, half naked, with my legs full of cuts and blood. I was in a crisis I guess.

Well, I talked to my psych about this and she told me those are borderline *traits* but she has to observe me longer.

A few beak downs later, last week, my doctor told me that there s 90% chance that I m actually borderline.

That hit me in a mysterious way. On the first hand, this meant that I wasn t suffering from a mental illness, but that I was flawed,  with a bug in the code. On the other hand, I was relieved I finally had an actual answer that I could comply by. 

I am now in a very confused, dark, very very much alone and scared place. I see here and  there that BPD  is not curable cuz its  not something you *have,* but something you *are.* 

Also, my biggest wish ever is to find someone to unconditionally love and to be unconditionally loved, because I know I could give and be given soooo much, even though I am a disorder. I think I am the unluckiest at this game. All my tries end up in desperation, pain, suffering and a lot of tears on my behalf. I CANT TURN OFF MY MIND AND I CANT LIFT THE HEAVY WEIGHT ON MY CHEST. I cant. I just cant. I m only 25 yo (F), I cant accept  THIS TO BE MY REALITY. I cant. I cant do this.

&#x200B;

Im really sorry, dear OP, for writing this here. I have no one to talk to and I am desperate and exhausted. 

I read your post with tears on my eyes. THIS, THIS IS ALL I LONG FOR:

> But I don’t feel THAT feeling anymore. The desperation doesn’t hit me like that any longer. I don’t have that crushing pain in my chest that drives me to do ANYTHING I can to get rid of it, no matter the cost. I still feel a version of it on occasion but it doesn’t command me.

8,"I wish I could give you a big hug. When I was diagnosed I was devastated. It felt like I just got told I had something terminal. There was so much bad information out there, I was told not to tell potential therapists my diagnose since they’d probably not want to see me. It was considered a flaw, like you said. I was broken. I was bad, I was a monster, I’d have to do everything in my power to not hurt the people I loved. 

Well it’s been 15 years since then and it has CHANGED. There’s so many ways to feel better now. There’s incredible resources out there, therapists know better (when I went looking recently I was shocked how many of them had bpd listed in their specialities!) 

You aren’t broken, you aren’t bad, you aren’t flawed, you are different. Different is not bad, but it does mean you’ll have to do more work in adapting to living in a world that doesn’t cherish people like us. 

Please please please find a specialist who does DBT and also deals with trauma. Even if you think you don’t have trauma, living with untreated BPD is trauma in itself! I did DBT years ago and it saved my life. But it was treating the symptoms (very well!) not the cause. We need proper trauma processing to really get to place of happiness. I only wished I’d done it sooner.

But DBT is a good place to start. Think of it like treating a wound, right now you are bleeding out. You need to stop the bleeding before you can start healing it. 

DBT will help with that awful awful pain. And I know you’re exhausted, I know exactly how that feels, you deserve rest and a break from that horrific pain.

If you can’t get that kind of help right away, you can grab a book or two, or even read some stuff on the web. The first thing that really started me stopping the bleeding was Radical Acceptance. (Someone recently said it should be called Radical Acknowledgment instead, and I like that a lot more!) 

Essentially I used to rage against the injustice of having BPD. It was not fair, how could I be damaged forever because of something that happened before I could even form memory? But all I was doing was hurting myself. If BPD was a brick wall keeping me from love and happiness, I was just punching it over and over. Trying to break through but only hurting my hands in the end.

Once I acknowledged that I did have BPD, it let me stop trying to beat it down. Now maybe I could take some time to figure a way around or over the wall. Maybe I’d have to turn back and take another oath. Maybe it would take more work to the love and happiness than other folks, but it was still there waiting for me.

And it’s not all negatives. There are positives about this so called “disorder.” We are so loving and kind, we can make the people around us feel wonderful. We are empathetic and generous - we are so able to put our selves in others shoes that we end up being the person many people can feel safe with. We feel emotions so deeply, a beautiful song moves us to tears, the love we have for our friends and family envelope us, a good day feels like sunshine. Because we are so empathetic we are able to be very creative, and express emotions and experiences in ways others wouldn’t think of. 

I know you’re at the darkest part of this right now. I’m not going to tell you it doesn’t suck, that the pain isn’t agony, that you should just buck up and get over it. It’s hard, I hate that you have to experience it.

But, it won’t last forever. There are good days ahead, there’s love ahead, there’s healing ahead. It means being in the muck right now, yes, doing hard work, yes (even when you’d rather not!) But there IS a path away from it.

For now try to just love yourself in the way you wish someone else would. Sounds hard, huh? You can just practice it for now, you don’t even actually have to live yourself. But try telling yourself things you think a loving person would say (even if they don’t ring true) like “I’m valuable” “I deserve to feel good” “I deserve love and kindness.” Comfort yourself, you just got shocking news, how would you comfort a friend who got shocking news? 

It’s okay to hurt right now. Hurting isn’t an emergency, even though it feels like one, grief is just another state of being, not good not bad. 

And please stay away from the subreddits about BPD that exclude people with BPD from participating. They will give you a very wrong impression, you don’t need their own hangs up and mental illnesses coloring your view of yourself.

Thank you so much for such kind words. I am pretty proud of my journey too! But more than anything I’m shocked, lol, I find it hard to believe I’m at this point, because no one even told me it was possible when I was a sobbing aching desperate 20 year old. They’d had me convinced it would be management for the rest of life, not relief. But I’m tell YOU it’s possible, not even just possible, it’s LIKELY you’ll feel better and live a relatively happy life. Relief is ahead.

I can t believe that somebody who s gender, age, location or history could show me so much empathy and could give me such a meaningful reply. I m truly touched and moved.  Oh my...

Your posts did give me hope and I want to hold on to this.  

When you said  about the range against the injustice of having BPd and that you felt like having a incurable illness, I laughed, as a little before I was literally shouting in the house ""why, why Is this happening to me, why do I have to be like this ALL MY LIFE, is it al my life going to be just agony and fear followed by a little quite and more unbearable pain? Why of all people me?""


I d still like an answer for that.  The internet only tells me how incurable this is and how much ""normal"" people gather around to run far away far away from us because we  create so much misery in everybody s life. And that makes me so sad because all I want to give to the people is my love and empathy. 

All i need ar two arms around me in a tight hug, promising me they won't give up on me. 

I feel like someday I am gonna wake up and ... be normal.  Enjoy life.  Be able to ignore things. Be able to not care.

I think I ll look into DBT but I m still very much confused and  in denial. I am not impulsive or aggressive, all my anger and pain  is inwards. 

I have soooo much love to give if only somebody could accept my flaws and promise me they won t give up.   

I am lost and so alone. I am in pain.  


I can t describe how much it means to me the time and energy you put into writing this beautiful, inspirational note to me.

I'd recommend short cut to answer vs going nuts trying to ID on own. Regardless of where you live, reach out to Mcleans experts. Viewed as the leading hospital intimately familiar w BPD.

Ask if someone would just chat and even give thoughts re properly skilled experts in your home area.

A lessor option but can go to Dr Fox youtube and find info/DM re direct outreach to his TX practice.  Same premise as for McLean.

3,"It's because borderline are actually a vulnerable demographic, where only about 13 to 15% even have malignant or abusive tendencies. The rest of the borderline population are actually very very vulnerable, naive...child-like. Gullible. People who are easily swayed. So it's easy for a doctor to come up with some ""breakthrough technique"" such as ""DBT"",  that costs an arm and leg, and try to pitch it to people with this diagnosis. 

People with APD and NPD, even though they are flawed personality, wise tend to be a little bit more sharper, and a little bit more clever, because they have more cognitive empathy. They're not gonna fall for that. So the mental health industry sort of leaves them alone. They let them seek to help when they want to. They don't push it on them or try to market towards them because they're too smart to fall for those tactics.",Actual_Pepper8815,1ad08qo

5,"Borderlines don't get babied, promise. We often get denied even basic healthcare the moment someone sees it on our chart because we're so aTtEnTiOn SeEkInG. We resist treatment because it's so hard to accept a diagnosis that gets instantly written off as abusive and difficult. But yes, it's so much worse for other cluster Bs and that's fucked up. Someone who has been diagnosed with NPD and/or ASPD who is sincerely seeking treatment and is begging to get better already has a huge indicator for success because if you can get to the point of accepting it, you've already done something that is statistically against you and that's life-changing. 

The good news is that more and more research and people-first education for providers is shifting how the profession receives and treats cluster Bs. The overlap between NPD and BPD indicates that they're both highly misunderstood trauma disorders and probably two ends of the exact same spectrum. Don't give up the hunt for a therapist until you find someone informed enough to have the ""well *actually* we call it cptsd now"" conversation and focus on healing your trauma and addressing the symptoms of it that present as a ""personality disorder"" (whatever that even means anymore). It's so hard to find a provider and even harder to find a healthcare team that puts the human before the alphabet soup, but they're out there.

1,"Hello there.  This thread I made for myself and my close friend may be helpful.  I don't have bpd, but if you have questions feel free to reply and I'll ask him to help answer.

You also noted a few specific problems with the program.  I talk a lot about BPD and see a lot of places where my friend gets stuck.   Alternative strategies is one of them.  For example, you have a default way if dealing with your doctor, your mom, the worksheets.  Your doctor gaslights, your mom isn't kind, the worksheets are only ""inspired"" by DBT.  I'd like to share a few alternative ways of looking at those things.  I hope that's ok.  

They all follow the same pattern - thing big first, then small.  What's the overall system or goal, or item about?  Then ask what does that say about how it can be used.

- worksheets - they may still be designed to help.  They may or may not be able to.  Most therapeutic tools require real engagement though.  Check if you're really engaging before you determine if they work for you.  I've seen emotions make effective tools and strategies ineffective before.  Totally understandable, but it's amazing how the ""ineffective"" a week or two ago becomes effective when approached in a different way.

- doctor - you're in a program designed to help you in some way.  But you have a doctor that isn't.  You can check your emotions about the doctor like the worksheets, but sometimes it's not the feeling, it's the person.  Are there other people?  The doctor gives you drugs, but are there other people you can talk with who can provide different care or just a listening ear?  Even if there isn't a therapist, you could try a different doctor or establish a relationship with someone else either involved in the program or staffing it.

- mom - family is tough and requires super advanced skills past taking a different perspective or asking and looking for more or broader resources.  Maybe for her right now the best thing to do is watch your emotions so she doesn't get to derail you too much.

Here's the link to the other resources.  There is hope, but it takes hard and emotional work to help your brain learn different perspectives and ways of thinking.  You will fail.  Over and over again.  But the wonderful part in life is that those failures don't have to matter as long as you commit yourself to doing one very clear thing: when they happen, you have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and continue your journey.  If you just get only that part right - commit AND act on just that thing - you can do it! It was a great step to post here, and great that you can recognize and clearly state the problems you are having.   You can do this!  Let me know if you have questions for my friend, and I can also check if they would be willing to chat with you.

I am also what I understand might be called a quiet borderline.  I internalize about 80% of the time- which is how I got to the most dangerous and destructive behavior regarding myself. I can now see the effect my BPD has had on my relationship- but I can also see where my relationship/partner has definitely influenced my experience of BPD.  Which I had never seen before.  He’s a wonderful person, he’s still here after all the tumultuous times.  However, neither of us knew how to deal with ourselves or each other, throw the BPD on top and it was a path towards disaster.  It’s been REALLY hard on the relationship front as initially he was either unable or unwilling to support me in dealing with this new diagnosis.  That caused a lot of pain which seemed hopeless while trying to get better.  Things are much better now as he has been able to take a more active role in what I am doing and what we do together.  ANYWAYS…

I was looking into attachment theory after seeing a TikTok over a year ago, I did an assessment which told me how difficult my attachment style was for relationships, my relationships would be toxic and fail and people with this attachment type often have personality disorder of some type- usually BPD.  I’m a nurse, but all I was taught about BPD are the things you find all over the internet, extremely bleak.  I quickly gave up looking into that and tried to never think of it again.  As I spiraled downwards over the following months, I was surprised, but also not, when my PsychNP brought up BPD.  I was very receptive because I have been treated for mental health problems for at least 20 years.  I was exhausted.  I didn’t totally know how to grasp BPD because again, stuff online was pretty extreme and the DSM-V is very clinical.  I could see myself in all of the criteria, but maybe not exactly as it’s written. So I tried googling “What does Borderline Personality Disorder look like day to day?”  That helped. I’m not always in crisis, but my traits of BPD (especially at the time) are always there, and some of them have been, for as long as I can remember.

I found a podcast episode on a podcast called Psychology Unplugged, it’s short, and he talks in plain English about psychology, find the first episode he ever did entirely on BPD, it was the first thing I ever read/heard that was neutral and even positive in regard to BPD.  I’m fact, he said he found people with BPD fascinating because all the pieces to a healthy personality are there, they just need to be put together/reworked.  Up yo that point that was the nicest thing I have ever heard ANYONE say about BPD.  

Then, I think through a subreddit, I found Dr. Daniel Fox’s you tube channel.  His videos are again, short and easily understandable, for someone who is new to their diagnosis, or for family/friend that are trying to understand. He covers every topic under the sun.  He addresses other personality disorders and how they’re different or people can have traits from multiple disorders.  He covers what he calls “complex BPD” which is BPD with any number of other conditions,
OCD, Bipolar, Depression, Anxieties, C-PTSD, etc.  He’s published a couple of workbooks as well.  I’d go for his “What is BPD?” playlist and start here for understanding and validation:

2,"I felt the same - I can't set any expectations for you and your life, but the more I've practiced DBT in the few years since I did it, the more has become possible.

It's maybe unfortunate that we focus on personal relationships rather than internal contentment when setting recovery goals - it sounds trite, but it really is true that we have to love ourselves before we can really love others, but if you can DBT yourself, and really, *really* understand and have compassion for every part of yourself, you'll have so much to offer others that rejection frustrations can be less of a thing. Edit: you're right, we can be some of the most compassionate, thoughtful people in society, and this is my experience also - but that means we have to take proper care of ourselves.

PROMISE you this is possible - the more you can understand yourself, the less it will even matter whether anyone else does or doesn't. It takes time and the courage to make mistakes to learn from, but you have the self-care skills to fall back on now.

One thing I would add is to be slightly wary of groupthink in recovery communities - despite our best efforts, those whom lack compassion for ourselves can end up reinforcing problematic things in one another; there is plenty of evidence of this in the discourse on Reddit if you look at memes etc and think 'is this person being nice to themselves, or objectifying themselves with some 100yr old psychoanalytic nonsense?' (for example). Your gang (sounds cool btw) might be different but I've been involved in recovery communities for years, and there can be a bit of an unconscious tendency herein.

We can help each other, but people will be at different stages of recovery and in the end, you have to do you.

I can also (strongly) recommend looking at things from a CPTSD angle - it's basically the same thing and I'm yet to hear a good explanation of why it isn't, and it helped me see myself more humanistically rather than stigmatizing myself over and over.

Thank you for responding. I think when I mention relationships, I mean friendships too because it affects interpersonal relationships. 

It’s interesting you mention C-PTSD because I’ve wondered whether that’s what I have myself, rather than BPD. Full disclosure, I have never been officially diagnosed as BPD, in fact my former therapist said she didn’t think I had it, however I had to do an assessment before entering the DBT group and obviously presented enough symptoms to be admitted. I guess the diagnosis itself doesn’t matter so much because, as you said, the symptoms are so very similar (and I’d say all people with BPD have PTSD). 

I wonder if you have any skills suggestions for things like self - isolation and the social anxiety aspect that comes with BPD / CPTSD ? (Like paranoia, intrusive thoughts, finding it hard to “lighten up” as people say and build meaningful relationships?… especially as an adult)

10,"Hey, 

I’ve been researching and I actually think I have CPTSD - it’s very similar to BPD but also has feelings of defectiveness: “feeling as if you are permanently damaged or worthless”. I think that may be why I identified as BPD - I recognise the emotional instability in myself but I’ve never self harmed, never had substance or alcohol abuse issues, I’m not impulsive and I’ve never cheated. I was also very aware of being open and honest in my most recent relationship and we never yelled at each other. It would be more just be crying a lot for “no reason”, being actual childhood trauma - it would manifest as feeling worthless, defective and wanting to isolate as a result. No hallucinations or delusions (other than imposter syndrome, which is a delusion in itself).

Thank you for sharing your experience. I guess getting bogged down in the specific diagnosis isn’t so important as, like you said, they do overlap. DBT was extremely helpful and I’m going to look for free psychotherapy and practice the DBT skills I learned in the meantime.

I feel a lot more optimistic after speaking to people and hearing their own experiences. Thank you.",Ill_Entertainment895,ubcyu7

12,"Sorry for the late reply, thought about stuff though. 

That's about the same time I started recovery - it ain't too late, never is. I know it affects interpersonal relationships but that's what I mean - we're uniquely socially-oriented as a phenotype. That's why you care about what others think of you more than others might, because we're more tuned in to how we all affect each other (I think).

There is A LOT of empathy underneath the surface problems, IMO as a side effect of the same factors that caused the BPD (which is probably actually just a subtype of CPTSD) in the first place - I don't see DBT isn't 'remedial' per se, more like a toolkit for self-actualization.

Social anxiety... First thing that comes to mind is 'if something scares you, do it more'. 

Gots to give yourself the opportunity to practice those interpersonal effectiveness skills - I can definitely recommend volunteering, because you'll be around compassion-oriented people who are less likely to judge you for any ways in which you're different from others, and it'll be easier to forgive yourself for any mistakes you might make because they'll have fewer consequences.

That's the thing - having courage to make mistakes and learn from them without falling into what schema therapy would call 'punitive parent' mode (extreme and objectively unreasonable self-criticism - maybe the source of the paranoia and intrusive thoughts).

For me, this is an ongoing war and I think it probably always will be, but I keep winning those battles and becoming more efficient and shutting that shit down - never really gets on top of me for more than an hour or so these days.

Maybe also pick a new skill you want to learn, like art or music or something, and just do it for yourself and watch your feelings come and go about how you're doing with it, and show yourself over time the benefits of balancing self-compassion with self-criticism as you get better at your thing over time. Maybe nothing too technical, though (I have a theory that computers/math etc aren't necessarily our strong point, but creativity and manual dexterity maybe are).

Not going to lie to you it takes courage, resilience, and faith in yourself that it will be difficult to summon sometimes, but that's how to develop *self*-confidence; confiding in yourself, knowing yourself, observing yourself, and building that up over time. 

It's 100% worth it though...

...OK, also, at the risk of invalidating a whole community, I honestly don't believe BPD is actually a valid diagnostic category any longer. There is 'a thing' with us, as shown by the neuroscience, but psychiatry doesn't explain it very well at all. I was grateful for it as an explanation at one point, but the more I've learned the more I've seen how limited and subjective it is. I'm saying this because a lot of people are where I was at, and believe the things I used to believe about myself before I knew myself better, and it's a tragedy that some things are getting reinforced socially online because it is like trying to do recovery by self-invalidating.

Oh - and pace yourself with the emotion known as 'love'; it's not one that comes around as frequently as 'anxiety' for example, so we don't get the opportunity to get to know it and regulate it, and it can get addictive. It's addictive because of the effects of the hormones involved upon our amygdalae and HPA axis - my thinking for myself is that it will always be a risk, but the more I've got to know it, it's not a vulnerability like it was at all.

...OK one more thing: DBT is the essentials, but for me once I knew I could learn things like this and saw the benefits for myself, self-re-parenting and self-improvement got addictive. 

*Show yourself* that you can *teach yourself* and *learn from yourself* - put the effort in now, and breathe easier for the rest of your life (seriously) 🤘

Edit: also look up the PAC model from Transactional Analysis, and also the 'looking glass theory of the self' and keep those in mind - good luck!",,ubcyu7

14,"Yes. I actually had a surprisingly very frank conversation with my mother today where I laid everything out and told her I think she has BPD and should get treatment and outlined all the emotional abuse I had experienced from her. She actually really listened and said “It has never really hit home until now. I get it and I’m sorry.” We’ve never been able to have this kind of discussion at all without an outburst from her. I don’t know what came over her or caused her to see this particular thing differently, but it felt nothing short of miraculous. We agreed to be no contact for a while and build a relationship in the near future hopefully. I think she got BPD like symptoms from her mother and, over time, because it was untreated, it became full blown and became what would appear to be a part of her “personality”, but was actually just maladaptive coping strategies, like you said. It’s not actually her. That’s the positive thing about BPD - one of the things they teach in DBT is to learn to separate your “self” from these automatic impulses because they don’t come from you - it’s trauma roleplay. It’s also a very treatable condition - I read something like 70% of treated BPD suffers do not exhibit symptoms anymore after 6 years, and 90% of these never develop these severe symptoms again. They’ve learned to manage their emotions and, more importantly, love themselves and allow themselves to be loved. I developed symptoms because of her but, I’m younger and more self aware in these kinds of things so I recognised how I was repeating the same behaviour I’d experienced and I sought therapy. Each relationship has improved each time. Even this alone is encouraging and I feel so relieved and happy I could finally say all of this to her - it gives me hope we can both heal, be happy and live fulfilling lives, separate but together. 

I haven’t read linehan’s book yet but I will, thanks for reminding me.

A good one to start with is The Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living with BPD by Alex L. Chapman. This will give you an first impression of the condition and help you understand more.
""The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook"" is full of really practical advice I highly recommend it.
Another advice is not to put yourself in the bpd box but rather see it as a chance to finally understand where you're suffering comes from and finally learning how to handle your emotions better.

1,What I try to remember is it’s a dynamic and often times there isn’t one “bad one”. The tendency to think that way is a form of splitting or all or nothing thinking. You both made mistakes and both contributed good things.,causaliti,10fz6nb
2,"The way i see it you are not crazy to have jealousy or something. You just need to learn to address it in a healthy way. It's hard. Im bpd diagnosed and had several relationships that ended bad because of my manipulative  behavior and clingingness. 
Maybe you really  overshared his personal problems but hasn't he done the same towards you? Probably you shouldn't be thinking you're a bad person cuz of this. You need to heal now and thinking like this will only lead you towards bad places in your head.
You seem pretty aware of things you did ""wrong"", not really wrong but behavior that led things to end bad, so you need to reevaluate this, how this can lead you nowhere good.
Please remember, is not wrong or bad to have this feelings, this things he did that made you uncomfortable are your limits and you need to set them in a manner that works for both. If he disrespects even tho you had already talked about, he is disrespecting your boundaries. He can't use his disorder to be dishonest, neither do you. 
Anyways, I'm just saying what I  think because I've been there... my current relationship situation looks alot like yours, but he didn't break up, although it almost happened.
Just be kind to yourself, you deserve better :)",mochitakki,10fz6nb

5,"you’re right, during the breakup we haven’t talked about his problems once. And since the BPD usually causes us to have no friends, his side is a lot bigger and agree that I was the crazy one. thank you",caitlini,10fz6nb
6,"thank you, and you’re right. i dont want one person to be the bad guy anymore and i really did want to reflect on where I went wrong..and honestly it was where I stayed when I felt like my boundaries were crossed over and over. i take full accountability for my horrible actions, but I can’t make myself hold the full responsibility and guilt on my back. he did talk bad about me while I was enamored by him, while he was love bombing me and maybe I subconsciously wanted to “get him back”, and I found out he called me crazy (and I’m sure has shared more personal information, but I never found out like he has). It’s confusing because i would even double check with people (and this is how I told them the personal information, not bad talking him) to see if I was being crazy for being jealous or upset at the time because he would say I was being ridiculous and every person would say that I needed to leave..but that was before I became the major problem. i know our reality is skewed, but I think he did not truly “love” me..but the idea of me, and he said that exact thing to me. we both loved who we were in the beginning and who we thought eachother were to be, but in reality maybe that’s our absolute best selves but it’s not someone we can maintain and a lot of people cannot maintain the honeymoon stage self.",caitlini,10fz6nb
7,"No one can reinforce or deny your reality. From what you wrote, yeah he has ""issues"" but I think he did his best to accommodate you and that wasn't enough for you.

8,"Hmmm, could be as a result of CPTSD. I’ve been told I have this and sometimes when something feels like a rejection or abandonment it can trigger a response in your behaviour that can either push people away or compel you to treat them a certain way. 

Borderline Personality disorder and CPTSD have a lot of same symptoms around abandonment/rejection.

It could be something he did triggered the victim (inner child) in you that means you subconsciously play the victim. Common in borderlines and CPTSD due to childhood abuse / traumas. 

So I’m essence, it’s hard to say if it’s reality or not. You could be right and your picking up on signals cos of previous hurt/pain. Doesn’t mean your crazy. Or it could just mean your projecting.",Eyrks90,10fz6nb

11,"you’re right thank you, some things are showing that maybe I wasn’t 100% the crazy one after the fact. i did cling onto him for maybe 2 weeks after until i found out that he downloaded tinder 4 days after driving to my house and telling me he wanted me to move in with him and that my heart always belongs to him. i went to his house (invited) 3 days ago and his energy shifted, he told me that he decided to move on because a girl told him that I dated her cousin (10 yrs ago) and I ended up finding out my ex coworker talked to my exs friend for 2 minutes (confirmed by 3 people)..so my ex made these excuses up to be a hoe again. i do have childhood trauma and did cling..but I don’t think I should feel as bad as he made me feel",caitlini,10fz6nb

Its hard to let go, especially when youre bpd and someone shows you love in some way. If people around you tried to warn you before... well you get the idea. 
The thing about boundaries is that we can't respect them ourselves, this is what fvcks everything up.
Right now you seem racional about things, try to keep that. Remember that you are not crazy, is not ""your fault"" that he left. Things just didn't work out for you guys. It's not the end of the world, you're not alone and probably will find someone out there that is happy to respect you.

2,"I had a point where it seemed like I ""wasn't changing/changing enough"" for about three years or so. It was in the thick of my therapy journey and I just hadn't really dealt with my own trauma yet nor had I been able to do DBT (no one trained at my university clinic), so a lot of my problem behaviors were still present even though I had made a _ton_ of progress up to that point. However, my partner really made it a point to stick it out with me, which made my working even harder on my problems worth it in my eyes. 

I'll be honest, I had to do double the improvement for anyone to even notice and double more for it to be acknowledged. Unfortunately, most people that either deal with very different mental illness issues or no mental illness at all just won't see the same progress that you see. Add that to being hurt by actions in the throes of being triggered or just having a bad episode (god knows I've sure been a real asshole in those moments) you get someone that is justifiably weary of saying ""yeah you changed."" 

If your SO is really in it for the long haul and you keep putting in the time and effort, it _does_ get better. There will be days when it's still rough. There will still be days that your SO will still say something shitty and you'll wonder if this was all for nothing. There will still be days where you use all your skills and you _still_ have a meltdown! **BUT** you will eventually rise above the problems you started with.

0,"Wow, your ex-therapist sounds like a control freak I’m glad you dumped her. Yes as a diagnosed BPD sufferer it’s endlessly painful to know the right time to make a decision because you don’t want it just be splitting! hope you get back into it when your ready🐢

personally I did one session a week for a year(after initial diagnosis) and one session a week gave me plenty of food for thought and reflection For the next week till I went back. if there’s anything about BPD it’s pacing your life out to remove as much stress as possible. I got diagnosed late (m44) now 46 so Im burnt out, and I’m now on the pension(but stable phew!).

so i can’t stress enough to really take as much time needed to remove unnecessary stresses in your daily routine. I have a saying; there’s nothing in my out tray. If I have a problem with a friend or anybody I have to sort it immediately, stewing on things will just make the anxiety and quality of life go down hill quick.here’s a little article with a picture that explains the different parts of the brain that are effected. I keep going and studying on from there and little pieces of the puzzle begin to fit into place more.

It seems to be a constant remembering of certain things, like the damaged amygdala is creating too much cortisol to the blood stream that makes us anxious and easily moody. So by reminding my self of that I can separate the ‘content’ :as in some one who did me wrong and how I’m annoyed and the pysical: ‘I’ve got massive amounts of adrenaline and cortisol running through my body that’s making the pissed offness highly exaggerated’…..and repetitive. any way I’m also on a learning curve hope this helps a little.

On the other hand, my other friend is more self-aware. I've seen how he acts in relationships, and how he acts with me. I'm not saying everything is perfect, but under no circumstances are things so horrible or out of control that it would be out of the ordinary.

I genuinely believe that most people in bpdlovedones took advantage of and likely emotionally abused their pwbpd. now they are demonizing them for their reactions. think of people who say all their exes are crazy

the goal of that subreddit is to DEHUMANIZE us. They do not view us as human. One tactic they use to do this is distorting our lack of sense of self/ stable self image.

5,"I think you are justified to be hurt by the rejection from that subreddit, for all the reasons you listed. And I think that subreddit is also justified to reject you. It very well may perpetuate stigma, however the purpose of that subreddit is not to repair what is broken in society, or to change the thoughts of those who are unfairly judgmental. Imo, the stigma is most perpetuated by the DSM’s failure to serve humans rather than insurance companies. 

There are stages to the recovery on both sides of this relational coin, and I have found that the separation of codependents is important for that recovery to begin for both. If someone needs a space where they are comforted by the thought that “the person who hurt me can’t be here” it provides the opportunity for free expression of pain without the fear of judgment and the addition of support. This is something we all need, and codependents early in recovery struggle to assert for themselves if challenged emotionally. But no one’s recovery looks the same. If it is not the place for someone to recover, they can find another place or use it as it’s helpful. I’m sure you’re aware that not every place is good for every person, and I see that place as a first step for many who are ill or as maladaptive as anyone else with a PD. We don’t see the people who leave or never join. With the B&W thinking apparent in that subreddit, my hope is that it’s a stone people take a step on through their grieving. It’s a process that has ugly parts many have to walk though. All emotions are valid, and morality ought to be irrelevant to them.",,15rku5z
6,"I am recovered Cptsd and undiagnosed quiet BPD I suspect my ex partner is quiet BPD too. He got super mad and gave me the silent treatment for days because he wanted to meet up one evening and I couldn’t I explained that would be great but sorry I can’t as I had such a long shitty day at work and I just can’t meetup. Another time he got angry when I hadn’t replied to him message I was sleeping then next morning he bursted down at my place looking frantic demanded why I didn’t answer the night before, he clearly saw me sleeping in bed and my phone off he got angry and left. Later I texted him sorry I didn’t reply I was asleep and thank you for coming to check on me. Eventhough we made up after that incident he became distant, disconnected whenever we’d spend time together he’d be either on his phone scrolling or watching Netflix. He’d also frequently withhold intimacy and last time when I started making out with him he turned away saying his back hurts is super tired he said sorry he can’t. I just had to suck it up and not make a big deal but I felt something was off as our relationship was built on love and alot of displays of affection and strong intimacy.
from there it spiralled quick down hill. Every attempt to address issues and talk about my feelings were met with defensiveness, blame and silent treatment. 
He had broken up with me many times but quickly would come back apologise for his behaviour and say it stems from fear and self sabotage he would tell me how much he loves me and want to grow old with me, when he was in the love/ idealising faze he asked me to please never let go even if he threatened to break up and that I would just need to remind him of the pact we made to be together no matter what. 
Now I think he is in the splitting faze and I can’t get through to him.
I suspect (he has quiet BPD with core wound fear of abandonment) so after the last episode we had agreed that do couples therapy but the very next day when I wrapped my arms around him and kissed him tenderly he looked at me with ice cold eyes sat me and to my shock broke up with me. I tried to bring him back from this dark place he was in to remind him of our beautiful love story of our pact of doing therapy. But he wouldn’t snap out of it. I had an emotional break down and he hugged me so tight for hours I cried in his arms. I was shocked, confused and in so much pain for a whole week I couldn’t function and he’d text me everyday to ask about me and how I was doing. I love him and care alot about him but I just don’t know what to do. This is my first romantic relationship after long years of violent abusive marriage so I am learning how healthy relationships feel like look like. When he is in the loving self he treats me like a princess he is super considerate and affectionate with me. But when anything small happens he gets cold, distant and disconnects from me. He did mention he disassociates sometimes, self sabotage out of fear being not good enough and abandoned.

1,"I can completely relate almost exactly. It's really reassuring to know that other people are having this same struggle while trying to recover. My boyfriend and I had this same conversation about a month or so ago, and it was really eye opening to see that we started off really toxic. We discussed what needed to change in our relationship and how to fix the miscommunication. So far it has been going really well, and I don't feel my intensified symptoms as often. I think you and your partner need to have set times to give each other space daily. It will give you some alone time to work on yourself, same with your s/o, and also continue to enjoy the relationship. If you were to give up the relationship, it may affect your recovery because it's really not what you want. Becoming a more healthy relationship doesn't happen overnight, so breaking up would only add on to your guy's distress. If you both want your relationship to work, that is good enough to keep going, but also growing as individuals.

2,thank you !! i think that that’s definitely something i have been considering although i do still want to proceed in a relationship i def want to be cautious of how it feels in the next few weeks or near future. i think even since i made the post we hav both been a lot less relationship like and more so being in touch with a close friendship like dynamic with occasional kisses and romantic sentiment to build our connection back up slowly and not make it too hard on ourselves. i think shifting my perspective of sometimes just pretending we are just close friends makes things better in terms of acting more personable in times of heightened emotions bc it doesn’t have the “relationship context” which sometimes triggers my bpd but i think it’s gotten better. idk if that makes sense but thank u thank u thank u !! i appreciate ur feedback and reply !!!,lotus-pea,ocawyx
3,thank you so much !! we decided to do just that !! even from when i posted this we decided and have kept some essential boundaries that include having alone time and also just space even if we’re together irl in each other’s presence we don’t always have to be on top of each other and made to feel like we have to entertain the attention span of the other all the time ! it’s been working p well and even though things don’t happen over night i think with this being the first week we’re doing pretty steady !! thank you SO much for replying!! this is so refreshing hearing someone go through the same thing and hearing it working well !! i think u were right neither of us want to break up rn so i think it’s rly just a matter of making sure we stick to our boundaries and continue giving each other space to enjoy things and work on ourselves separately before joining together again!,lotus-pea,ocawyx
0,As a partner to someone with bpd - you are very self aware to realise what you wrote and are accurately describing how disease manifests itself…if you share with him things you realised and how you as a couple can cope with it - how you’re going to behave when you feel youre gonna start splitting etc…im sure he’ll give you a chance. I would forgive a lot of the bad things if only the behaviour changed or begin changing…this is the only real proof that you are able to be a good partner to him in the long run (and not just because he’s had enough and leaves). Good luck!,Icyemustyle,18y00al
0,"I wouldnt phrase it as an 'offer' or anything like that. You can just tell him how you feel. Tell him that you realize your part in things, that you want to get better for yourself, that you still love him but understand that he needs to feel healthy, and that you hope one day it could work out. 

Right now his walls are probably super high. Anything resembling you trying to bargain or poke at his walls is going to be taken almost as an attack. Give him lots of room and space. 

&#x200B;

For yourself, you said a lot of really good things up there. It's hard work. It has to be consistent work too. Use your good days to really focus on coping skills and healthy mindsets. Try to really focus on getting to a place where you can be a good partner so you can have a good partner.

I wish you lots of luck. I know its difficult but it's possible. :)",coyotebored83,j146yn
1,"This is my first time responding a thread but this one caught my eye. As someone who suffered from both bpd and bipolar I’m gonna let you know a mood stabilizer will only work so far. It seems your dilema revolves around you not being able to give him space. It’s suffocating to him when he seems to need space in this moment. I know you mean well because you love him but your reaction to him telling you he cheated on you. I’m not trying to speak for him or your relationship. But he told you I guess to bring up trust. I’m not sure. It seems you lack trust in him a lot. You NEED to know he’s okay and because of that you don’t seem to understand the boundary of him needing space. That constant fear of abandonment is something I do understand. It’s bone chilling sometimes. The more you care and love a person the more intense the reaction. In my personal experience it has severed many relationships of all kinds. Friends and partners and family too. At this point he seems to need space and doesn’t believe you will give him that. So he blocked you and did all those things. Breathe. Accept you’ve done wrong and that he’s not perfect either. To pursue him to apologize will only prove his theory you can’t give him space. He’s overwhelmed because of your actions not with you as a person. If he cares and loves you, the space you give him will allow him to chill out and come back. But I don’t want you to also expect him to come back. Focus on what you may need in this moment knowing he’s not next to you. If he’s texting your mom, he’s okay and it’s not your job to make him okay or look for him to see if he is. Make sure you’re okay too. And I see you’re doing that. I wish you luck this is my my opinion for you. Take what you need",Bubblycat629,j146yn
2,"Yea.. your right. He’s wall is super high which is understandable, that’s what he needs to be feel protected. I just have this negative thoughts that what if I give him too much space and time, he’ll start seeing others? which I should not care about. 

I will try just tell how I feel and thoughts when he reach me. Asking him to be in a relationship again can be taken as manipulating/convincing traits and I do want to avoid that.

For myself, thank you so much for saying that, it encourages me to keep it going. It’s hurting me financially to go check in and starting counseling since I had to quit my job in there because of moving out, but I can find job soon for sure so it’s not that big of a deal. 

I’ll use these times and days for myself also, I want to be a better person. Thank you so much! <3",Milmily,j146yn
3,"Thank you for your time for stopping by/advice.
I'm currently taking one of the mood stabilizer atm. I don't know if it's working or not to be honest.. should I talk abut this to my doctor?

For the he needs space, you're right. I realize I tend to think this is the right way for everything when it's not. This was one of those moment. He said he will never stop loving me so I'll work on trust, and focus on myself. Any tip that help with the anxiety? I have this obsessions in being anxious 24/7 on everything..",Milmily,j146yn
4,">I just have this negative thoughts that what if I give him too much space and time, he’ll start seeing others? which I should not care about.

I know it FEELS that way. This is where you have to do some fact checking. If you are in a healthy loving two way relationship, you can trust that the other person will be there for you regardless of if you are in person or not. BPD can have issues with object consistency. Try to remember there are many shades of gray, it's not just black and white. You dont have to be with someone 100% or 0%. Sometimes space means no contact, and sometimes space means the freedom to do what they need to do. 

&#x200B;

Also yes focusing on yourself and getting to that healthy place so that you are enough all by yourself is the most important thing. I'm not there yet. But I've actually seen real progress in the last year or so and it feels really good. I feel so much lighter without all those negative thoughts that were filling my head. I still have them but they feel empty now. They used to feel so heavy and all emcompassing. It's nice to get rid of that weight. 

I truly wish you all the best. You deserve to be happy.",coyotebored83,j146yn
5,"I’m on lithium. I don’t know if it’ll help for you because every person is different. Mood stabilizers are more for bipolar disorder. It takes a while to take into effect. Once starting the dosage I felt impatient and agitated because I was coming off a hypomanic stage and I was crashing hard. This was for my bipolar. Any questions you have you should ask your psychiatrist but medications takes a while before they go into effect. 
   Mood stabilizers aren’t really prescribed for bpd because bpd is a personality disorder which may have developed from a childhood trauma. Children tend to not be explained situations because adults feel they don’t need to know or understand. Often times that lack of explanation let’s our minds go wild and think of worst case scenario of everything or everyone. Being on edge and extremely defensive. A tip my boyfriend taught me was to allow myself 24 hours to feel it out. Often times I’m quick to address something that I don’t like. So I’ll react abruptly, impulsively and negatively because my emotions are at the highest. If after 48 hours the  emotion persists it’s something I should address. I’ve noticed it’s helped lessen arguments and relax to think logically rather than emotionally. Realize your anxious thoughts are worry about a future you feel you can’t control. Focus on the things you can control at the moment and if there’s nothing more then let time take its course. Focus on other things you must do either tasks or treat yourself to something nice.",Bubblycat629,j146yn
6,"You're right. I have this stormy emotion that I break down crying and try to get what I want.. and I catch this more often that still have thoughts as black and white only. I don't want to be a burden, and nobody should babysit me for that other than myself. He said that he wants his time all by himself awhile, to heal. And the love towards me will never go away. So I will trust it and go focus on myself too.
To be enough all by themselves, what's that like? Mentally?

I'm so proud of you, and happy for you for how far you become!! I wish one day, hopefully sooner, I can00 be like you.",Milmily,j146yn
7,"\>  and I catch this more often  

&#x200B;

Awesome! The catching it is key. It will totally still happen BUT celebrate every catch. Each time it gets a bit easier and you start catching it more and more and it eventually becomes habit. I used to think it would take magic to change my thinking but it's really basic. lol 

&#x200B;

\> To be enough all by themselves, what's that like? Mentally?

LOL i dont know yet but I'm really excited and committed to finding out. It sounds lovely.

&#x200B;

Thank you! I still have bad days too. I was in a situation where I was forced to do something I didnt want to do and I have been crying for 2 days about it. The negative self talk is strong today. However being able to recognize it as 'negative self talk' and not identify it as just me anymore is really helpful. I say some awful stuff to myself in my head but that's just 'connie being a b\*\*\*\*' lol. i named my negative internal voice so i could tell her to be quiet. I read it somewhere and it helps. 

&#x200B;

Just remember to keep your eye on the goal. The goal being that you are a happy individual all by yourself. (not that that means you dont have friends and family and support, just that if you dont have them that's ok too) I make notes to remind myself. Sometimes art too.",coyotebored83,j146yn
