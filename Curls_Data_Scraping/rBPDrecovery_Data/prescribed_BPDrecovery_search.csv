0,What meds have you tried,"I’ve been diagnosed with BPD for 3 years now and due to being an addict in recovery I told my psych I don’t want to take anything that’s addicting or makes me feel loopy, she mostly tries to prescribe me antidepressants on top of depressants but I’m not depressed! I was on Latuda for a year and a half and that really helped with my anger and impulsivity but it also gave me really bad anxiety, there was no anxiety medication that helped so eventually I just got off it. Currently I’m just taking topamax for depression/mood stabilization but I don’t really think it works so I’m weaning myself off of it",1704902664.0,False,4,38,UnderTheSea2649,None,193bprc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/193bprc/what_meds_have_you_tried/
1,Atypical Anti-Psychotics for OCD/BPD,"Hi! I'm someone that has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and OCD. I recently got off my SSRI's because of the side effects, but I'm still on my mood stabilizer. Today my doctor prescribed me Vraylar, an atypical antipsychotic. Everything I'm reading about it talks about schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and it also can increase my risk of diabetes (which runs in my family). I'm curious if anyone takes/has taken anti-psychotics for anxiety or depression and what your experience was.

2,BPD & ADHD,"Hi guys :)

I (27f) was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 9. My parents didn't really believe in therapy so they kinda forgot about it, never did anything with it, and haven't told me about this diagnosis until a few years back. I've been diagnosed with BPD for 10 years. I mentioned the ADHD thing to my psychiatrist but never really focused on those symptoms as I've always been more preoccupied with the BPD symptoms.

Now, I know that ADHD could be mistaken for BPD and the other way around, but I definitely have BPD, so let's not get into that.

**I wanna ask those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD if you're taking** (or were in the past) **any medication for it? How did it work with the medication prescribed for BPD** (yes, I know BPD can't be treated with medication alone, but again - let's not go there)**? Did it make your life easier on the BPD side of things too? And in general, did it make your life easier?**

I'm tired of having to work/study twice as hard as people around me to achieve the same results. Among other things. But this is my main issue atm.

If that makes any difference, I take Effexor (venlafaxine) and trazodone.

Please be kind.",1712258208.0,False,9,6,WinterTangerine3336,None,1bvvzny,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bvvzny/bpd_adhd/

9,Remeron Mirtazapine,Has anyone taken this? I was prescribed 15 mg bc I weigh at 77 lbs I’m scared shitless to take it because I have family history of addiction and my brother told me he would take it to get a “high.” in prison and he’d try to fall asleep and it would make him twitch so he thinks I shouldn’t take it that it’ll fuck me up so I’m just not sure if I should take this I’m pretty pissed at the doctors n the er because I went for iv fluid and dehydration n high heart rate and it says dehydrated people shouldn’t take this so why would they prescribe me something that isn’t good for me at all but I’m just sick of being so small I’m 19 and I look 12. I also think they misdiagnosed me it also says those with manic symptoms should not take this and I usually have very violent n aggressive thoughts towards myself and others almost always I just didn’t tell them cause I don’t wanna get put in the looney bin.

12,Switching from Lexapro to pristiq. Nervous. Has anybody found pristiq helpful?,"26. FTM Non-binary and started pristiq today. I'm nervous because I've been in a bad place for the majority of my life. Struggling with BPD, CPTSD, anxiety, and depression. I'm really hoping this is going to help me. As a teenager I tried Zoloft, Lexapro, lithium and then effexor, was on effexor until I was about 21, couldn't orgasm and switched to prozac, felt okay but felt shitty whenever I drank. Tried Wellbutrin but felt anxious and had intrusive thoughts and bad sleep. Tried trintellix but had a horrible stomach ache so gave up on meds all together until I started not sleeping and having constant shortness of breath in 2019 so I started taking Lexapro again, it worked for a while but I gained a ton of weight and I don't think it's helping me as much anymore. My psychiatrist prescribed me pristiq, I'll go down from 10mg of lexapro to 5 these next few days then quit cold turkey. I was instructed to take 25mg of pristiq in the morning starting on the day I cut my Lexapro in half.

13,abilify and bpd,"ive been taking lexapro for about six months now. three months ago i got updosed to 20 mg. definitely helped with the daily depression i was dealing with, but brought up all of the bpd symptoms that were hiding underneath. my doctor prescribed me abilify (5 mgs) with a reduced dose of lexapro (was 20 mg now back to 10mg) and to be honest im so scared!!! 

taking prescription meds already makes me feel uneasy, and ive been reading some scary things about it. i took the 5 mg last night and had a hard time falling asleep, and when i did i abruptly woke up with heavy nausea, to the point where i literally thought i was going to vomit, blurry vision, and tossing and turning. i didnt get much sleep and when i woke in the morning for work the world felt very dreamlike. 

so im here to ask: is it worth it? my motivation and energy for life is completely gone and even though im not sad everyday anymore, the mood swings and intrusive thoughts are consuming me, im willing to work out the kinks of a new med.

14,realization,I was diagnosed with BPD about 5 years ago during an inpatient admission. At the time I was like this psychiatrist is nuts I don't have that. I stopped going to counseling and convinced my primary care to prescribe my meds.  It something I've pushed to the back of my mind for years. Lately its come to surface. My girlfriend is a social worker and has been reading I hate you don't leave me for her BPD patients. I can relate to every trait....every single one. I feel like I should have faced reality 5 years ago when I was dx instead of running away and pretending I don't have the diagnosis. I hate talking to people. I keep to myself and just deal.

15,how to work on attachment,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

edit 2: talked to my dr. the medication I was on for my arthritis gave me psychosis, and my rheumatologist didn't check my mental history before prescribing them. I stopped those, started taking prozac instead of cymbalta, and started 3 omega-3 fish oils, 1 vitamin b1, and 2 magnesium glycinate. i had a phone call w his sister a few days ago and she said he isn't ready to talk yet but it was fairly amicable. sending a text tmrw for his birthday but haven't reached out. going to the psychiatrist in a few weeks to get mood stabilizers. ive done a lot of journaling, therapy, and talking and distracting. I know I can thrive without him and I don't NEED him to survive, but I do love him and he enhances my life. I want us to work out, but I'm not going to spam or go crazy w the contact. After the bday text, I'm not going to reach out, which is hard, but if it's meant to be he will come back.",1711942056.0,False,6,4,casineb,None,1bstfxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bstfxm/how_to_work_on_attachment/
16,Emotional Relapse,"Hello everyone, after a period of treatment being stable I had a very strong emotional relapse, suddenly I started crying and I couldn't stop until 3 days later.  
These last 3 days have been a nightmare, so much so that I did not remember what it was like to live with borderline.Suddenly crying with suicidal thoughts and suddenly laughing watching my series, suddenly I felt very alone and empty, my mind could not with so many self-destructive thoughts, and so it repeated all day over and over again.The doctor prescribed another antidepressant and recommended that I go to yoga classes. It scares me that despite taking the medicine well, I can suddenly reach these critical states.  
I was about to give up, my depression was very strong, right now I have no strength but I will get it I do not know how, but I will continue in this battle and I hope that we all continue together until the end, good night to all, I send you good vibes.",1600661733.0,False,6,2,itsmoonpaula,None,iwtc2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/iwtc2g/emotional_relapse/
17,Some help here.,"

Can anybody help me. I am all alone. I am 31 yo Indian man.I feel stagnant in life. I have never been in a relationship and never will be. 
I have a family that has mental health issues. I got them from age 16. I know no one cares for this too but atleast some might gaze through.
I have no talent. I lived my life fighting what was diagnosed OCD and anxiety in the beginning and now after 15 years passing through psychotic diagnoses, has reached dependent traits hyper vigilant and now I conclude based on years long suffering and self redirections, and recent counseling that involved a psychometric test as a form of bpd known as quiet bpd. Now, before seeing my worthlessness right away for a relationship, I am not harmful like the other bpd types( even though they suffer much more and get no help from society), mine is not evident and hence took so long to find. 
Now, I have no purpose in life no self image, dependent, people pleasing( I hate myself for that, because world is so selfish when I look it through my bpd glasses.)I worked in different domains in a job I got and now I am a jack of all.
I hate myself.
I don't want this life. But I am not suicidal. I just want to walk away. Just avoid the trauma altogether. You know what on top of all this I took an snri a few years ago along with the high dose ssri(prescribed) without asking anyone or consulting, because I felt ( rn I am sure nobody will read it but there is a very small hope a little light, a fantasy rather. It's very painful to recollect it in a way that conveys my situation here).
So I took that snri because I felt so down and afraid of myself and my future as I stayed alone in the apartment and thought atleast I overcome that fear, because somehow I had to complete the integrated mtech that was the only way forward for me. I did all the work I could and somehow got out with some experience and the degree sponsored by the company.
In the end, here is the funny part, the snri complicated my condition. I have this frozen feeling with no emotions. I was in a constant fight or fright mode and it even affected my health. I started feeling zero hope in life. All I could do was sit on a bed and being I don't know just felt empty all the time. Actually I stopped feeling anything, let alone fear. No docs could help. Because I don't know how to relax. I am processing that stressed state in some other way
that I can't let go. I just start to panic when I feel stressed. I tried many relaxation techniques like emdr and eft and all that. I am now using CBD daily and it is helping my psychotic mind as well as slowly I am able to process the stuck energy.

18,Looking for resources,"I started seeing a psychiatrist, who specializes in TFP, 2 months ago. She diagnosed me with BPD. When I questioned the severity she said I’m “on the healthy side”. She explained that now that the assessment portion is over, the sessions would now be twice a week ($80 a week with my insurance). That was going to be a lot financially, as I dropped to working part time this year to help care for my baby. My husband supported my therapy and we agreed I would proceed with therapy and take a financial hit for one year for my well-being. I started to get a bad feeling about the psychiatrist when she prescribed me a sleeping medication and my insurance charged me $100 for the medication management code that she billed bc the insurance company said two codes were billed so it appears that 2 separate visits were completed when the medication management was discussed during our visit. I emailed her and told her I can’t afford $80 a week plus $100 every time she mentions medication to me so I would have my PCP take over this sleeping medication bc I don’t get charged when he writes me prescriptions. The psychiatrist then proceeds to send in a new prescription for a higher dose, which I didn’t ask for, after I was clear that I didn’t want to discuss medications with her again. This resulted in another $100 charge. She then took a 2 week vacation and we picked back up last night for our first real treatment session. She started the session by saying she needs to charge my credit card for the second medication charge. I let this go because I’m working on not cutting ppl off after a bad feeling. Then she says she has two requirements for me: 1) I need to “start a weight management program like weight watchers”. I gained a significant amount of weight during my pregnancy and can’t get it off. My PCP started me on Ozempic which has already helped me lose 40 lbs. I told the psychiatrist that I’m already taking steps to help with my weight (which was discussed in previously sessions) she replied “ya but you’re really not” and implied she didn’t trust my PCP of doing enough to manage my weight 2) since I couldn’t have her manage my meds due to insurance, she wanted me to have a regular psychiatrist manage my meds (vyvanse for ADHD and have been on for nearly 10 years and trazodone for sleeping which she put me on last month) bc she didn’t trust my PCP to manage them. 
All that was going through my head was this is more money I have to spend for things my PCP is doing for free. When I pushed back she said these two requirements were necessary for us to start therapy. She said it would be irresponsible of her to not have me do weight watchers and said it was the same as if I was an alcoholic and she required me to go to AA. 

She told me to cut my mom off and “have a hotel on speed dial” when I visit her but then later apologized and said she shouldn’t be giving me advice. She also made numerous little digs about my husband. Again, I brushed those comments aside bc I’m working on not being impulsive when it comes to cutting ppl off. But I’m really uncomfortable with her giving me an ultimatum and now  talking poorly of a third person on my life, my PCP. 

I emailed her and said I’m not comfortable with her two requirements and I understand this means we can’t move forward with therapy. I feel like the past two months of assessment and building trust with her was just a waste. I’m not ready to start with another therapist so I’m looking for other resources like books, videos, workbooks, etc that you feel helped you. Any advice or helpful tips on where to start would all be appreciated.",1673362420.0,False,3,2,yensid408,None,108bpy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/108bpy6/looking_for_resources/
19,"After having this med cocktail+not burdening myself, I am better. I was having a huge mental breakdown a year ago.","Forgive me if I have typo, I’m typing on my phone.

I was going crazy. Just crazy. I don’t even want to talk about it because it’s so shameful.
The breakdown was caused by lots of things, but major thing was school stress, alcohol, etc.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

-Benzo(I don’t recommend it because of severe physical withdrawal, but it’s working well for my anxiety. Before I would be walking and looking back v often and thinking someone would attack me. I don’t have those thoughts unless someone gets super x2 close to me. 

-Medical mmj. Since I don’t like how potent flower smells it works. 
 I don’t recommend black market for vaping. Since I have been paying for my therapy out of pocket, I have 2sessions a month now. Used to have 3-4 sessions a month. 
Tbh now albeit I use about 3g of vaping mmj within in a month in a med mmj expensive City(half gram would cost me $65-75), I pay less for my mental health(it’s been 12 years, going to therapy, looking for right medication. I couldn’t handle dbt. I hated group sessions.)



I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter. 

I feel like I am gifted. 
Even tho I have some struggles daily, ofc life is not a easy thing. My work place is stressful, min wage. But at least I can kill time with studying.
I’m just gonna get a certification.


I had 100,000 thoughts a day. Now I have 5000 thoughts and those are not suicidal.
