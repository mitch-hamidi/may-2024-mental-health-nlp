10,Just diagnosed.. so lost,"

I‚Äôve just been diagnosed bpd by an nhs psychiatrist. I feel so lost and abandoned by the health care system and family/ friends. Both my family and friends are in denial or underplaying my condition which I didn‚Äôt expect this reaction and the worst is the nhs are so underfunded they only are giving me group therapy which still start in 4-8 weeks.

12,An important issue often faced by those diagnosed with BPD,"I am 57, and over the last 43 years, I have been diagnosed with a number of mental health issues stemming from an abusive childhood.  There is something disturbing that has happened to me since I was 13, and was first encouraged by my sda school principal to try doing some ""counseling "" with him.  He turned the counseling sessions into times he could sexually misuse me, something I have come to refer to as ""sexual re-exploitation.""  This has happened so many times to myself and to others with histories like mine, but the only discussions I have ever come across about this subject have referred to this as ""transference,"" and the client, not the therapist, usually receives the blame.  Once, when I was 27, a minister who was counseling/screwing me told me something I didn't quite comprehend, but years later, when I finally caught on, it bothered me a lot.  He said the preacher who had trained him for the clergy, had told him the best sex he would ever have would be whenever he got to counsel girls with certain mental health issues.  I have felt a growing disturbance in myself over the last decade, as I started to recognize how often predators are purposely targeting those of us with certain mental health issues, and seem to focus on BPD the most.  The damage this does to people already dealing with so many issues is awful.  I have been blogging about this specific issue recently, and felt that others like myself might be interested in learning how to recognize these specific predatory words and behaviors, so we can all better protect ourselves, and also learn to speak up about those who choose harm people with serious mental and emotional issues.  I feel strongly that those of us who have made it to our 40's or 50's or older, need to start speaking up about this issue, in order to better protect younger people dealing with BPD, or any other mental health struggles.

Here is the link to what I have recently been learning, regarding this subject.  All posts from April 26 forward are descriptions of my current battle, and discoveries, regarding the misuse of those with BPD:

20,Newly Diagnosed and So Confused,"32F here.. So I don't know much about BPD. I was diagnosed a few weeks ago by a new psychiatrist, as I show 7/9 BPD traits. First of all, the disorder seems very nebulous and like it has a fair amount of stigma attached to it. Does anyone have a concise way to explain the jist of it to me? 

Secondly, I would like some opinions on my last relationship, which ended just before I was diagnosed.

I am also diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 with psychotic episodes...but I've had that diagnosis for years now, so I'm comfy with it. 

Basically, my ex is bipolar (but type 2), has cPTSD, is ADD, is nearly agoraphobic and is possibly Borderline as well. (She feels she may be, and her degree is in psych, but she hasn't been diagnosed yet)

Obviously that is a tough mix of disorders to make a relationship out of, and it was toxic to both of us over 4 years. She feels like I was abusive to her, and seems to now be going down her own rabbit hole of paranoia that is building me up into the evilest monster. Which hurts my heart, because I never meant to hurt her so badly, and I also suffered a ton during those years. 

All the bits and pieces of the toxicity of the relationship are too many and too involved to explain/list here. But the meat of what happened was that I lied to her about being physically attracted to her in the beginning, in order to spare her feelings. (I Hated lying to her, & looks don't really matter to me) She found out, and it Crushed her. She never trusted me again after that. I tried to make it up to her...&she punished me for about a year afterwards. I got suicidal from the awful relationship we were having, and she wasn't there for me through that at all. I turned to my friend who happened to be a high school ex, and he was the only one who was there for me, and his support was a big lifeline. Naturally, bc my partner didn't trust me, she thought I was cheating on her emotionally. She had me cut him out of my life. 

I kept *trying* to be a good partner and take care of her through a big PTSD breakdown that consumed her and meant she couldn't work anymore. I didn't prioritize my mental health AT ALL. Even though I obviously needed a lot of help, too. We had horrible communication and I got very stressed with being sole breadwinner.... in California... which is Butt Expensive! We had stopped having regular sex after she found out about ""The Big Lie"" and that lack of intimacy and love was very hard on me. Whenever we did have sex it was very clumsy and awful... and she never took care of my needs in that department. It was always me doing her... awkwardly....and I could count the number of times on my hand for 2 years...

Fast forward through a lot of heartache and bad communication. We moved across the country so we'd be close to her family... to a place where I knew absolutely no one. She still couldn't work, so I continued to try to support us. My mental health got really bad and I had a psychotic/ bipolar manic breakdown and was forced to be hospitalized. 

Over the next year and a half after that, we had a little more regular sex and I thought things were improving. Although I still had passive suicidal ideation and was very anhedonic and depressed. (So was she) I bought a house for us, with the hopes that getting out of apartment living would help her mental health improve. (I still wasn't deemed crazy enough, because I still could work, so I still couldn't prioritize my mental health...there wasn't enough spare time to take care of both of us)

In the end, we broke up abruptly and without really meaning to, in our new house. We never got officially married, thank God.

We had awful communication the whole way through. Now, after the break up...several awful things have come up that I had no idea she was going through when we were together.  

1. During the few, irregular times we did have sex after The Big Lie, she felt violated Every. Single. Time. Up until the end of our relationship. She didn't communicate that to me ever & so I feel absolutely awful that she was feeling that way and I had no idea. (It was never forced, she just wasn't into it to the extreme and didn't/couldn't communicate that)

2. She feels like I absolutely tore down her sense of self and self worth over the relationship 

3. She was scared of me over most of our relationship

4. Due to some misconstrued requests I made, she felt controlled by me sometimes

I have a history of abuse in my family, + The BPD, so I know I wasn't a perfect partner. There are so many other awful instances of miscommunications and misconstrued intents. I have only touched on the surface of the relationship. 

And now, it seems that I have become an ""evil"" person in her mind. It really hurts because I do have a heart and I'm an empathetic person. This person, who I meant to love & protect & care for & build up... has turned me into a monster in her mind. I know part of all that is the PTSD and bipolar paranoia she deals with...although I hesitate to bring that into this because it sounds like I'm gaslighting. 
The worst part is that I know that a lot of her grief is valid. I'm wondering if I Am a monster.

I literally dropped everything else to be in the relationship, I left my home state, family, and friends to try to make her happy & I really neglected my own mental needs...to the point of having a suicide plan recently... so it feels awful that not only did I fail in this endeavor, she feels like she was abused throughout.

I don't know what to think. I just finally got back with a therapist after several years of only having a psychiatrist. I take 4 psych meds. I don't know if I'm a monster or if her head is/has been skewed or both. 

What I do know is I don't want to feel like the scum of the earth and I don't want to treat another person badly.
Right now I'm so confused and I don't know what really happened! It's somewhere in a grey area, but now she's only seeing black and white. I just feel awful and I had to get all that off my chest. 

Does anyone have any clarity?

23,I feel like my partner has been manipulative since I was diagnosed and I don't want this to affect my recovery.,"To preface this, I intend to have a discussion with my therapist regarding this issue but I'd like some insight if this is a situation I need to remove myself from asap. 


My partner and I broke up about a month ago shortly after my BPD got worse and I was cycling through emotions every other hour. I started therapy and it has worked tremendously well. A couple of days ago, he came by and explained that he'd like to give this another try once I have sorted out my issues and he has his career together. Btw, we had been living together and he has moved to a place nearby. 


I love this new space we have to work on ourselves. I am working out, focusing on my studies and hobbies like never before. However, there have been a few instances where I'm wondering if he is subconsciously using my diagnosis against me recklessly. 


For example, he dropped by pretty late last night and was about to head back home to study. I was heading to bed anyway so I suggested he bring his materials over to study here since it was so late and he looked tired. He immediately went on the attack. ""Babe you are regressing, you are going back into the loop"". I was so taken aback, I was on the verge of tears. This recovery process has not been easy and it was very hurtful that he could throw my diagnosis at my face when I was just being kind. 


This isn't the first time this has happened. I assumed he is quite level headed and one of the few stable people I know. But the current dynamic feels very one sided. Although I'd like to be supportive of him while he achieves his goals, this behaviour of telling me I'm regressing or that I need to get a handle on my emotions for very normal kindnesses that couples show each other has left me with a sour taste in my mouth. 


He drops by unannounced all the time which I was okay with since he needs a break from his studies but he seems to think he is entitled to receive/show affection however he wants to while I'm the one walking on eggshells around him. 


I feel gaslighted to an extent? Being told I'm nuts for asking if he needs a meal since he is overworked is just.....bizarre.",1682737623.0,False,1,3,Notalltheretbh,None,132hnv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/132hnv0/i_feel_like_my_partner_has_been_manipulative/

However, I'm now stuck in quarantine, unable to see my long-suffering boyfriend (of 2 years but I did break up with him 8 months ago for 2 months).  I'm full of self hate and unable to go out for a run for the next week as I'm in the UK and my mum has coronavirus symptoms, and going for a run is probably the single most helpful thing for my head.

Everything is on lockdown and I can't go to the therapist or a psych, it's like being told you're mentally ill and tossed into isolation.

My friends not telling me about this situation made it worse. She tells me ki she'll choose what she'll do while I just sit and wait, everything tells me she's gonna leave me, my priorities for her and her for mine isn't even on the same scale and it hurt, I opened my heart to her before realising that she's committed and I feel like a huge idiot. I've told her to go to the other guy coz honestly if we were on the same page, there wouldn't have to be any choosing, and I'm trying to live with it, but it fucking hurts so so bad.

30,Can i identify with BPD even if i haven't been diagnosed with it? i truly feel BPD is my diagnosis and that nothing can change that.,"In 2017 i got a psych assessment when i was barely 18 years old, they concluded i had OCD withNPD/BPD traits, they decided to not diagnose me with BPD/NPD because of my level of impairment. I however know that i have BPD because of the symptoms i have displayed since i was a kid and primarily since i was 17, which is the age where it became gradually worse, and now at age 21 has reached a tipping point.

i Have a childhood diagnosis of Intellectual Disability, and recently (yesterday) they brought up the idea of possible Autism Spectrum Disorder, and many times have said they didn't think i had BPD, however i am still reluctant to accept the idea i don't have a personality disorder.

Over the course of 3 years and self diagnosis, BPD has been the core of my identity. I have felt humiliated and excessively obsessive when i tell people i only have ''traits'' as i feel it severely invalidates my trauma and the pain i face everyday.

I have told  people online/offline that i have BPD, and i seem embedded in my rigid delusion that i genuinely have this disorder, I feel as if the psychiatric system has let me down and has not provided accurate results because i am a male, and because of my disability. I was referred to a dual disability/mental health hospital as an outpatient for a 2nd assessment and will receive a diagnosis in 2 weeks, however BPD still seems unlikely to them.

The reason i relate to BPD so much is because of the behaviors i have, i can relate to ''BPD feels like having 3rd degree burns'', and i basically struggle with substance abuse, self harm, anger which is often irrational, and i don't know who or what i am as a person, and i have severe abandonment issues, i also experience extreme irritability over the smallest of things and will split on someone, from all good to all bad, rejection sensitivity, getting attached to people and wanting to marry them after a day, i've also struggled with thoughts of violence, homicide, arson, and grandiose beliefs. You can see my comment history and outbursts on reddit.

34,BPD & ADHD,"Hi guys :)

I (27f) was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 9. My parents didn't really believe in therapy so they kinda forgot about it, never did anything with it, and haven't told me about this diagnosis until a few years back. I've been diagnosed with BPD for 10 years. I mentioned the ADHD thing to my psychiatrist but never really focused on those symptoms as I've always been more preoccupied with the BPD symptoms.

Now, I know that ADHD could be mistaken for BPD and the other way around, but I definitely have BPD, so let's not get into that.

**I wanna ask those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD if you're taking**¬†(or were in the past)¬†**any medication for it? How did it work with the medication prescribed for BPD**¬†(yes, I know BPD can't be treated with medication alone, but again - let's not go there)**? Did it make your life easier on the BPD side of things too? And in general, did it make your life easier?**

I'm tired of having to work/study twice as hard as people around me to achieve the same results. Among other things. But this is my main issue atm.

If that makes any difference, I take Effexor (venlafaxine) and trazodone.

TL;DR: I'm a chronic overthinker. I'm not asking to be diagnosed or even necessarily what anyone here thinks I am or am not -- I'm asking how you realized you have BPD, especially if you suspected (or knew) before diagnosis.

I met a friend of mine about three years ago, and when he told me that he had BPD, I started doing research on it. That research led me to the realization that *another* friend of mine most definitely has it (not diagnosed, at least not yet, but if you meet all criteria, ya know).

Having a (disorganized attachment)[https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/disorganized-attachment], there are naturally elements to BPD that I can understand and apply to my own life.

More and more recently though, and especially when I hear people talk about their experiences with quiet BPD, I find myself relating to very nearly everything.

Which, ya know, makes a person wonder. I went through this same thing when I first wondered if I had autism, and then again when I wondered about OCD.

So, was there anything (or a bunch of things) that made you realize that this is what you have? Or was it an immediate realization upon hearing symptoms?",1684153800.0,False,3,25,General_Ad7381,None,13i6vf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13i6vf1/how_did_you_know_you_have_bpd/

64,Has anyone ever taken the DES assessment while receiving therapy?,"Recently, I‚Äôve experienced a severe mental breakdown - to cut a long story short, the experience resulted in several hospitalisations and taking time off work for 2 and a half month to the present date.   

The aftermath of this was me receiving a care coordinator and psychologist, who have decided that given my recent experiences, they want to do an ‚Äòextended assessment‚Äô to clarify my diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with BPD for close to 3 years now and when initially diagnosed, I did not have to take the DES assessment.  

DES stands for Dissociative Experiences Scale, which is essentially a test of 28 questions relating to dissociative tendencies that you rate between 0-100% based on the regularity of your experience with the posed scenario.   

This is not anything I have ever been asked to do before, and I am unsure if this is a typical part of a BPD diagnosis. I have made peace with my diagnosis and being presented with the DES has sky rocketed my anxiety that it might not have been right all along.   

The last thing I want to do is send myself down the rabbit hole by googling to try and find any form of clarity on this, and I would be immensely grateful if anyone could shed any input on this or if they have any experience (personal or not) with the DES assessment.

It seems clear that the rise in BPD diagnoses has less to do with a sudden rise in the struggle, and more to do with having the terminology and the willingness to diagnose. Accordingly, I find myself wondering whether big names from the past demonstrate life as a borderline. 

Right now I'm listening to a podcast with Jon Stewart and Judd Apatow, talking about Apatow's recent George Carlin doc... I think Carlin could have been a borderliner.

question to you guys is- what is something you wish you could have had access to when you were first diagnosed? What would have made it easier/better or really would have benefitted you at the time? It could even be something you struggle with/wish you
had access to now.

My main goal with this would be to educate the public & de-stigmatize BPD, while also offering support, mentors, and resources to help with coping.

I have been under psychiatric care since I was 13 (now 23) and have been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, social phobia, OCD, anorexia, ADHD, and PTSD and I typically defer to my doctors/therapists. But it's pretty fucking obvious to me that there is something bigger going on here... how would a person have 7 unrelated mental illnesses?! I have been on a cocktail of psychiatric medications since age 13, tried every type of therapy that I could and I still feel like I'm grasping at straws and trying to treat things that are just symptoms of a larger problem.

I have done A LOT of research (I'm talking hours upon hours) and am reasonably confident that I have Quiet BPD. I think the reason that no practitioner has caught onto it is because I internalize everything and I only lash out at myself. I don't really show any external signs of having BPD, however I have 8/9 BPD characteristics in the DSM (for context, diagnosis is appropriate with 5/9 symptoms). 

When I brought this up with my psychiatrist, she said she doesn't really see typical BPD traits in me (which I think is because I have quiet subtype and it's highly internal) and that she is hesitant to diagnose BPD because of the stigma it carries... okay, but I am confident that I meet the diagnosis standards under the DSM and need to be treated for BPD instead of the other seven issues, as the BPD & PTSD are no doubt what is causing everything else. 

I really don't want to self diagnose. But I have brought this up with multiple therapists, psychiatrists, etc. and my ED recovery coach is the only one to see the truth in what I'm saying. I *know* something deeper is going on. I have felt this way my whole life and only when reading about quiet BPD was I able to understand the chronic emptiness that has caused all of the other issues.

89,Something odd is going on at home,"hey everyone. I was diagnosed with BPD years ago and have now recently had a doctor think I have bipolar too. My mom passed when I was 13 and I have since lived with my dad. He had been truly supportive after I got admitted and diagnosed. Recently I didn't get medication at our clinic and became depressed and sensitive. Because he has been my pillar, he has seen me in all kinds of vulnerabilities. So he knows how my mind works. I've recently been suspecting that he is gslighting me (that's if I am even understanding gaslighting well). Because I didn't get meds, I yelled at him once and told him I wish I was aborted and hope he kills me. I was wrong and later apologized to him. He has been hurt since and I believe he has withdrew all efforts of being supportive of my mental health. It hurt like hell for the first few weeks, then I got a grasp but now I feel like he is purposely trying to mess with my head. I am highly empathic so I feel anxious at the oldest changes of mood he does.

I recently moved for grad school and am currently struggling because a friend of mine has become my FP. Without too many details we had mutual feelings for each other but she just got out of a relationship and for other factors couldn't do anything serious. I quickly realized I'd get attached too fast and so I told her we had to just be friends, which she was okay with. I struggled with it for a while so I told her we needed to go no contact for a while. We're off that break and when I wasn't around her I was doing better but now that's she's back in my life I spiral and split on myself so often. I put it in my head she hates me and had a crazy episode only to see her irl and realize we are fine. 

I want to remain friends with her but I'm really struggling with fixated thoughts on her and not comparing myself to everyone in her life.

92,28 M and Confused about why I‚Äôm awful to the one girl who loved me,"28 M and diagnosed with bpd 6 months ago. I recently read the book The Angry Heart. Great read, very relatable. Felt like I was looking in the mirror. Regarding the mans first relationship in the book, he talked about how he loved this girl (kind of) but treated her terribly. Lied, stole, manipulated and abused her. However, people with BPD have their ‚ÄúFP‚Äù, their love, the only person they can ever imagine being with. Basically love bomb them, clingy, co-dependent, ect. So why was this man so mean? 

I looked back at my first relationship, and second person I had slept with. I was 20, and I was awful to her. Lied, stole, manipulated, toxic jealousy, just overall mean. Why would I do this to the first girl that ever liked me? Growing up neglected and never wanted and one beautiful girl wants me and I was terrible. That was 4 years of hell for the both of us but mainly her. For context, We found out we were having a kid 3 months into our relationship, she‚Äôll be 7 soon. I now spend lots of time with my daughter and kiss the ground my baby mama walks on cause of the immense amount of guilt that i still feel years later. When she left I felt like I was losing everything, but in reality I was just losing control and I hated it. Got diagnosed with BPD 6 months ago and think a lot about how different things could have been for us if I had just know how messed up I was.

101,What Is the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD?," Mental Disorders (DSM).

There's no biologically based test to definitively diagnose borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, mental health professionals often use screening instruments such as the MSI-BPD to help identify the likelihood of BPD and the need for further evaluation and treatment.

Scoring of the MSI-BPD

Each item is rated as a ""1"" if it is present and a ""0"" if it is absent, and items are totaled for possible scores from 0 to 10. A score of 7 is considered a valid diagnostic cutoff, meaning that a score of 7 or higher indicates that you likely meet the criteria for a BPD diagnosis.2

The first eight items of the MSI-BPD represent the first eight DSM-IV/5 diagnostic criteria for BPD, while the last two items assess the final DSM-IV/5 criterion, i.e., **paranoia/dissociation.**

## Uses for the MSI-BPD

Clinicians use the MSI-BPD to diagnose BPD, sometimes in conjunction with other screening tools. Research suggests the MSI-BPD is helpful in detecting BPD in the general population,3 but more studies are needed.

The MSI-BPD test has been shown to be very effective in detecting possible BPD in people who are seeking or have a history of treatment for mental health problems.

## Psychometric Properties

The MSI-BPD has demonstrated valid, reliable psychometric properties. It has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It has also demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for detecting borderline personality disorder when a score of 7 is used as a diagnostic cutoff.

[**Coping With Borderline Personality Disorder**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095SHGB9N)¬†

## Other Screening Tools

The MSI-BPD is only one of several that clinicians typically use to diagnose BPD. These include the following.  


Structured Clinical Interview

This official clinical interview of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is an update of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) but is very similar.4 Your mental health professional may use this screening tool to help determine your diagnosis by asking you questions directly related to the criteria for BPD that are listed in the DSM-5.

This screening instrument also has an optional self-reporting questionnaire with 108 questions, but not all clinicians who choose the SCID-5-PD use this. 

Causes of Borderline Personality Disorder

PDQ-4

The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, 4th Edition (PDQ-4) screening test consists of 99 true-or-false questions that can help screen for various personality disorders, including BPD.5

Zanarini Rating Scale

The Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD), also developed by Dr. Zanarini, is used for patients who have already been diagnosed with BPD to test for changes over time.1

Which Tool Is Best?

A recent study comparing correlations, sensitivity, and specificity among the MSI-BPD, PDQ-4, and SCID-II in adolescents and young adults showed they were equally effective in predicting a BPD diagnosis.6 On the other hand, another study concluded that the PDQ-4 ""should not be used in clinical practice as a screening instrument for PD assessment.""7

## Impact of BPD Screening

BPD is challenging to diagnose and treat because it's so often misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder and other conditions. Further complicating the issue is that BPD often exists with comorbidities, including bipolar disorder, and poses a significant risk of suicide.8 That makes accurate screening tools such as the MSI-BPD particularly important.  


Once BPD is diagnosed, the clinician can develop a treatment plan to address it. This might include such targeted approaches as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), which has been shown to be effective for people with BPD.8  


## Potential Pitfalls of the MSI-BPD

Tests such as the MSI-BPD provide a picture of person's mental status only at a particular point in time. Astute clinicians additionally take into account the person's patterns of behavior over time.9

&#x200B;

BPD is a particularly difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. Research indicates that the MSI-BPD is a valuable tool in this effort, however, and takes very little time to complete. Based on the results, a clinician can then help you address BPD's challenges and learn healthy ways to cope with and regulate your emotional states and responses.",1647850548.0,False,3,1,redditerX75,None,tj6rq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/tj6rq5/what_is_the_mclean_screening_instrument_for_bpd/
102,Struggling with nightmares from the past.,"Throwaway account here.
So first a bit about us. You can skip to the question if you want.

My wife with BPD and i are together since 2008. We were at the tim 16 and 19 and did go through alm rough times together.
She got diagnosed at first with depression during our relationship and at the age of 18 with BPD and ADD. We did go to different therapist over the years. Some more usefull than others. She had for around one year a really creative one, who brought some ideas for her sleeping problems, but dropped out of the profession due pregnancy. She has now a therapist specialized on DBT. And she did some hughe improvements.


Question;

Now that she made hughe improvements in the last half of this year, but still struggles a lot with nightmares, where she falls back in her childhood, mixed with her current life.
We're now hoping to find something, that might her help with this. It really bothers her, since she feels like every progress she made, isn't there. In addition, she's not well rested.

I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers‚Äô mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn‚Äôt even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as ‚Äúa danger to the public.‚Äù Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn‚Äôt a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it‚Äôs an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don‚Äôt deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can‚Äôt do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

Found only 2 and I was just disappointed. I don't know if remission can occur this soon. Anyways I always wanted to get rid of my BPD and when I realised I haven't found myself yet, it made me feel sad. 
I have symptoms from past 13 years and I thought it's just the way I am. Then I got diagnosed just last year and my diagnosis was like getting all the answers for everything. Before being diagnosed I thought intrusive thoughts are normal, like every other person's brain works like that. But after being medicated I realised that the thoughts are not part of everybody's life. Now the thought of getting better sounds just scary. Like I've been this way all my life, now what am I supposed to do without it?",1633945758.0,False,13,4,Numerous-Eagle8586,None,q5sd05,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/q5sd05/is_it_only_me_or_everyone_feels_so/
118,New to BPD,"So I guess this is sort of my introduction, as im new and just exploringmy support options. I'm a 28F and married with 3 kids. I know the all the hate I'll get for this, but I haven't been clinically diagnosed yet, atm I'm still learning about bpd and collecting all the evidence to bring to my doctor so I can start the process of being diagnosed. 


Now that that's outta the way, let's start from the beginning. My mental issues, as it pertains to bpd, started manifesting when I was 9 after my parents split up. My parents were both abusive in different ways, mom is a narcissist and dad liked to beat us, but my siblings and I didn't know that our lives were all that bad because we didn't know any better. That was until the divorce... it was still pretty taboo to have divorced parents back then, so the schools put us in group counciling and that's when we started realizing everything. 


The divorce didn't make anything better tho, and as the years went on, everything compounded until I finally had a melt down. At 14 I was caught with razor blades on school campus, but the felt I was more of a threat to others than myself and I was sent to an alternative school for 3mos. When I got bk I basically told the school therapist I was going to keep mutilating myself bc no one cared enough to stop me. That's when I was finally hospitalized and diagnosed with ""severe depression with anxiety"". 3yrs later, that diagnosis changed to ""manic depression with severe anxiety"". I was on every medication you could think of, but nothing helped or lasted very long... my emotions have always been a daily rollercoaster for me and it was difficult to control.


At 19 I got pregnant with my first kid, I took preemptive steps on ppd. But all that did was delay the inevitable, and that was the last time I took any medication for my issues and started self medicating. I was doing pretty good until at 23, I lost what would have been my second kid. I spiraled for months after that, but even after it stopped I was still never as good as I was b4. Then at 25 I got pregnant again, and that's where things started getting really bad again. I didn't try to take meds during that time and the ppd hit me harder than the first time, even still as bad as I was, I still felt like I was handling it all very well... but 9mos later I was pregnant again and tht just turbo charged the spiral.


I knew my issues weren't normal and that I was worse than I had ever been b4 in my life, so I started doing research. Instead of focusing on past diagnosis, I researched all of my symptoms which I'll list off now.

‚òÜ constant daily rollercoaster of emotions
‚òÜvarious manifestations of paranoia
‚òÜhaving different ""personalities"" for different people I interact with
‚òÜhopelessness
‚òÜself hate 
‚òÜunstable relationships
‚òÜinability to hold a job for more than 9mos
‚òÜfeeling like I'm not in control of my self or actions
‚òÜimpulsive habits
‚òÜblackout rages
‚òÜhyper fixation with new relationships 
‚òÜsaying things I don't mean
‚òÜfeeling lost
‚òÜterrified of abandonment
‚òÜfeeling out of place or time
‚òÜdisassociating 
‚òÜhearing/seeing things that aren't there
‚òÜseething jealousy 
‚òÜacute distrust, even with people close to me


Really I could go on and on, the point is that I came across bpd and everything just clicked. So I along with all of my research, I started listening to other people's stories and their struggles and it just solidified it all for me. I meet 7 out of 9 criteria points, and so I'm 99% sure that this is what my problems all stem from. Really, the only thing that's really stopping me from going to my doctors with all of this, is my distrust of the medical industry. I don't know how to approach the subject without sounding like I'm crazy or overreacting. I've had past professionals claim nothing is wrong and tht I'm just attention seeking, it's not often I'm ever taken seriously.

unfortunately I‚Äôve found myself in a whirlwind of bpdlovedones posts, trying to listen to podcasts about bpd (drs are saying the cruel, stereotype type things about bpd), and im wondering if anyone‚Äôs actually recovered? How? How did your relationships change? am I stuck in this forever?


I (23f) have been diagnosed for 3 years, and reflecting, recognize how and where my bpd has come up, where it‚Äôs been prevelant and caused issues in relationships.


Here‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm currently with a new(ish) (5 months) partner (23m), and it seems like it is a safe place. He knows about my bpd, he tries to understand, he sets boundaries, he asks questions, he knows im in therapy yaddayaddayadda.


Normally, I have pretty quiet bpd, I don‚Äôt lash out (I did when I was a teen), I bite my tongue when I split, I realize when im devaluing someone and don‚Äôt make rash decisions I know I‚Äôll regret. However it obviously still comes out sometimes. It looks like it not seeing the other side, taking accountability, seeing im wrong, stuff along that nature.


But, when I do come around and realize maybe I was wrong, I feel so much shame and saying ‚Äúim sorry here‚Äôs why I was wrong‚Äù feels‚Ä¶ vulnerable?? I don‚Äôt know what my issue is haha. I‚Äôm not sure how to describe the feeling of 


Nonetheless, I have been trying to slowly recover, I have started a new intensive therapy program, im trying. But I feel like im messing my bf up along the way. I know every relationship has shit to hurdle over in the beginning but I feel like it‚Äôs more aggressive for me because there‚Äôs a name to the reason for some issues (bpd).

126,My spouses feel I mention my bpd too much,"I spoke with my boyfriend last night that I live with and he mentioned that two of our spouses said I mention my bpd too much.

I try to explain things using things but I always apologize for anything I've done typically I'll say something like ""hey, I'm really sorry I will do my best to improve this in the future. I think that because of my bpd it caused this issue to spiral."" Just an example of something simple I am just doing my best to recognize any triggers or what caused these issues because I'm trying to identify causes and get better about how I react to everything I've only been diagnosed since 2021.

I have been doing my best at recovering and letting go of the trauma I still have from the past and every day I feel I am definitely improving especially since actually getting that diagnosis along with my diagnosis for OCD and PTSD.

They also judged that I don't sit near the partner I live with much but I feel like it makes sense to try and give my other friends and partners attention on the weekly occasions we are around them since I'm with my main partner every other day of the week that we don't see friends/partners.

And the last thing they said is that I apparently make too many mean or self depreciating jokes. My spouse only recently brought to my attention that it bothered him when I made jokes that involved him and I immediately mostly stopped sometimes I forget but it's definitely gone down at least 90-95% and I'm working to make that 100% however my self depreciating jokes don't seem like an issue to me because I'm always just playing around and it's nothing super cruel just mostly stuff like ""if I'm trash then you're obligated to take me out."" In a joking and flirty way.

It seems like the only nice things he had to tell me were that they think I'm creative and generous and that I dealt with a money issue pretty well instead of blowing up I sat myself down and calmed myself then had an important discussion.

127,I‚Äôm surviving the worst part of my life. Recovery IS possible and I‚Äôm proof of it.,"Long post ahead. Tl;dr at the bottom.

For some background, I‚Äôm 29, just got diagnosed BPD last September. Despite that I struggled my entire life (suicidal thoughts, self harm, toxic relationships, MULTIPLE trips to the ER and I still was never properly diagnosed). I started DBT in October and just finished the program in April. I also started lamictal last year but just got on a dose that worked for me around February.

A little over three weeks ago, my husband got physically violent with me. He had ‚Äúonly‚Äù been verbally abusive in the past, which I let happen because I believed he would get better, even though he never even promised he would. 

And I LEFT. I just LEFT. I‚Äôve never really felt the FP thing, but I definitely let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to me in the past. And I know if this happened a year ago‚Ä¶I would have stayed. I would have let him tell me he only hit me because my behavior made him. I would have let him make me believe I was the one who was getting the second chance to not fuck up. 

But after a year of intense therapy and meds (less than a year actually) I had the ability to leave him. And when he tried to control me, I still left. And when it meant I‚Äôd have to live alone, I still left. And even when I had a full emotional breakdown on our first wedding anniversary, one week after he hit me, I still left.

Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am for keeping myself safe, something I never have done in the past. This is the hardest and worst thing I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life. But I know I‚Äôll survive, and honestly, I owe that to DBT and all the work I put into it.

Please don‚Äôt give up hope. Keep trying, keep putting in the work. It‚Äôs worth it and so are you.

I‚Äôll catch you in my suicide note if I don‚Äôt catch you later‚Äù

I was drunk and in pain - I‚Äôm not excusing it just contextualizing. She read the texts but didn‚Äôt respond or call me.

They were luckily nice and understanding and didn‚Äôt involuntarily institutionalize me. 

Now from what I can tell most if not all of my friend group knows. I texted each of them to ask for privacy but I don‚Äôt feel like I can ever look them in the eyes or stay in this city (luckily was planning on moving later in the year).

I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm asking for. I‚Äôve had something similar happen before and I know I‚Äôm resilient and in a better place (I know it‚Äôs still not the best place lol). But I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to any of my friends and although my mom and I are really close, I don‚Äôt want to burden and scare her more than I already have in the past.

We were couple 13 years, we broke up 3 years ago and we have 8y old son together. We started our relationship when we were 16y old so he has been my everything always. My behavior in relationship was very harmful, cheating, leaving him and calling him names. 3y ago he decided he was done for good and wasn't patience anymore. I totally understand that. One year after BU i met someone new Who was my FP about 4months. Things ended and it was the first time i felt pretty good by my own, i didn't have FP. Last summer we had sex multiple times with my ex and it started again. He said to me that this was only sex, he doesnt want relationship anymore. Well september he met another woman. And then my begging and bleeding started. It has been now 6months, i can't sleep, i can't eat because i'm so obsessed. This whole thing is killing me. He has said to me that i need to focus now to myself, get better and maybe in the future we can see if we have fresh start again. But i can't leave him alone. It feels like my world is ending every day. I have so strong anxiety and fear of abandonment. He hasn't even abandon me, he wants to be my friend and be in my life and ofcourse we have a kid together. But how to cope with this? I want to wait him when his relationship is over but it's not guaranteed that it will end and how long it takes. They have long distance relationship so it complicates their stuff. I have lost myself with this Journey and i need to find myself again and really get better before he can't even see me as a potential partner. This is so fucking hard, letting go of FP who has been your whole world from teenagers.

139,Some help here.,"

Can anybody help me. I am all alone. I am 31 yo Indian man.I feel stagnant in life. I have never been in a relationship and never will be. 
I have a family that has mental health issues. I got them from age 16. I know no one cares for this too but atleast some might gaze through.
I have no talent. I lived my life fighting what was diagnosed OCD and anxiety in the beginning and now after 15 years passing through psychotic diagnoses, has reached dependent traits hyper vigilant and now I conclude based on years long suffering and self redirections, and recent counseling that involved a psychometric test as a form of bpd known as quiet bpd. Now, before seeing my worthlessness right away for a relationship, I am not harmful like the other bpd types( even though they suffer much more and get no help from society), mine is not evident and hence took so long to find. 
Now, I have no purpose in life no self image, dependent, people pleasing( I hate myself for that, because world is so selfish when I look it through my bpd glasses.)I worked in different domains in a job I got and now I am a jack of all.
I hate myself.
I don't want this life. But I am not suicidal. I just want to walk away. Just avoid the trauma altogether. You know what on top of all this I took an snri a few years ago along with the high dose ssri(prescribed) without asking anyone or consulting, because I felt ( rn I am sure nobody will read it but there is a very small hope a little light, a fantasy rather. It's very painful to recollect it in a way that conveys my situation here).
So I took that snri because I felt so down and afraid of myself and my future as I stayed alone in the apartment and thought atleast I overcome that fear, because somehow I had to complete the integrated mtech that was the only way forward for me. I did all the work I could and somehow got out with some experience and the degree sponsored by the company.
In the end, here is the funny part, the snri complicated my condition. I have this frozen feeling with no emotions. I was in a constant fight or fright mode and it even affected my health. I started feeling zero hope in life. All I could do was sit on a bed and being I don't know just felt empty all the time. Actually I stopped feeling anything, let alone fear. No docs could help. Because I don't know how to relax. I am processing that stressed state in some other way
that I can't let go. I just start to panic when I feel stressed. I tried many relaxation techniques like emdr and eft and all that. I am now using CBD daily and it is helping my psychotic mind as well as slowly I am able to process the stuck energy.

I have always trusted him but I have an extreme fear of abandonment and cheating but worked really hard to avoid these impulses and mostly direct the anger and hurt to myself. However, during our relationship I was recently diagnosed with BPD. He brought up casually that he wants to make more car friends since I am not into cars, fine with me! Then he asks if it is okay for him to talk to girls when they have cool cars. Originally, I began to panic and said no. Minutes later I realized maybe that wasn‚Äôt fair and I retracted and said he could talk to them just not get close or hang out regularly. He thinks this is not fair. I know that maybe it isn‚Äôt fair but I‚Äôm so scared he‚Äôs going to find someone better and leave me that I keep having meltdowns at just the thought of it.

142,I thought I recovered but now I feel ashamed.,"I (27F) have been dating my partner (29M) for almost a year now, this relationship is very meaningful to me because of the amount of trauma therapy I went through to be able to date again after a 4 year abusive relationship. I think I waited a good 3 years before dating again when I found my current partner at the beginning of the year. 

As someone who‚Äôs been diagnosed with BPD in the past it‚Äôs very hard to be in relationships, and I genuinely think I had come a long way in my recovery when it came to developing a more secure attachment style, communication,  and  self regulation. 

My partner and I have come a very long way from when we first started dating and I genuinely felt so proud of myself for coming this far in improvement and feeling secure, until today. 

My partner just left for a week long vacation with their family, and while I‚Äôve been happy they‚Äôve been able to do that, it‚Äôs been causing me some unease to the point I‚Äôve been crying. They‚Äôve gone on trips before where communication is limited and I was fine, so I‚Äôm not understanding why my separation anxiety all of a sudden has become so bad.

143,I'm terrified my partner is cheating,"I've been diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this but maybe someone has some insight or tips on how to handle this, my first instinct was always to ""cheat back"" once I've felt threatened.",1696423146.0,False,2,7,SilverGirl-,None,16zm5er,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16zm5er/im_terrified_my_partner_is_cheating/
144,Success story: 3 years since I no longer met the criteria for BPD,"**Background:**

Diagnosed with BPD at 19: I would engage in extremely toxic and manipulative behaviours with my boyfriend at the time - spamming his phone if he didn‚Äôt reply within one hour, threatening self harm if he wasn‚Äôt spending all his spare time with me or felt he would leave me, I would split him every single day, within a matter of hours, no matter how hard he tried to make me happy or ‚Äúdo things right‚Äù. 
I was in college but couldn‚Äôt keep even a part-time job and failed countless classes because I‚Äôd lose motivation and had absolutely no sense of self.
I wanted him to hurt as much as I hurt from all my past unresolved trauma, putting it onto small things he might have misstepped, swinging from being extremely anxious/depressed to explosive anger. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself - no emotional regulation, black and white thinking, the works.

When he finally couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, I broke down completely and sought professional help where I was diagnosed with BPD. When I first read the symptoms, it was like reading myself on a page. 

**Recovery:**

Recovery took at least 5 years: I had to take a long, hard, brutal look at myself and shared it (embarrassingly) with my psych - identifying my traumas, triggers, behaviours and accepting it. 

I had times (especially in the first 2 years) where I regressed and engaged in undesirable behaviours and would hate myself so much I wanted to die.
The most difficult to manage was my dependency on partners, I feared abandonment more than anything and would lie or threaten self-harm to make them stay. 
But I kept self-compassion, accountability for my actions, and persevered. The frequencies became noticeably less and I used that to keep motivated. 
DBT and CBT worked wonders, especially practicing radical acceptance, wise mind, mindfulness, GIVE, and self-soothing techniques.
I also worked on my trauma through multiple EMDR sessions and counselling sessions at the same time.

3 years ago I was told I no longer met the criteria for BPD. I‚Äôm so proud of myself for keeping up with all my improvements (still use the same techniques today).
I‚Äôm so much more stable and confident. I have never insulted my husband, breached his privacy, threatened self-harm, spammed messages, tried to control his actions, blew up on him, or shifted blame during the entirety of this 4 year relationship (I had already come so far then) - it‚Äôs basic respect, but before therapy this would‚Äôve been impossible for me.


Guys it‚Äôs so difficult and painful and you‚Äôre going to have times where you slip up and it might take so long, but in the end it is so worth it.",1646332266.0,False,85,15,earlgreybiscuit69,None,t5y928,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/t5y928/success_story_3_years_since_i_no_longer_met_the/
145,I'm a lesbian with bpd. Has anyone experienced anything like this?,"So I have recently been diagnosed with bpd and there are some things I am struggling with regarding my sexuality and how I've got here and I know it sounds completely far fetched but I just need to know if theres anyone out there with a similar experience. I have recently discovered that I am a lesbian but I had only been with men before my girlfriend (who was also just diagnosed with bpd today) and she's really struggling to see how I could possibly be gay which I understand but I just know that I am on the feelings and looking back through my life.

When I was 13/14 my mum went into my school because I was being called an 'anorexic lesbian'. I was very skinny hence anorexic and I liked to hold my female  friends hands. I also used to look at my female friends bodies when they were changing (I know this isn't OK but I just didn't think anything of it). 

When I was 16 I went to my mum and I told her that I thought I was gay because of a specific girl in my school because I really fancied her and wanted to be with her but she told me that 'I wasn't gay but if I was it would be OK' and that 'everyone has those thoughts and feelings about women'. I feel like in that moment she normalised having feelings for women and made it seem like that's what heterosexual women felt. In that moment I felt really disappointed that I wouldn't be able to be with women. 

My mum also used to turn off TV programmes with two women in a relationship in then them and I always really wanted to watch them and have remembered the scenes that I saw from them so clearly throughout my life. 

I then fell down a horrible hole of chasing validation through sex with men because I thought that that would get me love. I created a character that I thought men would want because I wanted to be loved so badly and I thought they wanted sex so I became a 'sweet, cool girl who just wanted sex'. Even though I actually was never attracted to men in anyway. 

Everytime I had sex with men I dissociated to my school hallway and pushed my feelings away. My counsellor said that I was trying to escape to somewhere safer but unfortunately my school experience wasn't positive and therefore I was self sabotaging and punishing myself. I always felt anxious and wrong with men but I ignored my feelings and kept striving to be the perfect character.

I found myself looking at my female friends and their bodies and imagining myself being with them. But it was always like I couldn't be. I knew that I was never attracted to men and I have been attracted to women but because I 'wasn't gay' I managed to get to pansexuality because I knew I wasn't attracted to men but I didn't look far enough to know that actually I was attracted to women and therefore gay.

When I was younger a girl kissed me in a club but I was drunk and she got lipstick all over my mouth and at this point in my life I feel like i was just so far into the character that I was so fixated on being the perfect woman for men so that I would be loved because it was my only option because i 'wasn't gay' because of what was said when I was 16.

I have found myself fantasing about women throughout my life but it was like I wasn't able to be with them and men were my only option for love and I wanted to be loved so badly. 

When I went to my psychiatrist to get my diagnosis he said that because my mum was my primary care giver her telling me that I wasn't gay was a massive part in my life and that I wanted to please her and therefore became characters so that I could be loved and used sex as a currency to achieve this because I thought it's what men wanted.

I will also say that both of my parents are suspected narcissists and my step mum is suspected bpd also. 

When I met my girlfriend everything was different, I thought that she was the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen and everything with her feels so natural and right. And when we had sex for the first time I looked at her and said 'oh my goodness I'm not thinking about anything else.' because that was so new to me, I was actually there and thinking about her and her body and touching her and not just trying to escape in my head. 

When I actually think about what I want I know that it's women and that I'm a lesbian but I'm just so confused how this could be my life and how I could have done these things when I know they're wrong for me. I just need some answers and want to know if there's anyone who has any? 

Basically I just want to know if anyone has had a similar experience as me? Because when I look at my life I know that the feelings with my girlfriend are so different than anything I've ever felt before. And when I look back I can see that I have fancied women but that I pushed all my emotions and feelings away to create this character because I wanted to be loved so badly.

154,I don't know what's up with my brain,"Hi, I have been diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, Anxiety & Depression for several years. BPD is the newest one. 

I have no idea how to explain this, but I have a negative voice in my head (it's my voice) and I cannot distinguish between 'her' and my genuine thoughts. 

For example; 
I will frequently look at my kids, my parents, my boyfriend and it will say ""I don't love them/you"" 
I just had a baby a year ago and whenever he fusses the voice in my head says ""I hate you"" 
(It happens most frequently with my boyfriend &  kids)
It also disagrees with stupid shit like I'd think ""I'm going to have some water cause it's good for me"" and it will reply with ""no it's not"" lol 

She always tries to convince me of bad things, like for so long until I started showing the voice in my head consistently said I wasn't pregnant. 
She also said once I was showing that I would lose the baby. 
She also confidently told me before all this that I couldn't get pregnant. 

She is definitive and confident. And I am neither of those things...but yet, IT'S ME.

Like honestly, what the fuck. 

It makes me feel like a terrible person and it confuses the hell out of me, because it is MY VOICE saying all these terrible things. 

Do I really not love my children?

155,I‚Äôm doing really well but I‚Äôm scared ,"
I worked my ass of in DBT 2 years ago. My DBT therapist told me that in EIGHT YEARS of doing the program she had never seen anyone bring in a full diary card since week one. Because I was very young they couldn‚Äôt actually diagnose me with BPD but my therapist went through the criteria with me and I met 9/9 to the extreme. 

Before finding out about BPD I felt like I was just crazy I knew there was something more than just anxiety and depression and when I finally found out what BPD was it legitimately saved my life. 

I finally had a word to describe what I was going through I knew it wasn‚Äôt just me I found communities that helped me and told me I‚Äôm not a horrible monster because of my BPD. 

I fought tooth and nail to get the diagnosis of ‚Äúemerging BPD‚Äù and now that I‚Äôm recovering and getting better I‚Äôm scared that if my symptoms do go into remission it‚Äôll be dismissed as ‚Äúteenage hormones‚Äù 

I‚Äôve been out of therapy since May 2023. I‚Äôm living a good life I have two amazing partners that I adore (I‚Äôm polyamorous) and I‚Äôm getting so much better. I still experience the same symptoms I did before but now I have the skills to manage them. 

I‚Äôm scared that if my symptoms go into remission and I no longer meet the criteria for BPD then that means that all the fighting and begging to figure out what was wrong was for nothing. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be dismissed as just a ‚Äúmoody teenager‚Äù in future years. But I‚Äôm not going to let that stop me from recovering.

I was diagnosed with BPD fairly recently. I‚Äôve been dealing with rocky mental health for about 10+ years. I was always told it was just depression and anxiety. I was taking regular medication and while it took the edge off my symptoms they didn‚Äôt ever go away. So I went back to my GP to get some more help.

161,Feeling hopeless,"I just got off the phone with my doctor regarding my diagnosis. I have had around 10 years of therapy (of which three years of CBD) and  several diagnoses (attachment disorder, childhood abuse/neglect, ptsd, adhd, ED,  unspecified personality disorder among other smaller stuff). A lot of these have not been taken seriously or disregarded by other specialists because I was too young, too unstable or the diagnoses were clashing. Which is all valid. but i felt like I am in a calmer and more stable environment so I can get properly diagnosed.

Now they told me that I do seem like I have a high functioning personality disorder that seems to be BPD. BUT. i am too high functioning. they literally told me I seem to have ""beaten"" it already. I am 21 years old, which seems kinda unlikely to me as neither myself nor any of my friends or family think I am mentally healthy enough to go without any diagnosis or treatment and now I am stuck with the diagnosis of reoccurring depression - which in no way explains my extreme mood swings, dissociative episodes and occasional psychotic episodes. Feeling depressed is honestly the least of my worries.

BPD is rooted in both sides of my family and several specialists have told me I do check most of the boxes. I don't know what to do, my FP just left me because I am too difficult and too depressed and dysfunctional for him to handle. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this and I don't know how to get a second opinion (I'm in the UK). In the meantime I am unable to do any uni work and am without a job due to the pandemic and I just spend all day in bed trying to get through the day without making things worse, while my mental health gets worse every day.

My symptoms are fucking up my life so much and I am so done feeling this way and being so dysfunctional all the time and not having any stability regarding the people in my life. I just wanna be normal. I don't wanna drink or get high to not feel anymore, I don't wanna keep isolating myself from the people I care about because I'm scared I'll hurt their feelings or do something that'll end up in them leaving me. I don't wanna be this way I wanna work my way to being somewhat normal, and yet I am ""too high functioning"" to be treated. I feel hopeless and like all this is never gonna go away and I don't know how to keep living this life without any proper help or understanding from my surroundings....

What do I do? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

164,To our supporters woBPD: Thank you.,"If someone you love has BPD & you have taken the time to understand & be patient, thank you. I was diagnosed just under 6 years ago & expected everyone to jump ship at the mention of a personality disorder, & can personally say that without my support system, I would not have made it this long. You make all (& I mean ALL) of the difference.

This diagnosis is scary, & the stereotypes make it much scarier for those looking in. We all know that this is not a cookie-cutter disorder, yet are considered unhinged & dangerous to an extent. People either believe we've got no marbles, we're perpertual babies, or we're constantly on the verge of homicide. It's shitty.

But you guys stuck around. Held us until our bodies relaxed during psychosomatic outbursts, understanding that things can fluctuate & change for us drastically at the drop of a hat - never making us feel bad for saying ""no"" or not being able to handle a situation (or even get out of bed that day), being the ones we feel comfortable to go to when anyone else would dub us as ""crazy"", reminding us that we have no reason to apologize & that if the tables were turned we'd approach them with nothing but love, thus we deserve the same. Without that, I would have given up.

Sorry for the word vomit, my best friend just made me cry (by being so supportive, if ya can't tell), & I'm just still amazed that everyone still loves me & is still so patient & understanding. So, I wanted to thank the whole lot of ya who are doing the same for their loved ones.

You guys are so very important, so vital for us & recieving this unconditional love that we, at times, don't believe we deserve, is truly priceless.

165,Few questions,"Hello. I don't really know how to do an introduction.
About 1.5 years ago I was diagnosed with bpd. 
I am currently 23 years old.
Along with bpd I was diagnosed with (after 3 years of therapy.) PTSD, ADHD (combined presentation - what ever that means), persistent depression disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, undifferentiated dissociative disorder.
Something I really struggle with is never seeming to know how I feel towards something. Unless it's anger.
For example
I got married when I was 19. After all of the abusive relationships, I was done. So I ended up marrying the guy who helped me realize that my previous relationship was not healthy.
But now, I'm 23, and I just sometimes feel empty towards him. Like I care about him a lot. But I feel like I don't know myself so I feel so mixed on my emotions on whether I love him or not. Did I marry him because I'm terrified of being alone? Or do I actually love him? But I disassociate myself from my emotions so often that I feel numb half the time. 
I've been doing this for so many years that I almost don't know how to allow myself to feel, unless it's a very strong emotion, like angry or sad. But everything else feels nonexistent. 
So how do you know if your feelings are true? And is this even bpd? Or maybe a mix?

166,1am wake up thoughts,"F 25. Just woke up and I have been uncontrollably crying. I was diagnosed with BPD around a year ago and have been in therapy since. Various shitty things in life have happened to me, but my first trauma came from my dad (shock!) when he abandoned myself (8 at the time) my older sister and mum for a 21 year old woman. This absolutely broke my mum, she was severely depressed and from this age until I was 15/16 I was always scared she might end her life. My sister became rebellious due to trauma, but I went the other way and hid everything else going on in my life to try and protect my mum from feeling guilty as I don‚Äôt blame her at all and she did her best. The issue is that this trauma response of hiding things that I‚Äôm going through has made further issues with things that have happened to me e.g. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone when I was being bullied at school because I didn‚Äôt want them to worry, I didn‚Äôt tell them I was self harming at 13 etc and it was never noticed, being groomed online, covered up that my partner was abusing me for 5 years. My mum says to me that she thinks I have BPD due to my abusive relationship. I wish I could tell her everything else but I worry she would blame herself, when the person I blame is my dad for leaving us and not giving a shit, to then have another child and he is a good dad to him. Why did I never get that ? Since then I have had a strained relationship with my dad. We currently speak only about once a month though. When I was in my abusive relationship (ages 18 to 23) my dad cut me off unless I ended it and this also created a lot of trauma for me. I‚Äôm now in a situation where I feel that maybe I should say something to them. Or just my dad. Or I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to keep carrying this pain alone. I just want my dad to be sorry and take responsibility for the trauma he gave me. Not sure if even attempting to see if he will do this will just give me more issues.

So I have not been medically diagnosed with BPD but I have GAD, OCD, autism, and depression and all of which have made things very hard. 

Recently I‚Äôve been struggling with some very complex emotions and mental struggle including obsessive thoughts about my therapist. How every it feels slightly different to ocd. I get these thoughts where I over analyze and find a problem with the things she does (wears, behaviors, etc.) it has caused me to feel like a horrible person. And no matter how much cognitive reframing I do it won‚Äôt stop. My brain won‚Äôt listen to any logic or rationale. I end up checking her Facebook and pretty much every other thing online of her multiple times a day. I feel as if I NEED to know more about her. Sometimes I just have this feeling like somethings off and I relate it to her. And over all it makes me feel like a creep and a horrible person. Especially since she is basically the sweetest person I know, and has helped me so much, and always been there for me

I though originally this may have been more tied to my OCD, but after doing some research I think I may need to ask my psychiatrist about bpd.

1: (I do not believe she is a bad person for this. No one is perfect) Due to my wife's experience with her parents, she developed a more narcissistic mind to cope with the situation.

179,need some insight,"TW some ED and SH and S**cide mentions

So basically rn I'm 16. About 3 years ago I started having problems with depression and anxiety due to many factors including a huge move overseas and some serious cyber bullying from people close to me. With lockdown happening not much later everything because worst especially with the isolation and all that. I also did start having social media and pretty quickly got into the ""quirky depression"" side of tiktok but soon removed the app because I realised how stupid it was. 

Then the depression got pretty bad and it got to the point where I would sleep at 5 am everyday after spending hours in my bed doing nothing bit literally just crying. Sorry if I'm skipping things or not explaining properly I'm not very good with explaining. Also later on the suicidal thoughts were very frequent and for a few months they were very hard to get out of my head. 

I also started developing ED symptoms. It started with just running outdoors during lockdown which was allowed. After a while I would run up to 2hours a day. Then I switched to cycling which progressed to 4 hours a day. And finally I started obsessing over calories and the worst it got was 500 cals a day plus hours of cycling. I had a lot of free time as It was the summer holiday during the first lock down. My parents didn't mind me going out and stuff too. Just what was allowed.

After around 2 months of this I travelled for a while to go on holiday and slowly let go of most of the extreme ed behaviours. The depression didn't get better tho. 

Then a few months later I started have problems with severe anxiety. I got anxiety tics, unexplainable panic attacks and even a couple of short attacks that were later labelled as anxiety induced mania attacks. That was likely triggered due to the return of school and exams and all that. Also during that time my dad got diagnosed with cancer. At first they thought it was terminal and he had a few months but the diagnosis changed and thankfully he got treated and became cancer free about 8 months later. That period was pretty hard tho especially due to the caution we had to take as my dad didn't have any immunity and he because quite aggressive due to the effects of chemo and other medication. He still had problems with it but I can't say it's his fault. 

During that time I also struggles with SH and have problems with skin picking and some intrusive thoughts which I think is related to anxiety. 

Anyway lately the depression hasn't been too bad but I still have problems with anxiety and now the worst thing is anger problems. I would be fine but out of no where have a rage episode about stupid things. In the last 2 weeks I had like 3 extreme episodes leading to big family fights and I got to levels of crazy anger. I literally couldn't calm down except for when I started punching myself really hard. That left me with a few bruises. Also I started going to the gym a few weeks ago to help release that anger but idk it didn't help stop those anger episodes. This is really starting to bother me because idk how to stop them and i later I realise how stupid the trigger was and honestly I don't want to be another thing my parents have to add to their list Of worries. 

Anyway sorry this ended up being kind of a vent. But I wanted to ask for tips on how to manage the anger. 
Also I went into a great depth because I wanted to ask if it's worth looking into me possibly having BPD. I've been researching for around 2 years now because I just relate with a lot of the symptoms. I'm not diagnosing myself obv I just want to find the right help. Ik I'm under 18 so it's not easy to diagnose it but is it worth asking to be checked for it ? Also my grandad has it.

184,BPD Podcast,"Hey all!

This is my first reddit experience (bum bum baaaahhhh!)! I was diagnosed with BPD about two years ago, underwent DBT therapy for about a year and have been working very, very hard to work the skills-- to find that ""life worth living"" they're talking about. The transformation has been amazing to my day-to-day life, by no means is life perfect, or am I recovered. But holy shit, I can mostly functional again, and taking these little steps is giving me hope through the challenges for the first time in a long time. 

I'm a fortunate lady, not everybody is lucky enough to get diagnosed, much less, to wrack up their credit debt to get to go to therapy. I want to share my personal experiences because what I found in group-therapy was people didn't understand the skills in a real-life scenario. It all made sense in group but the practical application piece was missing. Our dear leader had examples that frankly were a little soft while we were all living the extreme version of it- which felt invalidating in itself. So I'd really like to share my stories, share the skills, and help others feel better-- if only it helps to hear they're not alone.

I've come up with a few episodes that are ready to record-- being based off what I've struggled with most and the skills that have most impacted my life. BUT I'd really like to hear what you all struggle with the most and hear your success stories of how skills have helped you! If you care to comment, I'd really like to hear where you're at.

I‚Äôve always had problems with friendships ever since I was back in school and I can‚Äôt keep friends in my life at all unless I keep them constantly at an arms length. I also find it really hard to apologise to people when I know I‚Äôm wrong, I cannot tell them I‚Äôm sorry unless I stop splitting. Something happened recently where my friend told me I was being mean to her and I get I was being mean. I was very overstimulated and annoyed (I‚Äôm also diagnosed ADHD) at everyone so I think I started taking it out on her and then she went on to tell me that I‚Äôm never there for her and that I need serious help with my friendships because I hurt her and etc because I wouldn‚Äôt apologise to her when she told me that she was hurt, I just kept on trying to defend myself and not take accountability for what I did. And I love her a lot she‚Äôs a good friend of mine but I don‚Äôt think she understands what my issue is but I also don‚Äôt think it would make sense to use that as an excuse. She also lives in the same area as I do so it‚Äôs kinda hard to avoid her, I just blocked her from social media because I don‚Äôt think I want to be friends with her at this current moment especially when I am annoyed and I don‚Äôt like being around her. I don‚Äôt know what to do. My other friend is also mad at me because of this situation and it really sucks because she wasn‚Äôt involved in the first place but the friend I had a problem with went and told her about it and then I went on a tangent saying that they are sitting around and talking shit about me and they all hate me and don‚Äôt wanna be friends with me.

186,i have a intellectual disability and can fully relate to the pain and struggle of BPD.,"I don't mean this by insinuating intelligence of my disorder is somehow higher than yours, in fact this solely on behaviour. my IQ was tested last year as under 58, i won't give you a full score however but my verbal IQ was somewhere around 80 which i may seem like my intelligence is average by my typing skills.

also when ''normal'' people say they know how you feel i can see through their bs, and its infuriating when someone says ''oh i have those traits too, i get it'', it is upsetting.

I can highly relate to the BPD quotes such as ''its like having 3rd degree burns emotionally''.

The injurious, impulsive behavior, the extreme anger to small situations, the idealzing, devaluing, and even becoming so attached to a person so easily, and even outbursts, i can all relate to.

I don't know if i also meet a dual diagnosis but this post is solely me seeaying i can relate to you!

i'm disabled, and my world view is unique just like the view of BPD affected people.

i don't know if it just happens that the people with BPD i met had a dual disability, but there is a similarity, my psychiatrist also said they were relunctant to diagnose me with the disorder, as an intellectual disability can cause pretty much the same behaviours.

191,Am I evil ?,"22 F. Diagnosed at 17. 

I act out. Irrationally. Violently when I‚Äôm super angry. I‚Äôve threatened people. Said such foul horrendous things to people. Used their insecurities and fears and personal history against them. Gaslight them. Said mean things to make them cry and feel small. 

It‚Äôs gotten way less since I stopped drinking; and mostly seems to be triggered by romantic interpersonal relationships. I was emotionally, verbally & physically abusive to my last two exes. 

I was angry at a guy I was recently involved with and was kinda holding it in acting like everything is okay. Then he came over and he tried to take my vape and I told him give it back and he didn‚Äôt and I tried to get it from him and I think he thought we were play fighting but I was  kinda irritated and when he wouldn‚Äôt let it go I bit him. So hard and it scared me how instinctive it was to hurt him. 


But recently I acted out and I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm just inherently bad, or evil. 
I showed up at someone‚Äôs house cause I was angry that they‚Äôd said something about me behind my back . I didn‚Äôt do anything physical but I sent horrible messages. But my friend who tried to stop me ended up getting into a fight with one of the girls there and I know that the altercation wouldn‚Äôt have happened if I didn‚Äôt act irrationally and go there.  And now my friend is in trouble with our institution. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm like this. Sometimes I‚Äôm just mean/attitude to people, and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the moment I know I‚Äôm giving an attitude and I don‚Äôt know why! Like I‚Äôll make small little comments that are mean. I hate that I‚Äôm like this. I wish I could be nice naturally and I didn‚Äôt have to try. I wish I wasn‚Äôt evil 

I‚Äôm in therapy but I‚Äôm scared. Cause even with my first ex I was in therapy and thought I‚Äôd change but I didn‚Äôt in my next relationship I was the same. 

& now recently having acted out in a friendship situation I‚Äôm scared.

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm just evil and gonna keep hurting people. What if I don‚Äôt really have BPD, or CPTSD and I‚Äôm just actually a shitty person 

The shame and guilt eats me and it makes me anxious thinking about the ways I‚Äôve probably made people feel. 
Then I just start feeling like maybe it‚Äôd all be better if I wasn‚Äôt here. 

Idk I don‚Äôt know what this is but I feel like I‚Äôm a shame to the BPD community.
Cause how can I know what this feels like and act that way towards others . 

And in the moment it‚Äôs like I know it‚Äôs wrong but I can‚Äôt help it and that makes me feel sick and depraved. 

I heard narcissistic personality and BPD are similar. What if I‚Äôm just a narcissist? 

My mum once told me that I was a manipulative spiteful and ungrateful child; and maybe that wasn‚Äôt traumatic. What if she was just actually saying the truth. 

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm gonna hurt everyone.

I was around 15/16 when I was first diagnosed with BPD and transferred to a specialist. I've been coping alright since (I am now 18), and l'd thought I improved quite a lot, however as of late l've noticed that l've fallen back into old habits and rather detrimental thought patterns. I've been especially disregulated the past few months, undoubtably provoked by a relapse in my disordered eating. Right now, my emotions have plateaued, and I'm able to think critically about my situation with a clear mind, so I'll use that as an opportunity to reach out and make some progress.

I'm operating under the assumption that my restrictive food intake has been the stressor triggering my states of emotional disfunction, however my ED is a seperate problem that runs so deep that it would be very difficult to just 'stop‚Äô. Because I'm not able to remove the trigger, I'm looking for ways to manage the resultant emotional tailspin.

Yesterday was definitely one of the worst yet - my head was clouded with blatantly untrue thoughts about my family and relationships which pushed me further down the pit of self isolation. Despite being in an objectively good place in life, l'd convinced myself there was no future for me and I had nothing to live for. That was probably the closest l'd been to actually going through with my plans to end my life since my last attempt in early 2023. A few hours pass, I listen to some music, and I feel fantastic. Super productive, I'm on top of the world and nobody can stop me. It's exhausting being stuck in this cycle of utter despair and what I can only describe as borderline narcissism. It feels like my brain is split in two, and I just can't seem to get that horrible part of me ur control. It's a constant battle between critical thinking and utter delusion. 

My friends, family and therapists are fantastic, but as bystanders they can only do so much. I have EMDR booked for the end of the year, but in the interim I need to lock in and really commit to my personal development. My question is, does anyone have any coping mechanisms/ self-help that genuinely worked for them? I don't care how niche or odd it may be, I just want some advice that isn't ""read a book"" or ""go on a walk"" - not that these aren't valid control strategies, it's just difficult to convince your mind to go on a walk when you're consumed by hopelessness.

I want to get better. I cannot keep living like this, it's hurting the people I love and corrupting my mind. So, please let me know what helped you. Anything is appreciated.

202,issues with therapist,"short backstory: I searched for the right therapist for about 2 years, went through 10+ professionals before I started therapy in January 2022 with a new therapist. I was seeking help for codependency in my relationship and suspected I had BPD. My therapist did an assessment and quickly diagnosed me. I saw her for 8 months and right away she was my favorite therapist I‚Äôve ever had. We both cried on my last session. She moved on to a different job, but I would have seen her for years if I could have. She referred me to the therapist that I‚Äôve been seeing for 4.5 months.

204,Prognosis?,"Hi all. My wife is suspected of having bpd. Sorry, no formal diagnosis I know of. But my suspicions come initially from her sister who has psych background, and the pieces fit. Sorry if that's not allowed here. 

I don't demonize her. I love her so much. But her mental stability went down really quickly a few months ago and she has made terrible, and abusive, choices that she does not take ownership. Affairs, including one with a former inmate at the prison she works at, she physically assaulted me on one occasion, threats of violence or killing me, ended up in the psych unit for suicidal ideation after holding a knife to her throat, and tons of gaslighting and projection. It's been impossible to see the person I love become this in front of me.

She had tendencies before, but she was stable. We have 4 small kids. We had such a good life. She refused to stop cheating, and I told her we couldn't be married if she didn't want to work on our relationship and was pursuing others. I wasn't perfect either, I have my issues, but I never swore at her, I never yelled, I never was physical to her or even objects. I tried validating her emotional reality and being there. She didn't feel it. Were getting divorced. She didn't even argue with me on me taking primary custody. 

She recognizes her traumatic background and that she has responses to those things. She wants therapy. She doesn't take any accountability for her choices. From all of her friends, who tried everything from tough love to expressing worry gently, she told them she didn't feel they loved her if they wouldn't agree with her on all of her decisions. 

I just want to know if anyone has any insight into what things might look like going forward for her. She isn't well. I doubt she'll be able to maintain our house on her budget even. She's been rude and challenging and abrasive in the meantime. Is she going to be able to be diagnosed and accept it? For her own sake is she going to be able to heal? My only other encounter with bpd is her mother, who never got help, and she is a confused old lady wandering around in a fog these days. I'm terrified that is what will become of my wife. Hope has burned me so much these months, but I need to know if it's likely she can get better. I'd like her to come back and heal together, but even if she won't do that I want her to grow and be whole for her own sake. Is there hope?

207,What is the most effective way to help my partner when her feelings of rejection overwhelm her?,"I (34f) have been with my partner (33f) for 15 years. She was diagnosed with BPD late last year after months of pretty intense self-sabotage. One of her core struggles is intense feelings of social rejection and not being liked. She's working through self-help stuff as best she can right now and is on a waiting list for DBT. 

I want to support her as best I can but I'm really struggling with what to do when her feelings of rejection sensitivity get really bad. Before, it felt like I could talk to her and reality test her thoughts and she'd be able to listen and calm down. But lately, social rejection seems to send her spiralling and every day feels like a potential crisis. She has a strained relationship with her best friend rn due to her own actions and is taking it really hard. She sees rejection in every small social slight, and when actual rejection happens (like being left out of people's plans or a group chat she's not in) she's so heartbroken. It's gotten so bad that nothing I say can break through the idea that everyone hates her and is actively avoiding her. I just don't know what to do to help her in those moments, and she doesn't know what she needs in those moments either.

I'm now realizing that I can't reality test those thoughts for her, that she needs to do this herself. But I love her and it breaks my heart to see her like that and hear her say how obvious it is that everyone hates her. When she's regulated, she can think through it and has been trying so hard to work on feelings of rejection but when rejection happens, she can only operate from that really wounded place and becomes inconsolable. Tonight I left when she started her spiral, reassuring her that I love her and hope she feels better soon but I don't know whether that has helped or hurt. 

We've struggled with codependency in the past and have worked to overcome it so I'm just mindful of my own boundaries too. It's so tiring and upsetting to hear her say these things, and she becomes so prickly towards me when I try to comfort her. We are having a lot of relationship upheaval right now too, so I'm not the most stable from an emotional perspective. I just want to help her as best I can, while projecting my own mental health as well and would massively appreciate some advice.

I thought that maybe others with BPD might know what has helped them manage rejection feelings, and what kinds of things helps from a loved one in moments like these? Should I be trying to help her reality test? Should I leave the room or stay with her?

209,I need some sexual healing,"I was diagnosed with bpd In 2020 but sex was never discussed in therapy. A big reason for this is the shame and embarrassment that I feel surrounding my sexuality (another reason is that I was only given a children‚Äôs book to explain my condition) therefore I have been struggling in silence for years.
I am F21 and I have slept with over 70 people. Most of these are 1 night stands from after night outs (I blackout every-time I drink alcohol and end up in someone‚Äôs bed the next day). The next day I also feel sick and hate myself. I know that people with bpd sometimes have false narratives in their head but I truly believe that no would could love me if they knew how many people I had slept with they would immediately leave. I think this is reasonable to presume especially because I am a woman. 
Even though I hate myself after I sleep with someone and I tell myself I don‚Äôt want to sleep with anyone whenever I leave the house and am in any social environment I find myself sizing everyone up deciding how attractive I am compared to others and who I could fuck. I‚Äôm in my 1st year at university as a mature student and I have been isolating myself because I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll go out and embarrass myself but even now I sometimes get an intense desire to just drop my life and do porn.

When I am having sex I can only get off if I tell myself that they don‚Äôt care about me and I‚Äôm being used.

210,Dealing with grief and bpd,"Sorry in advance for the longish post. 

When I was 16, I met this boy and we started dating fairly quickly. I had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety already, but not anything else. Me and this boy had a really crazy relationship over the course of 3 1/2 years that created a lot of trauma for me. We were each other‚Äôs first everything, including first love. He cheated on me for 8 months of the first year we were together, then we broke up and were on and off for the remaining 2 1/2 years through highschool and through my first year of college. During this time, we slowly went back and forth, arguing and being awful to each other, then blocking each other, but not spending more than a month before unblocking each other. There were also a lot of problems with our families, with my parents absolutely hating him and ‚Äúbanning‚Äù him from being with me and his family hating mine but loving me. 
I developed a horrible relationship with sex during this time, as me and his relationship began to revolve around sex. we would use it to heal everything, and we also would hookup with many other people while remaining possessive of each other. horrible i know, but we would cheat on other partners with each other constantly. We simply could not leave each other alone. when we were mad, i would turn to social media and tell everyone what he was putting me through. then we would just get back together. 
I could go on forever and ever about how awful it was, but the main point is my freshman year of college, it got especially bad. we got back together two days before i moved states away to college, and he was absolutely horrible to me. I was also manic (though i didn‚Äôt know at the time bc i hadn‚Äôt been diagnosed) and was constantly paranoid he was lying and cheating like he had done to me for years. eventually he just broke up with me and i spiraled. i ended up in the hospital because i realized i was severely depressed and then when i got out he told me he hadn‚Äôt felt anything for me in years and that devastated me. skip to thanksgiving and he‚Äôs hooking up with me again. then he drops me, and i get mad. i‚Äôve never been good about meds, and i wasn‚Äôt taking them again. so i got with his bestfriend. me and his bestfriend start a relationship then months go by and i ignore my first love asking to meet up and talk it out, and then bestfriend screws me over too. so i tell my first love about the whole thing out of spite. 
about 4 months after that, he died at 19 after being hit by a semi truck while he was working on his car on the side of the road. His family allowed me to see the open casket with them before the viewing and the funeral, but i wasn‚Äôt allowed at the funeral.

\-

For those of us who grew up in invalidating environments, our realities and experiences were often denied. This may have looked like a caregiver telling us to ‚Äústop being so sensitive‚Äù or saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù. As children we learn that we can not trust our own internal experiences and this sense of distrust within ourselves remains with us in adulthood. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, this feeling intensified as I started to question whether my reactions were valid or if it was my ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù. This was harmful because I began justifying other people‚Äôs toxic behaviours and using my diagnosis as an excuse to justify & rationalise my own unhealthy behaviours. Having my personality labelled as ‚Äúdisordered‚Äù reinforced my self-distrust.

Now when I experience intense emotional reactions, rather than telling myself ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my BPD talking‚Äù and dismissing my experience-

* I remind myself that my emotions are always valid. (This doesn‚Äôt mean that my actions are always okay).
* I give myself time and space to feel calmer, which may involve going on a walk, taking a shower or journalling.
* When I‚Äôm feeling calmer, which can sometimes take days, I take the time to think about the situation from different perspectives and come to a wise mind conclusion or decision (this is easier said than done and has taken lots and lots of practice).
* I also remind myself that sometimes I won‚Äôt have an answer, make the right decision or do the thing that‚Äôs most helpful, and that‚Äôs okay. I am still human, I will make mistakes and that‚Äôs okay.

When we practice putting space between our big feelings and our reactions, and take the time to try and look at all sides of a situation, the message we send ourselves is ‚ÄúI trust myself and my ability to handle difficult situations‚Äù. This practice can help us move towards repairing the relationship we have with ourselves and our inner world.",1681900119.0,False,37,9,Jembaby24,None,12rolri,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/12rolri/is_it_me_or_bpd/
216,I have kids and I don't regret it,"I see a lot of people who suffer from BPD saying they never want to have children and don't get me wrong this is PERFECTLY fine.

It is their choice and I'm happy for them that they are aware that it is not for them.

I also see a lot of people who's parent(s) was diagnosed with BPD and they suffered from their parent's disorder, their mood swings and unstable relationships. 

I just want to say that first off, having BPD does not always mean having narcissist personality disorder, and while they can occur together, they're not synonyms (it seems like a common misconception).

It also seems like a lot of people think that those with BPD should never have kids. I personally disagree. 

I was diagnosed with BPD a few months ago, after thinking I might have it for about 7 years. When I got the diagnosis, I got worried for my two kids.

But you know what? After talking with the mental health counselor (who put me on the waiting list for BPD group therapy), I realized that I am extremely aware of my symptoms, and because of that, I can offer a good environment for my kids to grow up in. 

Per example, yes, I tend to act recklessly, but I never ever put my children in danger or even expose them to what I do. 

I have crazy spending habits, but I found people who I trust to not be judgy, to mentor me financially.

I am just way too aware of my symptoms to let them affect my kids. I am not saying it NEVER happened or it never will, but I feel like I am getting better at controlling my mood swings (let's say putting them in the corner of my brain, and then letting the emotions out once the kids are at daycare). Let me also say that anger is not that much of a problem for me (I am very good at repressing this one).

I would not say I am recovered, since I just got the diagnosis recently, but if you consider how far I came from, then I am definetly on my way and optimistic for the future.

Right now, I am working on my relationship with food (hello going from binge-eating to restricting wildly every few months) and productivity, self-discipline when it comes to getting a degree.

Anyways. I just hope that this post helps someone in some way, maybe someone who hopes to recover and one day have children.

Don't take me wrong - BPD is still part of my life, but life is *in order* now.  

Here's the trick - although I managed to gain distress tolerance skills, improved interpersonal communication, managing emotions etc - disturbed identity is something that I can't 'fix' yet.

I keep questioning where's me and where's the disorder, and it seems like the most difficult part of my recovery. This is one of the reasons why I am hesitant about getting into a new romantic relationship - I am scared that because I sometimes don't know what I want/need, this won't be healthy.

I'm starting to suspect that this is something that I cannot force and it will take years of life without BPD turmoil before I start feeling more 'solid'.

If you have been through something like that, I would like to hear your thoughts :)",1630167589.0,False,20,10,hydraangea,None,pdcsnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/pdcsnk/question_to_those_who_are_recovering_from_bpd_how/
218,does anyone else feel 'normal' when not in relationships?,"I was diagnosed with BPD about 2 years ago now. I becamw a disgusting person who had angry outbursts which destroyed my relationship with my ex fianc√© and left me a wreck. 

Fast forward 8 months since my ex and i finally properly broke up for good, and i feel kind of 'normal'.

I still notice my desire to have unhealthy attachment to others, i chameleon, my intense reactions to perceived rejections, but because i don't really have a close relationship with anyone i don't blow up at all and it almost feels as if i don't have BPD. 

But i know i do. I feel it under the surface, just waiting to come out in a new relationship.  

Does anyone else feel like this? And does anyone have any advice on how to handle talking with new partners about BPD and how it impacted the way we acted, without seeming like escaping responsibility for our actions? I'm terrified of having to explain why my relationship broke down, that as soon as my new partner finds out that i had violent uncontrollable emotional outbursts I'll be rejected and outed as a danger to women or something.  

I never asked to be this way. I don't understand what happened. I was fine and then one day after we got engaged i just melted down and everr since then I've been fallen apart.

Idw to be alone forever but i also don't want to be treated like scum of the earth. I never wanted any of this. 

So when i feel almost free of BPD it gives me hope, but it also scares me that it only really fully comes out for me though really intense relationships.",1666038771.0,False,34,3,miggins1610,None,y6ltyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/y6ltyx/does_anyone_else_feel_normal_when_not_in/
219,UCSC podcast about BPD! (Looking for participants),"I am looking for:  
people with BPD who are self-aware, even if they always don't know who they are  
storytellers, journalers, and/or poets who are willing to share stories of family, love, identity, loss, and recovery  
people who want to reach across the Earth to other people who feel empty and alone to offer some relatable stories and/or survival tips

I've been diagnosed for five years now and throughout my healing process, all I've seen are books written by people without direct experience explaining how to *tolerate* rather than **understand** people with BPD. **I want to make something just for us**. I want to humanize people with BPD. Storytelling is the original meme!

I will write you back and we can talk about your idea, story, poem, song, etc. that you've submitted and what involvement you feel comfortable with.

220,Do you guys think that talking your emotions out is ineffective?,"I recently came to terms that I have BPD. I started working with a new therapist last week and she was debating whether or not I have it. I'm pretty sure I do. Whenever I've come across something BPD related online I'd relate to it, and the more I research it the more I relate.

Anyway, I wanted to know if people here related to something I've experienced. I've always been told that I should talk about my issues with a friend. Specifically, I had a guy who would always tell me that ""a problem shared is a problem halved"". That hasn't been the case for me. It rarely helps when I talk about my emotions, especially if I'm just venting. It's like my emotions are an immovable wall that can only be changed by another immovable wall smashing on top of it.

I guess that's the main point of this post. Do other people relate to this or do you find that a problem shared is a problem halved?

Ok, now for some extra stuff.

I was in rehab for a month and I had a therapy session with my FP (I feel weird using that term when I haven't been officially diagnosed, but that's the best way I can describe it). I tried venting to him about an issue we shared thinking that he could help me. I was a huge emotional mess. He then ghosted me for a few days. Eventually, he answered my call and told me that he needed space. About two weeks later, with the encouragement of my therapist, I invited him to join in on a family session. During the session, he lamented about how hard it was on him when I vented. I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he said that it was hard on him because he couldn't get me out of my hole of self pity. I've come to the conclusion that I shouldn't talk with someone who isn't my therapist about my emotions because it'll put stress on the person I'm talking to. But it's hard to keep the emotions inside except for one day out of the week. I want to talk to people, but how can I do that when it causes people pain? Does anyone have any tips on this?

221,realization,I was diagnosed with BPD about 5 years ago during an inpatient admission. At the time I was like this psychiatrist is nuts I don't have that. I stopped going to counseling and convinced my primary care to prescribe my meds.  It something I've pushed to the back of my mind for years. Lately its come to surface. My girlfriend is a social worker and has been reading I hate you don't leave me for her BPD patients. I can relate to every trait....every single one. I feel like I should have faced reality 5 years ago when I was dx instead of running away and pretending I don't have the diagnosis. I hate talking to people. I keep to myself and just deal.

222,Managing irrational anger,"DAE deal with bouts of crazy irrational anger directed at a random person for some tiny reason your brain spun into a giant story? 

I am sure some of y‚Äôall do because you have bpd too- I was diagnosed later in life- also I‚Äôm almost 2 years sober which has helped reduce my self harm & reckless displays of anger or suicidal ideation. But sometimes I‚Äôm having a really nice day and I feel like my trust issues are improving and then I have some little interaction with some person, that to a non-BPD would seem pretty harmless and inconsequential and yet for me I am filled with a fiery rage, and I want to like scream in that person‚Äòs face and say the meanest shit that I can think of. Then my voice of reason is trying to reign me in and tell me not to do it, and luckily later in life my voice of reason usually wins the battle. But even experiencing this intense and miss placed anger is stressful and also fills me with shame. I‚Äôm curious how other people deal with it, and specifically, if you deal with feeling like you project a lot of anger on to one person for a stupid reason. Because it seems really hard to find people who relate to this, but maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm asking non-cluster bs",1647220018.0,False,6,5,CodeRound4851,None,tdlg7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/tdlg7w/managing_irrational_anger/
223,What works best for you?,"Hi all!

I have been on the long and exhausting journey of finding the right medication combo for the side effects of my BPD. I am also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder w/ Agoraphobia, and PTSD. But, I believe my Borderline is the biggest disruption, as it triggers all of my other disorders.

I have huge abandonment issues, causing me to feel like it's next to impossible to let go of people, ideas, irrational thoughts, etc.). My irritability is moderate. My depression is severe, it comes with suicidal ideations. Lastly, my anxiety is on and off, but when it's bad, it is debilitating.

I am currently on Prozac 20mg x1, Hydroxyzine 50mg x3, Clonidine .02mg x3, Trazodone 100mg x1, Zofran 4mg xAs needed, and Adderall 30mg XR x1.

I have tried numerous other medications, but my med management has been a mess since August 2020. I have been put on and taken off so many medications, I am not sure what has made things worse or helped out (even though, I don't feel like I have been stable since March 2020).
