0,I can feel my medicine working!,"It’s working! I’ve finally found a good mix of meds that are having a major impact on my mood and stability. Everyday before this I was so angry and depressed and suicidal. Every single day. Now, I wake up, and I don’t even think about it. I just go on with my day. Of course I have a few moments here and there where my emotions rise, but that’s normal. I can control them. I don’t feel like the embodiment of depression and despair and anger anymore. I can feel them, and let them go. It’s crazy. I’m so happy. 

Meds are Lamotrigine 150mg and Lexapro 10mg if anyone is curious. I’m also a few weeks into my DBT group therapy as well. ",1716154128.0,False,1,0,BoggsOfRoggs,None,1cvywf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1cvywf7/i_can_feel_my_medicine_working/
1,Is weed a medicine for my emptiness or a crutch?,"When I realized I had BPD, it came as a relief to be able to give a name to the subtle wrong feeling I've always lived with: emptiness. Not quite depression, not quite anger. An absence of contentment and in it's place uncomfortable uncertainty. Waking up and my first thought of the day being ""did I do something wrong yesterday?"" 

I don't always feel this way. Sometimes, when things are going really well or I receive praise or have sex or good luck I feel all the good feelings. I enjoy these times but I no longer trust the feelings. They are a great natural high, probably the best high, and like all highs they don't last.

But I can bring the good feelings back anytime I want, with weed. Take me at my emptiest: give me some bad news on a day when I am already full of emptiness and I'll be a despondent mess, unable to smile, seeking isolation, crying and wanting to be asleep. I smoke some weed and voila, I'm back baby, all grins, improvised songs, making bids for the attention of my loved ones, giving back rubs, eventually falling into deep untroubled sleep in my bed, relaxed, comfortable as I've ever been.

""Why are you such a pothead"" I've been asked many times over the years and I've never known how to answer. Dunno, I like to get high I guess? ""Can you even go a day without your weed?"" ""Why do you have to be high all the time?"" These assholes questions throw shade, imply a weakness, a lack of self control, a tendency for escapism. I'm not weak, and I have decent self control. But yes, I do like to escape the goddamn emptiness because I want to live rather than cry.

The assholes have a point though. Weed has side effects that make it unsuitable for use all the time. If I use it during the day I become less productive and too inwardly focused, less interested in other people, happy but dumb. 

I have a busy life, a family and a job, volunteer work, home renos to do, appointments to get to, and I can't be dumb during the day when all my responsibilities need tending to. So years ago I settled on the routine of waiting until the evening to indulge. Although I may have felt emptiness during the busy day, I could always look forward to collapsing into comfort for an hour or two before a delicious sleep. 

It's not a perfect system because I still need to endure the emptiness throughout the day. And there are still side effects from the weed, like hazy memory, and difficulty waking up at 5:30am when I like to go to the gym.

And I also wonder if my regular weed use contributes to the emotional disregulation I feel as a person with BPD. Weed has been part of my life for so long, I can't clearly remember what I'm like without it.

So there are more than enough reasons to quit weed, at least for awhile. And I have tried to do this, many many times, and yet I keep coming back to it. 

The last time I took a break from weed was a few years back. The break was about three months long. I was proud of myself for being able to put it down and I even started to wonder why I used to do it every day. I felt a sense of freedom from having to go through the same rituals every day. 

The evenings were hard. I found myself craving some kind of special treat and ended up drinking alcohol more often. I found the best way to cope with evening emptiness was to throw myself into creative projects. As long as my hands were busy I was usually distracted from the emptiness until bedtime. I had to keep moving. I was more productive. I had a harder time sitting still.

Maybe one day some a pharmaceutical company will make a drug that contains the parts of weed that combat emptiness, without the side effects. 

I would love to hear from others with BPD. Has weed been helpful and does it have side effects?",1680373379.0,False,10,14,bpdlearnerburner,None,128ubhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/128ubhw/is_weed_a_medicine_for_my_emptiness_or_a_crutch/

4,I have been looking for a counselor or something affordable even something online? Can someone help?,"I have literally been looking for a psychologist for a year. I kept going to different ones and all they wanted to know is what medicine I wanted. I didn't know I had to make 2 appointments, one for medicine and one for talk therapy. It's expensive! $50 a pop. Now, everyone has too many patients and/or doesn't do DBT therapy or that other one CT.. whatever. I have rid myself of all toxic people and stopped drinking. I almost killed myself a few weeks ago by overdosing on antidepressants. I just wanted to sleep. I was offered a job as an assistant manager after being a temp for 5 days and freaked out. I was competing with an old lady that was a friend and had no other way to make money. I can't keep a job. I am smart as crap, but I worry about others too much and it bothers my heart. My attention span is crap! I got off my ADHD medicine over a year ago, so my follow-through is terrible. My self-confidence is crap. What do you all do when you need someone to talk to?

5,Two victories.,"I’ve had to big victories in my recovery over these last few months. First, I’ve been able to go down 25mg on my depression medicine. I know some people think 25mg isn’t much a dosage  change but it is when you suffer with moderate major depression disorder. Saturday will mark two weeks since I went down to the new dose. So far, I’m still stable. 

The second victory is I asked my therapist, if she was agreeable, to going to visits once every three weeks instead of every two weeks. She said she was totally okay with that. I never thought either of those things would happen. But they are! It’s a strange but an exciting feeling knowing how far I’ve come in my recovery.",1614692552.0,False,10,2,gooseglug,None,lw280a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/lw280a/two_victories/

7,abilify and bpd,"ive been taking lexapro for about six months now. three months ago i got updosed to 20 mg. definitely helped with the daily depression i was dealing with, but brought up all of the bpd symptoms that were hiding underneath. my doctor prescribed me abilify (5 mgs) with a reduced dose of lexapro (was 20 mg now back to 10mg) and to be honest im so scared!!! 

taking prescription meds already makes me feel uneasy, and ive been reading some scary things about it. i took the 5 mg last night and had a hard time falling asleep, and when i did i abruptly woke up with heavy nausea, to the point where i literally thought i was going to vomit, blurry vision, and tossing and turning. i didnt get much sleep and when i woke in the morning for work the world felt very dreamlike. 

so im here to ask: is it worth it? my motivation and energy for life is completely gone and even though im not sad everyday anymore, the mood swings and intrusive thoughts are consuming me, im willing to work out the kinks of a new med. 

i know bpd is not curable through medicine, im just looking for anything to bring calm in my life.",1605411916.0,False,8,10,nippysippy,None,jufftc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/jufftc/abilify_and_bpd/
8,Emotional Relapse,"Hello everyone, after a period of treatment being stable I had a very strong emotional relapse, suddenly I started crying and I couldn't stop until 3 days later.  
These last 3 days have been a nightmare, so much so that I did not remember what it was like to live with borderline.Suddenly crying with suicidal thoughts and suddenly laughing watching my series, suddenly I felt very alone and empty, my mind could not with so many self-destructive thoughts, and so it repeated all day over and over again.The doctor prescribed another antidepressant and recommended that I go to yoga classes. It scares me that despite taking the medicine well, I can suddenly reach these critical states.  
I was about to give up, my depression was very strong, right now I have no strength but I will get it I do not know how, but I will continue in this battle and I hope that we all continue together until the end, good night to all, I send you good vibes.",1600661733.0,False,6,2,itsmoonpaula,None,iwtc2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/iwtc2g/emotional_relapse/
9,Lamotrigine for BPD?,"Hey, so I started for the first time medication a little over a year ago (relearn/mirtizipine) and I was noticing at first it worked and made me gain a lot of weight which I didn’t mind cause I’m 5’8 and was 122-139 fluctuating. Sticks and bones. And the weight gain made me gain good weight; got a butt etc got thick lol. I looked good w the weight gain.

But it started giving me suicidal thoughts and my typical 2 week depression that I’d experience here and there put me in a 6-9 month depression that I couldn’t beat. Getting off the meds I felt better for 2 months and still feel better but I’m noticing I’m developing instead of depression, rage and anger problems. Like 0-100 anger problems and I also can’t take minor inconvenience. Like a dr appt being rescheduled makes me feel angry, I feel impatient and I can’t go to work or focus at work and I’m afraid I’ll push my boyfriend away again. (I understand ppl need to protect their peace BPD IS DRAINING) so I have to do my part to ensure I’m ensuring a good environment for not only myself but my kid and the ones who support me. My dr recommended lamotrigine and it seems scary certainly when I’m just tryna stabilize my mood fr, and mute my emotions. I have goals to uphold and I quit jobs easily but can’t this time. I realized I called off work twice (I’m still in my 90 days) and didn’t care to lose my job… which is an effect of my unstablized mood, the inability to think about the cause an effects of decisions I make when I’m angry. Who I snap out on, and I’m tryna avoid an episode from happening cause I can feel it. Is this medicine doing too much? I’m not tryna make things worse as I’ve been doing pretty ok minus the 6-9 month depression and the newly developed anger problems. What’s your thoughts??? I know ppl say DBT but I can’t afford that and those resources aren’t that available I also have a BPD work book that helps but I can’t focus AT ALL enough to even read or follow my music/go outside crisis plan.

10,BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I’m trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I’ve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I’m not sure what’s real, what’s a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that’s why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn’t have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don’t have a father. I don’t have siblings. I don’t have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought “it will never get better” for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there’s still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don’t even know what “this” is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can’t just give people psychedelics and say go crazy—it needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,15,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/
11,Manager called me manipulative,So today I went to work to grab a mask. I walked in not expecting anyone to say anything to me. Until the owner decided to ask me what I didn’t price items. I told him I forgot to price it and that I was sorry. he then told me he didn’t buy it. He proceeded to say “how the fuck can you forget about something that we talked about for three minutes.” Remind you I struggle with some ADHD symptoms and I’m working hard every day to put my BPD into remission but I’m 21 and it’s gonna take a while. He told me that there’s something wrong with that if I’m always forgetting. Yeah it’s called a trauma ADHD depression concussion. A whole slew of things. Now I hate using all of this as an excuse so I decided not to. I told him I’m going to doctors appts to figure out if there’s anything else going on. I told him he doesn’t have to believe me I believe me and then I said whatever and I left. This isn’t the first time he has cussed in an angry tone. We had a huge talk yesterday about how we (the younger employees) need to be paying attention more and that he fears that I am not doing the same amount of work whenever he’s gone. I Admitted that sometimes I don’t work as hard as I can. I lose track and can’t find anything to do. He gave me some ideas for what I should do when it’s slow in the store. I respect that he is just trying to run a business at the same time I’ve tried to communicate the struggles that I have and to let him know this happens everywhere and in every job but I am trying hard to work on it. I hope every time that they ask what they can go to insure I can get shit done. I need guidance more that most ppl. He doesn’t believe in the vaccine and he doesn’t believe in mental illness. He thinks I have complete control over every single one of my actions. Sometimes I’m unpredictable and he even said that he doesn’t know what to expect when I come in. I talk to my manager about all of this because he made me cry and she said you know sometimes you just come off manipulative. No I’m communicating with you my frustrations in the thing that I deal with on a daily basis and I just always hoping that you guys can understand and work with me and have a kind heart but they never do. Well I guess my manager is way better than the owner. She actually tried to calm me down. If I am in the wrong please let me know I’m just stressing this is a good job and I don’t wanna lose it but I see younger people get blamed for everything while the 50+ coworkers that I work with do the same exact thing but they don’t get talked to. They constantly blame us and come up with things that aren’t true because they’re bitter as fuck. I hate BPD and it feels like all of this is my fault and I am faking it and that I have complete control over every single one of my actions maybe I do I just haven’t learned it yet I’m taking medicine I’m doing everything I need to do. Yet I still feel like a disappointment to everyone. They just don’t see how hard I’m working and it sucks. Thank you guys for taking the time to read it love you all and hope you guys are having a good day sending you some positive energy I know sometimes we need it more than most people.,1643935524.0,False,8,2,Note4me6,None,sjzj25,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/sjzj25/manager_called_me_manipulative/
12,I need some advice.,"Hello everyone. It is going to be a long one. Also I apologize first for my poor English. 

My fiancé broke up with me 3 days ago after of 4years dating. He kicked me out of his house, so I pack the stuff I can grub and went back home with my mom and cats. He blocked me on everything so I can’t contact him at all. He is texting with my mom for the moving out stuff. 

On the day he broke up with me, I thought he was joking and left the house at 10pm during a big fight. I thought he’d come back as always, he happened to do that a few times, I mean I did few times too.
He never come back, I started to feel anxious. He used to say if he ever break up with me he’d kill himself, so I started to feel so anxious and worried. I went down to the town to look for him in a windy rainy night for an hour at 2am, I’m sure I looked so suspicious. I couldn’t find him, I went back home, spammed his message by texting & call. I was in a panic so I threat him by I’d kill myself, asking if he’s ok. He blocked me on everything at this point. I regret for how I acted. 
But still, I never gets updates if he’s ok. So I decided to call at his work. Called his step mom that I respect too. Which is not a good idea.. I did bunch of times enough that he’s work had to cut the phones line and caused so much problem. I feel so sick of myself that I put him this through. All I wanted to know is if he’s ok.

Days go by, my mom isn’t perfect at English so I was texting him for my mom about moving out, and the situation. (I think he knows that he’s talking to me by how I write down the words)
He mentioned that I was manipulated, abused him, depending on him too much in mentally and financially (that made him on debt), and so on.
Yes, one time I stub my thighs with a knives when he told me he cheated on me with two girls back in the day, I freaked out. But after that, he was royal to me this whole time, as I can see. But this feel of he might cheating on me again feels will not perfectly go away, even though I had the access to his phone anytime(he was nice enough to even tell me that I can log in to his sns), you know. Now I think of it maybe it was the symptoms of BPD since I had this feels of maybe he’s lying still.
Well he pretty much blamed on me on so many things in this relationship, of course there were few things that I went what?!?! But you know, I have my own side point of view so it’s just different I guess.

So I started to search about BPD in online. Back in the day I was on medicine for bipolar, and I found that it’s kind of similar. But the way most of the ppl write the traits of BPD were bit too official, so I couldn’t understand that much. I found this one article that explained really good, that matches everything for what I did. I completely realized, I woke up of this whole my world of why me? I hurt everytime thing.
I was abusing him mentally, physically, enough him to be completely shut off with me to heal himself.
In that moment, my love towards him, I felt that become colorful again. Yes, I’ve been felt dull in this relationship by so much stress at work, situation, etc.

The reason why this relationship were hard was me. I was causing the fight most of the time, when I was blaming him for it. You know, everything changed how I see things. Now I understand it, I started to take counseling for BPD.

In one of the conversation with my “mom” (it’s me texting since my mom isn’t good at English) he said: In my heart, there is a hope that she will get better and we can be happy one day.  I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.  Maybe that's still possible later on down the road. I'm hopeful.

And also, when I ask if he don’t love me anymore, he replies: My feelings are all mixed up, I don't know if I can answer that right now.
(My name) was the only girl I fell in love with so it's really hard.  But I began to resent her as the relationship went on.
My feelings are complicated so I still have love for her, but there is still no way I would be back together with her.

But again, he want me to be gone gone. I’m still confusing. I know he is fighting himself for life because I was such an toxic person.. I understand he’s struggle. I start to understand everything how he feels. You know, I want to be with him still that never change.
Well, he said he will contact/explain to me everything how he feel after I completely move out from his house and feel safe from me (About how he’s done with me)

Now, I’m in this hope that maybe he will give me a chance if he see the progress that I’m trying to get better about myself? But I read that these kind of act is called hovering.. which I don’t wanna believe. I genuinely love him so much. But after reading these thread of broken up with BPD threads scares me that maybe I’m in one of this diseases traits, which I don’t want to believe. 

I think he’s idea of separating is good for us regardless, but I still want to be in the relationship as a new start, not like in a previous one which were toxic.

When he going to discuss with me about this situation that he decided to make a move, I’m thinking maybe I can try give him an offer(?) that maybe he can give me a chance on as a new relationship. Like, I’ll take this counseling and the medicines for PMS(because pms might be triggering the BPD traits more.) also I’m going to get all re-check on my mental health, so I can find a better solution to help my self get better. (I don’t want to ever hurt him again.) and, we can stay live in a different places, and we will meet/talk whenever HE is able to, I won’t bother while I’m getting treatment, completely set the wall. and I will help him financially since I am the one of a reason that he’s on debt, because I can find better job in this town. But again, maybe this traits called hovering and maybe I should not try ever again so he won’t think I’m manipulating/convincing him to stay with me. 

Of course I want to be with him, I really love him a lot. But at the same time, maybe, as these threads saying I’m doing the traits called hovering and trying to get what I want out of him and that’s it, which I doubt but if it is, maybe I really need to leave him for good.

13,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,10,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/
14,I'm on Mood Stabilizers and want off them...,"...But my psychiatrist thinks I need them because I have BPD. I also have ADHD hyperactive type. My hyperactivity seems to mimic hypomania at times. In the past, my psychiatrist thought I was bipolar, but since then has amended that diagnosis. I was officially diagnosed with BPD during a 7-month stay at a mental hospital.

I don't like being on all these meds. I have major depression, and am on antidepressants as well. I also have GAD and social anxiety. Finding a new psychiatrist is impossible in my area, because our mental health care is government funded and extremely limited, even more so during the pandemic.

I'm looking for any research on how mood stabilizers (anti-seizure meds) can permanently change the brain.

Or for any of you others who were put on mood stabilizers and how it affected you, good or bad.",1590414496.0,False,3,5,dylandonaghue,None,gqb8xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/gqb8xt/im_on_mood_stabilizers_and_want_off_them/
