I know I need to reach out to other people and build a greater support network, and BPD tells me that I only want one unhealthily close relationship. I know I can't recover from either condition that way. I'm also having trouble with continuous sobriety, I always get to a point where I feel empty and alone and trapped and like I'll feel that way forever unless I relapse and I just today realized that that's my BPD coming up so I need to focus on BPD recovery as well. 

So my question is, has anyone had success with 12 step recovery and BPD recovery at the same time? I'm going to talk to my therapist about this today as well. Thank you.

17,Best kind of threapy for relationship abuse recovery??,"Was recently heavily abused by my ex who also has BPD. Both psyically and mentally. It was pretty bad. He is now facing jail upto 3 years including the cases from his previous ex. 

I'm now a shell of my old self. Today I was looking through all my old posts on Instagram and I cried. Because I mentally had forgotten who I was and how confident and happy I was back then. I didn't even realize at the time how much I had found myself back then. How free I was.. how courageous and inspiring and truly just nothing but my unapologetic self not letting anything hold me back. Fast forward 8 months and I'm a mess. I don't recognize that person anymore. I have been in abusive relationships all my life. This isn't my first rodeo. I have a very long history of childhood abuse over years. And then seeing my mother be abused too on a constant. I have had therapy most of my life and I am on medication. But I have no voice. I let people walk all over me. I find my worth and then I slowly have it manipulated again by the wrong people. Anyhow, sorry for getting drastically side tracked.. my apologies. Just wondering what the best threapy is for me to try after escaping DV ? I've done a bunch. Including some threapy the court suggested and cbt and dbt etc. Heard something about sky or ski therapy? I'm not sure. I've done different therapy's over the years but I'm open to re trying some. I have a very bad short and long term memory so I wouldn't mind doing them again.

19,Whats a good start to recovery if therapy is not an option?,"Me and my partner have been dating for a little over a year. We have a deep connection and idealy, this is the person i would marry. However, a few hours ago I was told that i needed to get better immediately or they would have to prioritize themselves and break up. 

I find it extremely difficult to regulate my emotions and control what I am saying when I get triggered (cancelled last minute, ignored, lied to etc). I feel physically incapable of moving for hours on end and I can end up lashing out and saying hurtful things. 

Unfortunately, while i plan on getting therapy eventually, it is not feasible for me at the moment. I really need to control and stop my triggers, but I dont know how.

I can't lose this person, we've planned a life together and I dont think I'll ever find someone like them again.

22,Thank you for choosing recovery!,"Context: I don't have bpd (so idk if this post will be removed, I understand if it is) but my partner does.

I came here to try to learn more (as the bpd sub is private) and I felt this immense proud feeling seeing so many people celebrating their big wins and helping each other because I see directly how this disorder impacts someone and how hard it is to try to break the cycles, and how rewarding it is, when you have a victory.

On behalf of the relationships you have rn or will have in the future that are too benefiting from your recovery journey, a billion thank yous. And a reminder from someone who is head over heels with someone who has this disorder: you are not too hard to love. It's been almost two years and I wouldn't trade my fiance for the world.

Sorry for formatting, am on mobile.
Have had many ups and downs, steps forward in my marriage followed by 2 steps back.
Suicidal and self harming behavior, switching, extreme moods and anger, black and white thinking, blackouts, dissociation.
Currently in therapy for a couple of months seeing a psychologist weekly and looking at a clinic specializing in borderline.
Sometimes I wonder how my life ever got to this point, how when I should be happy things are so hard.
No surprise considering my abusive childhood, but I thought I had left all that in the past.
Mostly though I am grateful.
Grateful to myself to realize I need help.

26,Dealing with other people's negativity whilst trying to work on recovery,"So this is part vent, part share... I'm currently on my recovery journey, really working hard on putting in the time to do the self-reflection, use workbooks and whatever other tools I can to really pull myself out of my bad patterns and get me on The Good Path (I'm not in therapy as I'm currently on an 18month + waiting list...)

I feel really good about it, really positive and hopeful for the future, even when things are tough I feel like I've got a better handle on myself, and really am feeling overall happy with the direction I'm heading in.

But there are people in my life that I feel are weighing me down a bit... People who have their own burdens, and it's not my place to judge - I have BPD, I'm hardly a poster child for stability! - but I feel like sometimes their constant negativity and (seeming) lack of willingness or effort to change is making it hard for me to enjoy spending time with them. I know that *""I'm working on myself so you can too""* is a really shitty mindset, but I just wish I knew how to help and influence the ones I love to put themselves on a better path.

At the moment I just... I find myself splitting on people that I want to help because no matter how hard I try and reassure them or give them support, they aren't listening and just respond with a constant barrage of negativity and self-deprecation that then starts to either trigger my own self-hatred or makes me feel like I hate *them.* Which I know I don't, but in those moments, I really feel like I do.

I'm just... I'm done with being surrounded by negativity ALL THE TIME. Life is rough, I get it, and bad days happen... but I'd like there to be at least some positivity around me. 

...Honestly, I don't really know what the point of this is...

31,"Time to start working on recovery, one step at a time","I'm not in therapy currently, have really struggled finding a therapist who can help me with my BPD and CPTSD (my last one was awful, and when I tried going to my GP I've ended up on a 2 year long wait list for another service because they're unable to help me because of my trauma...).

My mental health is at a critical low at the moment and I've not been taking care of myself, but I need to make a change. So, I'm finally digging out the workbooks I've had for ages but barely touched. 

I've set myself a new schedule/routine to help me make time for it, and I'm going to try really hard. Did my first session with Dr Daniel Fox's Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook.

I've seen some of his videos, and they're always pretty insightful and the first chapter of the book seems really good so far - really helped me to pin down some of the possible causes of my BPD, what subtype my BPD is (self-destructive/discouraged) and my attachment type (fearful - explains a lot!). 

So I'm feeling fairly hopeful. I think it's going to be hard work, but I think this combined with some DBT books I have can help me get things in order the best I can.

I'm just checking in to tell you that during our last appointment, my therapist of 3 years told me that she thinks I no longer meet the criteria for BPD and am what she calls ""a therapeutic success"". We went over how I got there over the course of my treatment and how some things will stay‚Äì""borderline traits"" that are part of my personality but no longer a handicap to my day-to-day life; and dissociative episodes that are now few and far between but not entirely gone. I know that setbacks are possible and even likely, but it does not scare me nearly as much as it used to! I have grown more confident in my skills and myself as a person despite previous therapists and medical professionals telling me there was no hope for me.

I wanted to share this feel-good news because I know that ""recovering"" from a personality disorder is so often seen as impossible that it really feels like there's no point in trying to get better. But there is!! I will be borderline my whole life but it doesn't have to be pathologic forever. I want to tell you that it does happen, changing is possible and work pays off. There's no way I could have imagined this just a couple years ago. You deserve care and your life is worth living, in and of itself, but also because it can and will get better. I also wanna thank this sub because you guys have been a really positive influence during my treatment and I hope this post contributes to give back a little.

35,Identity recovery,"I've come far in many aspects of my recovery. Especially in emotional dysregulation and explosiveness. I've come to a point where I have mature and healthy relationships that connects on a deeper level. One of the pillars left standing towards full recovery is identity disturbance, and my identity has to some degree cemented through recovery. I've created a higher value system and has found some of my interests.

I am however in a position where I am afraid that connecting to my emotional nature will result in changing my identity from a hardworking, dedicated and analytical individual to someone who is more lenient and taking breaks. I'm afraid that recovering even more might result in an identity that I do not want. The current fluffy idea of my own identity is a mixture between multiple individuals to whom I look up to, but I've also realized that my identity is still fluid in many ways, which has pushed me to find my own core. I want to be steadfast in what I believe in, and not be swayed easily.

I think it is hard to find the in-between.

I'd like to know if you have stabilized an identity, how you went about doing it? What were the resources you used? Did you create mental maps of how your psyche is organized?

38,Things I‚Äôve noticed since starting recovery,"I feel like I‚Äôm swinging from extremely codependent to almost counter-dependent.

I‚Äôve almost completely let go of my current partner as an FP. I‚Äôm basically indifferent towards them now, but there‚Äôs other contributing factors such as abuse and incompatibility that have driven me to this point.

If I entered into another relationship I‚Äôm not sure how I would behave. I wouldn‚Äôt want my BPD to flare up again and I don‚Äôt feel confident that some of my bad BPD behaviors wouldn‚Äôt resurface.

Even if we split, which is eventually likely, I‚Äôm not interested in being in a romantic relationship any time soon. I have so much work to do on myself and I want to proceed into every relationship with caution.

I am also doing my best to not cling onto others in my life too much as well. While I do think reaching out for support when needed is great, I want to try my best to be as strong by myself as possible before ultimately reaching out if I need the help.

I‚Äôm learning to be alone which has been a huge obstacle to be leaving abusive situations in the past. It‚Äôs really hard to survive by yourself, but I feel like the adversity is pushing me in a good direction of growth.

One **HUGE** win is that I have way better boundaries! It has been an amazing experience finally feeling like I can voice my own wants and needs.

I am less afraid of the fury, rejection and ‚Äúabandonment‚Äù that comes with voicing your needs now. I anticipate and expect pushback, but it‚Äôs worth being uncomfortable because the pain, grief and heartache that comes from not being true to yourself and suffering because you allowed yourself to be a doormat is worse than any person leaving me.

I can heal from someone throwing me away, but to live a life trapped in a lie and in misery‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like drinking a vial of poison everyday.

I also am a lot more patient and have less emotional outbursts. I can regulate my emotions way better and in healthier ways than I used to. I also allow myself to feel them now, whether I may have been projecting a bit or not. Emotions are real, but our perception of the situation isn‚Äôt necessarily always the truth.

So, yeah. I cry. I get sad. I get mad. I get frustrated and often self-isolate while doing so. Then once the intense emotions have settled down, I reassess the situation that upset me, try to be rational about it then communicate with the other party in a calm manner about how it made me feel, or what we can change.

Another **HUGE** change has been that I definitely feel like I have a personality and I know myself well now. I am not ashamed for simply being myself and in fact I like myself a lot. I know my intentions and my values, my likes and dislikes and I am honest about it.

If someone doesn‚Äôt agree with me or like me, then that‚Äôs their problem not mine. Just because someone doesn‚Äôt like me does not determine my worth and that‚Äôs a huge life changing perspective for me.

No more changing who I am to cater to others, especially because most of the time they won‚Äôt accommodate you either.

I‚Äôve also learned to stave off my disappointment when things don‚Äôt go as I expected or hoped. I used to throw tantrums, but I‚Äôve seen what it can look like for an adult to throw a tantrum and it was unsightly. I couldn‚Äôt believe I behaved in such a childish manner.

I now redirect my disappointment towards something else. If one thing didn‚Äôt work out, I just try to do something else that will make me happy.

Anyways, this is just what I could think of off the top of my head. These have been substantial and noticeable changes that have greatly altered my state of mind and state of being.

I **love** who I am growing into and I don‚Äôt plan on stopping anytime soon.",1625858854.0,False,23,4,SoftBoiledPotatoChip,None,oh2rfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/oh2rfw/things_ive_noticed_since_starting_recovery/
39,Remission/Recovery Resources for the Sticky Temperamental Traits of BPD,"Thanks to a year of DBT, my BPD symptoms are in remission, and I've been below the diagnostic criteria threshold for about a year and a half. 

I continue to practice DBT. I consider myself to be really rigorous and recovery-oriented, much like someone in substance abuse recovery might. 

I know that people like us have functional deficits, even in recovery, that are linked to temperamental traits (irritability, mood lability, negativity bias, impulsivity, etc). These deficits are the reason that only half of us go on to achieve normal interpersonal and vocational functioning after our BPD symptoms have gone into remission.

Here's the question: Does anyone have any post-treatment resources for those of us whose BPD symptoms are in remission but who want to maximize our functionality at work and in our relationships? Any resources that deal with temperamental problems as opposed to just behavior/thoughts?

40,3 Months into Committed Recovery,"It's been a little over 3 months since my ex went NC. At first, I had no idea how I was gonna live without him but I am happy to say it has been super easy. I was unfortunately in love with an idealized version of him. I thought I could mold him into the perfect (one day) husband but I am now realizing that it was stupid of me to even attempt, I was forcing something that didn't come naturally to him.

&#x200B;

 Any who, during this time I have really focused on myself, my mental health, my job, my kids, and the relationships with those that surround me, and everyone swears they see a difference. I've picked up hobbies that I used to love like painting and drawing! I'm also eating a lot healthier and have really gotten into meditation and yoga. Two months ago I received a trophy for top performer and a generous bonus and my coworkers have said if I wanted to open up my own office they'd help me. I've always been pretty involved with my kids but lately I'm fascinated by everything they do, every. little. thing. I've started mending friendships that became extremely rocky while I was with my ex and they have played a huge part in my recovery. I mean, bad days still happen but the frequency of those days has gone down significantly and those same bad days... aren't actually THAT bad. It's amazing what a little mindfulness and grounding can do <3 

&#x200B;

 I feel amazing and at times I can't believe that I'm actually a borderline. 

&#x200B;

Recovery doesn't come easy, it takes a lot of work serious self accountability BUT it's doable! I didn't think I was going to make it a month ... but here we are! Happier than ever and still recovering <3

41,I‚Äôm surviving the worst part of my life. Recovery IS possible and I‚Äôm proof of it.,"Long post ahead. Tl;dr at the bottom.

For some background, I‚Äôm 29, just got diagnosed BPD last September. Despite that I struggled my entire life (suicidal thoughts, self harm, toxic relationships, MULTIPLE trips to the ER and I still was never properly diagnosed). I started DBT in October and just finished the program in April. I also started lamictal last year but just got on a dose that worked for me around February.

A little over three weeks ago, my husband got physically violent with me. He had ‚Äúonly‚Äù been verbally abusive in the past, which I let happen because I believed he would get better, even though he never even promised he would. 

And I LEFT. I just LEFT. I‚Äôve never really felt the FP thing, but I definitely let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to me in the past. And I know if this happened a year ago‚Ä¶I would have stayed. I would have let him tell me he only hit me because my behavior made him. I would have let him make me believe I was the one who was getting the second chance to not fuck up. 

But after a year of intense therapy and meds (less than a year actually) I had the ability to leave him. And when he tried to control me, I still left. And when it meant I‚Äôd have to live alone, I still left. And even when I had a full emotional breakdown on our first wedding anniversary, one week after he hit me, I still left.

Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am for keeping myself safe, something I never have done in the past. This is the hardest and worst thing I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life. But I know I‚Äôll survive, and honestly, I owe that to DBT and all the work I put into it.

Please don‚Äôt give up hope. Keep trying, keep putting in the work. It‚Äôs worth it and so are you.

Tl;dr my husband got physically violent and thanks to DBT and meds I was able to leave him, something my BPD would never let me do before recovery.",1657591858.0,False,49,7,devourtheunborn69,None,vwzpxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/vwzpxv/im_surviving_the_worst_part_of_my_life_recovery/
42,I feel like my partner has been manipulative since I was diagnosed and I don't want this to affect my recovery.,"To preface this, I intend to have a discussion with my therapist regarding this issue but I'd like some insight if this is a situation I need to remove myself from asap. 


My partner and I broke up about a month ago shortly after my BPD got worse and I was cycling through emotions every other hour. I started therapy and it has worked tremendously well. A couple of days ago, he came by and explained that he'd like to give this another try once I have sorted out my issues and he has his career together. Btw, we had been living together and he has moved to a place nearby. 


I love this new space we have to work on ourselves. I am working out, focusing on my studies and hobbies like never before. However, there have been a few instances where I'm wondering if he is subconsciously using my diagnosis against me recklessly. 


For example, he dropped by pretty late last night and was about to head back home to study. I was heading to bed anyway so I suggested he bring his materials over to study here since it was so late and he looked tired. He immediately went on the attack. ""Babe you are regressing, you are going back into the loop"". I was so taken aback, I was on the verge of tears. This recovery process has not been easy and it was very hurtful that he could throw my diagnosis at my face when I was just being kind. 


This isn't the first time this has happened. I assumed he is quite level headed and one of the few stable people I know. But the current dynamic feels very one sided. Although I'd like to be supportive of him while he achieves his goals, this behaviour of telling me I'm regressing or that I need to get a handle on my emotions for very normal kindnesses that couples show each other has left me with a sour taste in my mouth. 


He drops by unannounced all the time which I was okay with since he needs a break from his studies but he seems to think he is entitled to receive/show affection however he wants to while I'm the one walking on eggshells around him. 


I feel gaslighted to an extent? Being told I'm nuts for asking if he needs a meal since he is overworked is just.....bizarre.",1682737623.0,False,1,3,Notalltheretbh,None,132hnv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/132hnv0/i_feel_like_my_partner_has_been_manipulative/
43,Behaviour before recovery,"Here goes nothing. After 2 years of therapy and lots of soul searching I no longer recognise the person I used to be. When I didn't know there was even anything wrong with me, my life was bad decision after bad decision, acting on hyper impulses and letting my wayward thoughts and emotions controll my life. I had little regard for the people around me, most of all my partner (20 years) I was unfaithful to him and denied him the love he so obviously deserved. 2 years ago I ended up on a psych ward after a spiral, when I got out I started therapy immediately. Only after truly hitting rock bottom did I wake up and see the damage I caused. The lies, the cheating, the inability to process emotion, the confusion and I do not recognise that person. Now, my emotions don't controll me, I controll them. I would not dream of doing this to him again. It's like I am suddenly awake to all of it and it hurts so much more then I could have imagined. I am not that person any more, I am well on the road to recovery. To separating irrational and rational thoughts, I searched deep within my self and I found it, hiding in my brain turning my emotions against me, I realised I was unwell. How do we move on from the damage we have caused, particularly to those we love, when the light turns on and we realise what we have done.

50,From the other side of recovery: realizations after 10 years of therapy,"I no longer identify with my BPD and rapid-cycling bipolar diagnoses, mostly because I do not fear abandonment like I used to, and I have fewer extreme highs/lows. It took 10 years of weekly therapy (sometimes 3 sessions a week) and lots of meditation/DBT/studying Buddhism, but I think I'm finally there. I told my therapist two months ago that I was ready to stop seeing her and try to work through things all on my own. 

It's been going really well, and my family has been supportive of my decision. I think they can see how much I've changed, which makes me really proud of myself. I've been considering whether my decision to end therapy was just another BPD splitting thing or manic decision. After two months of being locked in the same house with my family (thx COVID), it's clear that I've actually made progress, so I made a list of things that I am grateful for because of therapy/recovery from BPD--on the other side of it.

1) Having BPD means that you've been through the lowest of mental lows. I can't count how many times I felt like I was physically dying because of a BPD-related fear/sadness. Once you get better at managing BPD, you'll realize that other people don't have past experiences like that to help balance catastrophic anxiety. We already know what ""the worst"" feels like, so it's not as scary. And we know it'll get better (life has its own mood swings), even though that's hard to remember. Ngl-- knowing how deep in the dark I've been makes me feel kinda badass for making it out.

2) Our emotional depth lets us experience life in the most immersive way. Humans have something like 30,000 emotions, but I swear the people I know have 10 max. The capacity to feel is what makes life worth living. When you can manage how you respond emotionally to things, this is probably our superpower imo.

3) Compassion. The drama, trauma, and general intensity that comes with BPD has put me through a lot. Like with any hardship, getting through it has made me aware of how life is tough on all of us. I crossed paths with SO many people who had no idea I was struggling with BPD, and I'm grateful that some of them showed me compassion when I had hurt them. Now, when someone is unkind to me, I recognize that it probably has nothing to do with me. Everyone is going through something, and we're all just doing our best.

4) DBT skills are just awesome in general for everyone. I've had psychologically-sound friends tell me they need advice (read: anxiously rant while I make a mental list of DBT skills that could help them). When I share the skills that have worked for me, I realize that DBT was a HUGE stepping stone that helped me become more emotionally healthy and self-aware than the average person without a mental health diagnosis.

5) This one is personal, because I don't know how many people with BPD experience symptoms from a young age. I was diagnosed at 15 years old, and I am now 21. (My parents sent me to therapy for anxiety when I was 11, so 10 years of that). I can't believe how far I've come in terms of emotional maturation, and I'm still so young. It just makes me excited for future personal growth:)

- Embrace all of the methods people say work.  No need to waste time on fringe / unproven stuff.  YouTube has videos on all of these : CBT, DBT, Mindfulness, Mentalization, Stoicism, Buddhism, and anything else common I forgot.

- **avoid toxic relationships**

- **avoid toxic work environments**

- **avoid toxic friends**

61,"The Little Thing That Started Me On the Road to Recovery (That You Can Do, Too!)","BPD and depression often go hand in hand. One of the major things that characterizes BPD is a lack of sense of self. This is probably because, when we were children in negative environments with narcissists and irregular personalities as our adults, whenever we would engage in the behaviors that typically help the brain create a sense of self over time, our caregiver would shoot us down, or worse, make the thing about them. Thus, it was not safe to have a ""self"", it was safe to have *no needs* and a ""use.""

Abusive jobs mimic this. One amazing thing my mother taught me from back when she was in an abusive job as young woman, was this:

>""Every morning when I got ready for work, **I would look in the mirror and tell myself, 'I am a good person, and today, good things will happen to me because of it.'""**  
>  
>""But what if you don't believe that?"" I asked.  
>  
>""Tell yourself it as many times as you need to until you believe it,"" she finished firmly.

Another iteration of this for BPD sufferers is, ""I am a good person, and I am worthy of love."" Stand up straight, and look yourself in the eye when you say it.

I did this, and it has really helped. It felt stupid at first, hokey. But over time, I really started to believe it. After all, you hear something enough, it becomes true in your brain. That's the whole reason you feel worthless, right? 'Cuz you heard that a lot in one way or another. Time to take charge of the narrative. And turns out...it's really simple.

77,Sort of different than the questions usually asked on here... But what do you perceive as your reality?,"I am someone who's currently recovering from BPD, I would say I'm in-between the advanced stages of recovery and ""remission"". I apply DBT religiously, but lately I've been pretty stressed and it's been harder to apply and I've had a couple of, shall we say, mishaps.

But back to my question - Can I know what you, as a fellow BPD-sufferer, perceive as your reality? For instance - if you have a partner, do you truly believe they love you? Do you feel that you love them, genuinely? I often find it that during the throes of my episodes - my brain whips up this very convenient narration that of course, all along, I knew they never loved me. And I never loved them. But on my road to recovery, I've realized how easy it is to convince myself that the narrations I make up when I'm triggered are very distorted. A disclaimer: It doesn't mean my initial feelings weren't real. What I've learned is that my feelings are triggered for a reason, and if I'm upset, I am upset for a reason. I am not here to gaslight anyone - and that includes myself. Your feelings are real and genuine - I think the disconnect is our *reaction to those feelings and the very black and white narratives our brains cook up.*

So then back to my question - actually, two main questions: What stage in recovery are you (contemplating recovery, starting recovery, in recovery, well into recovery, in ""remission, or anywhere in between these stages - just made these up for easier understanding), and what do you currently perceive as your reality in terms of your relationships to other people?

For instance - my answer to my questions would be, I am ""well into recovery"" and I am starting to understand that my initial beliefs of what love and relationships should be are very distorted, and furthermore, my BPD dilutes my beliefs even further. When I get triggered, I don't believe that anyone has the capacity to love me. I have had pretty bad episodes these past couple of days, because my boyfriend has struggled for 2+ years to find a job, while I have been working as the sole provider for our household, and when I'm stressed, my BPD makes me believe he doesn't love me enough to get a job. In reality, the situation is more complicated. (Please don't ask about this. Not here looking for opinions about my relationship - I am simply curious to know what you perceive as your reality especially in its relationship to your BPD)

A few more questions to consider: do you believe that people love you? Do you believe that you can love others? What does love mean to you?

78,How do I fall in love with life again?,"TLDR: How do I approach recovery? Life doesn't excite me anymore. How do I fall in love with living again?

I am finally taking the jump to go all in on recovery. But I am not sure where to start. I have a therapist, I have DBT and BPD workbooks that I am working through. I have been a lot better at taking my medication, and I am being more honest with myself and those around me. But apart from that, I am not sure what else to do. 

Nothing is exciting anymore. I don't look forward to anything. When I wake up in the morning, unless I have some form of external commitment (appointment, meeting with friends, etc.), I have no problem staying in bed all day. 

I want to enjoy living. I want to get excited about being alive for another day. I want to be motivated to be better. I want to fall in love with living again. I know how precious life is, and I am so grateful for waking up each day and being able to live another day. But unless I am in a manic episode (bipolar 2 as well as BPD), I have 0 motivation to do anything, even the things I used to love. 

The advice I have so far is:

- plan things that I look forward to (I.e. date nights, holidays/vacations, etc). The problem here is that I am fresh out of uni (biomedical science) and have just started a new job, so i am broke and can't afford to make exciting plans. 

- romanticise my life - how do I actually do this in practice? 

- the Seinfeld method - possibly to track exercise? I'm thinking of a 10-minute walk each day?

- routine - starting small with one habit (I.e. morning or night routine) and adding onto it as I master each habit.

90,A Word of Hope For Those In Middle Age Still Struggling With Their BDP,"I woke up this morning to a post asking the relatively older members of the community (late 30s to early 40s) if they still struggle with the emotional roller coaster that is BPD. The OP asked if anyone else in that age group was still struggling with wild shifts in mood despite being told that their symptoms are supposed to stabilize in middle age. I‚Äôm glad to say that the OP found kindred spirits and I hope that was enough to comfort them with the notion that they are not failing at recovery.
As the day went on, I stumbled upon some interesting information that I think would be more helpful. I am currently listening to the audiobook ‚ÄúHow to Be Sad‚Äù by Helen Russell (which I think many of us should, it‚Äôs a wonderful book, but I digress). She talks about the importance of letting ourselves feel our emotions lest they get pent up and rare their ugly heads later on in life. 
In her research and consulting of numerous professionals for the book, she found that statistics show that humans and monkeys are more likely to display symptoms of depression and emotional distress in their middle age, hence the term ‚Äúmid life crisis.‚Äù Most of the experts she consulted mentioned that as you approach old age, the symptoms begin to lift as the stresses of middle age begin to subside. 
I found it rather helpful so I thought of sharing it with the OP. Thing is, I can‚Äôt for the life of me find the post. Im in three BPD related communities so I‚Äôve decided to share this as a post in all of them in hopes it‚Äôll make its way to the right person. 

While I can‚Äôt relate to the situation because I‚Äôm a little young (25, F), having the notion that there‚Äôs a reason this is happening and I‚Äôm not failing at my recovery is helpful. I hope that OP and the several kindred spirits in their comment section can also feel the same way with this info. 
Peace and love to all of you. 

TL;DR: If you‚Äôre older and struggling with your symptoms even though you were told this would slow down as you get older, you aren‚Äôt broken. There‚Äôs a scientific evidence that middle aged people are more prone to depression and emotional distress due to the stresses that come with it. Keep doing your best, the science also shows that it slows down once you get closer to old age.",1695334482.0,False,6,5,TheUndrachiever,None,16ot532,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16ot532/a_word_of_hope_for_those_in_middle_age_still/

97,hitting rock-bottom,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439573.0,False,1,7,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ad08qo/hitting_rockbottom/

I have asked them to research it on their own and just send me what they find so i can let them know if its accurate or just stigmatizing BS.

What (if any) books exist as a resource for partners of people with BPD that explains what BPD is, how to support us, and how they can hold their own boundaries in this sort of dynamic?

Maybe such a book doesnt exist but I would be happy with any of those 3 things.

EDIT: Anyone who responds to this assuming that im not putting in any work needs to fuck off. I've already sent them all sorts of stuff. I am in therapy. I have a workbook. I journal. None of my symptoms are severe they way they were even as recently as two years ago. I put in hard work every single day to manage this disorder that was given to me through being abused (reminder, none of us fucking asked to be like this). My partner fails to express external interest in my BPD. IMO if someone knowingly signs up to date someone with BPD they are signing up to do hard shit sometimes. It's not like I surprised them with this disorder, I told them on our 3rd date, well before we entered a comitted exclusive relationship, that I have BPD and that it is something they were going to need to learn about. It is immensely triggering to be in a relationship where half of the time when I am triggered it's at this point avoidable had they just done some research.

I am burnt out, suicidal, and at my limit. IMO reading a few articles on google is the BARE MINIMUM.

My room mate took an entire class on how to have someone with BPD in your life and how to support them.

I‚Äôm also a girl and I know they wouldn‚Äôt look like how they do without surgery. Something I can‚Äôt afford and he can‚Äôt afford either if he wants a woman who looks like that.

It doesn‚Äôt help that previously he told me he‚Äôs not attracted to me, that he‚Äôll cheat on me if I don‚Äôt give him what he wants, how he‚Äôs bored of me, tired of me etc.

Finding this out was an extra stab to the heart and my self esteem.

I‚Äôd have to spend a fortune to look like those girls and probably reverse time by 10 years.

111,BPDlovedones‚Ä¶helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I‚Äôm talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It‚Äôs all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that‚Äôs for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don‚Äôt really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I‚Äôm sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I‚Äôm trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I‚Äôve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs real, what‚Äôs a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. I don‚Äôt want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that‚Äôs why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn‚Äôt have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don‚Äôt have a father. I don‚Äôt have siblings. I don‚Äôt have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought ‚Äúit will never get better‚Äù for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there‚Äôs still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don‚Äôt even know what ‚Äúthis‚Äù is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can‚Äôt just give people psychedelics and say go crazy‚Äîit needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,13,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/

118,Am I crazy or did I use my skills/boundaries properly?,"(Originally posted in r/BPD but since I'm in recovery for awhile with my BPD I thought posting here would be better)

Update as of 10/13:

//My husband and I ended up looking through other messages between social medias we used together to come to terms with their behavior and again, find more patterns because I'm still trying to fight against their gaslighting. What we found was years worth of posts switching between talking absolute ill of our friend group and idolizing me, dragging and making very long hateful posts anytime one of us ended up in a relationship, the amount of hate and jealousy filled posts related to me was so nauseating that I've been sick for the past 15 hours. There's a lot more but I don't think it's quite on topic for this thread.

I feel much more confident and happy with myself that I was able to control my emotions regarding this situation and know I really did make the right decision. Thank you everyone for the support as well üß°//

Long story short I had to end a friendship recently due to my boundaries not being respected and asking for mutual respect/support in specific areas of my life.

 I've brought them up for over a year until it got to a point where I needed to take time away to think about my future relationship with this person as their actions were not only harming me mentally but settling into my relationship with my husband and kids (my husband is aware of my diagnosis and is very patient with me. However, I did split more regularly during the times after interacting with this person which initially made us realize maybe I needed to reevaluate the friendship.) I've been going to therapy for my BPD for 6 years, know my subtypes, know my triggers, know when I need to step away and use wise mind. I have multiple workbooks that he and I do together in between the times I don't have therapy to keep up with my recovery as I very much want to work on myself and have for years.

Here is where I feel like I'm crazy: after bringing up that we needed time away from each other and go our separate lives and stating why, I am hearing from others that they're telling people that I abused them. That I sent hateful messages and that I was clearly devaluing them because they've been researching BPD for a little. I was very confused. Had my MIL, FIL and other family look at the messages. They said what I said wasn't hateful. I even showed my therapist and she said no and that I shouldn't be made to feel guilty for putting my kids first regardless of my diagnosis or not.

Am I crazy? Did my black and white thinking kick in? Or did I truly do the right thing and trusted myself? So many people use my diagnosis against me and many times I have to spend DAYS making decisions so I can make sure I'm not reacting out of pure emotion. However, this is my family and they ARE more important to me than anything else. I know after this I don't want them around me or my family ever again anyways, especially for what lies they're spreading. 

Being a mom with BPD is hard but I will always put them first. Their safety and security is most important to me. So why do I still feel bad for ending this friendship?

To update as of today as well with talking with my therapist; she mentioned that my friend is probably a covert narcissist and that it is common for them to shift blame, lie, and fake memory issues to avoid accountability. And since I have BPD that my friend probably dipped and played into that against me, especially since i was never originally diagnosed with it during the start of our friendship.",1697085744.0,False,5,3,WanderingFoxWitch,None,175yhrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/175yhrw/am_i_crazy_or_did_i_use_my_skillsboundaries/
119,Holy wow DBT is amazing,"Wow dudes. It seriously is.

I‚Äôve been in CBT with some DBT features for like a year and a half and I made huge strides! But now I moved, and am starting DBT group and a one on one CBT therapist in my new city in two weeks.

I haven‚Äôt started the new therapies yet - but my friend who is a psychologist sent me a packet of DBT worksheets for my time off therapy and holy WOW - they are effective.

Personally, they take a long ass time for me to fill out, and I only feel like they work for me because a.) I already have experience with doing logs like this and with cognitive distortions and schemas through my time in CBT, and b.) I already have worked on emotional awareness a lot for several years with several therapists.

But like - this morning my partner said something innocuous of course which scared the shit out of me and immediately felt anxious and scared and angry and confused and I wanted to ask him all these questions and interrogate him and do all my impulsive behaviors‚Ä¶

But then I filled out ‚Äúcheck the facts‚Äù and wow. It just wild. It took probably an hour for me to really work through it, but I can see SO clearly exactly the route my mind took, and why, and I feel empathetic with myself, and I feel like I understand my partner, and I feel safe and happy and understood and I took no actions that I regret and just‚Ä¶wow.

123,Success story: 3 years since I no longer met the criteria for BPD,"**Background:**

Diagnosed with BPD at 19: I would engage in extremely toxic and manipulative behaviours with my boyfriend at the time - spamming his phone if he didn‚Äôt reply within one hour, threatening self harm if he wasn‚Äôt spending all his spare time with me or felt he would leave me, I would split him every single day, within a matter of hours, no matter how hard he tried to make me happy or ‚Äúdo things right‚Äù. 
I was in college but couldn‚Äôt keep even a part-time job and failed countless classes because I‚Äôd lose motivation and had absolutely no sense of self.
I wanted him to hurt as much as I hurt from all my past unresolved trauma, putting it onto small things he might have misstepped, swinging from being extremely anxious/depressed to explosive anger. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself - no emotional regulation, black and white thinking, the works.

When he finally couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, I broke down completely and sought professional help where I was diagnosed with BPD. When I first read the symptoms, it was like reading myself on a page. 

**Recovery:**

Recovery took at least 5 years: I had to take a long, hard, brutal look at myself and shared it (embarrassingly) with my psych - identifying my traumas, triggers, behaviours and accepting it. 

I had times (especially in the first 2 years) where I regressed and engaged in undesirable behaviours and would hate myself so much I wanted to die.
The most difficult to manage was my dependency on partners, I feared abandonment more than anything and would lie or threaten self-harm to make them stay. 
But I kept self-compassion, accountability for my actions, and persevered. The frequencies became noticeably less and I used that to keep motivated. 
DBT and CBT worked wonders, especially practicing radical acceptance, wise mind, mindfulness, GIVE, and self-soothing techniques.
I also worked on my trauma through multiple EMDR sessions and counselling sessions at the same time.

3 years ago I was told I no longer met the criteria for BPD. I‚Äôm so proud of myself for keeping up with all my improvements (still use the same techniques today).
I‚Äôm so much more stable and confident. I have never insulted my husband, breached his privacy, threatened self-harm, spammed messages, tried to control his actions, blew up on him, or shifted blame during the entirety of this 4 year relationship (I had already come so far then) - it‚Äôs basic respect, but before therapy this would‚Äôve been impossible for me.

127,How to help my spouse with BPD?,"TLDR at the bottom :) 


Hi everyone! I (M24) have been with my partner with BPD (enby 24) for 5 years, married for 2. Neither of us knew they had BPD at the start of the relationship; only about 6 months ago dots started to connect for them and they told me they think they meet the criteria for Quiet-type BPD. A diagnosis isn't likely at this stage as we live in the UK and the waiting lists are... intense for NHS mental health treatments.

At the moment I think things are a bit fresh, my partner has said that they've just come to terms with the fact they have BPD and aren't ready to look at formal treatment options yet but we've been working on a few strategies, for example we have an analogy we call ""the mountain"" where there are three basic levels on a 1-100 scale (the hyena pit at 1-10, a stable camp at 45-55, and the peak where the air is thin at 90-100). We try to check in about where on the mountain they are before we have a potentially triggering conversation and I'm trying to be more conscious of how/when I say things. They also have listened to Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents and Recovering from Emotionally Immature Parents, both by Lindsay Gibson, which has helped quite a bit prior to learning about what symptoms have been from BPD. 

My question is: how can I set boundaries or offer support and understanding without unintentionally discouraging improvement/healing or enabling? I've felt a few times that there's a fine line between offering accommodation and allowing unhealthy habits to form, but as someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with BPD/BPD recovery I'm not sure where that line is. If any of you have advice on what things I can do/suggest that would be fair and healthy, I'd be very appreciative! Ask any questions in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them!!

128,Just need to get my thoughts out,"In terms of recovery, I‚Äôm not sure where I am. I feel like the more I try and help myself, the more insightful I become in regards to my personality, the less it feels like recovery is the right word to use. 

I feel like I‚Äôm discovering more than recovering. I‚Äôm discovering ideas of how I became to be me, to think and act the way I do. I‚Äôm discovering that there are parts of me that I don‚Äôt like and feel like I can‚Äôt control. That discovery is making me feel incredibly vulnerable. 

I have a tendency to be vindictive when I feel unfairly treated, or betrayed. I have done so many things I am ashamed of, and even now I want to give an explanation before each admission. The reasoning behind why I did each of those things to the people I did them to. ‚ÄúWell they did this to me first, and so I did that‚Ä¶‚Äù

I don‚Äôt feel like I should act that way, I don‚Äôt like that trait. I don‚Äôt want to get revenge because I genuinely feel like shit afterwards. Yet I do it, over and over again. Why!?! I want to be the bigger person, I strive to be the bigger person each and every time and I never am. 

In counselling I‚Äôve talked about this very feeling, I feel if I don‚Äôt get revenge it‚Äôs as though I‚Äôm accepting the betrayal wasn‚Äôt that at all. I feel like I‚Äôm saying that behaviour is ok and warranted. I get angry inside and I hold that anger in and then I‚Äôm the only one hurting.

For context, I have ADHD, BPD, OCD, anxiety, a history of depression and panic attacks, and an extended eating disorder history. This is all rooted in separation from my bio mother as a baby and then being in a very emotionally neglectful (and at sometimes emotionally abusive) environment.

This is all obviously amazing. And I‚Äôm no stranger to healing feeling unusual and foreign and wanting to reject it and sabotage. But whatever I‚Äôm experiencing right now is different. Every time I encounter a situation that I handle differently than I would have in the past, and when I hold true to who I am, I like, mentally fall apart afterward. I have trouble focusing, sometimes I dissociate, sometimes it makes me panic. I feel unsteady and uncertain and it makes me scared. 

I want to embrace this next stage and move into being who I know I can be, but part of me wonders if these feelings mean I‚Äôm just going to sabotage it all. I don‚Äôt know. I guess I‚Äôm wondering if this is normal. It feels strange.

136,Family Doesnt Respect *MY* Boundaries,"I know this is somewhat long but im looking for insight so please bare wih me. I'm 24F and I have come a long way in my recovery. As I've moved into adulthood and have gotten more serious about my recovery, I have noticed the further away I am from my family the better. I dont have issues with others to this degree, if im upset we'll talk it out calmly and in a mature fashion or we share our boundaries and what we need in the moment. When it comes to my family, despite them watch my journey with mental health and all kinds of therapy, their own behavior and actions seem to never improve or change. For example, Im on vacation with my family in new york to visit my sister and her husband and my baby niece. I just wanted to enjoy my time away and have fun in their company. I got irritated because we were trying to figure out plans and nobody was answering my calls/texts (were in different rooms) at this point, im not even acting out or screaming or being rude in any sort. even when im in control im aware that there can sometimes be a tone of irritation in my voice. and so do they... despite that I clearly set a boundary as simple as ""stop"" as I've learned to from therapy only for them to continue. instead of disengaging, they scream at me loudly telling me to calm down or continue invalidating me saying in the moment. Again, i was only mildly irritated. there was nothing major happening for me to \*normally outside of them\* get to a placewhere my anger gets so intense i cry. Instead of respecting my boundries after repeatedly saying ""Stop"" and giving me time to regulate myself (after pushing me to a point where i actually raised my own voice to again say STOP"" its as if they'd rather push my buttons until i get to point to where my anger gets so intense i react. And then they blame \*ME\* and feed into eachothers energy of being nasty laugh at me and sayi ""I cant deal with this"" or ""this is why we dont go on family vacations when all i want is respect and when I try to vent to the opposite party they dont want to deal with it either and tell me to stop. At 24, I've so tired of this despite living on my own already, Im finally at a point to where im ready to be financially independent, leave (them behind or go to a new state or go to school away from them) and pursue my own contentment. I'm not perfect, but there is no respect or awareness held when it comes to me in my family. Has anybody else gone through this? I'll take whatever advice I can get. I know I struggle with a disorder but I can't convince myself its just me anymore. I cant handle the invalidation of them thinking and acting like "" shes just crazy so we dont have to respect her cause its her fault"" just because of my disorder.

When he got back and saw that I had taken his belongings off the night stand he immediately got annoyed at me. All of his clothes are still in the room it was just his laptop, phone charger ect. To be honest I just thought if it was all there I would stare at it and cry all night, or he would just remove it himself anyway. 

He asked to sit down and talk with me and expressed how annoyed he was. I said sorry and that I was acting on the fact that he told me he didn't want to sleep with me and he is the one that wanted to sleep in the lounge room voluntarily. He then said it was understandable and then said so what are we just room mates now?

we are long distance. this isn't an issue. but she lives with her abusive parents and her sense of physical affection is messed up and she doesn't know how comfortable she will be with physical affection when we eventually meet up. it makes me really upset, i know i will follow her boundaries and she is very willing to cooperate with me and meet me half way because physical affection is so important to me. but i cant help but be upset. 

people in the past have rejected my affection towards them because they just hated me but kept me around anyway for years, them rejecting my affection was simply because they didnt like me. i internalized it and now my brain thinks thats the case with everyone.

i know realistically this isnt the case with her. i know she loves me, but i still have so many insecurities and doubts. most of the time, my bpd isnt an issue and i have no doubt she loves me. but when my bpd flares up, i feel like i live in a delusion and that she doesnt actually like me that much. its almost always caused by us talking about having to slowly build up her comfort with me.

i think the most insane part is that i know i'm going to have to have this process too. last time i was physically affectionate with someone i got so sick that i thought i was going to throw up. i know it's going to be a joint process but for some reason it just doesnt register??

is there any sort of coping mechanisms or self help therapies or even books i can read to help with this?? i feel like its the biggest issue in my relationship right now and it feels like it should be really easily solved.

148,"FPs are a trauma reenactment response, and I think this isn't talked about enough at all.","Why is it that wherever I go around finding resources and support on how to cope with FPs, it's always either:

- romanticising the FP relationship as ""omg extreme crushy dopamine obsession!""
- expecting the FP to fulfil all your BPD needs/being genuinely toxic as hell towards them (because surprise, what we have is a DISORDER) and then calling them ableist for daring to speak up about it
- like it's a normal thing with BPD (which ventures into anti-recovery territory)?

I find it genuinely disturbing, honestly. 

FPs are at their core a *trauma reenactment response*. They form because subconsciously, that person reminds you of a past caretaker or abuser, whose treatment of you as a child caused you to develop BPD to begin with. 

I theorise it's almost the brain's way of gaining control over past trauma or recreating past scenarios as it's what it subconsciously knows and grew to cope with.

Maybe they are nice to you in a way you wish your past caretakers could have been, or maybe they're dismissive because they're busy and then give you a lot of attention when they do have the time. They're most likely not abusive like your former caretakers, but unfortunately your brain gets hooked. 

That's why we split on them. If they were normal healthy things, we wouldn't freaking split on them. We wouldn't subconsciously *project our trauma onto them.* 

And yes, when this happens, it is very very easily to unintentionally hurt and be very very toxic towards an FP. They don't exist to heal our trauma, and they can't, anyway. At least not permanently nor healthily. Keeping you in that dopamine spiral is NOT it.

I hate how there's so many ""how to create a healthy FP relationship"" posts too. I feel like that term is a contradiction in itself, because an FP relationship is never going to be inherently healthy if the root cause is a trauma reenactment bond. If it's healthy then, well, it's not an FP anymore.

152,What Support Groups Have You Found for BPD?,"It sucks to be alone! It also sucks to not be able to afford group therapy! Share your experiences with free support groups from whatever perspective of recovery.

I've been going to two, with a generally positive experience. My experience so far is that it's lovely to have a support group at all; that's about 80% of the benefit. The details of the remaining 20% vary.

1) Emotions Anonymous is a recovery group modified from traditional 12 Step recovery programs like AA or NA. I've been going about once a week for about a year, now. The only requirement to join is a ""desire to become better emotionally."" It's very diagnosis-agnostic, so there are a diversity of psychological geogrpahy. Most of the people I meet there are bipolar, BPD, or suffering from PTSD, with a couple of DID cases. Meetings are supposed to be safe sharing spaces, meaning no unasked advice or commentary on others sharing. I'd say the major benefit other than a sharing space is the anonymity. The structure of the 12 steps might help some people and might frustrate others. The major con, to me, is the higher power stuff. 

https://emotionsanonymous.org/

2) The Icarus Project is a mutual-aid network and support system for people dealing with Mental Health Challenges that normally get called mental illness. I've attended about three meetings in my lifetime. Groups are organized autonomously and non-heriarchically, and groups provide a variety of functions. It is implicitly anarchist, and as such a lot of the literature it offers links mental health policy to repressive political apparati like the prison system. The major thing I like about Icarus is that it is harm reductive and self determinative regarding diagnosis, medication, and treatment options. The hardest part of making the groups happen is that it's hard to get political activists interested in mental health and it's hard to get emotionally debilitated people interested into politics. 

https://theicarusproject.net/

Oh, and Icarus has tons and tons of really good resources though, including a 1 page handout of crisis advice and space to write an advance directive. I highly recommend that anyone with BPD fill out a 1 page sheet on your needs during a crisis rather than let random medical professionals guess at your needs and preferences.

162,Look for help with BPD? Don‚Äôt contact Rose Skeeters.,"Rose runs a podcast called from Borderline to Beautiful and she has a mindset coaching business that she promotes on the podcast.  Rose states that she has BPD and has recovered. She says that she has come up with a way to help others to recover like her.  I started listening to the podcast and found it not only validating, but also helpful. She talks about truth and honesty a lot. She talks about operating through life with a moral compass.  All of that is great advice. After listening to a few episodes I decided to reach out to Rose directly and see if she would work with me.  She agreed and we started meeting for $189 an hour.  We worked together weekly and I started to really build trust with her.  My partner and I were having a lot of problems, and Rose knew about the depths of those.  My partner reached out to Rose and during their phone call she told my partner very private things that her and I spoke about in session. She then said to him, that she was only telling him this because she is my coach and not my therapist.  She then told me in the next session that she spoke with him. She did not tell me what they spoke about and then told me that she was allowed to do that because she was my coach and not my therapist.  I was crushed and yet continued working with her. Forgiveness was on my moral compass and I really wanted to believe that she knew what was best for me.  A few weeks later she strongly suggested that we have a couples session. I expressed that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable or in a good space and didn‚Äôt think it would be a good idea. She told me I needed to do it for my recovery.  So I chose to trust her. During that session, I did not handle myself well. I was overwhelmed and defensive.  She kept telling me that I needed to admit that my BPD was hard on my partner. That I had to say, ‚Äúyes this is hard for me but also hard for you‚Äù. I was confused and again, defensive and overwhelmed and asked why? She then told me that if I couldn‚Äôt say it, she could no longer work with me.  That was the last time I worked with Rose.  I have since started working with a real therapist, who is held accountable by an ethics board that I can report violations to, working on actual therapy and finding some success.  People with BPD are highly susceptible to influence and my belief is that Rose has taken on the identity of her, self described, corrective relationship husband Jay.

165,Question to those who are recovering from BPD - how long does it take to 'fix' identity issues?,"Hi everyone!

I am 28 (f) and I have been diagnosed with BPD \~2 years ago (I've been in therapy long before, but it was not helpful until I found good DBT therapist).

For 1 year I had a very intensive personal therapy and DBT trainings, finished it 1 year ago (the demand is high that's why my therapist let me go once she admitted I was stable enough), I am still doing exercises, reflecting a lot, and I feel like I am recovering.

Don't take me wrong - BPD is still part of my life, but life is *in order* now.  

Here's the trick - although I managed to gain distress tolerance skills, improved interpersonal communication, managing emotions etc - disturbed identity is something that I can't 'fix' yet.

I keep questioning where's me and where's the disorder, and it seems like the most difficult part of my recovery. This is one of the reasons why I am hesitant about getting into a new romantic relationship - I am scared that because I sometimes don't know what I want/need, this won't be healthy.

I'm starting to suspect that this is something that I cannot force and it will take years of life without BPD turmoil before I start feeling more 'solid'.

166,Feeling pretty confused/lost,"Hey everyone!

I‚Äôm trying to get some insight for my situation- I feel like romantic relationships ending or big fights really do a number on me in a way that brings my symptoms of BPD to light unlike any other anymore. Here‚Äôs some context for my current situation and maybe if you have any insight and or advice/thoughts, you can share? 

I‚Äôve been dating a guy for a year. I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that we are just such different people in some ways, especially in the beginning. To add to this, we come from different cultures (I‚Äôm from the states and he‚Äôs from France). He‚Äôs in therapy, and I would be if it were more accessible to me at this time. We both work really hard to empathize with each other and be incredibly open. He‚Äôs the best partner I‚Äôve ever had except for a few minor details. In the first few months of our relationship, I saw that he had Tinder on his phone (I wasn‚Äôt snooping, it was there on the screen when he was showing me something). I tried to be super calm about it and I broke up with him and left immediately. We stayed in contact for the following months but I was pretty set on being over it (something new for me at the time). Eventually, he won me over again and I was willing to come back because I had seen that he wasn‚Äôt messaging anyone and that he really was just swiping for validation as he claimed. It took about 3-4 months to recover from that. Fast forward to this past Valentine‚Äôs Day. Everything has been amazing, we‚Äôve been great, I had trusted him. In a very similar way to seeing Tinder, I saw that he had many messages from women in his DM‚Äôs. He let me look at them, and the only ones he had messaged were only fans models where he paid for content - no emotional or sexual conversation exchanged. This was something i at first thought I could deal with even though it had been an explicit boundary that had been crossed. I‚Äôm generally a pretty open person about these things but things but this issue here had been that he lied to me again. 

I‚Äôve been noticing a lot of ‚Äúi love you, go away‚Äù from myself and my reaction. I‚Äôm fine and then I‚Äôm enraged - because the situation and my feelings are so nuanced. I don‚Äôt want to teach someone that this is how they can treat me even if it is a fairly evident act of self sabotage on his part. I don‚Äôt feel his actions have anything to do with me and yet I‚Äôm so, so infuriated. I want to leave but I want to stay. I want to be close and I want him to show me he‚Äôs really sorry. I know my best course of action is probably to leave and hold my ground but I think other bpd people, regardless of recovery might know how this feels. I don‚Äôt want to be emotionally violent and draining and yet this situation makes me feel so triggered.

167,Need advice for healthy connection cutting,"I've come a LONG way with my BPD.   I've had a healthy relationship with a group of people for two years and ongoing now!  And now you're wondering what the titles for.

&#x200B;

Before I went to therapy, I found a group of people who helped support me after I had a falling out with an abusive friendgroup.  

They were incredibly healing for me, for a time.  I have done nothing to hurt them, and the majority of conflicts were things we talked over.

&#x200B;

I say majority, for a reason.  Because they...started to become cold at one point, started to revoke a lot of comfort they offered me, and stopped wanting to tell me about themselves.  I've recently discovered they've destroyed some things we've made together when I wasn't looking, to. 

And i've found out they treated one of my current healthy friends like absolute shit, and talking to them, i've discovered these people aren't nearly as healthy as they claim to be. 

&#x200B;

I do not think they're healthy for me, and the best option would just...be to cut them out. 

&#x200B;

But I have my pains.

They've changed my life, they bought me birthday presents, they've helped me more times than I can count, and there's still a lot of things I love, and like about them.  And cutting is so....painful.  I'm crying even thinking about it. 

The easiest thing for me to do is to ghost them, but the guilt of it would haunt me forever.   I think the best way to do this would be to thank them for everything, apologize I couldn't make everything up back, but tell them, ultimately...

It's just not healthy for me anymore.  And I want to focus on my health and recovery, I want to tell them to focus on theirs to (one of the them suffers from extreme anxiety with abandonment issues). 

&#x200B;

It's painful, I don't even know how to BEGIN processing how to...recover from that, all over again, or even begin to work up my courage.

I keep telling myself the truth is, we haven't talked in months and they probably care less for me now.  But it's still painful, I still want to be a better person even if they aren't.

169,Reassurance Needed - Fears of Abandonment,"I spent the most amazing day and night with a guy I've been talking to for a few days. It was perfect.

171,Stuck at moving forward. (Venting/just going through it),"So I'm really deep into my recovery and have recently become fully self-aware. I have know about the BPD for a year now and have made great strides in being a better person, but something eluded me. I was really unaware of just how toxic I can be in personal/intimate relationships, and damn I have ripped out some hearts. This has been something that really blindsided me, because, in theory, I try to be very reliable, trusting and  great partner. This is where my problem begans.

Once I began working on this part of myself, I rediscovered, yes rediscovered, that I am in a very toxic relationship. I discovered it about 8 years ago but didn't understand what I was dealing with, so I slipped right back into the trap. But... after spending over 11 years of our life together, having 2 kids and build the so called ""American Dream"", I have discovered I am married to a narcissist. She fed off me for all those years and I graciously gave her everything she could dream of, until I couldnt give anymore. It crippled me and led me to an unusual inpatient situation. I began getting better and stronger. 

I've always knew my wife suffered from co-morbidity, and we have been through a lot together. Even before we started building a life together, we were already extremely trauma bonded by professional situations outside of our control. So I have constructed a very well designed plan (I also have extreme OCD) with the help of my therapist, to actually help her and get her to change. 

Yes I know, ""you can't change a Narcissist."" But here's the catch, and if you don't believe do some research, but PwBPD have a very unique ability. Just like all the other women I have destroyed in my past relationships, 
I also have the ability to destroy narcissists, and that's just what I did. 

I have broken down her defenses and ripped her of her armor. Now as I stand above her, sword ready to strike, I hesitate. I see the small, broken and scared soul, that I have been manipulated to love, but it's still love. As I recollect on her past, and see how she got to now, and I know what her future can be. So I wait, patiently, ready to strike. As I gaze into her subconscious eyes, she knows it's time.  Either she'll be completely destroyed or she needs to began to grow stronger. As she starts unraveling our relationship, she began to see why I have labeled us ""The Demon and The Succubus,"" to which she replies to ""That sounds fun."" 

I know this is a ""patiences"" situation, but it tense and stressful. I know the outcome. Either we have to rebuild our relationship anew and aware, or we must completely destroy each other.

172,Inner child work and reparenting might have saved me,"Hey guys, I‚Äôve been going to therapy for about a year and a half now and early in my therapist started talking about inner child work. It has honestly been a game changer. I know not everyone has the time, money, support or other means for therapy so I wanted to share a tactic that has really helped me take care of myself when I wanted to do the opposite, or it can just be food for thought. 
A lot of people with BPD are prone to self-harm and self-deprecating habits that stem from our childhood due to childhood experiences, as well as survival tactics and defense mechanisms to protect ourselves from more trauma. My therapist told me to imagine myself as though I was my own child. Would I think think of my own child as worthless, not worthy or food or care? How would I take care of my child if they were sad? Would I treat them the same way I treat myself? Would I treat them the way my parents treated me and my feelings? Would I validate them? Would I rationalize things for them? I know this can be hard, especially for the less nurturing type of person, but we also all want to love and be loved. It is only a small part of the bigger picture, but when it comes to self-love and taking care of myself, it has played a huge role in my process of recovery. You cannot stop other people from abandoning you. That‚Äôs a harsh truth. But you do not have to abandon yourself out of feeling worthless or acts of self-loathing. I want to hear your thoughts and how you see it, or what your experience has been with reparenting yourself or even the lack thereof. 

Also, book recommendation: The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D. It‚Äôs a popular book, but for good reason. Bessel encapsulates trauma in a way that is easy to follow yet so profound and has brought a lot of pieces together. There are sensitive subjects in the book that he gently discusses in order to explain the manifestations of trauma. TW for sexual assault, violence, abuse, etc.

173,My Weird Hack for Splitting,"I‚Äôm in active recovery and in a healthy, happy partnership. I don‚Äôt deal with splitting a lot, but sometimes rejection will hit me just right and I‚Äôm plunged into the Uh-Oh Zone. 

First, if I‚Äôm out of control and don‚Äôt trust myself to speak, I make the ASL sign for ‚Äòrattlesnake‚Äô and indicate to my partner (non verbally) that I‚Äôm gonna go get back to safety by spending some time alone, self-soothing. He supports this 100% at any time, for however long I need. 

If I can still speak, I say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm dealing with some big emotions and I need to take care of myself. I will talk to you later.‚Äô We live together but he‚Äôs AMAZING at letting me do my own thing. 

Once I get myself safe (and ideally, somewhat soothed), I pull off the road to Splitsville and detour through the Friend Zone. 

We‚Äôve always said that our friendship is the most important thing, and that as long as we can figure out how to stay friends it‚Äôs not the end of the world if we‚Äôre not romantically compatible. So I sort of‚Ä¶fast forward to the worst possible outcome in my imagination. That we‚Äôre just friends. 

It instantly makes whatever situation I‚Äôm navigating seem more manageable and less dire. It reminds me that we are separate people, and that I exist whether I‚Äôm his girlfriend or not. 

Sometimes I set a timer and say, okay, for the next hour I‚Äôm going to force myself to pretend that we‚Äôve never dated, just always been really good friends. It‚Äôs weird, but it shifts my brain out of that dangerous place. 

I think this only works if there is trust and safety in the relationship, and if your symptoms manifest mainly in romantic relationships. I‚Äôve never split on a friend. 

Anyone do anything similar? I wish I could explain it better, but I don‚Äôt really understand why it works.

I (22F) feel things so deeply, and although my partner (of >4 years) is very sweet and supportive when I have mood swings or meltdowns in front of him, I can never tell him (30M) about the private hell I go through when we are apart. I am in a much better place now than I was 3 years ago. But recently living sober from weed has forced me to be with my huge emotions again. It's very difficult to write this, knowing I will not numb myself with THC afterwards.

I get incredibly insecure when he doesn't respond to my texts. I am incredibly hurt when he leaves me hanging even for a little bit. For example, even when he told me he was too busy to hang out, I wrote long long texts at 3 AM pleading to spend an evening with him. And although I felt it was very sincere and genuine emotions I was portraying, I felt hideously embarrassed and deleted before he woke up. But now again, he is late on the video call he promised over the weekend. I have already cried multiple times today about this. In some ways, I wish I hadn't deleted the texts, so he could see how viciously I am feeling about this, maybe he would be more understanding of it all. But also it just isn't fair for me to beg and plead while he is asleep when I think I know how he will respond when he wakes up. 

The worst part of this is, the moments of heightened insecure attachment leave me feeling so rejected and so desperate, often in the hours or moments leading up to us hanging out. But when I see him, he is expecting to see a happy bubbly version of me, and I instinctively snap into a frantic idealization instead, and happily forget the hours or sometimes days of agony leading up to it.

It is made much worse by some notable trauma he inflicted on me earlier in our relationship. We have had positive and healing conversations about it, but I cannot help but be aware that I am in a trauma bond at this point. I don't think he 'leaves me hanging' any more than a normal relationship, I don't think he does it to hurt me. But there are other highly questionable dynamics in our relationship where I do feel he plays on my emotions to elicit a certain response from me. On the other hand, maybe this is just what love will always be like for me with Bpd. 

I'm already embarrassed to have typed this. I don't know if these huge feelings are because it's a part of my sober BPD brain, or if I am just very deep in a toxic relationship with someone I have feelings for.

I honestly believe recovery is possible for me, and I thought I was doing very well until I stopped smoking weed, and am faced with no way to eject myself out of my body.

176,Recently Diagnosed But Can't Find Treatment,"I was diagnosed with BPD by my psychiatrist a few months back. It makes sense for me, I've related to the symptoms for years. Unfortunately, my psychiatrist doesn't do therapy, and there were issues with my previous therapist involving my privacy and I chose to end my relationship with her. When I did so, I was removed from the waitlist for a DBT specialist and a place in DBT group therapy, which means I now have to deal with this diagnosis on my own until I can find a new treatment opportunity. As of yet, I haven't done any DBT because of this situation. 

I don't want to keep sabotaging my life and feeling awful. I want to improve and gain skills that will help me cope and keep my relationships.

Knowing BPD was responsible for it doesn't alleviate it though.  Lately it's been a different kind of looking back.  I'll suddenly start thinking about how I wasted my best years, sort of like Uncle Rico in Napoleon Dynamite.  I think about how different my life would have turned out if I didn't have BPD holding me back.  I can't go back and I can't do those things now at this point in my life- I can only cope with the ramifications of my poor life's decisions.  The anxiety of it keeps me awake at night.  I think about how I had so much talent for a couple different things and now it's too late.  The worst part is that I understand now how I could have fixed those issues then.  Ultimately I suppose this is an issue with acceptance.  I need to accept that I squandered my life and accept that I can't Donnie Darko wormhole back to the past and do it over better.

178,Getting over the final frontier?,"Hi, I have never posted here before. Hello. I (26F) have been diagnosed with BPD since I was 16. Things were incredibly chaotic in my life until I was about 22, and then I began to grow more self-aware. I have been steadily improving; though of course I've had periods of intense reactivity and disorder along the way. 

At this point, it feels like my self-awareness has maxed out. A lot of the time I can recognize when I'm becoming activated, and am able to stop my impulse to freak out at someone, or self-harm, or spiral or whatever. But there are still other times when my emotions become too powerful, and I get blown away by them. Especially anger or shame. Many of those instances, I'm even somewhat aware that I'm reacting intensely/inappropriately - but I still can't stop myself from reacting. 

My question is - how does one surpass this final frontier, and get to a place where you have your emotional reactivity under control? 

I'm really sick of being like this, and sometimes I hurt people emotionally, which is horrible. But I don't even feel bad until afterwards, when the emotional tide has ended. I would like to never hurt anyone again, but it's like I won't ever fully tame my emotions. 

I've gotten probably 75% better but I can't get over that last quarter. I've been through therapy many times, I've studied CBT, DBT, mindfulness, meditation, PTSD recovery. I know all the tools and tactics. I know why I'm like this and why my feelings surface.

179,Can I talk about trauma here?,"Recovery is such a strange experience. Before we go on, I‚Äôm not gonna talk about anything specific or explicit. But I do want to talk about how trauma feels like this permanent brand on your psyche and it just feels like it‚Äôs unchangeable.

But as we know from battling BPD, nothing is exactly unchangeable. That‚Äôs one of the most insurmountable things I think a lot of us face - the beginning concept that BPD itself is this unbeatable thing. I‚Äôm past that point in my journey at this point in time - I know it‚Äôs treatable, and I‚Äôve been living with it, and getting better. I‚Äôm very thankful for that.

However, trauma is something I still can‚Äôt quite grapple with. Remembering trauma triggers a lot of my BPD traits like no other. I think the worst part of it is that I feel like the world keeps moving and changing while I feel like this immobile, unmovable block in my psyche is going to haunt me forever. And then I get angry. And when I get angry I split. And when I split I have these delusional thoughts about people who have consistently loved me. And I have to work hard to rein the thoughts in and to not give in to my demons.

In 2021 I grew the most unhealthy attachment to my ‚Äúfavourite person‚Äù. I felt like I was pushed into his arms though from everyone around me. To be fair they were all calling our relationship out and I saw it as a way to ‚Äúrebel‚Äù against everyone. I got stuck In this vicious cycle where he used my BPD to his advantage. Anyway come to August 2022 and my baby sister had just been born, I finally found my escape out of this hole that was slowly killing me. I went back to my mother‚Äôs house that night to get myself ready to be an older sister to then be assaulted and broken up with 2 hours after the best thing had happened to me. We ended everything through the courts and since then he‚Äôs sneakily came back into my life without showing it. He‚Äôll unblock me and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù send me things, his friends will watch my social media accounts, his mum will show up to my local shopping centre and death stare me and my new partner. All of that aside in August I started my cycle of self destruction and hate for life, I later made new friends who showed me positive things to do and better ways to think and it stuck with me. I started to heal and grow and it was going great all the way until July 2023 when I lost my bestfriend, he was planned to come and have a holiday so we could catch up. Just a week before he was set to come he got into an accident. I found out through multiple people texting me to ask me if it was true, that moment that I opened my phone a huge part of me stopped living that day, I‚Äôve been trapped in that exact moment. My mental health started to decline, rapidly. I started to take everything out of my family and my partner, at one point my partner had left. I started my recovery again and I felt I was doing great until again another slip in my journey and I started working a depressing job at a cafe where I‚Äôm under valued and verbally abused for things I know I‚Äôm doing right. I started to feel attacked by everyone, my family, my partner and now my bosses. I took the pain of what my boss gave me and took it out on my partner to then take that anger and pass it on to my mum.

181,BPD and New Relationship,"BPD Girly Pop Relationship Advice

I need some help. I recently started a relationship with someone. We have been dating for about a month and a half. I have done a lot of therapy and inner work for my borderline personality disorder, but this new relationship is flaring up everything. Triggers that haven‚Äôt happened since the beginning of my recovery five years ago are resurfacing. My nervous system has been a complete wreck. I cannot tell if it‚Äôs my BPD/ trauma that is causing my flairs, or if the person I‚Äôm with just isn‚Äôt right for me. 

I‚Äôve been emotional and attempted to explain anxious attachment style to him. At first, he appeared really receptive but I am having to express my needs week after week. I explained that canceling, inconsistency, and lack of follow through create blocks for me when building trust. 

I had a minor surgery a week ago and over a month ago, he agreed to be my designated driver to and back since I couldn‚Äôt drive myself. Two days before surgery I checked in, and he told me no. He claims it‚Äôs because we didn‚Äôt talk about it enough for him to make plans accordingly, but this is hard for me to understand because I told him over a month ago and he said he‚Äôd make arrangements. Then, my surgery almost was cancelled because the hospital does not allow Uber to pick up patients but I had no other options for pick up/ drop off. 

Next, he said he‚Äôd make dinner for me after work. After work came, and I started driving to him place and he said he forgot and he wanted to cancel. This was one day after speaking about how it‚Äôs important to me to only commit to plans you are able to follow through with. I also acknowledged people are human, but consistent cancelling is not good for me. 

There have been other times where we have had great dates and fun times together. I could write more but I‚Äôm really struggling to see if it‚Äôs my disorder causing problems or if I am not okay with who he is. 

He also said he‚Äôd come to my birthday and meet my friends. Then today, he again went back on his word, saying he doesn‚Äôt think he wants to and that it is too early. I feel like I‚Äôm communicating and he isn‚Äôt doing anything different in response.

182,slowly but surely I'm making it,"It's been a while since i posted on this reddit but so much has changed and grown. I grew a lot, got help, made new friends, found lovers along the way and with each passing day, I began to heal despite the new pain coming in. 

I don't really know where I am on my BPD remission journey... But it's possible. 

It's possible to have healthy relationships in both friends and romance without splitting so bad. It's even easier when they all understand that you're a human and need a chance to process and hold you accountable for the the things that hurt them. 

They gave me a chance to grow, believed in my potential to heal and be better, they aided me with peer review and accountability and of course with every friend and romantic partner i lost, I begin to realize, newer, better ones come in and offer new perspectives and different ways to cope and grow. 

I sit here now, writing this as I do my Relationship DBT questions on two new friends i've met, and reading through it, reflecting back on it, makes me remember how far I've genuinely have come. 

Abandonment is a horrible thing to heal from. It's hard it sucks and it's painful and sometimes healing isn't for everyone. But the friends I have now, the ones I make, and the ones who stay with me, they make me feel less alone. And yes while I'll rehash old traumas and deal with the symptoms as they come, 

I can honestly say that life has been a lot better the more i continue my healing journey from bpd. 

And BPD is terminal. It can't be cured with anything. Therapy and medications and learning ways to make things easier and healthier for yourself through coping strategies may be the closest thing to a ""cure"" but it's a lot of hard work. 

it's hard work that I actively continue in order to keep healthy relationships, strong boundaries and honest communications with, because I deserve a chance to be happy and live a healthy life while living with BPD. 

So I guess if you're reading this, It's possible. It's possible to heal and to grow from the severity of it all. While it'll always be with you, You can find comfort in knowing that it's at least possible to ease the symptoms, to live a normal and healthy life style as Someone wBPD. So to whoever needed a sign to not give up and to see if it was possible, 

It is. 

Here's to the long progression of my own recovery, and all the beautiful places and people it will lead me to. 

And Here's to you, the reader.

183,can't get a diagnosis!,"So I am usually not one to self-diagnose. I have been under psychiatric care since I was 13 (now 23) and have been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, social phobia, OCD, anorexia, ADHD, and PTSD and I typically defer to my doctors/therapists. But it's pretty fucking obvious to me that there is something bigger going on here... how would a person have 7 unrelated mental illnesses?! I have been on a cocktail of psychiatric medications since age 13, tried every type of therapy that I could and I still feel like I'm grasping at straws and trying to treat things that are just symptoms of a larger problem.

I have done A LOT of research (I'm talking hours upon hours) and am reasonably confident that I have Quiet BPD. I think the reason that no practitioner has caught onto it is because I internalize everything and I only lash out at myself. I don't really show any external signs of having BPD, however I have 8/9 BPD characteristics in the DSM (for context, diagnosis is appropriate with 5/9 symptoms). 

When I brought this up with my psychiatrist, she said she doesn't really see typical BPD traits in me (which I think is because I have quiet subtype and it's highly internal) and that she is hesitant to diagnose BPD because of the stigma it carries... okay, but I am confident that I meet the diagnosis standards under the DSM and need to be treated for BPD instead of the other seven issues, as the BPD & PTSD are no doubt what is causing everything else. 

I really don't want to self diagnose. But I have brought this up with multiple therapists, psychiatrists, etc. and my ED recovery coach is the only one to see the truth in what I'm saying. I *know* something deeper is going on. I have felt this way my whole life and only when reading about quiet BPD was I able to understand the chronic emptiness that has caused all of the other issues.

I was so shaken up when I started..it felt like preemptively mourning parts of myself, if that makes sense. But I stuck with it and 3 months in I'm seeing a tremendous amount of progress.

 I have an hour with a one on one and 2.5 hours of skills group every week in addition to phone coaching during business hours. The appointments with my one on one have shown me so much about how and why I developed the patterns I have. Getting to the root of... everything...is helping me cultivate self compassion which I have never had previously and learning to use skills and consequently reducing destructive behaviours is helping me gain a level of confidence I didn't think possible.

Mind you I'm 38 and have been ""doing the work"" for 4 years now, (I didn't receive the BPD diagnosis until 2 years ago, I just thought all my symptoms were from bipolar disorder, which I also have).

 It's just so wild to me to feel like recovery is actually possible. Not like I expect BPD to ever fully recede but I do believe it's possible to experience long periods of remission. I want to siphon every drop of this 6 month program.

My therapist told me, ‚ÄúDo you know that what are you doing right is not correct, it‚Äôs not you?

Some questions I have,

1. Is this common for a BPD episode or a manic episode?

2. Do borderlines ever want to reconcile with their healthy/supportive ex partners after going through medication, intensive DBT and CBT? Even if this is a matter of years into recovery? We are friends now, and my ex borderline is extremely sorry and feeling beyond guilty for hurting me. She cares about me **immensely** and is still extremely sweet to me. She does not want a relationship but does not want one in general. The mention of wanting to be with nobody, not wanting a husband, and a future alone sounds like borderline black-and-white thinking. 

Also she mentioned in the past while we were still together and her BPD was triggered,

>I am not able to have a relationship with you or nobody else because It **never** going to work 
out because of my condition.

It sounds like very dichotomous thinking that you‚Äôd
see with BPD.

This woman felt **destroyed** when she knew she hurt me and broke down crying to tell me she was sorry for pushing me away, that she just wants the best for me.

189,Attachment Progress,"i am 20 and first started the diagnostic process for bpd when i was about 16, but due to parental interference i wasn't able to actually get diagnosed until after i turned 18. one of my main issues has to do with attachment, i have a hard time making friends, so usually i would stick to a small group of people, but i would always find myself closer to just one member of the group, it would start out innocently enough, it would be that i was just ""more comfortable"" with that person, but would quickly turn into them being my fp.

at that point they would be less my friend, and more like an obsession. i would push away everyone else, and unfortunately, with many of the people i found myself attached to in this way, they would encourage it. i guess certain people like the attention or the intensity? that is until i would inevitably split on them of course. usually i would split on them several times, until i looked back at the relationship and realized that it just, sucked all around, and i would cut off contact, which was extremely difficult, but i somehow managed it. then i would move on again, and the cycle would start back over. 

yesterday, i had a conversation with my most recent fp. we're both cluster b, and we were mutually each other's fps, and had been for close to a year. recently, we've both gone through a lot of changes, i started uni and a new job, and they're about to get engaged. i've also recently picked up a new hobby, that has been enabling me to make a lot more friends, and i've realized that the intensity of my relationship with my fp, has dulled, and it's the same for them. they are still extremely important to me, and i still would consider them to be my closest friend, but i don't know if they're my fp anymore. i don't think that this point i would say i have one for sure, and there are no other likely candidates either.

i'm really proud of both myself, and my friend for this, because we're no longer as codependent, and i think this is going to make our friendship much healthier. we're both getting better, and that's a really good thing. i feel like this is a huge step forward in my recovery process, and wanted to share it with others :)",1663524566.0,False,12,3,nikamontag,None,xhnp5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/xhnp5q/attachment_progress/

Here it goes- recently I have been focusing on self awareness. Yesterday & today, I was able to identify several times where I typically would make decisions that are sabotaging or counter active to my growth and recovery. In light of recognizing the choice I normally make, identifying why I make the choice, seeing the negative impact it would or could have, or has had in the past, I chose not to make the choice. In doing so, not only did I curb my impulses, but I was able to step back from a situation and see it from a different angle. This is huge for me. This allowed me to say no to putting my priorities in front of someone else‚Äôs desires because it filled my need to be needed. This means that I chose myself to be more important than my need to meet someone else‚Äôs needs so I get attention. These are all very huge steps for me.

192,Saying goodbye to CPN,"Hi all. I'm looking for advice and insight...
I've been having treatment for BPD for 4 years now. I've had different treatment forms and with different professionals for each, though I've consistently always alongside this had my designated Community Psychiatric Nurse. She is the first professional I came into contact with from the beginning, was the one to diagnose and treat me for BPD (her speciality area) and the first person I opened up to about everything; my past, my childhood, my raw inner self, my perceived 'worst' parts, with no judgment and an almost 'motherly' type style, something I'd never had or experienced before. Needless to say, this relationship although kept professional, has had a profound impact on me in both my discovery and recovery in dealing with BPD and with general life. As I grew and evolved and got better through combined treatment, our appointments got spaced out more and more and I no longer felt the lifeline type 'need' for her, and certainly don't have her in my mind as a sort of FP at this stage. However, I'm due tommorow to have my required '6 month break' from all treatment. She has informed me that if I need to come back for more treatment after 6 months of being discharged, that it won't be her I get assigned to again, so this is goodbye, not necessarily to treatment but to her. I think that this would be difficult at any stage but I've just come off the back of the hardest few months in a long time, and am only just getting back on my feet with things, so despite I am a lot better at coping and understanding myself than I was when I first started treatment with her, this mandatory break and goodbye, although required, couldn't have come at a worse time. She is the first and only person to have understood me, more than myself, given me insight, support, and non judgemental compassion. The one and only person who gets 'me' and this disorder in a way my family, friends and partner could never, something so priceless with BPD. Although I don't require her support in quite the same way as I once did, I still don't feel ready or confident with the idea of facing life and its struggles, my struggles, without her. I knew this day would need to come at some point, but I don't feel ready, probably magnified with what I've been through lately. I don't know how to face this. It's tommorow, I'm dreading it and what comes after it, how I'll cope with the uncertainty of the future and what it may bring, without the comforting thought of knowing she's there in the background IF I ever really needed her... I liken it to the imagined comfort and confidence a child has knowing they're cycling a bike unsupported for the first time without their parent's hand on them stabilising them, but watching on, waiting to be there if needed and that being the thing that makes the child feel able to keep going and doing it alone. Any words of support and advice regarding this and how to face it would be much appreciated ü§ç",1676565457.0,False,5,12,Deceptively_Honest_,None,113utf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/113utf8/saying_goodbye_to_cpn/
193,How to support my partner,"My partner recently came out as having BPD. They knew about the diagnosis but kept it a secret for the year we‚Äôve been together.

My immediate boundary was they need to be on their meds and see a therapist on a regular basis. We even saw a therapist together, but they had a bad time because they session wasn‚Äôt supporting their abusive behaviour. I want to stay but we can‚Äôt stop fighting and I‚Äôm at the point where I need to leave because of the hurt and broken trust. I‚Äôm trying to save this relationship, but they threaten suicide or get angry and drive away at 4AM. 

This person is in an early stage of their recovery and I‚Äôm worried they are not well enough to really understand how hurtful they‚Äôve been to me. I need some distance because they lied, but what is the best way to support someone with BPD? Is there anything I can do, or is it up to them if they want to or are ready to be healthy. What does healthy BPD even look like?

This has all been so sudden and I‚Äôm tired and scared and confused. All I want is for my partner to be happy and healthy, but not at the expense of my health.",1568315561.0,False,7,5,BPDrelationship9,None,d3cs6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/d3cs6o/how_to_support_my_partner/
194,I think I developed OCD,"It‚Äôs the best label I can give it, but paired with my PTSD and also fear of my BPD being out of control, I have been policing my own thoughts, actions and emotions very hard and I think that the paranoia of lashing out or possibly being unreasonable in a situation has lead or is leading me towards OCD.

I tend to analyze disagreements in hindsight and weigh out everything and want to fact check before I try to decide whether I was in the wrong or not.

It hinders me from reacting appropriately when someone is actually being an asshole to me and it also makes me freeze up because I‚Äôm stuck in a mind loop of analyzing myself.

I journal obsessively (almost daily and sometimes twice a day).

I suppress my emotions out of fear that I will overreact and say/do something bad.

It‚Äôs bad. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm having an episode of psychosis because I‚Äôm hardly ever here in the present.

A thought I‚Äôve been having recently is anger and resentment towards people who don‚Äôt check their own behaviors.

I‚Äôve been so hyper vigilant about my own behaviors that I spot shitty things others do without consideration or care about how it affects the people are them.

This really applies to a few of the personal people in my life, namely my romantic partner and my parents.

I know it‚Äôs good to not be codependent and worry too much what others think about you, but then some people legitimately don‚Äôt think about or care how their actions and decisions are going to hurt someone.

Or they understand what it means and choose to do it anyways which hurts even more.

I know we can only control ourselves and we have to choose to not stick around when others treat us badly. Sometimes we need to choose our battles and fight.

But I‚Äôm getting real fed up with folks who have so much to say about others behaviors when they themselves take no time to observe their own.

Just the ramblings of a borderline in recovery. I guess I‚Äôm still codependent because I‚Äôm worrying too much about how I affect others. Oi vey.",1636877476.0,False,2,9,SoftBoiledPotatoChip,None,qtl9ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/qtl9ck/i_think_i_developed_ocd/
195,Being BPD and dealing with the shit non-BPD people say,"I was reading another post similar to this topic, but this is something I‚Äôve been noticing recently and it‚Äôs been annoying me a lot.

I‚Äôve been in recovery from my BPD for a while. I am most definitely not out of the woods and I doubt I ever completely will be.

But I *am* trying. Nobody can tell me I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve gotten a lot better about my behaviors and how I see things.

I‚Äôm less controlling, more detached, a bit more secure and I can recognize when I‚Äôm dysregulating.

I police my feelings less and my reactions more.

But I realized a lot of us pwBPD are given too bad of a rep sometimes.

I know we can be sensitive and tend to project sometimes, but in my previous relationship with a (what I deem to be abusive partner) I realized so do they.

They were also sensitive to criticism and would deny ever being wrong at all. They projected all the time and assumed they knew what I was thinking and feeling.

They‚Äôd put me down and call me bad names, purposely say things to try and trigger me because getting a reaction out of me was entertaining for them.

Long story short, other people need to be accountable for their own actions too.

I know for a fact that I definitely do not have an issue recognizing my flaws. I think I‚Äôm the one person in this world that blames myself the most for being imperfect actually ü§°

Hello, I have BPD. Self loathing is part of the package.

And I actively want to become a better and more likable person. But me having BPD doesn‚Äôt absolve others from their own shitty behaviors.

This has made me realize that I don‚Äôt have to tolerate snarky comments or abuses from folks around me.

I‚Äôm not perfect, but I know my heart and my intentions and I‚Äôm not going to stick around people who continue to intentionally trigger me even when I‚Äôve explicitly asked them
not to.

I can‚Äôt control their actions, but I can certainly choose not to spend any of my
time or energy around them.

197,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,10,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/
198,I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore,"I think I‚Äôm ruining my life in the process of getting better. I started going to therapy again and this time I hope I last longer than just a couple months. Overall, it feels like I‚Äôm getting somewhere, but it seems like the more I try to break these habits the stronger they get and that‚Äôs where I slip up.
At the moment I am at home from a day at work that barely started this morning. My partner lied about having a doctors appointment so he could get us out of there seeing that I couldn‚Äôt stop crying in silent. People at work liked me at some point in the beginning, but now it feels like they avoid me or at the very least are constantly wondering what happened to me. I used to talk to most people and mingle and I‚Äôve always craved connection with others, but I lack many social skills or rather the anxiety is so big that just ends up making me extremely socially awkward and scared. I‚Äôve also always felt at a disadvantage being from a different cultural background. I promised I was going to get through the day and I applied the mindlful breathing exercises I‚Äôve learnt at therapy and on my own, but they didn‚Äôt work. I kept going back in the room and crying just for being there, for hearing people laugh and connect with each other while I felt like I killed the vibe just by being there. 
I am also ruining my relationship with my partner, and have began to consider breaking up with him because I don‚Äôt want to drag him down with me. He‚Äôs fully supportive and wants to be there for me but it‚Äôs like the more he tries to love me the more I reject him.

199,"I feel like I‚Äôm being used, a fill-in, I need a reality check","So I‚Äôm on the cluster b spectrum as well and didn‚Äôt know. I got into a relationship with someone who had BPD, and neither of us knew. 

I was the one who got hurt when she split, she got hurt too but it was moreso her delusions which caused the splitting.  This was one of the ways we discovered something was wrong and lead to the diagnosis.  

Anyway, I can‚Äôt talk to ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù about this because their advice is to demonize cluster b people and they only say to ‚Äúrun!‚Äù  I don‚Äôt find it helpful, I‚Äôve been through years of therapy and I know what it‚Äôs like to see danger in everything and I empathize. I‚Äôm not an angel either and I‚Äôve been lucky to have people who offered me grace and redemption 

Long story short, when I began to understand our relationship was abusive, my ex and I went no contact and it‚Äôs been over 2 years. I spent the time single and in therapy and wished her the best 

We‚Äôve recently reconnected and it‚Äôs only been because she too has been in weekly therapy for at least a year now.  I immediately noticed we have new abilities regarding taking ownership of our emotions, and we‚Äôve been talking every day.  For the most part it feels healthy, there‚Äôs been nothing strange with the correspondence. In fact, I enjoy it. 

It‚Äôs platonic enough‚Ä¶ we do reminisce about memories and such, but we mainly just share our days with one another and discuss health and therapy. She told me she missed my friendship and wishes things ended differently.  

Thing is, I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs just using me to fill a void until she gets into another relationship.  She did tell me she was single and I mean, I‚Äôm not her bf, she can do as she pleases

‚Ä¶. But I don‚Äôt want to get used or be a fill-in for anyone.  

She sent me a meme today that said something like: 

‚Äúme: I‚Äôm not going to be in relationships for now, I need to work on myself

The moment someone attractive looks at me: I‚Äôm ready to get hurt again‚Äù

I‚Äôm not interested in making jokes like this given what happened between us, not interested in being some stable friend for her while I watch her ruin more relationships, and herself.

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm catastrophizing and spiraling over something that was just a joke meme and it triggered me?

I just want to be the healthiest I can be and sometimes I can‚Äôt tell if my fears are valid. 

I don‚Äôt want to be used.  I don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt.  But I also don‚Äôt wanna run away if there‚Äôs no real reason to and I know at least part of what I‚Äôm feeling is triggered anxiety. But that also doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs not a real concern underneath it all. My go-to reaction is to jump ship and run away. But I‚Äôve learned that isn‚Äôt healthy, so here I am trying to figure out what I feel and why, and then a healthy way to address those feelings. 

She wants to meet up in person and a part of me does‚Ä¶. Not with any expectations other than authenticity from both of us. I‚Äôm so happy that she put in the hard work to face her trauma, I‚Äôm happy for myself for doing the same.   But I think full recovery is a life long journey; one that I can understand.

I have never physically hurt him in any way, but I recurrently get into the same argument, which he has begun to vocalize more freely is really hurting him. Obviously, both because I love him and don't want him to leave me, I would do anything to stop hurting him. But I need help figuring my way out of this self-contained paradox that is plaguing me. 

In an argument we had today, which started from a facetime call when I began to rant about some interpersonal troubles I was having with friends and then became embarrassed / felt like he didn't understand me and ended the call, he asked me whether I was trying to hurt him on purpose. I said no, I am trying to understand why someone so stable would stay with me(this is a continual issue I face, embedded in the fact that I don't see myself as healed yet and thus convince myself I'm undeserving of secure attachment). He has heard this before, and undoubtedly he will hear it again.

I asked him why he thought I was trying to hurt him, and how I could stop.

We agreed we can both take space, as every phone call with him runs me into emotional overdrive and I'm left alone without any present comfort, but I really want to use this opportunity to explore my cognitive dysfunctions / dissonance so I can at least get a little bit better. I know recovery doesn't happen overnight, but I've been on this healing journey for long enough that regression makes me lose hope in the endgoal altogether.

I am seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow. I just took the whole summer to taper off of cymbalta and detox from adderall and really don't want to go back on antidepressants, but as I am about to enter my last year of university and work two jobs I know I need some medication; my current plan is to ask for adderall xr and rely on TM and yoga to cope with emotional instability, but I don't know if it will be enough. I also am no longer to see my last/only therapist, and am really hesitant to look for and begin with a new one as I've had such disheartening experiences in the past.

201,"Loneliness, 'masculinity, ' and this neurodivergence","Yesterday I attended a Zoom-based men's support group (I've not shared with any about my BPD diagnosis/neurodivergence) and the facilitator asked each of us what our biggest stressor has been this year.¬† I've been working hard on pausing before I speak, so I listened to a couple others.¬† I could relate- uncertainty of work/income, expectations about traditional Male societal roles, even politics. 

I thought about my contribution to the conversation- there have been a number of huge stressors- money,¬† bpd, separation from (ex?)wife...¬† but when he came to me, without even thinking,¬† I blurted- 

""Loneliness. "" 

The call got silent. The other men sympathized but offered support in ways that didn't *quite* fit- apps for affirmations, retreat centers in my country of residence (you can't swing a dead monitor lizard without hitting a recovery center here), and the vague and uncomfortable ""you'll be all right dude."" 

I think many cultural expectations of men or definitions of masculinity idolize this 'silent strong rock' template. We're expected to suck it up and deal, we're expected to only display emotions in certain times and ways (cried at mom's funeral? Of course.¬† Cried at the end of a movie? Ohhhh sensitive boi but ok. Cried because you've had an argument? Oh you pussy, I'm gone)...and even the name of this well meaning group is 'MAN UP!'¬† Yikes. 

I've felt better in the past two weeks since I joined this sub. I feel seen and heard and by those who experience things as I do. 

But actual loneliness,¬† no one in physical proximity that you feel safe with.¬† I have my cat... and that's it.¬† 

As things slowly heal into an ugly but possibly functional scar on the relationship between me and my FP (who leads our China organization, who was the Lennon to my McCartney for years, who is my ex wife's BFF and now roommate too), I tentatively shared in a recent conversation that loneliness is still a remarkably difficult challenge. She declared ""you're not alone- you have us, we're always here"" 

She means it- but doesn't get it. Her ""always here"" comes with boundaries and exists over the internet. Her ""here"" is thousands of kilometers from mine.

Before her, the only other people I knew who had BPD were my older sister, her two best friends & my mum. I now also have another close friend with BPD who I've known for a few months.


Before her my BPD was also very intense & just fucking bad. A total shit show. Always splitting, always self harming & suicidal as well as letting random guys use me because I felt so insecure, goes on. The whole lot.


When we became friends, we were close straight away & told eachother a lot of personal stuff since we meet on my old mental illness meme account. Luckily we live in the same country so when I visited my old state where she lived in June last year, we meet in person after about a year of talking & we've been best friends ever since only seeing eachother three times irl (the last time we caught up was in Jan, she visited & stayed in my state for a week).in the distantish future she wants to move up here to the state I live in & move in together which honestly would be so fun, especially with my other friends so hopefully it happens. 


We are always really open with eachother & nothing seems to be off limits with us because we can confide in eachother about everything, some things we say I probably wouldn't be comfortable telling my boyfriend. Think same goes for her. There's no shame & we can pull eachother up on our shit, be honest about what the other needs to do & always supporting eachother & making eachother feel better when shit goes down. It's one of the coolest friendshios I've ever had & I feel so greatful for her, to have someone I can openly talk to who fully gets it & that's a mutual feeling.


My BPD has gotten much better this yearish. Part of that is having someone to talk to who gets it, who won't judge me & really cares as I just said. I hope that we'll stay friends for a long time if not life because apparently that's possible lol. What's also cool is that we're both going to become nurses!! Well probably.

anyway, I've been ""dating"" this 2nd year for the past 9 months, but I have never called him my BF/ I always insist we are just friends. He knows about my BPD and is an angel. so kind and forgiving and takes SUCH good care of me/ gives me space when I need it, etc.

&#x200B;

buttttt I've finally realised he has a problem with alcohol and I'm just not cool with that. I tried to give him an ultimatum, but not. by sort of just saying I'm not ok with your drinking, if this continues, ill need to seriously consider whether or not I can welcome you in my life. well he made 1 appt with a therapist (but he's been seeing a therapist for the past 2 years and nothing has changed, so not sure why this will be any different)

&#x200B;

anyway just yesterday he called me, drunk, and my policy is, that I don't engage with him when he is drunk, so as soon as I noticed he was under the influence I let him know that I would be getting off the phone, and I did. normally thats all, I would see him the next day and well it would just be. but, this time, I blocked him! I try REALLLY hard to not BPD all over him, but I also don't want to be a doormat... you know?

&#x200B;

this is one of the hardest parts of recovery, knowing what is BPD and knowing what is normal and standing up for myself.

&#x200B;

I blocked him because historically when he's drunk he will send me 20 texts, which is distressing, and I have a boundary that I won't reply. but its hard when the texts are so distressing. so I just blocked him so I wouldn't even receive the texts. then this morning I debated unblocking him, but then got locked in indecision so did nothing. he is still blocked. I feel bad, but I don't know what else to do.

204,"i have bpd, and my girlfriend cheated and i feel guilty","(this is my first post ever lol hi, I‚Äôve been in bpd recovery for 6 months :) )
I found out my girlfriend cheated on me 3 weeks ago. on the night I found out, I was angry for maybe 5 minutes before she burst into tears. I comforted her for hours, and even though I was enraged, I held it all in because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her. and then she told that she resented me for not wanting to be in a poly relationship, which I made a clear boundary on (my therapist helped) 6 months ago. I asked her to leave, kissed her goodbye, and told her to stay safe, but the need to help her kept me asking for updates every  few hours. the next day she attempted and left me with the responsibility of being the one who received the goodbye text and her location. and still, after all of that, I blamed myself. i was overwhelmed with anger and bittersweet numbness, but every time I answered her calls from the hospital, I was kind. when she came out of the hospital, it all came out. I had written 40+ angry messages to her in my notes app, and it was all spilling over (maybe splitting?). since then, and especially since the night I found out, I haven‚Äôt really felt anything toward her. I don‚Äôt cry when I listen to songs that remind me of her, or when I look at the photos of us. hell, we text everyday and I don‚Äôt feel anything. if we‚Äôre fighting, I‚Äôm enraged. but if she‚Äôs sad over us ending, I‚Äôm giving her ‚Äúa safe space to be heard‚Äù since we were best friends, im there for her. I officially broke up with her days ago, and since then she hasn‚Äôt stopped reaching out. we were fighting every night because I was ‚Äúhurting her feelings‚Äù by telling her how I felt. and then it turned into her begging me for a way to keep us together, and when she said that I almost agreed (splitting?). i told her no after hours of silence, and now she‚Äôs been clinging onto any text I send for days, showing me more love than she ever has. but when she‚Äôs mean to me, she gets back to loving me. when I got mad over her telling her friends that the breakup was because of me, and that my breakup text was made her feel like she was abusing me (friends all proof read and made sure it was polite). she told me ‚Äústay the fuck away from me, I‚Äôm serious‚Äù. the next morning I APOLOGIZED for being angry! I‚Äôve found a way to blame myself for her cheating, and i apologize every time she makes me feel like she blames the cheating on me not being poly I just feel guilty for everything, and even though I know I can‚Äôt reattach, a piece of me hopes it happens.

205,What's made you successful?,"Hi all - I think there is a small bump in the viewers of this sub from the question I asked in /r/BPD yesterday.  I think a lot of us are some way down the path of recovery or gaining control again in our lives.  I'm not too far down, only about a month in, but I'm trying everything I can to stay focused.  I definitely have my setbacks, but they seem to be occurring less and less.  

So, what are you doing that has helped you consistently or consistently-ish?  How consistent has it been?

**For me:**

1.Studying DBT. This includes:  
  
* Self-study (Online course, purchased the official DBT workbooks)  
* Official program through my psychologists (Actually a mix of schema and DBT therapy)
  
2.Studying discipline and habits and putting them into practice.  This includes:   
  
* Using a timing technique, and dividing all tasks into 5 minute pieces.  This helps me overcome and procrastination, seems to be addicting in a way, and I end up doing way more work than I expect most days.
* Forming everyday habits around household duties, exercise, spending habits, therapy, journaling, planning, DBT skills, tasks I normally procrastinate on, and even interaction with others.  
* Planning the majority of tasks every night before bed.

3.Thinking of others instead of myself.  This includes:  
  
* Calling my parents or reaching out to a friend/acquaintance every day, even when I don't want to.
* Reaching out to others I know are in pain  
* Looking for people in crisis online and making donations, learning about them, etc.  
* Journaling about my children, 5 minute gratefulness journaling which includes being thankful for others in my life.
* Planning activities with others and going through with them

Learning new tools to handle my emotions, developing many healthy habits and finding a way to stick to them (simple timing techniques), and putting much more emphasis in thinking of others around me when I tend to think of myself has been life-changing.  For about a month so far.  Two major emotional setbacks during this period, both when I decided to drink heavily.  In general I'm avoiding alcohol, and only allow myself to drink once per week (from Marsha Linehan - the more successful modern programs for alcoholics are not complete abstinence), however, I'm not strong enough to control myself once I start at this point, and it doesn't usually go well unless I'm around others.",1507020826.0,False,9,15,mgale85,None,73z6rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/73z6rc/whats_made_you_successful/
206,"I know my brain is trying to protect me, but I don‚Äôt want these feelings anymore","It‚Äôs been a long journey. Lots of pit stops and roundabouts and detours and wrecks and repairs and general surreal debauchery along the way. I thought I was starting to get better at it. Until They (ex partner/ex fp) left and never came back. Never offered a gesture at closure. Not even a lazy shrug or flick of a finger‚Ä¶just nothing, forevermore.

I did DBT, CBT, and prolonged exposure for years. Worked my ass off. Poured endless sweat and tears into treatment and recovery until my heart was caked with the saltwater. But my heart also became large and strong during that time. I could feel the weight starting to lift, the demons start to retreat from my head. Then my lover, my best friend of almost 10 years, left me. I still do not understand why. Perhaps that was the problem. Why it happened I do not know, but I do know I shattered. Completely and utterly broke.

In September, it will have been 4 years since I spoke to that person. Not a word between us. Just empty white space where profound love used to be. Those years were spent desperately, clumsily, agonizingly trying to piece my jagged remains back together. To reform myself as a stronger individual and to once again be able to see a person staring back at me when I look in the mirror. A person who, while flawed, is growing and reasonably content and moving forward. 

[I think that might be the hardest part. Looking in the mirror and seeing yourself, but not seeing a person. I haven‚Äôt been able to make one out in my reflection for 4 years. Just hollow black circles meet my gaze. Nothingness.]

Try as I might, I cannot seem to even begin to put myself back together. No matter how much treatment I get or support I seek or love I give or receive, my shattered pieces only seem to degrade further. Turning slowly but surely to naught but dust. I have had 2 long term relationships since They left, and both were spectacular disasters. Beautiful, incredible, loving, passionate, toxic, dramatic, exhilarating disasters. As I write this, I am feeling the deep sting of losing another partner/fp, the second of those two disasters. There is nothing I can do to rid myself of this pain‚Äîthere is only acceptance, which has started to feel incredibly numb and pointless. 

tl;dr‚Äîmy BPD (along w comorbid trauma/anxiety/substance abuse/mood regulation disorders) symptoms have grown so monstrous. So inhuman, so horribly broken as they well up out of me. That I cannot seem to even start to heal from one lost relationship, let alone begin to think about starting a new, healthy relationship. Or even more importantly, that I cannot seem to find any minuscule way to start the process of healing and finding myself at my core. My emotions are completely out of control, and they consume and burn relationships and people like fire when they rise through me. I know that I feel things because my brain is trying in its misguided way to protect me. I just‚Ä¶do not want it anymore. They are Pain, at its essence. I want to live very much, but I do not want That anymore.",1628143245.0,False,10,5,SaveYourSelf_FromSin,None,oybeu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/oybeu8/i_know_my_brain_is_trying_to_protect_me_but_i/
207,I'm alone,"I was diagnosed with BPD in March. My emotional support dog that's been with me since 16yo died in April. I lost my house in May. I got married in June. My grandma (that ancestrally passed me the BPD) died in July. My mother (also BPD) did not let me know she died nor let me know about the funeral. In Aug, a few days ago, my new wife almost left me. 

We live very remote, and she was too scared of COVID to board the plane to her parents' house. So she's still here with me in our remote location where I lived for many years but she just moved back with me 2 months before COVID so the only people she knows are my people.

I've had surges of recovery since she's expressed her true feelings and struggles with our relationship. She plays caretaker role that exacerbates her anxiety and therefore, resentment, and as I notice her resentment, it exacerbates my BPD. My drama and bs almost put out her incredible light, but she struggled to tell me how she felt and get some space to get healthy.

She's right now finally pulling herself out of her depression and hanging out with my long time friends I reached out to. I gave her my blessing to see them, as I recognized our marriage has a higher chance of making it if she consults with people who already know and love me, than if she consults with people who don't know me, nor understand BPD. 

I'm making a great effort to figure myself out, emotionally regulate, write out my feelings, prepare for episodes, and be the best wife I can be for her--and the best person I can be for myself. 

But I'm afraid of losing my friends because they take her side (rational me knows that won't happen and they are well-equipped to deal with mental illness with no judgment). I'm lonely, and I'm scared. I don't want to talk to my family because they are all major personality disorders, they trigger me, I learned this all recently, and just went NC. 

I just want love and support and don't know where to turn except Reddit. Please reach out if you want to chat, if you have any words of love or advice, please pm or comment. I'm also really poor (like, haven't had running water or a proper toilet through the pandemic, kind of poor) and would be so glad to know of any BPD resources that are free. Healthcare is very poor where I live (50% population underserved) and despite the long, teary days of reaching out to doctors after holding in my diagnosis in shame for months, they just can't connect me to proper healthcare in my area because it just isn't here, so online it is--which means out of pocket. Which means free, for my budget.

208,"I love my GP (it got long, sorry)","So I've been having a bad BPD style relapse over the last month or so. But now that I'm more of a quiet borderline girl it's a slow spiral into hell.

So I went and saw my GP last week (yay me, waited until crisis point) and she stuck my back on Seroquel for a month just to stop my head racing all the damn time. Seriously, my anxiety was so out of control that my brain was almost turning itself off. I was convinced I was losing my mind because I just became so fucking dumb. Losing words, getting lost, forgetting things the second I heard them.

I voiced the fact that after being off Seroquel for 3 years it felt like I was failing by going back on them. She made me stop and listen. She said that it's no different to someone with asthma who's had it under control for years. Sometimes there will be some trigger that nobody can predict or see coming, so they add in extra help (medication) until it's passed and then go back to their usual routine.

She heard me, validated me and reassured me.

I went back yesterday for a follow up (I'm 100 times better than I was, love Seroquel) and we got to talking about the nature of BPD. I'm her most managed borderline patient so she can often get a different perspective from me. 

I told her my theory that we don't necessarily grow out of the BPD traits and behaviours, that I think we just learn to turn them inwards instead. I know I'd rather take it out on myself than others like I used to. I told her that even with all the therapy my thinking patterns are the same, I just have that filter between thoughts and actions that usually works really well.

I also told her how I've learnt the biggest reason behind BPD behaviours is control. Lack of, needing. I've always been at my worst when my emotions (and therefore my life) were out of control. So I'd do ANYTHING to feel like I had some kind of control. So, manipulation, SH, disordered eating, risky behaviours, impulsive behaviours. All of it, for me, was about control. That obsessive need for control.

She took notes. She's going to talk to her colleagues about it and see if they've had other patients voice the same kind of thing. And I know she's not patronising me.

She heard me. She validated my point of view. She thanked me for adding my insight and changing how she looks at BPD recovery.

Yes she's only a GP, but she specialises in mental health and is always learning about things like BPD because they're so misunderstood.

209,turning 25 really made me realize how narcissistic my parents are,"a little background for context: My whole life was spent in survival mode as I was systematically denied opportunities to grow into a healthy, happy, functional person. As the youngest in my family, for the longest time, I was told I was sick and to blame for my family's dysfunction. time after time my parents have proven to want me off their payroll and never showed genuine compassion, empathy, or support in any other way except financially. They would say cruel, horrible, hurtful things to bring me down but say they want the best for me and pull a woe-is-me card saying they have done everything they can to help. I softened and repeated to them that all I ever wanted was a cheerleader but instead, they'd continuously drag and slander me telling me I'd never get far in life and the world is a cruel place. the truth is they are the cruelest thing I have encountered in my lifetime. No matter what I did, even after 15+ years of therapy  I found my identity, improved myself, learned how to not react like them, communicated in a healthy manner, and am very confident and can defend myself properly.  it was never enough to change how they treated me. At 17 they sent me to a residential therapy center and I was in a position in which I couldn't decline or avoid it, which actually ended up saving me and changing my life forever. They were supposed to be a part of the journey but even experts couldn't convince them of their wrongdoings and who I really was, not who they interpreted me to be. They refused to listen to my therapists and tried to convince them of things they simply knew weren't true. (I lived there and interacted with them on a daily basis for a year). Eventually, it got to the point where my parents were constantly contacting my therapists, writing a literal \*book\* worth of an email, trying to tell them what to tell me or what I was doing. They wouldn't respect a professional's boundaries, how were they ever going to respect mine? hindsight is 20/20 as they spent my tuition to go to my dream college and pursue my dream job on this place. Grand total of $120,000+, to not listen to anything that was truly causing conflict. This problem persisted with all different therapists for years, looking back, they basically had me hop to different therapists throughout the years when thought they were wrong and couldn't sway them. When I was a kid I distinctly remember an incident where a therapist had restated something my mother had said to me recently, and i asked her if my mom told you to say that to which she replied, you're a smart cookie. They were convinced i would never take off and told me id never succeed yet resented me for being the reason I couldnt.

&#x200B;

Now, 25 (F), I live on my own and I have my dream job and found my dream apartment. I admit I had a late takeoff but everyone is on their own timeline, progress not perfection. They had helped me along the way financially but were consistent in their past behavior. I'm currently in the process of a move and things that shouldn't be arguments become arguments because they think I'm arguing when I'm cool as a cucumber. I did everything myself and orchestrated the move. I made plans and shared them and how we needed to get things done. they'd constantly interrogate me as if I hadn't recited the plan 10 times in a way that made me feel that they think I'm truly incapable. yet, they pushed me off when I reached out to get things done and would get so mad when id point it out respectfully and they'd blow me off while going off on me repeating the same horrible things. I know they are helping me financially but expressing my frustrations led to me being told I'm never going to have a relationship or friends and this is why people hate me and leave. to which I replied, like who? then they claim I gaslight them as they continue to try to tell me I'm this horrible person who lives to make them miserable. They go back and forth constantly from wanting to help to being punishing mean-spirited people and I'm just tired. I want to enjoy my life and I see now that even achieving what they thought I'd never do but claimed they wanted for me still isn't enough to earn their respect. I've done so much mourning over them never being the parents i needed through the years and now I just think my only option is to surrender to that. Its just really sad. I have so much anger and resentment from it, especially when I was the one told in my childhood that they had to walk on eggshells. But now I see, it was me that had to tip-toe and hold my breath. I don't want to be angry anymore, but god, do they fill me with rage. 

I don't know what I'm really looking for...  I want to preserve my identity and my recovery without their words living in my head. So maybe connection, advice, or a community. I just want to be happy and feel proud, my life has never been better and I feel like they have sucked the joy right out of my achievements. every. single. time.",1693340841.0,False,8,2,KirbyInTheClouds,None,164tdo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/164tdo4/turning_25_really_made_me_realize_how/
210,Trying to recover while in a new relationship,"Hey everybody ! I have recently been on the journey to start recovery right now after going through a really rough and challenging time after starting a new medication that brought out the worst parts of myself and a new relationship that i realized heightens my bpd symptoms (even just having the context of being in a relationship had me triggered). I want to further my growth as much as possible so I want to make sure I work towards my growth instead of against it. So I share this in hopes of getting feedback or really any response! I want to know what other ppl think from an objective POV ! This is a long post so be prepared for that ! 

I am currently tapering off this medication and working through dbt workbooks and in the process of getting started at an outpatient dbt program ! We both have mental illness and they have gotten treatment/ are going to therapy and taking meds however unfortunately things started turning toxic unknowingly and there was a dynamic created where I started burdening my partner and they felt like they always had to be there for me even if they didn‚Äôt have the capacity to otherwise in their mind who else would and over time started revolving their whole life around me (even isolating themselves from others just to b around me and try to be there for me in crisis). They took me expressing some of my intrusive thoughts and fear of abandonment to heart and made themselves suffer to make me feel ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or not to abandon or leave me.

 I would word vomit and over share a lot of things I definitely should‚Äôve kept to myself but that I never knew was making them feel like this. Our communication was off because they thought it would make me feel even worse and I would in turn internalize any feedback or criticism and also sometimes they didn‚Äôt even know how they felt never mind to then tell me. We got into a habit of them reassuring me no matter what and a routine of seeing each other all the time. After a major meltdown from me and a long day of work, we got to the point where we both got triggered and had an emotional night which lead me to initiate conversation about the issues that are there. 

As we uncovered more, it was disturbing to see how something that we both thought was going pretty well to see how actually unhealthy our start was.  

We have granted each other space as we definitely need to think, reflect and let ourselves read the situation/our feelings more. Last night, we talked about it and took accountability and shared feelings that were scary to say and admit but were needed to be said. We decided instead of breaking up we both are going to put forth the effort and time and patience to try and care for ourselves more and in turn make it so that we rebuild and unlearn all the misconceptions that we had in our relationship by creating and actively writing down different solutions to our issues and putting in a plan to how to achieve it to give us another go but I wonder if even this is a way of being toxic. 

My worst nightmare of burdening someone else‚Äôs mental state bc of me came true and while it was on them for the lack and dishonest sense of communication within themselves and with me I just don‚Äôt want to make more toxic decisions and hurt us both in the end :,( 

Any feedback would be appreciated and I guess if anyone relates to this it would be nice to know I‚Äôm not alone in this position. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed that I let myself get to the point where I was hindering the growth of my partner and weighing their life down but I‚Äôm trying to accept that there‚Äôs nothing I can do about the past and just to take accountability and change however if anyone has suggestions on how not to feel so guilty/bad/ashamed please lmk !!",1625235134.0,False,4,4,lotus-pea,None,ocawyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ocawyx/trying_to_recover_while_in_a_new_relationship/
211,Going to have surgery in a few hours. Can someone please help support me through this,"I made a decision not to have children almost ten years ago and today is finally the big day to have my tubes removed. I have told my little girl inside me this will protect her and make sure she is safe. I have been feeling so calm as it's going to be a relief to know that I won't accidentally bring another person into this world with my family history of serious mental illness. I have been going to a DBT group for two months which has been good for me. But work has been triggering for me the past few months from renovations (customer service role getting abused with complaints about it) and I just had an asthma attack this week which has left me angry because it was preventable and even more exhausted. My husband is really frustrated  because I was making a lot of progress but I've been having confused and disorganized speech again since the attack. I told him not to come with me to surgery (in a calm way) if he is going to continue being cold to me. Maybe he would have cooled off for today if I gave him space sooner but I was anxious and tried to force the conversation sooner than he was ready to calm my anxiety. But he just got angry, said the above and tried to take control of what happens today. I said this is my choice and I would feel better letting him sleep and rest his sore back as he will need to help me when I get home, and I also don't want him to be cold to me as I will not be able to relax at the hospital. I know I wasn't right to bother him as much as I did but I also have asked him to have some compassion for me with everything that's been going on. I know he is learning how to respond to what I say again as I am using my DBT skills and not going straight to a ten anymore. I feel for him and completely get that he expected me to break down completely last night over this and he hid sharp things etc. But I was so not at that point and he didn't believe me. He thinks I am lying. I wonder if he has ptsd from dealing with me as he really panicked and became overcome with emotion. But the expected outcome didn't happen. I used my skills and said I would like to discuss this in a calm and healthier way in a few days. He didn't have to step in to keep me from self destruction and he feels like I am gaslighting him because of this. I hate being this way and I hate that the person I love most is struggling with my past so much and is questioning my present - my recovery. But I get it. I have been there with my mom and he has been there with his sister. It's hard for him. So I wanted to let him know I can do this surgery without him there and just being home. I wish for a different outcome to that discussion but I didn't start the conversation right and I admit I was pushy. I believe I don't deserve to be alone through the surgery but there is no one else I want to call on to help support me. I know you will understand here. I just want someone to hear me and check in on me.
