0,Lamotrigine!! Changed my life. It‚Äôs a mood stabilizer. Not saying it works for everyone but it‚Äôs been working like a charm. I still experience mood swings but they‚Äôre easier to manage with it,Chaotic-Sylvester,193bprc
1,Wellbutrin is the only one that seems to do anything for me. I take 450mg daily. But am also major depressive so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,delta1810,193bprc
2,For me Quetiapine has been super super helpful,No-Being-3279,193bprc
3,Abilify & Zoloft,MaMakossa,193bprc
4,"I haven‚Äôt had luck with antidepressants- I‚Äôd be interested in trying mood stabilizers. However, I‚Äôm switching psychs and in the meantime I‚Äôm finding (not a prescription med) L-Theanine very very helpful! I take it in the morning with coffee and night before bed !",,193bprc
5,"I'm mentally doing really good on Zyprexa, swelling up like a tick but finally found something that helps.
I had the genetic testing done as well and it had Abilify listed as my best choice with Zyprexa coming in as one of the least favorable. Ironically enough it was the exact opposite. Abilify had me agitated and anxious while Zyprexa has given me peace so I'm not going by their genetic results if I ever need to switch my meds again",GrammyDee79,193bprc
6,aripiprazole used as a mood regulator. I still get mood swing but they are not as extreme and much more manageable. It really help me,Stedna,193bprc
7,"lamotrigine made me suicidal and pass out!! then I tried venlafexine and it was okay but stopped working and also gave me crazy insomnia and other side effects. just started Latuda and it's amazing so far. no side effects, my mood is completely controlled. I don't have wild thoughts and my brain feels calm. it's only been a week or 2 but I noticed it working the first day I took it",Individual_Salad587,193bprc
8,"Taking advice on medication is generally a bad idea, because the effects (both good and bad) will always be individual. It'll just lead to bad impressions of stuff that could actually help you.",Melthiela,193bprc
9,All of them make me gain weight so,Recent-Influence-716,193bprc
10,"I have bipolar disorder as well so I can‚Äôt take antidepressants. What really helped both my bipolar and BPD symptoms was quetiapine (antipsychotic) and lithium (mood stabilizer). I tried topamax for my chronic migraines ages ago and it was awful for me. Slowed my cognition down way too much- I‚Äôd forget what I was saying mid conversation and what the topic even was, or forget what I was doing or where I was driving to.",spicypotatosoftacos,193bprc
11,"I take Wellbutrin (I take it for ADHD), Lamotrigine (mood stabilizer) and Buspar (3x a day for anxiety) 
Unfortunately BPD is hard to treat with medication because it‚Äôs all based on trauma and not chemical imbalances. I hate it. But don‚Äôt lose hope!!",Ok_Fruit_3575,193bprc

14,lamotrigine my beloved! üíó,FF13IsActuallyGood,193bprc
15,I‚Äôve just started lamotrigine. How long until you saw a significant benefit? I‚Äôm still really struggling right now.,ExtensionFish4421,193bprc
16,I wanted Wellbutrin to work so bad bc it works great for my friends but I could only handle 3 weeks bc it has a black box label bc it can make suicidal ideation worse in some people and I just so happened to be part of that unfortunate percent,Worrisome_eggplant,193bprc
17,"Does that help with impulsivity? Just as an example, I drive really fast and I know I shouldn‚Äôt. Sometimes I even hope I get pulled over. Like‚Ä¶ who tf wants that? But I can‚Äôt stop myself",UnderTheSea2649,193bprc
18,What specifically do you notice that helps you with? Something else I struggle with that I never got any relief from is paranoia‚Ä¶ not like thinking the president is gonna get me but I‚Äôll see someone look at me expressionless and I assume they‚Äôre mad at me and I obsess over it and get really paranoid they‚Äôre mad at me and I‚Äôve done something wrong.,UnderTheSea2649,193bprc
19,Wow! That‚Äôs really good to know! I will keep that in mind üòä,UnderTheSea2649,193bprc
20,I did a genetic testing when I first got diagnosed to see what medications I am most resistant/ compatible to so just looking around to see what other ppl with the same condition as me have tried to see what my options are,UnderTheSea2649,193bprc
21,Omg I am soooo freaking forgetful!!! I didn‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs a side effect of topamax?!,UnderTheSea2649,193bprc
22,It really depends on the person imo. For me it was a month or two. But you‚Äôll get through it!! Trust me it made a worlds difference for me. Though I will say drinking and smoking will affect you differently so be careful with that. I honestly stopped drinking and only socially smoke and that alone made a difference. But like I said not everyone is the same so my body chemistry is not the same as yours so keep track of it,Chaotic-Sylvester,193bprc
23,"It has helped me with stability so, yes! I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs help me with both impulsivity & compulsiveness! 

I, too, would play with fire (in a bad way) but I‚Äôm trying to find healthy outlets.",MaMakossa,193bprc
24,"Def try it for paranoia ! I have crippling anxiety and dissociation- rapid heartbeat etc and it hasn‚Äôt done away with those things, but it has helped them more than anything else‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm also trying to exercise daily so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just overall lifestyle change‚Ä¶ but I def need the L Theanine, it‚Äôs really helped me sleep and handle work/ relationships much better",,193bprc

26,"You're better discussing that with an actual doctor with experience on the matter, not random people with subjective experiences. This is too important of an issue to leave to random strangers. Just saying :)",Melthiela,193bprc
27,"Yup, that's why it's affectionately called ""dopamax""- makes you dopey. It's an anticonvulsant prescribed for epilepsy and chronic migraines to prevent seizures and migraines by slowing down electrical activity in your brain. Topamax isn't approved by the FDA to treat anxiety, depression, or PTSD but some studies show it's helpful so some doctors prescribe it anyway. I think a big appeal of topamax is it doesn't usually cause a lot of weight gain, unlike antipsychotics.",spicypotatosoftacos,193bprc
28,Dbt really help me replacing those impulsiveness into something more positive. But I must say the process is not fun and was/still a lot to go through. Hope this help,Stedna,193bprc
29,Oh yeah exercise! I used to try to go to the gym every other day or at least 3x a week just for 45 min or so and I remember when I slacked off for a few days at a time my BPD flared up. Now it‚Äôs been six months since I‚Äôve been to the gym and I‚Äôve had the itch to get back in there,UnderTheSea2649,193bprc
30,"You‚Äôre right, I will consult my doctor of course, how else will I get the medication? But right now my doctor only wants to prescribe me antidepressants and depression isn‚Äôt my issue which is my I‚Äôm reaching out to others like me to see what they‚Äôve tried that isn‚Äôt an anti depressant so I can reference it on my genetic chart with my doctor.",UnderTheSea2649,193bprc
31,"I had initially looked up the side effects when I started it but wasn‚Äôt alarmed by anything I saw but I just looked them up again and wow. Just wow. Was on the highest dose 200mg for a year, I‚Äôve been weaning myself off of it and am down to 50mg. This is just so eye opening‚Ä¶ thank you",UnderTheSea2649,193bprc
32,"I hear a lot of people talk about Dbt and my therapist recommended I take dbt classes when I first started seeing her. I know I absolutely have to start exercising again, but I feel like this is also something important to be looking into",UnderTheSea2649,193bprc
33,"It‚Äôs so hard for me to keep up with it myself‚Ä¶. I go through similar cycles but I was like 2 months without when I hit (one of many haha) rock bottoms‚Ä¶. Maybe this is the sign to go back! Yea it‚Äôs so hard‚Ä¶ I hope that can help <3 and everyone‚Äôs body is different, but I‚Äôd recommend trying L Theanine ! Just be sure to take it with coffee or tea if it‚Äôs during the day (better paired with caffeine- give it a google and check it out)",,193bprc
34,Tell them that you want to try something else than antidepressants. Doctors generally don't look too kindly upon people suggesting what medication they want to be prescribed.,Melthiela,193bprc
35,Dbt is just there to teach you to cope better and in healthier ways with your bpd. It depend if you have any other mental illness on top of bpd but sometime having a side of schema or CBT therapy can be helpful!,Stedna,193bprc

As far as I know it isn‚Äôt supposed to be a long-term medication, but I‚Äôve been on it for a few months now. I like it, but I worry sometimes about dependency/withdrawal symptoms (as I do with any medication). Good luck with it, I hope it works out.",scrumptious-bagel,149jo5y

4,"I've taken Vrylar two times, and frankly, I would never recommend it. I don't know how to describe what went down. Besides, it made things a lot harder mentally. Suicidal/self harm thoughts, anxiety increased.I really hope it works for you. In my experience, some meds work, and others don't. Sometimes, they work and then stop working. It depends on the person and their chemistry. Keep a journal of all your meds, what they are for, and how your experiences are while taking them.",Nymeria6508,149jo5y
5,"I‚Äôm taking risperidone (atypical antipsychotic). It helps me sleep, when I was at my lowest I literally couldn‚Äôt sleep for the longest period of time. It helps with my anxiety and generally helps me think less. Like there‚Äôs silence in my brain sometimes instead of there being way too much noise. Also helps me be less dissociated and generally helps my BPD symptoms such as being less angry, less upset, feeling less of that awful emptiness. It‚Äôs a mood stabiliser so it reduces the intensity of my emotions whether positive or negative. Makes me a little slower intellectually, and has made me gain loads of weight so that I‚Äôm pre-diabetic now which is really annoying.. yeah I‚Äôm tracking my calories every day now and reducing my intake but it‚Äôs still really hard. 
I‚Äôve been taking it for a few years now.",Cozysweetpea,149jo5y

I'm on Lamotragine and just weaned off Zoloft because of the side effects but I'm wondering if I should just go back to an SSRI. I don't know much about anti-psychotics and my doctor could barely tell me what they did for my brain which didn't bode well.",Market_Total,149jo5y

0,"I was diagnosed with BPD back in 2015. I was just diagnosed with ADHD not even two months ago. I‚Äôve been on stimulants a little over a month now. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned this last month:

- the stimulants have made my BPD symptoms go quiet. They‚Äôre legit a whisper. 
- the stimulants have made my depression become 85% better. Its so much better Im going to be lowering the dose of my Lamictal the end of this month to see how i do. 
- stimulants don‚Äôt work as well the week of my ‚Äúperiod‚Äù (it‚Äôs not a true period because I‚Äôm on the pill)
- the week of my ‚Äúperiod‚Äù my BPD symptoms came back with a vengeance on that Wednesday and lasted till that Sunday. So, a total of 4 days out of the month i had BPD symptoms. Once that Sunday was over, my BPD symptoms have been quiet again
-  the stimulants have improved not only my BPD and depression symptoms but my overall focus/concentration, executive dysfunction and overall energy are a so so so much better. 

I did recently make about post here about ADHD and BPD. If you look at my post history, there were some great comments on it. Hope this helps!

Edit: forgot to add that I‚Äôm sleeping so much better too",gooseglug,1bvvzny
1,"BPD and ADHD here, diagnosed a little over a year ago. I found that the Straterra (Atomoxetine) has worked VERY well for me. I don‚Äôt know if it made enough of a difference on its own, as I also went extremely heavy into mindfulness, meditation, DBT and CBT therapy up to 5 times per two weeks at max). All of this along with a ton of reading on stoicism, Taoism, and Buddhism (especially the Plum Village/Thich Nhat Hanh writing/podcast etc). 

So, I find myself at a 100% different place and, of course, still working hard to ensure that the me I am each day is me, authentically. The meds helped my focus and getting stuff done ‚úÖ which allowed me to turn chores or work into mindfulness training and the opportunity to center in the middle of a storm. 

Good luck on your journey, I am having fun now, I hope you achieve peace, joy, and happiness also. üòä",sonarriley,1bvvzny
2,"I was diagnosed ADHD as a child, and got on stimulants at a very early age. Proceeded to have a troubled childhood, and developed BPD diagnosed later in life. Still taking stimulants to this day.

I would say DBT helped me the most. Ive had huge emotions my whole life, and was never believed for my genuine meltdowns, by parents or school. Learning to cope with those feelings and express myself appropriately was a skill that came with time, practice, and therapy.

My point is, I don't personally credit stimulants as doing much for me emotionally, other than reducing the stress I feel for having uncompleted work (hah, as I type this having procrastinated myself into a corner). I like my ADHD meds, and take them every weekday. I have never been prescribed any meds for my BPD. I was offered antipsychotics, but turned them down in favor of therapy. 

Best of luck to you! While no pill can cure it all, I won't downplay the positive effects that stimulants have had on my adult career. Probably shouldn't have been taking them as a child, but that's in the past. I hope you find a happy balance :)",Affection-Angel,1bvvzny
3,"Oh my God. This is exactly what I needed to hear. You delivered. Thank you so much!!!

Also, my bpd gets much worse before and during my period, so I know what you mean. 4 days is amazing though. Very happy for you!",WinterTangerine3336,1bvvzny
4,"Weird tangent, but if your BPD symptoms flare up before your period, I would look into premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD.) It's basically a SEVERE lapse in mental illness symptoms before your period due to hormonal changes. I have it and this is just a personal anecdote, but it seems to be extra common in pwBPD, for some reason.

Obv I'm not trying to armchair diagnose you or anything like that but just wanted to give you something to look into if you want to find treatment for it ‚ô•Ô∏è",witchcrows,1bvvzny
5,"I don‚Äôt have PMDD. They don‚Äôt usually flare up during my period. What made last month different is my primary had me start taking my BCP continuously so i don‚Äôt get that withdrawal bleed. I‚Äôm having serve hormonal anxiety during that off week. Im considered premature ovary failure because of the age i started experiencing perimenopausal symptoms.

0,"I‚Äôm on a med cocktail rn that‚Äôs working really well for me, in addition to therapy. 
I recommend trying to get established with a psychiatrist if you want to take the medication route. It‚Äôs very common to end up on a mix of meds to get the right balance and that really can only be properly managed by a fully trained specialist physician. Unfortunately primary care/family care doctors just don‚Äôt have the depth of training in neuropharmacology & neuropsychology to know how to tackle BPD.",undisclosed__desires,y892qm
1,"One med, Xyrem, which gives me deep sleep (which it seems to me deep sleep would be great for stabilizing all kinds of conditions), but is near impossible to get without a narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia diagnosis. 

What's worked even BETTER than that med for me is therapy - Internal Family Systems (IFS) to be specific. I also did a session of Introspective hypnotherapy which helped a good chunk too. I'd say Introspective Hypnotherapy and Xyrem helped an equivalent amount, and IFS by far has helped the most. I am almost entirely non-reactive now as far as BPD symptoms go. I'm processing the root causes, and gaining a stability that drastically reduces my likelihood of reacting for the ones I haven't yet processed. All my other issues (narcolepsy, ADHD, fibromyalgia, etc.) have improved considerably with IFS as well.",Brains-In-Jars,y892qm
2,"I‚Äôve been on Zoloft it was also horrible for me. 
Also they gave me hydroxyzine for anxiety and I swear it is a placebo it did nothing.

Then I have Prometazin (25mg) that I only take in energencies, if I‚Äôm super tense (70+) or really anxious.

14,"Low low dose seroquel (quietapan) has been so amazing for me. If im losing my shit it totally just knocks me out and calms me down, quiets the overwhelming loudness of emotions. It‚Äôs also awesome bc the dose is so low that a whole months prescriptions worth is theoretically safe to consume, if you ever were inclined that way you can‚Äôt use it to that end.

I've being trying some differents meds to see which ones would help me better. In the end the best combination was: one antidepressant, one anticonvulsant and one antipsychotic.

But is not perfect, of course I stil have moods swings, impulsive actions, splitting and really bad thoughts. But they happen less now

16,"I have BPD, diagnosed about a year ago. I'm prescribed 25mg of seroquel for sleep, but I'm also on 100mg of sertraline for anxiety and everything else that was wrong with meüòÇ

I never ever wanted to be on medication, but felt kind of pressured by the doctors.
I found the initial side effects of the seroquel were horrible. I woke up super groggy every morning, it took me at least an hour to wake up properly and snap out of the daze. I stuck it out for a few weeks to give it a chance but I just hated the ""hangover"" from it. I brought it up with my doctor and now I just take half a tablet, and that suits me perfectly.

It's honestly made a big difference, getting a good night's sleep is so integral to your mental health, I'd suffered with insomnia since I was a child, my brain always went into overdrive and anxiety mode before sleep.

I can personally say that it's helped, but that might be the combination of the two medications, I don't know.
If it helps, my psychiatrist did his doctorate specialising in BPD, that's what he put me on, and I trust him. He essentially said the two medications compliment one another.

I'm stable now, and very very rarely suffer with panic attacks or anxiety anymore, which used to be frequent and debilitating. I can handle stressful situations without feeling like I'm going to explode.
I'm mode stable than I've ever been and family members have commented that I seem less twitchy and fiddly.
I feel what I think most people would describe as ""normal"" which is amazing.

Give it a chance, but I would personally recommend trying to get your diagnosis, and your recommended prescription from a psychiatrist, not a regular GP.",HayleyPoppins,ukirpd

0,"Hi I'm sorry to hear that you are going through such a painful time. Something that has helped me with suicidal ideation and self-harm urges is accepting and validating them, rather than judging myself for having them (judgements tend to add more distress to an already distressing situation). Accepting them does not mean that you act on the thoughts, it just means that you acknowledge that they are there. It‚Äôs okay to have these thoughts, you are a human and this is your brain‚Äôs way of helping you cope.   
You may say something to yourself like:  
\- ‚ÄúIt makes sense why I am experiencing these thoughts given that I am going through this‚Ä¶‚Äù  
\- Just because I am experiencing these thoughts, doesn‚Äôt mean that I need to act on it and I can do things to help myself (such as distraction, talking to a loved one or therapist etc.)

That being said, this is a tool I use for **passive** suicidal ideation. If you are feeling unsafe, definitely reach out to mental health services.

I know it's really difficult to do, but try and be gentle and compassionate towards yourself - it really does help. Reminding myself that emotions are temporary helps me too. Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to ü§é",Jembaby24,11xxsra
1,Ive been battling stim addiction on and off for a few years now and can really say I wish I had put as much effort in early on into addiction treatment as I did BPD and CPTSD. Think of as trying to find a way to get the waves tossing you around to still a bit before learning how to swim or deep dive. It‚Äôs pretty hard to do either when you‚Äôre being tossed to and fro with alternating states of mind. I don‚Äôt know if the cocaine use was kind of a one time thing or if you use more intermittently in either case finding the right help to look at why you used and how you could prevent it in the future might be really helpful as a way to sort of nip this in the bud before it detracts from your hard won stability. You might need to take another look at whatever meds you‚Äôre taking to see if they are addressing what needs to be addressed. It can be so hard not to turn to chemicals when you‚Äôre low everyday. If the cocaine use was an isolated event I‚Äôd say 5 weeks out you should be mostly out of the woods and back to baseline in terms of it still affecting you on a directly chemical level. Working out regularly is also one of the best things you can do. Give it another week or two and maybe things will stabilise and you‚Äôll feel more empowered to assess and process,MissDissphoria,11xxsra

Tears, cathartic revelations, deep sorrow, buried memories.. all just starts flooding out.

If it‚Äôs meant to be, it will return and show itself naturally. But my dear, if it was abusive, if it heavily lacked boundaries on both ends, if it made you feel subhuman in any way, I would really, really reconsider your decision to contact this person on Friday. The anxiety you must be feeling must be over the roof. Be kind to yourself; hug your most tender parts and see this as an opportunity to flourish and grow in ways you never thought possible. üå∑

We work on giving each other space and it‚Äôs hard for my partner. She has tools she‚Äôs gathered from studying about bpd and most days she uses them.

The relationship wasn't abusive nor toxic, we had some major life events happen on both ends (cancer, deaths, hospitalizations, etc.), and I lost sight of my attachment issues and let myself become codependent. In the first part of the relationship (~6 months) I was very aware of it, and able to keep it under wraps, it's just when the shit of life hit the fan that I lost sight. 

Because I already contacted him last night, I don't think I'm going to contact him on Friday, rather try and keep myself NC until he reaches out. I do truly love him and I can say for sure that he loves me, its just this period of separation stings that much more knowing that it was related to my BPD.

Let me remind you this: the right person, the one who is willing to stick it through with you 100% of the way no matter how hard it gets, will show you with their actions. 
Life is exhausting. Things happen; trauma is hard to deal with. However, some people don‚Äôt have the capacity for it and that‚Äôs ok. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with someone just not being mentally equipped to deal with so much stuff. It‚Äôs.. so much to ask of a person. There‚Äôs so much strength and communication that needs to be present. Support systems from both parties. Love is..so complex. Beautiful. And unfortunately, so painful, sometimes. 
Now that you‚Äôve decided to go NC, give yourself the liberty of enjoying your free leisure time! Do something that you love to do.. whether it‚Äôs cooking a nice meal, practicing a hobby you haven‚Äôt picked up in a while, going out with some friends.

personally I did one session a week for a year(after initial diagnosis) and one session a week gave me plenty of food for thought and reflection For the next week till I went back. if there‚Äôs anything about BPD it‚Äôs pacing your life out to remove as much stress as possible. I got diagnosed late (m44) now 46 so Im burnt out, and I‚Äôm now on the pension(but stable phew!).

so i can‚Äôt stress enough to really take as much time needed to remove unnecessary stresses in your daily routine. I have a saying; there‚Äôs nothing in my out tray. If I have a problem with a friend or anybody I have to sort it immediately, stewing on things will just make the anxiety and quality of life go down hill quick.here‚Äôs a little article with a picture that explains the different parts of the brain that are effected. I keep going and studying on from there and little pieces of the puzzle begin to fit into place more.

It seems to be a constant remembering of certain things, like the damaged amygdala is creating too much cortisol to the blood stream that makes us anxious and easily moody. So by reminding my self of that I can separate the ‚Äòcontent‚Äô :as in some one who did me wrong and how I‚Äôm annoyed and the pysical: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got massive amounts of adrenaline and cortisol running through my body that‚Äôs making the pissed offness highly exaggerated‚Äô‚Ä¶..and repetitive. any way I‚Äôm also on a learning curve hope this helps a little.
