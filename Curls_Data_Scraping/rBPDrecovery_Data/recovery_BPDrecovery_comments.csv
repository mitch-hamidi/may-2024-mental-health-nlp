I just know that after all the times I ‚Äútry again‚Äù the first portion is always to get exercising again.

1,"Remember moderation is key. Smashing the gym everyday for hours is not sustainable for most people, and those who can do that have built up discipline and routine for a long time. I think the key is to have a little movement each day. One day that might be the gym, another day it might be a brisk 20 minute walk, another might just be a very vigorous hoovering session. The key is consistency and not intensity. If you're a member of the gym, it would be more sensible and realistic to commit to going twice a week. Anything more than that can be your choice and just a bonus, and you can factor in other activities besides this.",PuzzleheadedVisual77,197kbvn

0,"I think it's important to remember that ""recovered"" doesn't mean feeling great all the time. I'm not saying that you said that, and I really feel with you because it sucks to have a good period and then feel like you're reverting back to old habits. I'm having a pretty shitty time myself right now, after having a few relatively stable years. But to me there's comfort in knowing that having a bad period after a good one doesn't mean you're back to start, and having a good period in the middle of a bad one doesn't mean you're not having a hard time. Even people without our disorder experience life like this, maybe not as intense, but life is nothing if not unpredictable.

I try to have hope that some day I will look back and be grateful that I didn't end my life back when I wanted to during the hard times, because of everything I experienced after. Just like I have so far. Even if it's just a beautiful sky, a good episode of TV or laughing with friends - I find moments to be grateful I'm still here despite the suffering that feels like it's never ending at times. 

I hope you find the good moments again soon, and that they make life feel worthwhile. Because you deserve that.",finickyfingerpaint,1cu1f9f

0,"Yes. There is. That's it if you don't give up. This thread is the proof, is called bpdrecovery and there's a lot of success stories in here if only you read a little. Recovering doesn't mean ""learning how to function without appearing crazy"" either. It means to heal, to learn to live with yourself. That's if you don't give up wihen you have those bad moments, of course.

I'm now on my road to recovery. It's not an easy road and there'll be times where you'll ask yourself why all the effort, but that just means you're on a bad spiral. Feeling hurt all over with no exit in sight. But that's precisely your bpd. Everything feels like that.

You won't be recovering doing a week of therapy or dbt. The road is long. And there'll be times where you'll feel you're putting too much effort for nothing. But every little step is a win. And every little thing you do will help in the long run.",Aureolindaisy,122hsi7

8,"Recovery is possible - I know this from firsthand experience and from watching others with BPD transform their lives. I can't believe how much I have transformed in 2 years of therapy, looking inward and prioritising my mental health. For me, the suffering is so much less now. It's not easy and it's really fucking painful at times but so worth it. ‚ù§Ô∏è I wrote this about what healing from BPD has looked like for me, hope it helps: 

Healing, for me, doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt still experience intense emotions and harmful urges. It doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt still get triggered or have irrational thoughts. It means that when those things do happen, I can cope. I still suffer sometimes, the difference now is that the suffering doesn‚Äôt have to be self-destructive. I have tools to help me, I can reach out for help, I can give myself space to feel my emotions, I can be gentle with myself.  
You‚Äôre not failing at healing for still experiencing symptoms. I used to get stuck thinking I was failing because I still experience all of those things. I experience them less now, and I have learnt that it‚Äôs not about getting rid of all my painful emotions, it‚Äôs about changing the relationship I have with them so I don‚Äôt spiral into them.",Jembaby24,122hsi7

1,"I recovered after 3 years of DBT and I no longer ‚Äúqualify‚Äù for a BPD diagnosis. I am a completely different person now, I feel much more emotionally regulated and stable and I built up my self confidence enough to follow my dreams and I‚Äôm now an artist (living off unemployment money but whatever, my jobs were making me sick too lol!). Every day I remember how privileged and lucky i am and how much hard work I put in to working on myself in and out of therapy, how hard it was to set boundaries and over come conflicts, and how I did all this and I‚Äôm functioning and feel joy and love a lot and accept I‚Äôm really emotional but grateful I can communicate my emotions now.
I have now been in a relationship for 8 years, in the last 2 years it has become actually healthy. my partner has adhd and struggles to emotionally regulate and communicate emotions too, which helped me apply some DBT skills and teach them how to regulate, whilst I‚Äôm learning to regulate as well.

I still struggle with disordered eating, I still struggle to keep to 1-2 alcoholic drinks when I drink, I still am a highly sensitive person and sometimes reactive, but I‚Äôm compassionate as hell and I show myself a lot of that compassion.

When I had my last therapy session, my therapist said to me that he felt so proud and warmed by how I threw myself into DBT, that I did everything with 100% even when it was really hard work, and I told him through my tears that I had to because I really really wanted to get better, I wasn‚Äôt scared of getting better anymore. 

I remember the shift if me that went from wanting to get better but petrified of the change and safe in the comfort of who I knew I was, to needing and wanting this journey, seeing how unjustifiably fucked up i was feeling, that it really wasn‚Äôt my fault- it just was‚Ä¶ I think the shift came from a place of self compassion and self acceptance, and surrendering myself to therapy and I let all the hard stuff come at me in giant waves that knocked me down over and over but I got back up stronger. Like ripping open old scars in order to heal them properly so they don‚Äôt cause you pain anymore. Only discomfort.

Im a success story, and i feel so proud and privileged to remember this every day ‚ù§Ô∏è",r0sebudbean,yvi78t
2,"I've been recovering for a little over 4 years now and no longer qualify for BPD. The biggest thing for me was sobriety and finding a good meds regiment to keep me even and energized. The other big thing was to try and cultivate as many emotionally supportive friendships with positive people as I can. 

Having multiple close friends and not focusing my energy on any one of them has made a massive difference in keeping myself in my wise mind all the time. Now I haven't been able to have a stable romantic relationship yet, but I have a couple dozen solid friendships, and several very stable emotionally close ones. 

This all took a long time and it wasn't steady at all, but keep with it and try to practice DBT skills once a day if you can. I like to take a little break at lunch and sit in the sun for a bit to meditate and practice.",dreexel_dragoon,yvi78t
3,"I had BPD, CPTSD, Anxiety Disorder and Dissociative Disorder. I started treatment when I was 15 because I was suicidal and deeply depressed. I got weekly supportive counseling until I started CBT psychotherapy at 20 years old. At 26 years I started DBT and went it through 2 times. After that I got trauma therapy but because I had already learned very good distress & Mindfulness skills in DBT, we ended the trauma therapy early and at the age of 30 I was diagnosed to be in recovery.

I'm now 37 and haven't been suffering from BPD symptoms in years. My life is healthy and in balance. I'm optimistic and generally love my life. I know my limits and triggers and avoid pushing them. I'm happy and self-confident. 

I have truly recovered from all of my diagnoses and haven't had any contact to mental health services in 6 years. I also don't take any madications anymore. I take care of myself, do sports, eat healthy and sleep well. I don't allow toxic people into my life and enjoy my solitude. 

Mindfulness is my saviour and it works with everything! I use it every day and with mindfulness I'm able to survive all and every trouble, trigger, negative emotion, impulse or challenge. It's just amazing how effective mindfulness is. For me it's a way of life now.",the_end_of_mind,yvi78t
4,"YES that's me! I've done so much since my initial diagnosis of BPD in August 2018.

First, DBT saved my life. I did DBT in a group therapy setting twice. That got me over the worst time period of my life when I was barely surviving.

What has helped me is meditation (I use the Headspace app), journaling (I use ""shadow work"" prompts I found on Pinterest), exercising, and my medication. I was diagnosed with ADHD in May 2021, so when I started taking meds for that, it also helped some of my overlapping BPD symptoms.

My therapist and I also talk about the concept of self-compassion a lot, which I think is hard for pwBPD to practice. My self esteem was really low when I first got diagnosed, and I was really mean to myself. I wouldn't forgive myself for \_anything\_ but tolerated so much bad behavior from others. Learning about self compassion and applying those skills to my life really helped me heal and believe I had a life worth living.

As far as relationships go...that sometimes just requires some trial and error. During my last relationship, I just trusted myself enough to know that I didn't want to be with that person. I recently went on a date with someone else, and ultimately decided I don't want to date anyone right now.

The cool thing about having BPD is learning about yourself, the ugly bits you don't like to talk about and the beautiful versions of yourself that no one knows about. Sometimes we want acceptance and validation from other people when we don't even accept or validate ourselves.

I still have BPD but I'd consider myself a ""success story"". I was also hospitalized last year, so I don't think I ever ""recovered"" from BPD completely. I just have learned to live with it and adapt it to my life if that makes sense.

If you want to chat let me know! I'm sorry for the wall of text.",moods-,yvi78t
5,"I no longer qualify for BPD. I struggled for two decades, one of those decades I was plagued with suicidal thoughts and urges. DBT therapy saved my life.

I am now the most content I have ever been. I turn 40 in three months. In a few short weeks I am marrying my love, who has stood by my side for six years. I dated him for months before I told him about my BPD and I was terrified how he would react. He was unfazed by it. Accepted me wholly for all my struggles.

A few years ago I found myself in a full place of recovery. The suicidal thoughts and urges are completely gone. My mood is stable. I am much more mindful in how I interact with others, what I share, and how I listen. 

I have so much compassion for my past self and all the pain and heartache I went through.

7,"I've been married for 12 years. The first 5 were the worst I was untreated for bpd and misdiagnosed.  I was hell on heels in the most literal sense. I wasn't a good person in any way shape or form.. idk why my husband stayed he's an amazing man who saw something in me I hadn't seen in myself at that time. I was diagnosed as bpd and I stopped all the prescribed meds for the misdiagnosis and stopped all addictions that solved about 60% of my problems. I then did cbt, dbt, emdr and trauma therapies in addition to traditional talk therapy.  I exercised, eat healthy, drink water...I worked, and worked, and worked until I could be healthy for myself and my spouse. Today you wouldn't know I have bpd if I didn't tell you I did. It's very possible it just takes a tremendous amount of work and consistency to get well enough to be in a healthy relationship.  I have the house, thr happy marriage, the car, the white Picket fence but only because I fought tirelessly for it. I also went NC with family it's the only way I can maintain my well-being... if I let them in I know what will happen so it's not an option. Good luck op if you want it bad enough you can succeed.  I'm not saying I don't have days of struggle because I definitely do I'm just more well equipped to handle those days than I was before.  I wish you the very best.

9,"Unfortunately, I‚Äôm no where near started on my recovery process (other than downloading some DBT apps that were the first to go when my phone storage was full), but I have found someone- somehow out of the miracles of the mysteries of the mind, that is the most patient, understanding, wonderful man that he is. I start having a blowup and he can deescalate me in minutes. I am out of control, he tells me to take space and deals with my kids and my mom and my pets or whatever needs to be done. I go for a smoke break, cool off, come inside and my dishes are done, the kids are fed, and he‚Äôs reading them bedtime stories. Shit like this every single day. 

I‚Äôm terrified he is going to leave me. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôm becoming dependent on him. But I‚Äôve never felt so good about myself and so eager and willing to allow change to happen within myself. He‚Äôs relit my soul when I didn‚Äôt think I could take any more traumatic events in my life. I was so drained. I hated life. I was miserable. I never smiled. I was giving up. And he makes it all seem so easy. He makes me feel special and like I am lovable just how I am. 

Do not stop until you find your person that makes you feel 100% safe in all ways in life- even with yourself. I‚Äôve ruined so many relationships, shit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve ruined so many people. I could never do any of that to this man. He‚Äôs never given me a reason. He sets boundaries but addresses me in the calmest sweetest ways so he can explain before I jump on the defensive. 

I don‚Äôt know about doing it myself, but it sure saved my life having someone come in that showed me true love, acceptance, care, compassion, and vulnerability. If I found a way, there‚Äôs got to be more.",SnowflakeGypsy,yvi78t

14,"Not fully recovered but guess dealing with things (esp relationship) better than before I was diagnosed and got therapy. I got diagnosed sometimes in 2021 and went to therapy consistently until now. There‚Äôs a caveat tho: I found a suitable therapist I can trust. Been on meds for some time too, not for the bpd per se, but for increasing my energy level in my depressive state. In my case, keeping the meds to minimun dose is the best way to keep my mood and energy level stable so I can work on other stuff. But eventually, I tapered off and stop it completely.

My last relationship went south, it‚Äôs failed (though this time not from my end). The difference is I can pretty much handle it well. He is someone I love dearly. My favourite person. If you have bpd, you know what it means to lose your FP. It‚Äôs not without tears and such. But I managed to not SHd during this breakup and used other healthier coping mechanism.

That being said, the symptom is not completely gone. I still relapsed (particularly in SH), though far and fewer in between (twice in a year?) and that‚Äôs due to extreme stress and heavy trigger. Relationship wise, I‚Äôm doing pretty good nowadays even tho it‚Äôs with my dear circle of friendship and not in romantic sense. I can express my needs and concerns assertively instead of being passive agressive then suddenly cutting people off. I make an amend to not ghost people anymore, to the point that when someone had crush on me and I cannot return his feeling, I would tell him so to save his and my time.

Now I am off meds for half a year already and I am doing just fine. Even though I‚Äôm still prone to feeling empty and lonely, but I am pretty content with myself for now. To give a realistic picture, it‚Äôs not always like this. But the most important thing is low days are more manageable.

22,"Because I keep telling people that you have to want the help and actually work for it. I tried going through BPD without medication and without therapy or any aid for a very long time. I did good on my own (through research and reading) but I was still not in a healthy place and I obviously did not have the right tools. My first year in therapy/DBT alone was very successful and I accomplished a lot more than I had in the past few years on my own. I sought out help because I truly wanted to change and be a better person to myself and those around me. I imagined that if I gave up I would lose the people I cared about the most and ultimately I‚Äôd always be in pain so I worked very hard to change that and I stuck to it. People also hate hearing that routine, good health, sleeping habits, therapy, exercise/going outside actually works and can reverse a lot of symptoms of trauma and poor health. Someone here the other day kept saying how they hate how often their therapist tells them to drink water. I said that unfortunately sometimes it sucks to hear it, even I myself thought my DBT lessons were silly and corny, but being hydrated and taking good care of your body can drastically improve emotional dis-regulation. They accused me of being dismissive and saying water cures depression lol. Now that I‚Äôm at this point tbh I realize that many (not all!) people *want* to be stuck in the struggle. It lets them victimize themselves, make excuses, or they‚Äôve made it their entire personality and don‚Äôt know who they are without it. I totally understand because that was me at one point, but you can‚Äôt do that and claim that you‚Äôre trying to get better. You‚Äôre not - and that‚Äôs okay. Everyone‚Äôs journey is different but if you want it you can have it. That‚Äôs probably my biggest piece of unpopular advice.",johntitorswife,yvi78t

25," It's a trauma response, remember that we didn't choose this it was forced upon us by the people who should've loved us unconditionally but instead chose to abuse and neglect us. Now of course as adults we got shafted and have to be responsible for undoing the damage they've caused but we are this way because it's a survival response.  No one tells a person with ptsd they're bad or evil we shouldn't be told that either. 

We all know that life isn't fair but we can balance the scales if we try really hard and dedicate ourselves to unlearning the bad behaviors and learning the healthy ones. That's all this is. Unlearning some things and learning some new healthier things. It took me a long time and I still have struggles I imagine I always will so don't think it's all smooth sailing lol it's not. But because I unlearned some things and learned some new healthy things I'm capable of managing much more efficiently. Like the ""normies"" do.. You'll get there when you're ready 

I also want to say I'm 35 and as I aged the explosiveness I had when I was younger really toned down on it's own so therapy is amazing, truly life changing, but aging really helps too. My heart goes out to those who post and are in their  teens and 20's because it's already a difficult time without bpd, add that in and instead of getting over a mole hill y'all have to climb everest.  Not everyone makes it but those that do she be kind and supportive to those who are trying. Good luck I really wish you the best and I hope you get to where you envision yourself to be in the future.",Ambs1987,yvi78t

Well done for everything you‚Äôve done for yourself, the immense amount of hard work, and each moment you chose to make loving choices for yourself (water, bedtime). Showing ourselves kindness and compassion is in a way going back and fixing what we never had.",Ill_Spirit_233,yvi78t
27,"Nah, I agree. I am in the same boat. I did a shitloqd of work. I don't drink nearly as much as I used to, sometimes going months without alcohol. I really like to move my body because it gives me something to focus on. I'd say that sometimes the challenge is to not be influenced by others maladaptive and/or dysfunctional patterns that they actively normalise and even enforce, particularly in the arts scene (I'm an artist). Also, having a strong community that you know has your back and you have theirs. Where there is open dialogue and responsibility. People who can hold you accountable with compassion and gentleness but also steadfastness. 

I'm not in a relationship but I am dating someone and it's very healthy. There is plenty of open communication and dialogue, and I am honest about my fears and anxieties. It feels good to be able to relax into it. I really hope that you can get to the place that you want to, OP. - With some difficult work and a lot of love and support!",kemkem97,yvi78t

30,"I do! I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend steady for 6 years and of those 6 I‚Äôve only been recovered for the latter half. I will say that the first half was rough because in general I was at a very low moment of my life and not the healthiest mentally (no treatment). I don‚Äôt think anyone should stay in a shitty relationship - but in my case I was very fortunate to have my partner believe me when I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to change‚Äù. He was willing to stick it out through the hardships and in turn I showed him that I was serious about it. Now here we are in a much healthier place living together, traveling, and now planning for a home and babies. Which btw, I held off on having children until I no longer qualified for BPD and until I knew in my heart I was healed enough to not pass down anymore trauma. It is absolutely possible for this to be your reality but you have to really want to improve and even then wanting it is not enough; you have to really work for it. I think though that I would have realistically wanted to do all of this healing before getting into a relationship but it‚Äôs kind of just the way things turned out for me. 

For context: I also have no contact with my abusive parents/family so I had a lot of time and heart to put into my own relationship.",johntitorswife,yvi78t

* Get adequate nutrition via healthy diet and take Omega-3 fatty acids
* Partake in hobbies that are just for you and not to impress others
* Limit time of social media. Delete Facebook. Unfollow ""influcencers"" and people who make you feel ugly. Even if that person is your friend. If they make you feel bad about yourself then stop watching their life.
* Exercise often but you don't have to be a ""jog at 5am"" type of person. Just do what you can.
* Read self-help books
* Join a class of some sort. Yoga, cooking, etc. Can be anything. It builds confidence to do things that are just for you.
* Stop putting things off that you want to learn or do. Even if it's something as little as ""Ooh I wanna try that new Indian food place"". Just go do it! Try new things often.
* Learn self soothing techniques. I like hot showers and incense. I also have a playlist on Youtube of rainforest sounds and other ambient noise beacuse I find it very soothing.
* Don't ever do things just because you feel like it will impress someone. Be true to yourself.
* Stop being lazy. If something takes less than 10 minutes then just do it. Clean up your living space and don't live amongst clutter.

1,"Hey :) Fist off, that‚Äôs awesome, use that motivation!!

I think learning some DBT skills, beginning with mindfulness, is a great start. There‚Äôs a lot of great resources for this online and the BPD workbook by Daniel Fox is also very popular. 

I recently started using the self care app Finch and I really like it! You set goals and get points for completing them. The more points you gather, the more your finch grows and learns. It‚Äôs super cute!
It also has a great library of suggested goals (e.g., stepping outside once) and integrated exercises (e.g., box breathing). It really helps me keep on top of the things that are important for keeping my emotional vulnerability down, like exercising, leaving the house, socialising, eating regularly, keeping my space clean‚Ä¶

I also recommend you pick a goal you want to work towards. Could be anything, learning a language, an instrument, running a 5k, redecorating your space, finishing the BPD workbook‚Ä¶ anything, you get to pick. And then you work on that goal every single day, even if it‚Äôs just the tiniest bit. This mindset of [non zero days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz/the_gospel_of_uryans01_helpful_advice_for_anyone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) has really helped me make consistent progress without getting bogged down in perfectionism. 

Lastly, give yourself time. Don‚Äôt expect all your established patterns to go away over night. Show yourself grace and patience during your recovery. This is a tough road but we‚Äôre walking it, one step at a time. 

Wishing you all the best for your recovery! üåª",Budget-Astronaut-660,14qk0hy

0,"What kind of dbt have you done? And what‚Äôs your support situation like? We require so much genuine, compassionate support (not just people who put up with us and are maybe nice sometimes). You may also look into a spiritual community (something with an online presence, something that your friends are sure isn‚Äôt a cult). Buddhism is the most natural progression from DBT, but that doesn‚Äôt need to be the route you take. I took more of a pagan and philosophy (while not spiritual, they fill that same religious text void for me, but I‚Äôm actually encouraged to question them) route.

I know things feel endlessly chaotic (believe me, I KNOW) but long remission is possible. We can never guarantee that we won‚Äôt end up back in the throes of it, but the more we‚Äôre in remission, the easier it‚Äôll be to return. I wish there was a cure for what we have, I really do. 

There is hope. It takes time. Even just the first step of DBT (safety and skills) can take a year or more. It‚Äôs hard to be patient when it feels like your world is constantly crumbling, but we just gotta build small habits little by little. You can do it. I know you can.",gravitymaverick,152ont4
1,"I understand the feeling, i do feel it repeating myself over and over. Seems endless. What help for me is writting about my frustrations then taking a moment an re read it, then analyze the situation. If that doesn‚Äôt help meditation is good, i like headspace (the app) because its nothing about spirituality or religion, its just a way to analyse your thoughts and feelings. What also helps me is doing sport, to put all that negative energy somewhere else and feel good in my body. Yoga helps because its a easier form of meditation in a sense and also feels good on the body.

however, you should also talk to them. explain how you're trying to get better but that it's a process and you can't be expected to magically get better immediately. if they feel as strongly towards you they should understand and be willing to help. ask them to communicate when things hurt them, but you can also communicate what things trigger you so they could be a bit mindful of that.

I hope your SO understands that getting better isn‚Äôt a fast process. It takes a lot of time, and you‚Äôve got to train yourself to react appropriately when you don‚Äôt feel good.

My coping skills are mostly distraction and redirection exercises. Listening to loud music on headphones, coloring, going for a walk, spending time in a small safe space. Also I journal out all the negative thoughts I would usually say out loud, then tear them up and throw them away. 

You can‚Äôt ‚Äòremove‚Äô your triggers, that‚Äôs impossible. However you can train yourself to react more positively, or at the very least, not have a meltdown about it. 

I hate to say this‚Ä¶. But you‚Äôre going to have to step up your self control. A lot. If you want to keep them in your life, you‚Äôre going to have to make yourself get up and use your skills. There‚Äôs no easy way, no shortcuts. Sheer force of will is what it will take. It‚Äôs so fucking hard dude. I‚Äôve been there, and still there now.

You‚Äôre simply not going to get better immediately unless you really get your act together and start forcing yourself to react better to your triggers. No excuses, no ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äô etc.

Abandonment is our number one trigger. You‚Äôve now been made aware there is a possibility that you may be abandoned by the one person you thought was going to be there forever. Communication is very important, as well as a persons mental health. I understand they may need to do what is best for them. If they desire the forever as you do, communicate that gently. You need to be sure you‚Äôre both creating a secure attachment for each other. It is not a solve all, but it‚Äôs a strong start. Clear communication, trust and holding each other accountable to that will definitely help. Actively listen, do not defended yourselves when explaining how one is feeling, do not invalided each other. All of these will lead to triggers and one not being heard. Keep a journal for your eyes only if this helps, write in it about every feeling you have. This can help pin point feelings that you may not have words to describe them.

This advice was all from my therapist over the years, it has helped me immensely. I still have my days but I have more understanding of how to help care for myself. Really take the time to learn your triggers and describe them to yourself on what a specific word, phrase, or look can cause you to lash out and become angry. If you‚Äôre anything like me, I would become very angry and I really despised that about myself, I would say the most cruel and hurtful things to my significant other. I regret it very much‚Ä¶thankfully he has been so understanding and compassionate over the last 6 years it‚Äôs really helped and eased my symptoms of abandonment knowing he is always there for me, but he is sure to hold me accountable and has learned with me over the years to know when an episode could potential happen.

The best thing about your post is that you acknowledge when you‚Äôve done something that has hurt someone, you are aware of your actions. Wanting to better yourself in any way possible it a very strong start. I hope this helps guide you in a direction that offers you abundance.

The yoga channel I follow on YouTube is Yoga With Adriene. She has playlists for every months that are free.

Headspace has some free guided meditations, but in app purchases. My work offers free subscription, so I am sure you can find lots of videos on YouTube as well.

3,"I‚Äôd start by reading some self help and taking some time to really get in touch with yourself via journaling your feeling both good and bad.

Start figuring out where the tender parts of your heart are. Once you uncover some triggers you can start making a plan for how you‚Äôll act when your upset in those moments.

For me I take a lot of time away to settle down. Even if it takes hours that‚Äôs ok? The important thing is you take that space and don‚Äôt create more damage while upset in the deep feelings that come up.

You got this! The desire to improve is the biggest thing you need to change and then the willingness to pick up some new tools

For tips , the things mentioned before you can try. best of luck to you two.

6,"It sounds like your partner may be feeling emotionally and mentally exhausted from the daily challenges of dealing with your as of yet untreated condition. Their mental health is important as well. You don‚Äôt want them to put your health above their own, that‚Äôs unhealthy and also a recipe for building resentment. 

It might be a good idea for you guys to consider taking a break for a few weeks. Your partner can focus on resting and rebuilding their stamina and you can focus on starting your own self care - watching the Dr Fox videos, starting the DBT workbook, getting into a regular routine of eating healthy, getting enough sleep, regular exercise if you aren‚Äôt already doing that.

I would also suggest a few books for at least your partner to read, and even you as well, since you sound pretty sure you have BPD: ‚ÄúTalking To A Loved One With Borderline Personality Disorder‚Äù by Kreisman, ‚ÄúStop Walking On Eggshells‚Äù by Mason & Kreger, ‚ÄúLoving Someone With Borderline Personality Disorder‚Äù by Manning.",Random_Enigma,13twhcv

As some folks have mentioned, it's helpful to communicate your triggers to your partner and ask them to consider them. Although we can be challenging to be with, every relationship requires effort and support from both sides.

However, on a side note, individuals with BPD tend to idealize their partner, considering them their favorite person, and may believe they won't find anyone else like them. The truth is, there are plenty of people out there who may be just as good or even better.

When you begin Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and learn how to be comfortable being alone and the peace that comes with it, as well as how to become emotionally independent from your partner, your perspective will become clearer and more rational.

As someone with BPD, I can assure you that recovery is indeed possible. However, it's important to acknowledge that it won't be an easy journey. The key to recovery lies within yourself, as you need to actively work on improving and grounding yourself, as well as changing your thought patterns and perceptions. It requires consistent effort from you.

It's crucial to understand that while help and support from others may be available, you shouldn't rely solely on external assistance. The primary responsibility for your recovery rests with you. It's essential to take ownership of your healing process and not expect others to do the work for you, even if assistance is offered.

Remember, your commitment and effort in working on yourself will play a significant role in your path to recovery from BPD",Teesamaha,13twhcv

4,"I've never been diagnosed with BPD but I can offer you some weird advice. I'm not a mental health professional and I have never been diagnosed with BPD but my parents have it, I've dated a few people with BPD and I am neurodivergent. 

My advice is to look at your BPD like a neurodivergence with added childhood trauma, as if you would have been diagnosed with autism if not for the negative childhood experiences. I think part of the reason therapy doesn't help with BPD is because therapists sometimes attack the wrong problem, DBT, talk therapy etc doesn't really help with people who are on the autistic spectrum. Instead maybe try something like [Easter Seals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easterseals_(U.S.)) but for adults? Again I'm not a mental health professional but it's something you could try.

Try look for resources that help people with autism when they have meltdowns, and look for resources for people with PTSD-- It might help to approach it like autism with severe early childhood trauma rather than as a personality disorder, unless of course you have another disorder cobmorbid with BPD.",eli_lili,j1h7xv

2,"Fyi if you are going down the 'finding out what a ""fp"" is' route, then you are gonna waste a lot more of your time and your recovery WILL take longer. It's not a healthy way to look at things. If you get drawn into the 'BPD is my life' online culture then you might as well just throw away the next few years of your life now.

Get away from BPD on the internet until you understand yourself more. Stop reading about how 'hard' BPD is and start reading about recovery. And I mean read real cited books, not shitty online blogs. Do your own research to find them. Everyone's recovery method will be a little different so find your own based on what has been proven to work for others. 

Don't focus on BPD in therapy. If you are still abusing any substances then you are wasting your own and everyone else's time by worrying about BPD. First get clean and learn to deal sober, and drop the 'woe is me' attitude. When you've achieved that, use therapy to learn how to form healthy relationships and how to deal with emotional intensity/instability. 


You'll be fine. Do this right and you'll cut a 'lifetime' down to just a year of part time study before you're healthy enough to be working/dating etc. It may be a bit longer if the substance abuse problems are really bad, so go at your own speed.",,vcoj8a

8,"having worked in substance abuse and behavioral health, I‚Äôll tell you something you don‚Äôt want to hear.

the idea that you ‚Äúknow yourself well enough to go about your own therapy‚Äù is a load of shit. The condition of BPD is defined by instability in emotions, relationships, etc., and it is impossible to truly ‚Äúknow‚Äù anything while living a life of instability.

It‚Äôs the same concept of ‚Äúknowing everything you need to do‚Äù to get better, yet you don‚Äôt can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt do it. Metaphorically it‚Äôs like knowing that to get to another continent you will need a plane, but you have no legitimate knowledge or ability to get a plane. It‚Äôs just an idea and a thought that almost feels like a reality because you are capable of feeling the emotion of what it would be like if you were to do it.

Until you are stable enough to legitimately realize your patterns of behavior and be held accountable for them (also a big IF as it‚Äôs very common for BPD to make you avoidant and run away from those who do hold you accountable), it is in your best interest to find a therapist that you trust, and trust them with your life. Find someone who works for you and challenges you to harness the powers you have to figure everything out.",RedDevilsUnite,vcoj8a

1,"In situations like that I kind of reorganize my friend structure with that person. 

If someone I talked to everyday was contributing to negativity or toxicity, I would first try to change the tone around our conversations. If that didn‚Äôt work I would just distance myself, maybe talking to them every other day or once every few days. I realized that just because someone has their own ‚Äúnegative‚Äù traits doesn‚Äôt mean I need to cut them off. It just means you need to set some boundaries around the time you spend with them, or maybe changing the relationship to be more positive. 

For me this shift in tone or time helped blend the positives and negatives of the relationship in a way that didn‚Äôt cause me to see the person as automatically 100% toxic.",PickledIntestines,yptltx
2,"I've been on both sides of the equation -- in addition to BPD, I have treatment-resistant depression. Add in a nihilistic outlook and I know how much of a pain I can be. Recently, however, a lifetime's worth of ""work"" on healing seems to be paying off.

The only things that kept me going through the bad times was (a) listening and trying to be helpful, and (b) trying to keep the focus off myself. I couldn't bring myself to look at the causes or effects of my illnesses, so focusing on my friends' problems and trying to help them through their own difficulties was the safe way to go.

These days, I've been making serious progress with both my depression and my BPD, but the habit of listening and helping is ingrained. Having a light touch and as much of a non-judgmental attitude seems to help. When with my friends, I only have to remember how much of a shithead I was/was capable of being, and my rationale for kindness has changed from one of escape to one of loving-kindness. That's not to say that in the past I wasn't inspired by loving-kindness, but nowadays it's stronger and purer.",Cascando-5273,yptltx
3,"This is actually really good advice, thank you. I've tried reframing the conversations to be more positive and it always still takes a downturn because they always find a way to bring it back to something negative, particularly about themself. 

So maybe stepping back a little and setting those boundaries around the time I spend with them will work better, because sometimes I just need some space - and maybe they just need the space to let that negativity out?

I told myself I wanted to do DBT so I could break the cycle that runs in my family. I wanted my son to have a better mom then what I did. And you know what? I am.

I agree with the user who says recovery is a constant process. I had a couple of years of therapy before my symptoms were well-managed, but if I have gaps in treatment it can be harder to maintain that. 

I don't think there were huge marks of progress. It was small things -- maybe there was a trigger in my life I didn't lose my shit over, or fewer bad days, or being able to do things I hadn't done before. I slowly edged into feeling okay. Eventually I had bigger milestones like going back to college and being able to work, but that was a long way into that process. It was a very gradual improvement. 

I think being in group and individual therapy helped me a lot. I don't talk a lot in therapy groups, but it gave me the sense of solidarity, knowing other people were going through what I was. If something in group was a big thing I wanted to dig into more, I could bring it up in an individual session.

I had a lot of luck with affirmations for distress tolerance when I was really upset. Things like ""This hurts now, but I can make it through this"" or ""I'm trying my best"" when I felt bad about my progress, or generally reminding myself that mistakes I made weren't the end of the world. Focusing on those over and over gave me *something* to focus on when my thoughts were racing, and I think they made me a lot kinder to myself, since my go-to was to internalize every bad thing in my life.

I also really like the ""opposite to emotion action"". There are so many times I didn't feel like doing things, especially when I was going through my divorce and things like that. The more I pushed myself to do therapy, to not push people out of my life, and to try things I was afraid of, the less I felt my mental illness was crippling me. I think I also felt more valuable as a person, too, because I became more productive and was able to see what I had to offer as a friend, a worker, a daughter, so on, which made it harder to feel that people would be better off without me or like I was a burden to the people I love.",torgoboi,jx84f2

1,"My Psychiatrist honestly corrected me on this. I was about to be clean for 2 months and she told me I had a lapse which means I did it once, but didn't continue over and over again. Honestly I did it because my ex left me because I had BPD and used it against me. Relapses really open up your eyes when you think and talk about it whether it's with yourself or your therapist. Having BPD it's literally a symptom that we cannot control our emotions but the more we understand we deal with them better. They haunt you a lot unlike how much we work towards on recovering and understanding it's an episode and we recognized it. My therapist always kept saying that because we were never taught to celebrate little things in life, even getting up from our bed is a big thing. 
Honestly I know we constantly question ourselves and you have too, it's just a part of you. It doesn't define you. I had the exact question on whether it's BPD or my real feelings, my Therapist told me to just be with the feeling and stay in the moment because figuring out which was it makes you more confused and you cannot control yourself because you need an answer. 
As far as your relationships are concerned, I had lost 90% people in my life when I got diagnosed 8 months back, most don't understand. I just went back to college after an year of all this and I'm still not okay. Taking help is fine, going to therapy for BPD helped me a lot, people make comments and I still take weeks to recover, I cry a lot and blabber nonsense. It's okay if they forgive you, but they have limits too, only difference is that they don't take your health as a personal thing, you aren't your disorder. It took months for my family and 4 friends to understand.
 Yes everyone has their own lives and be busy, but I started coping with it and not taking it personally, if I do, I voice it out and tell I need some time and communicate. I ran away a lot from people and my family, physically too, there will always be atleast 1-2 who won't leave you. 
If my family or friends don't understand, I just take it with my therapist. He's never once denied or told I'm overracting because it's not, it's just how we are wired since childhood and everything, we cannot be just okay in a day. It's takes a lot of time to change yourself and remould your behavior, which is totally acceptable.

Now that the end may literally be here, we are no longer ""SICK"". We are now proven to have simply been the canaries of a dying world. Not a doomer, an empiricist...",IconoclasticAlarm,q8qdrj
0,"I understand your concern and it‚Äôs totally valid. Also, congrats on the recovery and the way you seem to be striving for it!

Now about your question specifically: I struggled a lot with that in my early 20s. I had the impression I had no convictions and my opinions shifted from black to white at all times.

A few things helped with my condition:

Tests: Online tests. Plenty of them. I used to go to Queendom and take all the available tests. They helped me get to understand a few superficial values. From there I went on to explore things that seemed to make sense to me (political beliefs, spiritual beliefs, career options, lifestyle) so I could delve deeper.

People: This comes with time, but it‚Äôs important to build enough self-esteem, self awareness and boundaries to recognize who is toxic and who is good. Oftentimes ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people are also very confused themselves about their own identities and they will see an easy target on you to project their mess. I was able to rebuild myself when I cut ties with my messy mother and established what were the points in my life she had a say or not.
Don‚Äôt be afraid to say no, don‚Äôt be afraid to establish boundaries. By strengthening your core, you‚Äôll suddenly start to realize that you have an inner set of values and thus, a personality.

Embracing the chameleon: At some point in my life I also realized that 1- maybe some people fit by just not fitting, and 2- the brain is an ever shifting organ, so your mind and personality are too. It is OK to love something by today and absolutely loathe it tomorrow. Things don‚Äôt have to make sense all the time. Contradiction IS part of the human nature. Just embrace it too. Extraneous questions will make you shift. Sometimes it will be gradual, sometimes it might be disruptive. Embrace, accept, adapt. Be weird. Have several personas, they are all you. That‚Äôs ok too.

I‚Äôm sorry for the lengthy response. I hope this helps. Stay safe.

Edit: typo",DadHunter22,fz3n1f
1,"I think you said it when you said you realize you are fluid. For me, it is most important that my identity does not shift to the person who just walked in to the room. I am now resistant to others telling me why my thoughts and emotions are not healthy, valid, or sane.  They are thoughts. We all have them. Emotions, we all have them, my caution is in getting too attached. I can now shift between thoughts, emotions and reality; looking at things from different angles, which is what I believe is a more human and compassionate approach than the rigidity I used to get stuck in. As a heterosexual woman, this resistance to others defining me is particularly problematic because most men are trained to fix women. They seem to be tuned in to sniffing out a problem and attacking it. They do not respond well to my independent view. Either way, I can leave a point of view to explore a new one, and I sometimes have to be aware not to attach to anything extreme. 

&#x200B;

On the other hand, Honestly, I do struggle in the current pandemic and have been more stuck than I have become accustom to. Anyway, I digress. We are all moving pieces on a board. The classic problem, to me, seems to be in getting stuck on one spot on the board. While I have developed moral stances and intellectual points of view that I deeply agree with, I can also let my behavior shift with circumstance and adapt in an almost normal capacity. Not sure how much of this makes sense to you, but who I am is beyond definition, while what I believe can be roughly sketched, but finally, as a borderline, how I act it where I practice, every day. That will always be my achilles heel. Maybe this helps a little to ease up on the gas when it comes to rigidly nailing down a ""persona.""",wtfrweeeedoin,fz3n1f
2,"Could you please expand on ""1- maybe some people fit by just not fitting,"" ?",ellaravencroft,fz3n1f
3,"Sure! For long I struggled with having a ‚Äúweak‚Äù personality because I thought I had to fit into groups in order to be accepted and liked. So my convictions and tastes would change from A to B to C according to what group I was trying to fit at the moment. But I had my own set of beliefs and they were quite strong, and personal and they made sense - in their particular way - and they were perfect, even though flawed. And I wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfit‚Äù a 100% percent anywhere. Because that‚Äôs what having a personality is. You can have a circle of like minded people around you, or even several groups where you can have shared beliefs or interests, but you don‚Äôt have to live as a shadow of anyone. You can, finally, grow up to understand that you can ‚Äúfit by not fitting‚Äù. Just be yourself and you‚Äôll be accepted by the people who deserve to know you the particular way you are.

0,Can I ask what the dosage of Seroquel you took was?,gooseglug,nty430
1,"I find that no matter how stable I am, a super low dose of seroquel makes such a difference to everything. I've just come off mine again and have barely slept in 2 weeks even with prescription melatonin. The seroquel is amazing for my anxiety, just hate the side effects.",SadieSadieSnakeyLady,nty430
2,It‚Äôs funny how unique we all are. I had to come off of seroquel because it was depressing me... I was like a zombie,,nty430
3,I'm also in the process of coming off seroquel due to a serious health issue. Down from 525 in January to 250 now. I found that reducing by 25mg every 2 weeks lessened the impact of reduction and withdrawal. How quickly have you come off and was it from a high dose? It takes a while for the brain to adjust sadly. When I tried to reduce by 75mg at once I felt like I was coming off hard drugs. How long have you been off them? Maybe an alternative is possible?,Danidinger,nty430
4,I was at 400 mg. Nothing lower than 150 was considered a ‚Äúworking dose‚Äù on me.,hopeful-pessimist13,nty430
5,"Just found this sub as I‚Äôm about to be off seroquel, is The B borderline were talking here?  I feel like the bipolar and borderline committees need to come together and decide on acronyms moving forward.",Stuffdougsmade,nty430
6,Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt start to impact me until 150.,hopeful-pessimist13,nty430
7,It takes me usually two weeks to phase out of that. At first it‚Äôs almost like I can‚Äôt wake up in the mornings. And it‚Äôs like that whenever I got an increase in dose as well. Once that adjustment was over it was like the only thing that controlled my extreme highs and lows that happens throughout the day. Intermittent bursts of anger being the biggest thing it zapped.,hopeful-pessimist13,nty430
8,"We did 50mg at a time until I was at 50, then did 25 for five days. But I could already feel the negatives at 50 mg. I wanted to give myself more time to adjust in theory, but within days of being completely off the medication my sugars dropped into the 100‚Äôs and have stayed there (we couldn‚Äôt bring them out of the 300‚Äôs). 

I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve tried *all* the alternatives, but it certainly feels like it. Seroquel was the hesitant choice anyway because I‚Äôm just someone that balloons up on it and that‚Äôs mostly all without dietary change, since it‚Äôs metabolic altering. It‚Äôs not about the vanity, if it was just losing out on the beach body of my dreams I‚Äôd take mental health in a second. Unfortunately I‚Äôm in a dangerous zone with weight. Uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, fatty liver. 

I know normal is all relative but I just hope to have some semblance of it again. I was really beginning to think age and therapy were crucial to my recovery. Feels like I‚Äôm picking up all the pieces again and I just don‚Äôt want to destroy anything in the process.",hopeful-pessimist13,nty430
9,Did you slowly taper off of it or come off it all at once?,gooseglug,nty430
10,Bipolar is referred to as just bipolar. Borderline personality disorder is referred to as BPD.,gooseglug,nty430
11,"I completely understand this. How long have you been off them fully now? it's so frustrating when you find a medication that works after years of fighting.

If you want to talk about how you're feeling and what withdrawal things you're experiencing I'm happy to talk!

I'm proud of you trying to do what's best for your overall health even if it's not an easy choice at all! this wont undo all your progress even if it feels like it is. I've personally got to come off Seroquel because it's causing my heart rate to shoot up to dangerous levels in the night and has been for years I just didn't realise it! it was a wonderdrug for me so I'm nervous about being off it too. But I sadly have no choice it seems.",Danidinger,nty430
12,Slowly weaned. With doctors approval.,hopeful-pessimist13,nty430
13,Thanks for the response...I did end up putting it together that I was in the right place. By all the seroquel talk and realizing I was clearly outnumbered by females.,Stuffdougsmade,nty430
14,"Oh my gosh that‚Äôs so scary! Ans you know what? I just blamed my physical health but when I‚Äôm on Seroquel my resting heart rate is in the 80‚Äôs, but in the sixties off it. Which is odd considering the anti anxiety impacts it has on me. I had no idea it could have also been the meds. 

I‚Äôm only off of it for two weeks now, but instead of feeling like I‚Äôm making progress my mental health seems to be getting worse daily. But I‚Äôm trying to believe that it just takes time and two weeks isn‚Äôt long at all. I know how difficult relationships can be for those of us with borderline and it‚Äôs been profoundly impacting my emotionally state with my partner. He‚Äôs understanding but also I think doesn‚Äôt really like me coming off the medication. He knows why and gets it, but I totally understand why it‚Äôs literally like being with a different person right now. I feel bad for him and me. 

Thanks for understanding! Have you found any methods to help being off the medication?",hopeful-pessimist13,nty430
15,Your reason why you had to come off of Seroquel is the exact reason why I came off of it last month. My resting rate was super high and it was causing heart palpitations.,gooseglug,nty430
16,"It is apparnrlty known to have impact on the heart but it seems to be somewhat ignored until its serious enough! I found that if I didn't eat with it at night it would shoot up so I've managed to settle it by eating beforehand until this year when I got rushed to hospital! I've not yet had confirmation it's the medication but the episodes only happened within 2 hours of taking seroquel (once even eating a bunch of chocolate after taking it resulted in a hospital trip in an ambulance) I eat chocolate in the day fine but not within an hour of taking seroquel.

I imagine that's so tough! I'm sadly still on 250mg for now so my side effects have just been me being more emotional to situations I dread the lower doses. I only have learnt coping skills for when I have dissociation episodes which is to use comforting scents to ground me and therapy putty. I've also learnt the importance of a ""break"" to process my emotions when conflict arises or I get an overwhelming emotion. My partner also struggles with knowing how to support the mood changes when it comes to adjusting to lower doses so far. I try my best to explain it when I'm in a calmer state but it's not always easy is it? :( 2 weeks feels like a lifetime right now I'm sure! I think it can take a month to 6 weeks to settle but if you're feeling like it's too much please don't be afraid to reach out to mental health teams ect. Are you part of any mental health support groups irl? They can be a huge help!",Danidinger,nty430
17,Really?! What dose was you on and for how long? I've been on it like 6 years and didn't realise what was happening. I had my heart checked years ago and nobody said anything. It was only when I increased my dose and it caused an episode similar to something like svt that I became aware of what had been happening for years. I've had to slowly taper off it and it seems to be slowly improving but after 2 hospitalisation nobody has linked it to my seroquel it's me who's basically raised the issue!,Danidinger,nty430

This week I had the worst thing ever that could happen to me and am now capable of dealing with it.  Normally it would have destroyed me emotionally and would take a lot to recover from.  But I put up a healthy boundary (cut contact with abusers), started medication (mirtazapine in addition to the escitalopram I was already on) and have been talking to a therapist.  Have also quit drinking, stopped using cannabis, gotten rid of my FP issues, and started taking art classes online.

0,"BPD takes years and years to 'recover from'. As it is literally our personality, one month of therapy does not change that. You and your bf needs to realize that it's a long process. You are also capable of a relapse, and I believe most BPD people do experience a relapse at some point.

You have not regressed to anything, as there is no stages of recovery. We do not recover, we change our thought patterns and behavioral patterns gradually over years. This allows us to 'recover', in the sense that we finally get out of the toxic circle that we create for ourselves and manage to find balance. In addition to this we learn emotion control, which makes everything easier.

We are who we are. We can change, but it takes time. If he doesn't like who you are, then I don't think you're a good match. You sound like an empathetic person, and honestly he sounds horrible.

This is a quick pit to fall in, whether he does it consciously or not. Every time he disagrees with something or wants you to do something, saying 'have you gone back to your old self?' seems like a quick and easy way to get what you want. He may not realize it, but I would be careful if I was you. You might want to talk about it.

And finally, I want to say this. _The way we feel about things ARE NOT WRONG_. We lack the capability of processing and controlling our emotion. But we are not living in an imaginary world where we are dictated by insanity. You have a right to feel the way you do. You are equally as sane as he is. It's how you _act_  what counts. Do NOT discredit yourself because of BPD. We are perfectly sane people with difficulties processing emotions and bad coping mechanisms which cause us harm.",Melthiela,132hnv0

2,"Hi! So I struggle with this same problem; I‚Äôve had a big fear of wanting to get better for a long time that I‚Äôve been battling, but it‚Äôs gotten a lot easier over the years and I had a big ‚Äúa-ha!‚Äù moment the other night when I realized one thing. 

So for me, I finally figured out that what it stems from is that I grew up in an environment where I wasn‚Äôt allowed to feel, wasn‚Äôt allowed to express hurt or anger so instead for the majority of my childhood I just kept it all inside. This compounded when my parents split and I became responsible for my three younger siblings, especially when we were at our dad‚Äôs, because he refused to take care of us and didn‚Äôt really love us the way a parent should. I basically had to take on the emotional role of a parent at the age of 10 after years of repressing my emotions already and that took a massive toll. Over time, all of that pent up anger and frustration and immense hurt built up and eventually it exploded. I started hurting and hurting and hurting and it felt like it would never stop. But at the same time, it felt good, because I was finally feeling all these things I‚Äôd held back over the years and, my GOD, it felt so good to recognize I did have pain and I was hurting and it felt so good to just let it all out. To just let myself be raw and open and real and not hold it back anymore. It was kind of like a volcanic eruption, in that it was caused by immense built up pressure below the surface and it relieved that pressure to let it come out finally, but it also destroyed the town below and the surrounding forests in the process. 

Eventually I got stuck in the catharsis of feeling that pain for so long that hurting was no longer cathartic but instead became comfortable; it became my safe place. I felt at home there and even kept myself there willingly and actively sabotaged myself when I started to leave that place and for a long time I wasn‚Äôt sure why. I always just attributed it to, ‚Äúit‚Äôs BPD and that‚Äôs why I feel this way‚Äù but never linked it to something deeper, so instead it always just felt like trying to fight the inevitable since I always thought it was something I just couldn‚Äôt help. It wasn‚Äôt until I realized that it was because I needed a place to feel my pain‚Äîand feared that I wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to feel hurt or anger anymore once I recovered‚Äîthat I understood this roadblock and what got me stuck there in the first place. And that provided me with a solution. So now I‚Äôm focusing as I go forward on not repressing either side of me, hurt or happy or any of the other vast aspects of my beautiful multiplicity, because I am a person and I am a lot of things and why limit my multi-dimensionality? Who I am is vast and diverse and it is limitless and I just don‚Äôt see any use anymore in confining myself to one facet when I can have the whole thing. And I‚Äôve found that I feel much better when I‚Äôve felt a feeling as much as I need to feel it, because then I can naturally transition to feeling something else. I have to make space to feel all my feelings. And to allow myself to hurt when I need to, but also to know when it‚Äôs time to move on. But that knowledge that even as I continue to get healthier I‚Äôll still be able to feel hurt and sad when I need to was really freeing because now it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of anymore. I just feel so free and very at peace.

Recovery doesn‚Äôt mean feeling happy all the time. It doesn‚Äôt mean always being in a place of peace and understanding. Most of it is uphill. I‚Äôve been in earnest intentional recovery for a few years now and I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm doing half of the time, and there are still lots of moments where I feel lost and scared and confused and afraid and I fall into old patterns before I realize what I‚Äôm doing and pick myself up again. It‚Äôs all part of human multiplicity. It‚Äôs the way things are.

But then there are also these moments when all the work I‚Äôve been putting in and all the things I‚Äôm thinking about all finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô, I come to a new understanding and awareness that I didn‚Äôt have before, and inside I just feel an immense peace and clarity. And it‚Äôs a beautiful feeling. I don‚Äôt feel that all the time, although as much as I still do fear leaving my old identity of suffering behind, I find myself more and more even on a subconscious level actually /wanting/ to feel good. Wanting to do things to feel good. Wanting to feel that peace and clarity and insight again. 

And even when things feel awful, I just make it through by knowing nothing can stay the same forever and instead the only way to make it through the turbulent ocean of BPD emotion is to just ride each wave as it comes. Nothing stays the same forever, and there is beauty in change. And just because I‚Äôm in recovery now doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt still feel hurt or anger or upset at what happened to me. It doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt still have a place to feel my pain. But it means I have room to feel more things now. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm going to living in a world of color and as harsh as it is sometimes, it‚Äôs beautiful getting to feel a whole range of things again. 

And besides, as you get further away from where you used to be and start to feel healthier, you‚Äôll start to remember yourself, too. Identity can be found in lots of things. It can be found in pain, true, but it can also be found in survival. In recovery. In healing. In choosing, no matter how many times you get knocked down, to continue to get up and keep going again. Identity can be found in strength. And hope. And love. And there‚Äôs a part of you buried underneath even all that, too‚Äîthe real you, the core you‚Äîthat I‚Äôd be willing to bet is still there underneath all that pain. The real you is still there underneath all that and has never left you. It may just take forging your way through until you find you again because that real core you is there, even now, waiting for you. You‚Äôll find it. 

So my suggestion honestly is just to keep going. The fact that you‚Äôre tired of being where you are is an important step, because it means you have some motivation and a reason to move forward. Recognizing you don‚Äôt want to be like this anymore is the first step and it‚Äôs a big one because it‚Äôs also the hardest. You won‚Äôt lose your fear of the unknown right away‚Äîyou‚Äôll continue to come head to head with it again and again as you continue forward, but it does get easier and there do come more and more moments in between where you‚Äôll find happiness and strength and peace and where you‚Äôll be so glad you decided to move forward. And those moments are worth fighting for. 

Lastly, the answer won‚Äôt come to you right away, it can take lots of time and soul searching and the realization can come about when you least expect it, but maybe ask yourself why you feel so afraid and what‚Äôs at the root of it (like how I realized for me that I was afraid to recover because I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt have space to feel my pain anymore). Coming to understand why and how you are the way you are can help a lot because it gives you a new, more compassionate understanding of yourself and helps you create a unique solution that will help you to battle that fear. It‚Äôs kind of like going on a quest and picking up hints and clues and different swords and things along the way and it‚Äôs hard a lot of the time, but sometimes you meet someone who gives you important words of wisdom or you discover a tool you didn‚Äôt know you needed and it makes the whole thing a lot easier. Wishing you lots of love and strength to you on your journey, and just keep moving forward. ‚ù§Ô∏è",quentincoldwater9,iqyqeb

recovery never ends but life gets A LOT better

recovery is very simple, but we think it is very hard.  follow the path others have laid out before you, it works.  many tools are available online do not wait on or rely on the NIH.

CBT, DBT, Mindfulness, Buddhism, etc.  Use all the tools.  Learn with a passion.  Recovery takes time.

0,"BPD can be a really ""invisible"" problem for a lot of people, because they don't see the inner turmoil that we go through. As someone who grew up with parents who didn't believe in the concept of mental health, I would suggest to not bring it up to them for a while. It's just not worth it. Work on yourself, keep seeing the professionals you're seeing, and try to seek support from friends or from people like us online. I know this is disheartening - but this is YOUR journey and your parents and brother are making it about them, and how they see your issue versus understanding how you see and FEEL about your own issues.

You deserve your own space to work all this out. If you're not in DBT, try to get into a program or with a therapist who does DBT. If neither is possible, work on DBT workbooks and try apply those skills in every day life. You just can't change people's minds who don't understand. It's unfortunate but it's true; you deserve to recover and you deserve people who believe in you. We believe in you, and your feelings deserve to be validated.",Creative_Lettuce_630,q57hsq

3,"My family are unsupportive. They didn't help me, they stigmatized me. When I get better they are super happy n relived but they are quick to turn around and use my mental health issues against me at the first opportunity and say that I will always fall back in my old patterns (which is not true). They said I'd never change a few years back but now they tell me I changed a lot and that I am doing better -\_-"". They were never there when I needed them and they are still not. I learned to be my best friend and to be my own savior.  


Your family seems unsupportive and from what I understand they are actively harmful and puts your recovery at risk. I had to get away from my family to get better. I literally moved towns. It was a hard decision but I had to prioritize my self and my recovery. I don't know if it's a possibility for you but I think it'd be best. If not have some clear boundaries and let your brother know that what he said was unacceptable even if he was angry.  


You can get some DBT workbooks if you did it in the past and it helped. I don't think people will be your mentor for free because it's a lot lot lot lot lot of work to help someone to deal with mental health issues. You always got reddit to ask stuff but I think some work you got to do on your own even if it's hard as fork. I know how hard it can be I went thought that. But I also have some friends I can write to if I need, some of them have BPD.

I also try to explain my condition to my parents but my mom already read the stigmatizing stuff about BPD and wouldn't listen and my dad doesn't really cares or listen so. I think you shouldn't spend time trying to explain your disorder to your family. I understand what it's like to really wish your family would support you but you alone can't make that happen. It has to come from them. I think that the best thing you can do is to reinvest that energy into getting better.   


Remember that recovery isn't linear and can be heavily affected by environmental factors. It's ok if something bad happens to you and you get a ""BPD flair"" because of it. Have some empathy for your self when it gets worst. It'll really help to not go too deep and to get better. The sun will shine again.",,q57hsq
4,"I think it helps if we hear that we are doing a good job. We are genuinely trying to get better, however many people don‚Äôt see that.

It‚Äôs like positive reinforcement, it encourages you to keep trying and let‚Äôs you know you‚Äôre doing well. What you received from your brother was the exact opposite. If they won‚Äôt hear you out, try writing them a letter explaining how you feel. Tell them it means a lot to you when they are supportive and listen to you, and that saying that you‚Äôre doing a good job goes a long way. Might help a little",mintchoco9,q57hsq

6,"No. My parents and I have a tumultuous relationship at best. When I opened up to them about my diagnosis and they inevitably asked why, I was honest and told them that it's not clear cut however there were many experiences in my childhood regarding their treatment of me that could have contributed.

My parents scoffed, told me that there are different ways to parent and that experts in this field are always changing their minds about what constitutes good parenting. In their mind, because they had good intentions, there is no need for them to ever apologise for any inadvertent damage they caused me.

The biggest thing that has helped me with my parents is radical acceptance and going low contact with them. I moved out of home at 18 as soon as I could, and we only speak every couple of months. 

The reality is that my parents are never, ever going to consider that what I - and my siblings too, if to a lesser extent - experienced was abuse. They are never going to consider their actions, and they will never learn how to properly apologise (both my parents have some narcissistic tendencies). While it would means a great deal to me if they did, it is harmful to me to try and make it clear to them just how badly they messed me up because they always just turn it back around on me.

My parents are the way they are. This doesn't mean I need to change them. It doesn't mean I need to continue to act as if everything is okay.

I do what is best for me. I don't call them. We speak only when they call me, and if they call too often I will moderate this by  accepting the call only when I want to.

I will never stop feeling like I need them to understand, or wanting them to recognise their actions. It was very hard, but I've let go.

I won't let them hurt me anymore. And that's what you need to do in whatever way works for you.

0,"Lots of questions. I‚Äôll answer the best I can, from my own experience. 

1. Yes, I have recovered. My psychiatrist declared me officially in remission back in May of this year, based on a reevaluation. I only exhibit two of the nine criteria now. 

2. You never don‚Äôt have BPD. If you have it, you have it. When a person has ‚Äúrecovered,‚Äù that just means they have developed the skills to manage the symptoms. And, you can relapse. 

2. For me personally, going into remission hasn‚Äôt affected my memory at all. It‚Äôs still the same as it was before. 

3. I was professionally diagnosed. I heavily advocate against the self diagnosis of BPD. 

4. Yes. 

5. I was diagnosed with BPD traits when I was twelve. My symptoms presented severely enough that I was able to be diagnosed when I was sixteen. I went into remission at age 22. 

6. Yes.

7. Some people with BPD don‚Äôt need medication, but many do.

8. I did a combination of DBT, CBT, and a tiny bit of EMDR. I‚Äôm also on meds, but the cocktail that works for me may not work for everyone else. 

9. This is a difficult question to answer because it‚Äôs hard to put into words how I feel, so I just put it like this: I‚Äôm not suicidal anymore. I‚Äôm happy, I‚Äôm thriving, and I‚Äôve literally never been better. 

10. BPD is the most treatable of the cluster B personality disorders. From what I‚Äôve read, recovery is pretty common, but so is relapse. 

11. I‚Äôm not absolutely horrible to be around anymore. People genuinely enjoy my company. I‚Äôm a wonderful fianc√© (his words, not mine) and my recovery is reflected through my grades as well; I‚Äôm a straight A student.",,18p8weo

2,"Well it's not a mental illness in the sense where illnesses could be cured eventually. It's a disorder that is about your personality. That's a big word.  

Can your personality be cured? No. Can it change? Yes, to some degree. Personality is a very broad term and encompasses many things. Some of which are capable of change.

I am currently in remission. I am in a stable point of my life, safe. I don't want to hurt myself, I don't feel empty, I don't have extreme emotions that I can't deal with anymore. I don't go from love to hate, I don't take eons to calm down anymore. I can be by myself and be okay with it, I don't blame myself or hate myself. I feel proud of myself! 

I just mainly feel like I'm more safe. I can have strong emotions still but I'm not overwhelmed by them. I don't feel overly scared anymore. I have PTSD though and very severe trust issues so some of my symptoms (such as stress induced paranoia) will probably never leave because they're being amplified by other issues.

I was professionally diagnosed by a group of psychiatrists. The process started when I was 19, I got diagnosed officially at age 20. I had meds for it, and started DBT. Midway DBT I quit my meds and realized that they were making me far worse and I believe that quitting them caused my remission, together with therapy. I'm now 24.

My psychiatrist together with my therapists declared me to be on remission and my therapy discontinued. My fianc√© and I are doing much better now and are much closer. Our fights are pretty far and few and very easily resolved. Generally our life is much easier.

The statistics are easily Googleable, but the likelihood of both recovery and relapse are high. I have no idea about the condition of my amygdala, I've never had an MRI or other head imaging. But as an RN (registered nurse) myself, my educated guess would be that my amygdala hasn't had any growth haha.

5,"
""Emotional Sensitivity and Intensity: How to Manage Intense Emotions as a Highly Sensitive Person"" and ""The Gift of Intensity: How to Win at Life and Love as a Highly Sensitive and Emotionally Intense Person"" by Imi Lo helped me a good deal so far to re-frame what BPD actually *is* and start to move past the shame and stigma.

She outlines all of the positive traits of being highly sensitive, and also how a  BPD diagnosis can come from that, but also how BPD is on a spectrum, not a death sentence, and has crazy overlap with a whole host of other ""conditions"", while also not shying away from the fact that there are processes and behaviors that need changing to be able to thrive and lessen the extent to which we may cause harm to ourselves or others. 

So far it's been very uplifting and encouraging; these two may encapsulate what you're looking for. While the book is *technically* about HSP's, I would posit that 99% of pwBPD are inherently HSP's, and BPD is mentioned throughout.

0,"‚ÄûNormal‚Äú isn‚Äòt the right word, but it‚Äòs common. Also trauma isn‚Äòt always certain dramatic events, it can also be things that *did not* happen. Like maybe your parents never hit you but they also never hugged you for example.",catluvr1312,zmczmx
1,"It's very common not to remember your trauma, but those memories can be recovered with time and a bit of work, if you feel it's necessary. 

BPD is a mixture of genetic and environmental factors, and the environmental ones could be a whole host of things. It can be things like abuse, but it can also be more subtle things - for example, if a parent was dismissive of your emotions, or neglectful or disrespectful, or anything like that. Anything that may have caused you to develop an unhealthy attachment style at a young age.

I really recommend reading The Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook by Dr Daniel Fox. In the early sections he goes through environmental factors that can contribute to BPD and there's a nice clear checklist that you can go through, it really helped me pinpoint all the things that could have potentially been a factor in my developing BPD, including some things I hadn't thought of before.",NadjasLeftTit,zmczmx
2,"Sometimes folks refer to us (ppl with bpd) as having trauma, and our learned behaviours, from trauma due to emotional neglect growing up. This kind of trauma might seem more mundane than criminal events, but can have huge, long-lasting impact. (I want to note that trauma is trauma; it's not about what happened, but how it impacts us - whether we experience physical, sexual, or emotional events.) 

Ultimately, you know your life. While I fully support exploring your past, please don't feel like to need to create anything to make something fit. Likewise, don't minimize something important to you for the sake of someone else. Therapy should be a safe space for you to better explore you - with a little guidance - not something you need to live up to. 

Another thought: why not ask what led to the diagnosis? Your counselor should be able to help you with these questions.",kdew22,zmczmx
3,"In EMDR, we talked a lot about how sometimes to keep you safe, your brain can ‚Äúprotect‚Äù you from the details of a trauma, but you can still experience triggers, so I have worked on finding patterns in reactions I have that aren‚Äôt proportionate to the situation I‚Äôm in & work on reprocessing/working on ways to deal with those physical symptoms. It‚Äôs not required to know what all happened to you, just kind of working through ways to remind your brain that you‚Äôre safe now & the defenses aren‚Äôt needed if that makes sense.",chloebear1993,zmczmx

0,I'm in recovery and single because my partner didn't love me the way I deserved to be loved and I say that in a completely rational and objective way.

2,"undiagnosed but with BPD traits here. i'd probably describe myself as ""in a months-long backslide away from substantial efforts at recovery"", but i've been contemplating how to get back into recovery.

what do i currently perceive as my reality in relationships... hm....... it's. bad? it's not good, but it has been worse before. i'm still able to believe that people love me and that i love them, but i'm really struggling to believe that this love is resilient enough (on either side) to successfully & healthily weather how badly i'm doing rn. not without permanent damage. everything feels unstable, and that's terrifying and makes me angry and sad and scared, which makes me act way worse and self-isolate a lot more.

i don't have faith that the people i'm closest to are capable of being there for me in the kinds of ways that i feel like i need right now (nonjudgmentally & unconditionally), or that i'd be able to believe & accept that kind of love even if it was being given, and i also i don't have faith that i can be there for anyone else in any kind of meaningful way because i'm way too tied up in how badly i'm doing to properly show up for anyone else.

i can tell it's getting dangerously bad because it's really tempting to just continue the alienation of everyone around me so i can finally be left alone to wallow forever/eventually unalive myself when no one is left to care. most days lately i've been thinking to myself that relationships are too painful to maintain and i can't handle it anymore. the people i love matter more to me than anything else in life, and it feels like it's always hurt this much, and i don't have faith that it can hurt less someday (or that i'll be able to maintain the unending exhausting effort it takes to make it hurt less). i've had enough repeated backslides and excruciating relationship rifts over the past \~20 years to convince me this pattern will probably never change.

so that's where i'm at! hope that was useful??",twigathon,qo62ej

But how well does that usually help when you're in the thick of it right? It is scary. It is frightening. It does make you angry. It makes me feel angry for you, the fact that you have to carry all of that.

I hope it gets better for you. If it helps, it got better for me. DBT helps, and I was lucky enough to meet the right person. Though honestly, even with the right person a lot of the time it's still a huge struggle - so if you're having doubts about whether people love you enough, it may not be so much as they don't love you enough, so much as what we suffer from is so tough.

That being said, I'm an only child and my parents are pure dipshits and if they were the only ones I knew, my recovery would barely even happen, if at all.

Anyone else here have the realization that they're kind of a garbage human unmedicated?  
I was diagnosed back in 2018 after getting fed up with my own temper, because I knew it was way out of line and abnormal. I hyperfocused on BPD, read some books, got a few workbooks, started on medication and found my sweet spot.  
  
All of that has led to a lot of self awareness and recovery, and lately I made a casual comment to a friend that when I'm not medicated I'm overall just a garbage human and she got a little upset with me. It's not even meant to be self depreciating or derogatory, it's just the truth. üòÇ Anyone else feel that way?",RotterWeiner,16dfyra
3,"I've come a long way in the last two years being medicated.  I've also learned a lot about communicating my emotions and needs, where as I used to run away from situations that I couldn't deal with or shut down when I got overwhelmed.  I was also known to have meltdowns and self harm.

I wouldn't say that I'm a garbage human being unmedicated, but I was a human being that made mistakes and handled things poorly.  And I think that's a distinction that's important to make.  

It's important to accept responsibility for handling things poorly or making mistakes, but it's also important to remember that you're human and you deserve to forgive yourself for making those mistakes.",CokeinUphurrkut,16dfyra

9,">I think that's a distinction that's important to make. 

Oh I know. But hindsight has made me realize that when I'm unmedicated I'm abusive to my children. So in my world, that makes my unmedicated self a garbage human. Medicated, my kids adore me. Unmedicated, they're scared of me. I was terrified of my dad my entire childhood, I won't make them feel that.",20Keller12,16dfyra

0,Hi! I‚Äôm interested in this :),Angry-Kangaroo,wpeo47
1,"First off, I applaud you for having the wherewithal to not only be aware of your tendencies/disorder, but actually address the issue forwardly. Anyone who has experienced BPD with an individual they deeply love, (not just a tinder date that blew you off.  And while that sucks too, its not quite as damaging in my opinion.) they are deeply affected by the disorder. Mostly people who form codependency. I will be the first to tell you, that BPD is not perceived as negatively as you might think after reading the freshly damned, broken lovers that tend to arrive here. They are hurt. They are seeking answers that maybe you and I already are familiar with, and many have not accepted what's happened, or do not yet understand the mechanisms behind BPD or how/why people afflicted, do what they do. I actually have a tremendous amount of sympathy for those with BPD, and spent years of my life striving to understand the disorder.

&#x200B;

My pwBPD was extremely destructive and impulsive, but she was genuine. She simply had chronic low self esteem, deep unhealed wounds from her abusive childhood, and severe impulse control. My experience began nearly 15 years ago, and 2.5 years ago, our relationship ended.

&#x200B;

She caused me great pain. The last year we were together, she was diagnosed and I tried really really hard to motivate her, help her stay on task with DBT and reassure her that I was in for the long haul. I tried to learn as fast as I could about it (and there's A LOT to learn) but I had never heard of it before, and had no idea what I was doing. It was doomed.

I think its a wonderful Idea you have and I would be happy to answer question for you, tell my story, give you ideas or advice, proof read, or otherwise help you in any way I can. I'm sorry you were not welcomed to our group sooner. In my opinion, PwBPD that are trying to heal, should be welcomed into groups like this with open arms. Its really, beneficial for all of us to understand each other. Also, remember one thing, PwBPD are on a spectrum. Ranging from mild(with traits) to completely destructive, with other co-morbid disorders like NPD and ASPD, or traits, and are much more damaging. Every situation is different.

Feel free to DM me. I'm not opposed to a video call interview either.

Let me know!

Keep up with your journey to heal, you're doing good things.

0,">I wanna be in her corner after every session together. I want to lift her up after every session. I want to stop any therapist from hurting her if it‚Äôs going that way. I want to cheer her up after any sessions. 

>I want to support her through getting an assessment. And I wanna be there for her every step of the way.

Reading what you wrote, it seems that you want to take on way too much. Let me ask you a question - why? Why is it so important for you to be needed? Why do you want to take on a parental role? The best question you can ask yourself is what motivates me here? If I do all this for her, what will that say about me? Do I base my self-worth on being needed by others? Or sacrificing myself? Those are the hallmarks of codependence. Does focusing on her issues get me away from my own self-esteem issues?

This wouldn't be healthy for either of you. She would be dependent and you co-dependent. Yet you want to put so much energy into her. Did you have to emotionally take care of a parent and that's why this is normal for you? Because this would be taking on a parental role and would be enabling and reinforcing her and your codependence. 

What if you set healthy boundaries and honored her boundaries. She is taking some space. What if you respected that? If she reaches out, you can mention therapy but she has to want it. You can't change her. If she needs support, she will let you know. Honor that. Don't parent her and get enmeshed in her life. Take this time apart from her to focus all that energy on yourself. That would be heathy. I wish you the best.",GirlDwight,1biacdn
1,">I want her to take the next step.

I'm sorry but you have no power here. What you want is irrelevant. Therapy doesn't work unless she wants it and she's motivated to get it. We can't control or change other people. Only how we respond to them. You like the potential in her but that's not the real her. The person you like doesn't exist. Being her friend means seeing who she is and accepting it. If she's hurtful, then distancing yourself with heathy boundaries. I'm sorry.",GirlDwight,1biacdn

5,"Sure you can DM. 

>I am doing it for me

Okay that's sounds like you want her to change for you. I'm sorry but that's not possible. And if she desires a parental role which most BPD's do, she'll be angry at you not filling it. It's a lose/lose. You become the parent, she doesn't change inside because you can't change from external validation and she is still angry at you because of her needs to place blame outwards and be the victim. If you put boundaries in place and engage, she gets angry that you won't be the parent. And again she is playing the blame on you for her emotions. So both these options are the opposite of helping her because they just reinforce her disorder of outward blame. And they enable you to be co-dependent instead of healing.

What if you enacted heathy boundaries by disengaging? That's the kindest thing you can do for her. It's what may actually motivate her to change or just find a new ""parent"". I know the pull for you is strong, it's an addiction. It's like you're in a cult and she's the leader. It's very hard to see reality and get out. The time and energy you spend on her just strengthens your indoctrination. But time away from her not spent thinking about her will help you ""see"" reality and break the cult leader- victim bond.",GirlDwight,1biacdn
6,"Here is my reply to both of your last posts:

I don't want to be in a parental role.

For reasons I'm not gonna get into, I don't have many people and have difficulty getting close with most. I do like her as a person and unless I'm completely off in my assessment of her mirroring capabilities (which I think are mediocre), I think she's a good person. And also good at promoting my growth and I hope I am decent at promoting hers.

I don't base my self worth at all based upon others. It's been very internal to me for a while.

Sacrificing myself: there is an amount of myself I'm happy to give in any friendship/relationship, she does push boundaries but we're not going to live together this time. And I've learned a good bit about my limitations, boundaries, and we're not getting close to those limitations this time. I've also learned alot about her. I pushed so many of her buttons without even realizing. I pushed them alot. Hell I would push a normal persons buttons unknowingly in the past. It's good to have discovered and lock down my boundaries as it pertains with her. I don't think she'll push too aggressively. She'll be upset but I fully expect her to be ok with them. Or move on.

Codependent? A bit.

I'm not letting her become my life this time. And also making an active effort to build a full life.

Her boundaries, yes I will honor them. Considering everything that went on the past few months, I am impressed she managed to push through and do the right thing. Considering how much it ate away at her. I'm gonna make my peace with her and then I'm leaving her be. Ball is in her court. I'm not gonna BS her. But I do expect her to bite.

She's wanted to change since before she met me, she doesn't quite understand what's going on. She used to believe she was a narcissistic and doomed and did pursue therapy for that and made me aware of it in the beginning. I let her know a few months back that I didn't believe she wasn't one and that there is alot of hope for her. The happiness on her face was priceless. I shared info about DBT w/ her and there was an overwhelming fear on her face. She primarily attends therapy when it allows her to continue assuming the victim role. But I have seen her take responsibility and direct feedback, from me and therapist. I think DBT and the right therapist can make a big impact. 

The ball is going to be in her court entirely, she will have to take responsibility but I will be there for her in a few couples sessions just to make sure the therapist isn't being a dick to her. After she's gotten off the ground, and her personal therapist is in sync. I'm planning to step away from it. If she wants me to come for sessions here and there I will.

I'm not nearly as attached to her as most people become w/ their pwBPD. She didn't destroy my self esteem or worth. Mine is pretty concrete.

1,"I worked in a tier 4 adolescent psychiatric facility for about a year. While you‚Äôd be in a lower tier facility (assuming your stay is voluntary), there are some things that will probably be relevant. Residential facilities are not as effective for treatment as they are meant to be, but they are more effective than they are generally portrayed as being. The vast majority of residents aren‚Äôt there bc they want to be, they‚Äôre there because they or their guardian wants them to get better. Even if someone has a specific established treatment plan, their treatment as well as daily routine will follow the general path of the unit‚Äôs goals - so finding a facility with the closest specialty to your needs or dx is important. I.e., a depression/suicide unit‚Äôs rules group therapy and routine will all be centered around harm prevention and treating depression. If a resident wasn‚Äôt a troublemaker, a lot of their time beyond treatment and routine was avoiding boredom. The more they focused on reaching treatment goals, the shorter they needed to stay. The food will almost certainly be bland and follow a 1-2 week cycle. My one main piece of advice to someone expecting to be admitted would be to get in, get done, and move on. In-patient treatment‚Äôs main advantage is the accelerated pace of treatment and recovery. You‚Äôve heard of what happens in Vegas? People do crazy stuff in mental facilities they‚Äôd never do outside it, because it‚Äôs the safe place you can get it out. As long as you remember what you‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs okay and in fact beneficial to not dwell on the things you do and people you meet. Holding on to those means you don‚Äôt move forward.

I‚Äôm sorry for the infodump. I was raised to be scared of therapists and mental hospitals, and now that I‚Äôve worked in that field it‚Äôs really important to me to help people see the full truth if that makes sense.",TabbyCatWren,1cb9tv3

The rest of the borderline population are actually very very vulnerable, naive...child-like. Gullible. People who are easily swayed. So it's easy for a doctor to come up with some ""breakthrough technique"" such as ""DBT"",  that costs an arm and leg, and try to pitch it to people with this diagnosis. 

People with APD and NPD, even though they are flawed personality, wise tend to be a little bit more sharper, and a little bit more clever, because they have more cognitive empathy. They're not gonna fall for that. So the mental health industry sort of leaves them alone. They let them seek to help when they want to.

We resist treatment because it's so hard to accept a diagnosis that gets instantly written off as abusive and difficult. But yes, it's so much worse for other cluster Bs and that's fucked up. Someone who has been diagnosed with NPD and/or ASPD who is sincerely seeking treatment and is begging to get better already has a huge indicator for success because if you can get to the point of accepting it, you've already done something that is statistically against you and that's life-changing. 

The good news is that more and more research and people-first education for providers is shifting how the profession receives and treats cluster Bs. The overlap between NPD and BPD indicates that they're both highly misunderstood trauma disorders and probably two ends of the exact same spectrum. Don't give up the hunt for a therapist until you find someone informed enough to have the ""well *actually* we call it cptsd now"" conversation and focus on healing your trauma and addressing the symptoms of it that present as a ""personality disorder"" (whatever that even means anymore). It's so hard to find a provider and even harder to find a healthcare team that puts the human before the alphabet soup, but they're out there.

Have you explored childhood trauma at all? It appears to be quite common for people with BPD. Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker is an excellent book. It‚Äôs about CPTSD but that too is still often quite relevant for pwBPD. A great deal of introspection may help you recover some memories and thus help you understand your current and previous behaviours better. This may possibly help form some weak foundation on which to base a sense of self. I am in the process of doing this at present.

Not understanding and doubting who we are is common. Despising oneself is common too, you‚Äôre not alone in that, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less painful. I could list off things that others might say define me, but they‚Äôre all just coping strategies I‚Äôve done a lot really, and they feel skin deep to me.

On the subject of loneliness, it‚Äôs absolutely desolate. Worse around people, and worse around people I care about. People seem so connected to one another, but they‚Äôre right there and a million miles away at the same time. I don‚Äôt know if this is how you feel, but I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on my worst enemy.

If you have problems with trust, I recommend starting there. Trust is a willingness to be vulnerable for some perceived reward. However, if that reward never materialises, be it due to abuses/betrayal, or because the lack of connectedness we feel makes it very difficult, it‚Äôs hard to keep trusting and remain vulnerable, especially in light of feeling like a raw BPD nerve. Nevertheless it‚Äôs agonisingly necessary, as is the equally agonisingly authenticity when doing so. Try and show your authentic self, as in how you‚Äôre feeling and what you‚Äôve been through, even though you despise it, because just possibly someone else won‚Äôt despise it. If you can start to trust enough to truly believe it when someone says that they value your presence, that they like you, that they love you even, then maybe you can begin to feel some degree of the connection and belonging we all deserve.

Once again, congrats on finally having the courage to stop running.",split-divide,17zoojy
1,"Hey thanks and back at you - congratulations on 84 days. I first tried to get clean and sober about 3 years ago by myself but I kept relapsing. I'm at 45 days now since my last relapse. You describe so accurately what I'm experiencing right now, I'm in tears. 

I have worked through some of my trauma from childhood with my therapist, at least what I can remember anyway, but it's not very much. I will check out that book you shared. I have also been diagnosed with CPTSD. I have heard of people doing this thing called shadow journaling, but I don't really know what it is or if that would help me. Have you heard of shadow journaling? Can I ask you what you are doing to build that foundation?

""But they're right there and a million miles away at the same time.""

Oh...this. When I try and connect with people, it feels exactly like we are so far apart. Like I am trying to be someone I never can be, that if I show any of myself, they will see me for who I am and definitely never want to talk to me again. 

What you said about trust and willingness to be vulnerable really, really resonates with me. That's just the perspective I need to hear to motivate me to keep pushing through and putting myself out there. I stopped going to my recovery meetings because of the pain and confusion and haven't gone in almost 2 weeks, but it also really helped me to go. Knowing how I'm not alone in feeling this way and having this particular type of struggle is really helpful to me. Thank you so very much. It means a whole lot to me. So so much.",Alainasaurous,17zoojy
2,"Sorry for the late reply, I found this really hard to reply to for some reason. I don‚Äôt really know why, but I promise it was nothing personal.

Thanks, it‚Äôs gotten easier, I also gave up caffeine 2 days ago, but still vaping nicotine. Relapse is perhaps expected I think until we get answers, but hopefully now you can recognise addiction as a symptom of BPD/CPTSD rather than a cure for some unknown ailment. I really hope that knowledge will perhaps give you strength in the darker times. But hey, if the worst happens, try not to be too Black & White about it. I know if I relapsed right now, be it on drugs or self-harm (kind of the same thing I know), abstinence would feel entirely ruined, but that too is a symptom we must both fight against.

I am glad what I said resonated with you and perhaps made you feel less alone in what you‚Äôre going through. Even if the loneliness remains, know that others are also where you are now right alongside you, even if you would pass each other on the street. It‚Äôs excellent that you were able to cry and in the process grieve a bit, that‚Äôs super important, as is learning to anger at the abuse and/or neglect you may begin to remember a little more, so that you can start to heal from it.

From what little I understand it‚Äôs pretty normal for people to not recall a great deal, but it might come in time and with work/introspection. Further to that you might be able to reframe things given enough introspection. For example, I have 3 days in my life that stood out and I have never truly forgotten, although access to all but 1 disappeared until recently. There is ‚Äòthe day the music stopped‚Äô, ‚Äòthe day I realised expressing was pointless‚Äô and ‚Äòthe day I realised I could run riot‚Äô. The latter of the 3 was wholly wrong. It wasn‚Äôt the day I learnt I could run riot, it was the day I freed myself from fearful isolation and that abuse stopped. I was finally less scared of my parents than I was of the darkness alone upstairs. It was a day I should have been proud of, but I‚Äôd internalised it as me just running riot.

I had to google shadow journalling, and if this is what they meant https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/shadow-work I‚Äôve been doing it already in a round about way. The next bit of my response rolls together your questions regarding shadow work and what I have been doing to try and build a foundation, it also ties heavily in to agonising vulnerability and grasping at some small ability to trust.

I have been part of a group of 10ish friends online for ~25years. It does not feel like I am part of them, but I leave and then go back to the chat server repeatedly for some reason I am yet to understand. They claim to want me there, but I don‚Äôt trust what they say, nor fathom what positivity they see in my presence, and so can‚Äôt internalise that sense of belonging at all. In fact I wish they‚Äôd end the exhausting charade and tell me to leave. Nevertheless, we made a psych focused chat room, and I have been talking or ranting or introspecting or some amalgamation of the three openly in that chat room. Largely to myself it feels like, but importantly where the closest thing to friends I have ever known can all see it. Sometimes it is punctuated by other people with varying degrees of variously healed trauma, but not hugely often. I will openly introspect, consider memories in order to challenge them, acknowledge and discuss triggers, link articles such as https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7357542/ (I feel bad if I let my AirPod battery get too low lol), rage when I am splitting, talk self harm, anger, grieve, talk about how I am feeling generally or more specifically (from joy and relief at feeling leg cramp -> hopelessness -> suicidal in the space of a few minutes), drug relapse, how I personally define emptiness and what BPD feels like and how much it constantly hurts, probably in the vain hope they might hear what my parents never did.

I lay this all agonisingly bare, and importantly in a way that an observer might be able to reasonably understand it somewhat, which requires forming thoughts in to weak words that approximate the intensity of the BPD+CPTSD experience. As a consequence of doing this whilst also reading a couple of books, asking diagnosed people of their experiences, reading peer reviewed articles, credible websites and also reddit, I have started to make some progress. For example understanding how the limbic system works and especially the amygdala, recovering memories, reforming the ‚Äòrun riot‚Äô day, learning about emotional flashbacks, the internal voids and the external void I feel, closing myself up from the world and the world from myself, understanding the inner and outer critic enough to notice what it is that they try to convince me of (e.g. that I am just being dramatic and should stop talking so openly in the chat room). Through introspection and honesty (I basically accused everyone of lying), I also described disorganised attachment before I even knew the term, so when I read about it, I knew it wholly applied to me. I have spiralled in the chat room a bunch of times, as in started allowing catastrophising thoughts to win, typically that they all just want me to shut up and leave, and that they were laughing about me secretly and were ‚Äòjust enjoying the clown show‚Äô. But they‚Äôve chimed in a couple of times and said that was not the case. I don‚Äôt wholly believe them, but the affirmation helped a bit. 

Showing increasing levels of vulnerability (when I started this I didn‚Äôt even really share what music I liked), has made showing vulnerability that bit easier both online and offline. I do sometimes now actually go to my husband and cry when things are bad for example. Perhaps more importantly if he hears me, which during the most painful moments is perhaps inevitable assuming close enough proximity initially, he feels more able to come to me and provide comfort, which makes him feel less isolated, more involved and more useful.

I don‚Äôt know how much this is helping with trust yet, and I don‚Äôt know how much this is helping form a foundation for a sense of self, but as I said before, I am pretty sure both require showing up authentically, which by definition requires vulnerability, so given enough time perhaps they will come to even some small degree. Selfishly, if the loneliness decreases even 1% it will have been worth it.

Funny you should mention stopping going to meetings, I stopped too. My issues largely revolved around an inability to be wholly present due to self-image, feeling like their pain far outweighed my own, and their continued assertion that addiction was a disease. Addiction, at least for me, is not a disease; it is a symptom. As such it triggered me, because as I later came to realise, minimisation of problems flashes me back to all the times I was never helped by my parents. I recommend you introspect the pain you felt, and the confusion you felt, and try to get to the bottom of them. By introspect I mean question and challenge your own thoughts and feelings, especially about why you think or feel in a certain way.

There is no singular bpd experience. Bpd diagnosis requires medical acknowledgment of 5 of 9 symptoms, which means that every person with bpd experiences it differently. 

Consent - as is legally considered - is a complex factor of activity, which goes beyond a simple verbal ""yes"" or ""no"" - especially if a person is dealing with a disorder connected to childhood trauma. There are instances of men and women misunderstanding basic facts about consent - definitely factors such as body language, power dynamic, and sexual history - but there is nothing in the wealth of discussion around bpd and/or sexual assault that points to the spurious connected you're trying to make.",kdew22,z66dwg

5,"TW: SA

I was SA'd and feel that at times I've had several bpd symptoms (who hasn't?) but my therapist said in don't have BPD or bipolar, just depression.

During my SA I had the well known ""freeze"" response instead of fight or flight. I was terrified of him and seeing what he was capable of (later he lied and said he didn't ""mean to"" do it) so I knew to not try to fight, as he was bigger than me. He was on top of me, so I couldn't run for ""flight"". I just...froze. He 100% knew what he was doing. I was so shocked as I woke up to him in my room doing it, that I just froze. I worried that if I tried to fight, he would become (more) violent, as some psychos get off on that.

Since I was in treatment for depression, he used the classic ""she's lying out of spite just to hurt me over something trivial. She has mental health issues"" (the depression) in order to play innocent. He of course, like they all do, claimed he was ""the victim of false accusation"". He even got his case dropped as further ""proof"" of his innocence, which he used to try to ruin my reputation. Organizations like RAINN cite high statistics on rape cases not being prosecuted in the UK and the US. 

So, there is no skewed idea of consent in any form, at all, common to BPD or any other mental condition. Get that right out of your head, please. It comes off sexist and victim-blaming, etc.

Just because 3 people on the Reddit posted ""examples"", doesn't at all mean any form of false rape accusation is related to BPD or any other mental illness in any way.

Rape shield laws bed to be updated to stop every defense attorney since the history of ever to stop asking victims about their mental health history while on the witness stand. More often than not, mental illness is a symptom of (EVIDENCE of) sexual assault, according to science, rather than ""evidence"" the victim ""probably doesn't remember correctly"" or is ""lying out of spite"" or ""making false accusations"" - and that has been scientifically documented again and again. In fact, a high percentage of rape victims have mental health concerns already. That has also been documented by organizations like RAINN. 

Mental illness of any kind must never be allowed to be used in court in attempt to discredit the witness or his or her memory the way it's been done before.

Rapes are notoriously hard to prove because unlike with all other violent crimes, first it has to be proven that a crime even happened then the suspect's or accused's guilt proven. However, in a perverse twisting of justice, more often than not, it's the victim who is scrutinized on the witness stand, rather than the suspect. This adds trauma on top of trauma, and women have ended their own lives over a rape trial due to additional stress caused by bullying and badgering by the legal system's defense of their attacker.",The-Sonne,z66dwg

I think this is where it stems from. The fact that these people who were really violated at very young age, have hard time understanding how they are now being consenting grown adults who never rejected having sex in the first place, but end up feeling/ thinking of being raped/used *(because of frequent diassociation during sex that many pwBPD experience?)* and then making false accusations.

A couple months later I finally confront her about the verbal and psychological  abuse she subjected me to for the entire relationship (it started before we even began dating) and then in there she decides to tell me I was rapist, referencing this time, and telling me that every single time I had ever initiated sex I was raping her.

It helps understanding that putting in the work in doesn't mean having the responsibility on their shoulders, 'cause that's on you.This book simply covers understanding, boundaries and how to work with it.",Aureolindaisy,14luhmj
1,"I genuinely think this is a good idea. It can be hard for PwBpd to know where to start. Another option for longer relationships is couples therapy, where you can both learn more about how the illness affects you. But a good book to start with would be I hate you- don‚Äôt leave me",Dapper_Requirement52,14luhmj
2,"I might get downvoted for this, but I think for a partner they need to make that choice. I think a person with BPD can learn the skills and communication strategies to inform their partner without hurting them. Sometimes when trying to ask a partner to read about it, it puts some of the responsibility on them even if we don‚Äôt intend that. If a partner chooses to read about that ti be a support, that‚Äôs great! But giving them a book and asking them to read about it can bring a lot of pressure as well.

I could be completely wrong though, this is just my opinion on it.",LuridLilith,14luhmj
3,"I have read the stop walking on eggshell's book several times. Initially because I thought my mother was borderline but by the time I got to the end of the book, I was shooketh. It was me! Now that I've learned a lot more about cluster B I'm quite confident my mother is a vulnerable narcissist and my father being in unempathetic emotionless military guy did not provide me any help in the safety and emotional nurturing department growing up. 

Anywho all this to say The book is really helpful! Something that is also really helpful is sensitive stability.com. they have weekly group IES classes and one of the best things I got out of there was doing the trigger map. I did my trigger map and shared it with my partner so that he could see how the worst of the worst BPD traits come out during specific triggers. One of mine is jealousy. So my hope is that my partner is going to care enough about me to know that being a little overly communicative about where they are and when they'll be back, not checking out other women in front of me or making comments about women in general is all going to help me to feel safe and secure.",Reasonable_Serve8001,14luhmj

I think the pwBPD should be able to communicate 

Only if the partner asks should they recommend a book

17,"Thank you so much for saying this. This is essentially my plan. A few days after they decompress from getting back from taking care of their mom, I plan to talk to them about this again. I've done a lot of self reflection this week and realized that one of my core needs to feel secure in a relationship is to feel understood and to be respected/taken seriously. For me this looks like the people I chose to invest in to take my disorder/disability seriously and approach it with compassion. I've been very triggered recently because I percieve that they do this for their brother who has severe bipolar, but not for me. I think that I just percieve them as not taking me seriously, I dont think thats really whats happening. But I really need them to grasp the basic fundamentals of what BPD is in order to truly believe that they care. If I cant get this from them, which I feel like isn't a lot to ask, then I am going to have to break up with them because ultimately its hurting me and our relationship. 

Thank you for responding with compassion, and affirming that I'm not asking for too much. I needed to hear that.",TransGuyKindaFly,14luhmj

I had to face my demons which was so, so incredibly hard but without doing that, I wouldn‚Äôt have begun the healing process. It sounds like you are super supportive and that is key, but he shouldn‚Äôt use BPD as an excuse to get away with toxic behavior. It was when my BF told me ‚ÄúI worry about you constantly ‚Äú that I realized I had a serious problem and that prompted me to seek help.

Maybe not specifically with your weight but it could be that he is insecure about HIS body and he‚Äôs lashing out at you.

6,"Hey! Another pwBPD here... while I fully support the comments and commenters above, I also want to provide a somewhat alternative perspective: DBT is not always as helpful for one as it can be for others. DBT is based in ultra-conservative, ultra-individualist & normative concepts that does not account for every experience - especially for marginalized people. If your partner is resistant to therapy, maybe try to find out more about what makes them so reluctant? 

Likewise, I would highly recommend that you look into some personal counselling: loving and living with a pwbpd can be super impactful and you deserve an ear just as much as they do. Considering your family unit, it sounds like couples counselling might be helpful too. Sometimes we all need a ref to bring us back to the rules of engagement and to remind us of the reason we remain ""in the game"".

14,"My partner* actually, and thank you :)

I had a longer response typed out based on my own experiences but I'm not sure they would compare to yours in their depth or frequency... I did however work in psych for a long time and my first tip, because it's easiest to rule out, is self care, which you've already got under wraps. You didn't mention sleep, however. A healthy amount of sleep, and a routine for it, is very important for mood regulation and thus even more so in your case. Beyond that, it may be that for whatever reason your body needs a bit extra at times and so taking the occasional nap may be helpful both in the case that this feeling is a manifestation of tiredness but also to simply ""reset."" Try power naps, no more than an hour, often I wake from those feeling energized.  The other strategy I would recommend, if your feeling is not so frequent but overwhelmingly deep, is to force yourself to do a big distraction - go to a theme park with friends, go skiing, etc, things that are so intense or involved that you're unable to stay in your head. This is obviously not a functional 24\7 answer but with the work you're doing professionally and personally you may be describing, through a BPD lens, what others experience and simply call burnout - it sucks for everyone but your first suspicion obviously goes to ""the same old suspects."" Look into solutions for burnout and even midlife crisis, you may very well be experiencing something totally normal albeit shitty.

Finally, due to your experience with and recovery from BPD you, your age, and where you're at in life, you may be experiencing the standard ""existential crisis."" The ""why are we here? What's the point of this?"" that many go through, myself included. The answers to these questions are deeply personal and individual... For me, the answer is children, family, helping others (like charity but I'm talking more being helpful to people that I know), and legacy, they I'll leave behind and where the world is headed. Every time I work on something within the scope of my end game values so to speak I feel good - when I'm doing nothing on that front I do not feel good (unless, you know, vacation). You may be coming against these questions, due to age, due to being single, due to accomplishing your goals and not knowing what's next... In any case, it's worth considering where you're at, where you're going, and what you're doing to get there - breathing feels good but treading water doesn't get ya much more than that, you know? There's a part of DBT having to do with ""a life worth living,"" I've heard about it but don't know what it's all about, but if you're in existential crisis it may be something worth looking into. Of course, even with your progress you should continue to see a therapist, even the most accomplished horseback riders i know still spend a couple hours a week with a coach :)",Major_Boot2778,147ao5i

Were these his exact words? If so, this is a giant red flag... my question is why be with someone who says things like this?

""I can‚Äôt do anything about it if he‚Äôs not attracted to me. I can‚Äôt stop him from looking at them, cheating on me or him jerking off to them.""

You're right. You cannot do anything about it. You can talk to him about it and tell him it makes you very uncomfortable and see where it goes from there. Though given the behavior, it's likely ya'll do not fit for a relationship together.

The other big reason is financial. That should say more than enough.

8,"Seeing them with their eyes isn‚Äôt the problem. It‚Äôs when he actively goes searching for women to look at.

If they just show up on his feed and he sees, he sees. If he clicks to see more that‚Äôs where I have an issue.

Porn is an addiction and an epidemic issue. It affects relationships and skews expectations. There has been research done on this. I understand if one does it when they‚Äôre single or if both parties consent or even watch it together.

But when you‚Äôre in a committed relationship it gets a bit more complicated IMO. Especially if it‚Äôs affecting your ability to hav Essex and be intimate with your partner.

Personally as long as it isn‚Äôt something as personal as only fans or perhaps going back to the same person as fap material I don‚Äôt care as much.

It‚Äôs even more acceptable to me if it‚Äôs animated cuz that‚Äôs different.

But my partner has told me porn has desensitized him and excessive masturbating has given him mild ED.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong to hold your partner to certain standards. Woman or man I don‚Äôt know that anyone would like their partner ogling other people and taking intimacy that should be shared between them and putting it elsewhere or giving it to someone else.

I genuinely believe that most people in bpdlovedones took advantage of and likely emotionally abused their pwbpd. now they are demonizing them for their reactions. think of people who say all their exes are crazy

the goal of that subreddit is to DEHUMANIZE us. They do not view us as human. One tactic they use to do this is distorting our lack of sense of self/ stable self image. Another post I saw was saying ‚Äúif you start to miss them/ feel bad for them, remember that the person you knew did not exist‚Äù. This kind of rhetoric is disgusting

5,"I think you are justified to be hurt by the rejection from that subreddit, for all the reasons you listed. And I think that subreddit is also justified to reject you. It very well may perpetuate stigma, however the purpose of that subreddit is not to repair what is broken in society, or to change the thoughts of those who are unfairly judgmental. Imo, the stigma is most perpetuated by the DSM‚Äôs failure to serve humans rather than insurance companies. 

There are stages to the recovery on both sides of this relational coin, and I have found that the separation of codependents is important for that recovery to begin for both. If someone needs a space where they are comforted by the thought that ‚Äúthe person who hurt me can‚Äôt be here‚Äù it provides the opportunity for free expression of pain without the fear of judgment and the addition of support. This is something we all need, and codependents early in recovery struggle to assert for themselves if challenged emotionally. But no one‚Äôs recovery looks the same. If it is not the place for someone to recover, they can find another place or use it as it‚Äôs helpful. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware that not every place is good for every person, and I see that place as a first step for many who are ill or as maladaptive as anyone else with a PD. We don‚Äôt see the people who leave or never join. With the B&W thinking apparent in that subreddit, my hope is that it‚Äôs a stone people take a step on through their grieving.

6,"I am recovered Cptsd and undiagnosed quiet BPD I suspect my ex partner is quiet BPD too. He got super mad and gave me the silent treatment for days because he wanted to meet up one evening and I couldn‚Äôt I explained that would be great but sorry I can‚Äôt as I had such a long shitty day at work and I just can‚Äôt meetup. Another time he got angry when I hadn‚Äôt replied to him message I was sleeping then next morning he bursted down at my place looking frantic demanded why I didn‚Äôt answer the night before, he clearly saw me sleeping in bed and my phone off he got angry and left. Later I texted him sorry I didn‚Äôt reply I was asleep and thank you for coming to check on me. Eventhough we made up after that incident he became distant, disconnected whenever we‚Äôd spend time together he‚Äôd be either on his phone scrolling or watching Netflix. He‚Äôd also frequently withhold intimacy and last time when I started making out with him he turned away saying his back hurts is super tired he said sorry he can‚Äôt. I just had to suck it up and not make a big deal but I felt something was off as our relationship was built on love and alot of displays of affection and strong intimacy.
from there it spiralled quick down hill. Every attempt to address issues and talk about my feelings were met with defensiveness, blame and silent treatment. 
He had broken up with me many times but quickly would come back apologise for his behaviour and say it stems from fear and self sabotage he would tell me how much he loves me and want to grow old with me, when he was in the love/ idealising faze he asked me to please never let go even if he threatened to break up and that I would just need to remind him of the pact we made to be together no matter what. 
Now I think he is in the splitting faze and I can‚Äôt get through to him.
I suspect (he has quiet BPD with core wound fear of abandonment) so after the last episode we had agreed that do couples therapy but the very next day when I wrapped my arms around him and kissed him tenderly he looked at me with ice cold eyes sat me and to my shock broke up with me. I tried to bring him back from this dark place he was in to remind him of our beautiful love story of our pact of doing therapy. But he wouldn‚Äôt snap out of it. I had an emotional break down and he hugged me so tight for hours I cried in his arms. I was shocked, confused and in so much pain for a whole week I couldn‚Äôt function and he‚Äôd text me everyday to ask about me and how I was doing. I love him and care alot about him but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. This is my first romantic relationship after long years of violent abusive marriage so I am learning how healthy relationships feel like look like. When he is in the loving self he treats me like a princess he is super considerate and affectionate with me. But when anything small happens he gets cold, distant and disconnects from me. He did mention he disassociates sometimes, self sabotage out of fear being not good enough and abandoned.

0," Oh OP I know this feeling well. When I‚Äôm angry I rarely lash out on others and instead take it out on myself, but the anger is more comfortable at least for me because it is an activating emotion. Sadness and emptiness are immobilizing, and thus it feels like there is nothing you can do about it. Personally I try to invest the sadness into creative outlets. I make music, for example. I think I would try to do something like that, or if you aren‚Äôt into art, try to think of things you usually like to do. If you don‚Äôt feel like doing any of them really, start with the thing that repels you the least. You might find from there that you have more energy to do other things. Or do you have a pet? Snuggling my cats always helps a little too. I try not to rely on other people since I don‚Äôt have many friends and I tend to overwhelm them. Whether that‚Äôs my fault or theirs, I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs just a sad, sad reality that people won‚Äôt be there for me how I need them to be.



But I think at the end of the day, you just have to radically accept the sadness or anger. That‚Äôs what I truly have trouble with. I want to blame somebody for how bad I feel‚Äîothers or myself.

Anytime I feel anger or have to end a relationship that I view is harming me I feel a lot of guilt and shame at first. I struggle with knowing when I'm allowed to be angry (I keep it on a very controlled leash) because of having BPD and some people immediately going, ""Oh she has anger issues and everything is an attack if you talk to her!"" when it's not and everyone else in my support circle sees that. Instead now my anger comes out when I feel like I've been greatly disrespected and it 100% comes out over my kids and husband when they are targeted. 

I haven't had to end a lot of relationships or friendships. Conviently enough the relationships I ended were due to be too toxic and recognizing that their behaviors influenced me too and caused me to develop bad habits that took me years to break in my late teens/early 20s.

1,"This is an amazing story to read! Congrats to you! 

For your fear of abandonment, what helped you the most to overcome it? I‚Äôve been involved in DBT since February of 2018. DBT has saved my life. Except I‚Äôm still struggling with the fear of abandonment. I stayed single and away from any sexual relationships for over 3 years because of it. However, I recently started a new romantic relationship and it‚Äôs already trying to sabotage things. I will say it‚Äôs gotten a lot better with the help of DBT. I made boundaries with myself to help overcome it
but it‚Äôs still there. I even sought out a new therapist to help me work through it (my old therapist left in December of 2021. I wasn‚Äôt planning on getting a new therapist but I knew I needed more help with it). The person I‚Äôm seeing does know about my fear of abandonment and so far is understanding.

That's what your story sounds like. BPD is one of the biggest misdiagnoses for young women with CPTSD, the other is Bipolar Disorder. Traumatic emotional dysregulation, especially when severe is not well understood by many, even a lot of therapists don't understand what severe traumatic responses of emotional dysregulation looks like and misdiagnose.

People with true cluster B personality disorders are not able to fully recover because they cannot let go of their false self- it is their chosen defense mechanism for life. There is a lack of core identity for life, and so the external validation seeking and exploiting of others never goes away or they cease to exist. It is their identity, they killed themselves internally as a child to survive. There is no recovery of that lost child in true cluster B PDs.",,t5y928

9,"**Important disclaimer:** I was extremely abusive and manipulative so it took pretty drastic measures. It might not work at all for you, please don‚Äôt if it‚Äôll be negative on your progress.

When self-sabotaging (mostly through ‚Äòtesting‚Äô or picking fights) I recognised it was wrong but couldn‚Äôt help it. Writing/journaling was the ONLY thing that worked for me. I removed myself from the situation, wrote and reflected (usually through tears and a breakdown):

1. Wise mind
2. How is this to do with trauma/self-identity. I can‚Äôt exist in normalcy, only chaotic, because I don‚Äôt know how else to defend myself/survive - self-compassion
3. Write down specific reasons why nothing he does will ever be ‚Äòenough‚Äô, it may give me momentarily satisfaction but not long-term goals and results.
4. Write every single thing I wanted to do to hurt him, and reversed the roles, the impact it would have on him and me - how quick would I be screaming abuse? I made him the bad guy because I had to to justify myself (like an abusive parent) - learn to take accountability for my actions.
5. Write down why I believe that giving him pain is going to soothe my pain, and the long-term impact on him - self-soothe.
6. Forgive myself, don‚Äôt spiral into self-shame, I don‚Äôt need to disappear and die, I hurt so much and never developed the coping skills. Break the cycle of abuse, he deserves better, I am stronger.
7. Be proud of myself, I‚Äôm taking steps, I‚Äôm taking steps, I‚Äôm taking steps. What can I do to build self-identity and feel less vulnerable to abandonment? - VITALS, work with psych
8. Make plans for after - ACCEPTS

I did this NEARLY EVERY SINGLE time, ‚Äòtraining‚Äô a different chain of thoughts in response to emotional triggers until it literally became natural to me - it was like slowly shedding all this hurt and pain and heaviness. To be clear, I still have the thoughts but they don‚Äôt overcome me and impact my actions (it used to be like a tsunami, but now are just small waves that wash by sometimes).

I really hope this helps, good luck on your journey and relationship, its so clear you‚Äôve come incredibly far just by reading your story

TL;DR: In my case, my fear of abandonment subsided from emotional accomplishments of stabilising relationships, self-compassion, and making plans for my future, something I wasn‚Äôt able to do when I was so overcome by emotional deregulation and need for chaos.",earlgreybiscuit69,t5y928

0,"I find that being in a relationship with someone who is not securely attached (emotionally healthy), triggers all of my anxiety to an extreme.

I was married to someone for 13 years who I always felt secure and stable with. He was honest and loyal and communicative and would do anything for me. My therapist said I didn't have BPD. I had already done a lot of work previously and throughout the marriage and so there were no symptoms really flaring up. Maybe every great once in a while I would split and it would be a fight but it was so rare. 

Then my next relationship was with someone who is an anxious avoidant. He would pull me in and then push me away. I was constantly anxious to the point of having panic attacks which I had not had in over a decade. Emotionally the relationship was destroying me and putting me at my BPD worst.

So if your person is secure and trustworthy and loyal and communicative, perhaps there is some work that you need to do. If they are not stable in their cadence of reaching out to you and things are hot and cold or you don't feel like you have comfort and where you stand. this may not be the best person for you. 

I know how hard it is, but we have to be vulnerable and communicate our needs. We have to give them the opportunity to meet those needs and be willing to suffer the rejection if they do not. If they can't meet our needs, we have to put ourselves first and walk away.",Reasonable_Serve8001,15njz4x

FWIW, I‚Äôve attempted tapering off meds a few times, under a doctor‚Äôs care.

With a lot more conscious effort, I was able to maintain my emotional regulation in everyday life and minorly stressful situations, and it was very good to know that. 

When bigger stressors came up, I could not. 

I ended up doing irreparable damage to my body, to my relationship, and to my property.

0,"Hey I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôm currently doing the same - going about fixing all of the things I was left with after being abandoned as a child. 

Dating a stable and patient and kind guy, also getting my doctorate, working like an animal and pulling myself out of debt, also letting my mask down, being this new version of me - quieter, more subdued, not as loud, not as people pleasing - and it is really weird and scary. All of it. And my friends are confused by it too - they makes jokes about my past and say things that I would have used to love, and now I‚Äôm uneasy with them. Now I‚Äôll defend myself, or I just won‚Äôt respond. I used to fall into this drama with people or get sucked into their melodramas and now I just stand aside and quietly protect myself.

This new stable life feels so foreign to me, it doesn‚Äôt feel like me. I can feel myself railing against it.

Last night I sat eating dinner with my bf and he talked about work, and I was bored. And I just felt myself getting mean, and losing interest, and I felt some part of me inside screaming to shake things up and make things comfortable and chaotic again. I feel like David after dentist - is this gonna be forever?? it all feels so weird and unfamiliar, like I‚Äôm wearing someone else‚Äôs skin. Will it ever feel normal? Will I ever be able to relax into this and feel happy?

And then like you I catch these glimpses - of the happiness in the stability. Of the new me, of this quiet person who knows herself and her worth. I also have stopped falling into fantasies, and I catch myself before they become my world. But what am I left with? 

It‚Äôs just this cold hard and boring world. It‚Äôs not magical like I had hoped. There is no swirling current of mystical hope or someone who is waiting to be there for me. It‚Äôs all me. I have to be there for me. Even though I have a partner, in the end, it‚Äôs just all me. Is this it? Is this the whole thing I‚Äôve been working for?

I don‚Äôt know. But what I hold onto are those little glimpses I get of freedom. Of freedom from worry and freedom from fear and guilt. The ability to say something I believe and trust it will go over well. The ability to take stock of a situation and know that I have read it correctly. The ability to be bored by my bf and know that later in the night we will still fall into fits of laughter together. I trust that this skin will feel like an old well-worm sweater soon. And these challenges will change into new ones - and my new self will be able to tackle bigger and better things.

I can‚Äôt wait to not have to worry like I used to. Not not have to be vigilant about my thoughts and fantasies and preoccupations, to not have to watch everything I say to make sure I am not overreacting. I can‚Äôt wait for those glimpses to become my norm. I can‚Äôt wait to spend my life following a trail of real joy and happiness,  stitching together moments of love and laughter and holding onto them and trusting them and believing them. You‚Äôre building a life - you‚Äôre making a mosaic. Trust that you‚Äôre doing the right thing. 

It sounds like you are using new skills that are really difficult to use and they feel uneasy. And the core fears within you are terrified of the repercussions. You ready for the punishment to come, you‚Äôre ready for the axe to fall. Keep going. You will get used to it. You will learn that you are safe to be this new self.

Imagine your life if you had been this person all along. That is where you‚Äôll be in ten years. Good luck!",Astrnougat,11m3l92

A weird little tip (might help in social situations): recently, whenever I feel intense negative emotions, I've tried controlling my facial expressions. (I believe there has been research into this too, not quite sure though). Instead of letting my eyes get teary, or expression 'look angry/sad', I simply try to keep it neutral. It took practice but I've found it somewhat lessens the intensity of what I'm feeling.

Taking a nap, a walk, or exercising between the start of those clearly spiraling thoughts, and acting on them. Or a full night's rest. The number of times that a very angry ""this won't help anyway"" walk followed by a night's sleep have stopped me from \*many\* bad choices.

Consciously thinking about the situation after, and figuring out what thoughts or feelings I ascribed to the situation, that caused the spiral to start (e.g., a partner rejected spending time with me, which brought back memories of parents acting a certain way, etc.) - this helps me set precedents in my head for ""sometimes I act in ways informed by trauma and not grounded in reality"", which has over time started popping up in my thoughts as the spiral starts; over time, I'm sometimes able to anchor myself in that, and examine the spiral a bit as it happens‚Äîand even stop it before it gets worse!

It sounds like you are actually making amazing progress. It's okay that your emotions overwhelmed you and good on you for telling your roommate the truth. Your roommate kinda sounds like an ass. ""You can control yourself around us"" um, sure, probably for the most part but not everyone is 100% in control 100% of the time. 

You're progressing really well. I think maybe talking to your doctor about medication might help with the outburst, and you need to give yourself a break. You're a Mom, with BPD, sometimes you're gonna flip. That's okay. Hell, neurotypical Moms flip. You're only crazy if you think they don't.

I think that in the moment, maybe your window of tolerance was small or factors made you willful, but it's just another learning experience where you can use a chain link analysis.

Even people who teach DBT fail to use skills all the time.

And sometimes we have to take a step back and look at our progress from a macro-perspective; maybe we had a setback that brought as back a few steps to where we were a week ago, but if we compare ourselves to how we were a year ago, you still see a ton of progress. Just keep believing in yourself and you‚Äôll succeed. I believe in you!!",,gnzyb2

5,"Yes I take medication for my depression and anxiety. I‚Äôve also started using CBD gummy‚Äôs. The CBD gummy‚Äôs have been helping when I take them. Part of what triggered yesterday is my cycle is due within the next few days. The other thing is I switched from smoking regular cigs to a e-cig 8 days ago. I am on birth control to control my cycle (my meds for my depression caused my periods to be irregular). I plan on going asking my doctor if I can continually take my birth control pills so my hormones won‚Äôt dip down to cause the hormone mood shifts.  

I need to clarify about my roommate. He‚Äôs my sons dad. I‚Äôm currently renting a room in his house. He isn‚Äôt an ass. He‚Äôs experienced my anger before I was diagnosed with BPD. He knows how far I‚Äôve come to control my anger and he knows that I nowadays i can control it better. He knows how far I‚Äôve come in my recovery.

0,"Oh man, I feel ya. 

You know I recently read something like, if a child doesn't want to spend time with their parents, it's a failure of the parents, not the child. Applies to adult children too. 

Unfortunately the parents don't often realize that. But what's important is that You do. 

It's more than okay to distance yourself or even cut contact from toxic family members. I've done both and it helps me immensely. You sound like you need at least some time and space away from yours too.",kindadeadly,zxfia5
1,"I really understand what you're going through, my family are the same with poor respect of boundaries. Im several years into therapy and from my perspective, you may have to accept that you can't change them and continue to cultivate your own safe spaces like your own home etc. Its great that you're living independently from them already, that distance will be very helpful for you. 

I think its worth acknowledging that you cannot heal in the environment that made you sick. It may be helpful to view time spent with family as an opportunity to test the skills you learn in therapy, and to try to remind yourself that you have your own space to retreat to now where you are in control again - this dynamic is no longer inescapable. 

I think its also worth acknowledging that you can let go of the significance of a relationship without cutting that person out. 
Does my family drive me crazy sometimes? Yes. Do i wish i could change them or get through to them? Yes. But i cannot change them, and it only hurts me to try and try, and so i have to accept them as they are and take measures to protect myself.

 I can still spend time with them and make plans with them because i love them and i know they love me, even if they arent always great at respecting me. I just have to be realistic and prepared. 

I know how painful family tension can be, im sorry you're dealing with it. Ultimately you DO deserve respect, so its really important that you find and cultivate as many spaces for yourself as possible where you ARE respected. It makes dealing with family easier to handle.

I hope something in my little ramble here is helpful to you, be safe :)",transliminalmechanic,zxfia5

Telling me secrets that I must not tell my siblings... But the anger and resentment fuels me to stay away from them, which is ultimately for the better for all of us.

She cut me off from all forms of intimacy while I was going through pretty intensive DBT and CPT. She insisted because I was sick with BPD I was the cause of our relationship ending. I used to accept more blame than I do now. 

I don't know. I think we grew apart. She wanted me to earn back holding her hand when I asked to be comforted while confronting a traumatic life of physical sexual and emotional abuse.

16,"The first long term relationship was with someone who was either a sociopath or had both BPD and NPD. I broke up with her because of the cheating, lying, and manipulation. 

The second long term relationship was with someone with BPD but a kind heart. I think that her BPD and my undiagnosed BPD clashed. We are still close friends (and have a child together). 

The third person I married. I think she loved me very much, but sadly, I was still undiagnosed. I had no idea what I was going through or how to verbalize it. She had no idea how to deal with the various symptoms. They pushed her away. Then she became cruel in response. 

The fourth person was the love of my life. For a time, it was the healthiest and most amazing relationship I could ask for. Then, I started to suffer mood swings, fears of abandonment, cold episodes, and anxiety attacks. I destroyed us. That experience got me diagnosed and put into treatment. Everyone who knows me says I am calmer now than I ever have been. Unfortunately, she was never able to see me the same way or believe in us again. She loved me enough to try and stay close friends. For a time, we were best friends. I think I was a good friend. She never really closed the door on us fully, though, and when she started seeing someone else our friendship stopped working for her. 

Because of treatment, I am able to no longer villainize my ex wife. For the same reason, I never villainized the love of my life at all. I just hope she is happy in this new chapter in her story.

To answer your question in that context, I have provided similar destructive input into all my past relationships, but the people in question put very different inputs into those same relationships.

0,"""Favourite Person"" is not and never has been a major part of BPD, only a part of BPD internet culture. It isn't a real thing, and is simply a 'shorthand' way of justifying and often romantisizing an incredibly unhealthy insecure-type of attachment disorder in an  interpersonal relationship. Justifying having a 'FP' is directly detrimental to your recovery and I would really recommend avoiding any communities that encourage the idea. If you are interested in understanding this better, then do some reading on attachment styles, or better yet ask your therapist about it if you have one. 

Of course having these extremely inseure-type relationships with people is very common in people with BPD, so good job avoiding it currently. It's something to be glad for. But now that you are not 'in it', it's the best time to understand why you might be prone to developing these styles of relationships, so that you can avoid slipping into this attachment style in the future, and can be better prepared if you do suffer from it.

I still grieve for the end of those friendships, and kinda started thinking that this was like an actual heartbeat after a breakup.. For a long time, I still yearned for that kind of person.

10,"Nice job trying to gatekeep and trying to invalidate my understanding of my diagnosis. 

To anyone else reading this:

You won't find 'FP' talked about in a serious way in any diagnostic manuals or treatment manuals for BPD. As people with BPD we are not 'special snowflakes' with a unique relationship only for us, and a 'FP' isn't a real thing for anyone BPD or not.

I understand exactly what people on the internet think a 'FP' is, as someone with BPD it's something I experienced A LOT before therapy and still find myself slipping into it sometimes if I'm not careful.  Any human is capable of having this specific dysfuncional attachment in a relationship. People with BPD just tend to want it when a healthy indvidual won't. You think neurotypical  people don't feel insecure about relationships sometimes? They do, they just deal with it (thus forming a healthy relationship) or they end the relationship, rather than keep their partner walking on eggshells. They choose not to stay in a relationship in which they feel 'like the world is ending' (or worse, such as literally suicidal) when something goes wrong. (Often for people with BPD even imagined situations can cause this response. I myself am no exception)

The sooner you realize this type of relationship isn't some special thing, and the sooner you recognise the signs of an unhealthy attachment, the sooner you can step back, act like an adult, and think ""what the f*"" am I doing here putting so much importance on someone other than myself, and finally start healing from BPD.",,qq0abc

Its like someone else has taken over, blindfolded you, and put you in the passenger seat. It really sucks especially when someone says hey remember when you did this shitty thing and you honestly didnt remember but you kinda do, like a dream or nostalgic memory. In my experience and research i think this is the fight or flight response. Our brain takes over as we step out, in this moment our brain is trying to protect us from getting hurt, from feeling how we have felt in the past, and to survive to see another day. It doesnt matter how big or small is the reason you split. Your experience is valid. To stop this I believe you just have to not split in general, be mindful, take seconds, minutes, hours, or even days to react rather than acting on impulse and intense emotion. Hope that provided a bit of insight.",Remarkable-Diet2319,u2zdh3

2,"I actually only realised I did this and why it happened after I went through a difficult break up and was looking through a bunch of videos trying to help understand myself better.

Dissociation causes memory loss and so even though from your partners experience, she's having an argument with you - you are not arguing with her at all. It's almost like speaking through a window at whoever has triggered us but nothing they say will reach us because there's a massive disconnect.

Best advice is to either try not to get to that point in the first place, because both you and your partner can't win against that projection of past emotion to seek validation or to attempt to step back and ground yourself to communicate in a healthy way whilst minimising the likelihood you'll be triggered and spiral. Focusing on statements lile ""I think xyz and that makes me feel xyz"" instead of ""I feel xyz"" gives you the ability to be rational still. It's a horrible thing to realise you do but knowing it means you can learn to be better with it. Even telling your partner too that sometimes she does need to walk away to protect herself as otherwise you're both arguing in two completely seperate realties and it will only escalate. Look up about diffusion techniques in relationships and share them with her too so she knows it's not about her, even though it feels personal. 

Hope this helps.",Nervous-Coat4043,u2zdh3

0,"not a mod but I don't think this is against the rules--you clearly want recovery, and that's not always easy to get. Hopefully you can order books online but I recommend starting with these 2 workbooks:

* The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook
* The Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook by Dr Daniel Fox

I haven't tried the second one but I love the author's youtube videos. He really gets BPD and is empathetic, unlike a lot of mental health professionals. and I like workbooks because you practice the skills, rather than just read about DBT and forget it in a day haha",,o7q285

I‚Äôve found it very useful so far as it‚Äôs all based in meditation and mental control. 

Very different route, I know. But might be worth a shot. I mean, what‚Äôs the worse that can happen from practicing meditation ? 

I also found guided inner child meditation to be crazy beneficial - did one, cried my eyes out and hugged my childhood self‚Ä¶. And now when I start to ‚Äúsplit‚Äù I can sort of hold my focus above my head and recognize that conflict tends to come from people acting from their ego/inner child and not their True Selves.

0,"I appreciate this post a lot. ""FP"" culture in online BPD discussion is, frankly, awful in trying to normalize and romanticize one of the worst aspects of our disorder. It's the entire reason I don't really feel comfortable on r/BPD, and I dislike how this inevitably bleeds into every decent sub. 

On specifics though, do you think that every FP is a trauma reenactment response? It's an interesting concept though I'm not sure I would always agree as I feel like it may be generalizing. I would prefer a more open classification of ""'insecure attachment style' relationship"". Still 100% an unhealthy relationship, and based on a failed attempt at establishing a healthy interpersonal relationship that should NOT be encouraged or normalized, let alone romanticized, but open to the idea that these attachments can form with anyone, not just a reflection of a primary caregiver and/or abuser. Less ""It happened because of this person being who they are"" and more ""It happened because I have a poor understanding of healthy relationships and in this case failed to establish a healthy one"".",,ylqrjv
1,"Really insightful post - I agree wholeheartedly. There is so much romanticism around the concept of FPs that I think people ignore that these attachments are unhealthy at their core because they are maladaptive attachments as a trauma response. 

That level and type of attachment to someone is always going to be a problem because it's essentially an addiction to the feeling that person gives you, and I find so often in FP relationships you aren't even seeing that person as they truly are, just through the lens of what they make you feel. 

I hate having an FP and couldn't think of anything worse for my recovery than trying to encourage an FP attachment.

Mental health in general becoming an accepted topic of conversation in contemporary society is a recent development. Overcoming the stigma of BPD is unfortunately up to us. We have to do our best to recover, to be with people who see us for us instead of the diagnosis. Eventually that circle of people will expand with more exposure to mental health education.

I wish it was different. It makes me angry that it was up to me to break the cycle of abuse, it was up to me to parent myself, and now it's also now up to me to recover from BPD and deal with its stigma.

A lot of things are inherently so unfair for us.

Choosing to stay in a relationship with a person who is actively using (and while you‚Äôre in recovery) is setting yourself up for a lot of pain.

Today is day one and you have a beautiful future ahead of you. You will create it one day at a time.

When going thru a breakup it‚Äôs always helped me to make some kind of fun plan for the near future - usually involving a short trip or visit somewhere, eating good food, buying flowers or a video game, a video chat plan with a friend living far away‚Ä¶ I tend to obsess/ruminate a lot, so to prevent myself getting stuck (or god forbid going back) I actively create other things to obsess over in the short term.",mieletmoi,psorm3

2,"Have you run this thought by your therapist/emotional healthcare team? They may objectively know the nuances of your situation better than most.

Beyond that, you sound like you're using your wise mind well in approaching this. 

I'm curious if he knows he knows about your situation. I know my pwBPD of 10 years will still have bad moments every once in a while, even tho 90% of the time is fine, and I know to give her room the other 10% to use her DBT techniques to self-soothe; usually for about 10-20 minutes at most. But to someone who doesn't understand BPD and helpful behaviors like mindfulness, dialectical behavior therapy, and other coping techniques, certain situations can lead to confusion and feelings of being 'tricked' by one partner and abandoned by the other.

Just know I wouldn't judge you regardless of what decision you make, but you need to be able to tend to your day to day emotional health (mindfulness and whatever coping/self-soothing is needed, as needed)) without feeling judged or feeling like you have to hide it.

I still be mindful when I go out, some things trigger me when I see but most don't know and some don't even care when I bring up the topic, actually recovery helped me a lot on understanding myself.

Don't be hard on yourself, take it slowly. Start with one person and then carry on, it'll be fine. Seek therapy and talk about it if it helps or read some books. You are enough as you are, do not feel bad that some aren't around you because you're in recovery. üñ§‚ú®",_ackerman_69,ronsj1

8,"I'm sorry this happened.

I do love her podcast and I recommend it to everyone and what she says on the podcast is helpful.

She is human. And we all make mistakes. *I am not excusing her.* I do not understand why she felt the need to tell your partner things you told her in confidence... betraying confidence is heartbreaking. Those are private things, kept closely to the heart. And it hurts my feelings for you. 

That being said... perhaps not utilizing her coaching services isn't bad advice. If betrayal of confidence is a deal breaker for you at this time. I would seriously heed this user's advice. 

I do believe that there are some things solved by communication, but don't believe in rushing communication before the person is ready to communicate. As a coach, therapist, or just a friend. Betraying that confidence is unethical... and shifting the blame and making excuses, saying, ""I'm a coach, not a therapist in this situation"" is a direct violation of her own teachings. Many of which I have heard, and it falls out of line with her integrity. 

Do I agree with her teachings? *Yes. Emphatically yes.* Do I think it an unhealthy expectation to be able to follow them *all the time?* *Yes.* Because we are humans. 

She was wrong to do what she did. Yes. But I also believe that throwing her away as a resource would also be a mistake. 

I empathize with you. I've been in a situation not unlike the one you are in now. To have a conversation you told someone in confidence be relayed to someone else without your express consent is a violation of trust. And I'm sorry.",SomewhereScared3888,11gpra1

I've noticed that lots of guys with BPD tend to not get in relationships or at least not often. With women they tend to get in a lot more. I think this is just the nature of the genders.

That being said, if you are truly self aware, you will understand just what you are capable of when you really get emotionally hurt. Pure hate is the only way to put it. I use that pure hate as a shield from the narcissism. While deep down I know, that if she is willing and does change (just wanting her to become self-aware) I can love her fully again.

But BPD gained control of my emotions about 15 or 16 years ago, and yep, I've got some stories about uncontrollable rage and unfathomable consequences, for that was my life, up until I became self-aware. The hate is a mask I wear, just like the many other masks we wear throughout our lives. The ""hate"" or all-black mask is used defend against the manipulation and control tactics they use.

9,"A lot of the problem with BPD and majority of the other personality disorders, is that the person who's suffers is really unaware at the severity of what they are up against. We all have our bad days, and to PwBPD our bad days usually come with the thought of life isn't worth it, and I'm better off dead.

0,"Hi! I am slowly on the path to start inner child work soon. I am not full blown into it yet, but am placing the first bricks slowly. 

Recently I was doing a guided meditation where they told us to meet our inner child in a difficult moment that happened for them. It didn't say how but it encouraged us to be there for our inner child in that moment. To let them guide us to how they would have wanted to be comforted (a hug, silent presence, reassuring words...). Whatever your inner child might have needed at that moment, but not received. 

So I did. I spent a good ten fifteen minutes with my inner child, letting her lead the moment. Accepting her feelings and letting her know they were normal. 

When the meditation ended, in my head, she was now resting her head on my shoulder, sitting facing me on my lap. Quietly. As if almost falling asleep. As I said the meditation ended and the audio said ""When you are ready, slowly open your eyes and come back to your surroundings"". 

I mentally told my child, ""Ok sweetie, time for me to go"". But I felt her quietly grip me, like ""No, please, not yet"". I said ok. It was a surprise to me but I accepted her needs. I started rocking myself, while hugging myself, softly, kindly, caringly. Eventually another 5 minutes later or so I was like ""Are you feeling better?"" And she was like ""yeah"", so we gradually let go, until I was ready to reopen my eyes and carry on with my day.

When that happened, I thought, OK, I need to dig deeper here. So I bought a book, haven't read it yet. I can come back and review once that it done.

I also selected a picture of me when I was a child, a positive one, and I keep it visible in my living room, I look at her when I can, I try to smile at her. 

Thanks for the book recommendation! I will definitely give it a try as well!",clamdeu,10ywrod
1,"Hi, I also have found inner child and reparenting really helpful in healing.  It's part of the process once I identify very reactive memories and name the feelings they give rise to.  Once I've done that, I start to ponder upon the things I'd like to go back and say if I could.  But reciting them to my inner child is the best thing for it.  

I've got to say, this is a technique taught by some MLMs, it's been parroted at me by others but lacked the weight for true healing because it was so contrived.  Plus, the ppl in my life parroting it were the ultra toxic ones..  Probably few ppl recall Mork & Mindy, the scenes where Mork was standing in a black room reporting to Ork, that is the kind of vibe and focus to elicit poignancy for me.",,10ywrod

4,"So glad you found the help you need and that you posted here in such a clear and helpful way so other people can consider this wise path.
I've been involved for decades with a 12-step program called ACA or a ACOA, a brilliant program modeled after AA that changes lives for the better... ""It works if you work it"" this program gives you instant and basically free access to decades of healing work that is very much based on reparenting yourself to overcome past traumas abuses neglect losses Etc sustained while a member of a family with either drug and alcohol abuse or any other form of addictive behavior that rendered parents unable to give really healthy good kind-wise direction consistently to you as you were developing. This results in adult shortcomings that are predictable and listed on a laundry list, of which there are two forms, a shorter one and a longer one, and they are both easy to Google. It turns out that the shortcomings and difficulties on these lists match pretty closely a lot of mental health diagnoses including bipolar borderline depression anxiety Etc. so maybe duh the answer is healing the trauma and not taking drugs and going endlessly to talk therapy that doesn't have these tools that are so wisely part of this program.
If anyone relates to any of this to yourself a favor and research this group and meetings near you both on Zoom and in person. I started going in 1989 and went on and off because of busyness and self-love issues but I'm back again and loving it and good things are happening.

I know I need to learn to self soothe but I don't know what I can do to make myself feel better. Sometimes I leave and cry in the bath for a few hours but I just can't make myself feel better.

I know I need to distract myself but I can't focus on anything but my emotions. Even after hours of isolating myself, I have to go back to my husband and make him have sex with me so I know he's attracted to me.

But unless I think he enjoys it, I don't feel better from it. And since I'm forcing him, I usually don't believe that he enjoyed it.

We have the firm rule that if either of us says ""I need to stop"" or ""I need a minute"" during a discussion or argument, we HARD STOP (even if one of us is in the middle of a sentence) and go to separate spaces to calm and ground ourselves. Once we're both feeling grounded we return to the conversation.

8,"Self soothing makes so much more sense once you get back to safety/the present moment. 

When you have an episode, you‚Äôre basically jolted into an alternate timeline where you‚Äôre in danger of death if you‚Äôre abandoned. You gotta get out of that false reality first. 

Look up grounding exercises and start practicing constantly. Use them the next time you split to get back to this reality, where your sweet husband adores you. 

If a tiger were chasing you, you wouldn‚Äôt stop to self-soothe. So the first step is to look behind you and force yourself to notice that no tiger is there. 

If you don‚Äôt have an internal monologue, forcing one or speaking out loud can be great. Speak like you‚Äôd speak to a terrified child. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôre okay, I‚Äôve got you.

If you allow them to be present and are able to co-exist with them, they will eventually move on. They may get stirred back up again, but you can wait them out. 

The most important thing is that you survive those intense emotions without doing anything you‚Äôll have to fix, later. Just get through them. You can figure out whether or not your bf has been distant later, when you‚Äôre not overwhelmed. Right now you need to self-soothe and ground and get back to reality. 

The reality is: you are an adult person who can meet their own needs. If your boyfriend is abandoning you, you will feel agony, and you will survive it. Your existence is not threatened by abandonment because you are an adult. As a child, your survival may have depended on the approval of the people closest to you.

1,"It‚Äôs normal for people to start calling a little less and hanging out with their friends more again after the initial honeymoon/begging phase of a relational ends and things become more steady. This could be a very good sign of him happy and comfortable in the relationship TBH. 
If you‚Äôre not really being abandonment, then it can be hurtful to be overly mistrusting and suspicious of them all the time. Check the facts. In my experience, if a man says he likes you and spends time with you, and calls to check on you, then he really is into you. Maybe, you can trust when he says, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fine. You‚Äôre okay‚Äù? 
While he‚Äôs busy working or with friends, just remember to take care of yourself, friends, family and hobbies. This honestly helps me when I‚Äôm feeling clingy (aka abandoned) and builds lasting confidence and fulfillment. And gives you something interesting to talk about when he finally does text you back.

1,"it‚Äôs okay to have an anxious attachment style so long as you‚Äôre also fulfilling your own needs and being your own person outside the relationship. 

Now as for your partner, I feel like I could kinda tell (i‚Äôm making an assumption, could be wrong) by the way you were typing you were trying to not make him look bad, which I get because you love him. You should feel okay to be sad around him, but he shouldn‚Äôt be the only thing making you happy. If you feel like he is playing on your emotions, take some time to evaluate how and why a little more, and make conclusions for yourself. And if he knows leaving you hanging like that is gonna upset you, he should be a little more attentive. A text takes 2 seconds. 

some things are vague in this post so I can‚Äôt like confirm for sure if your relationship is super toxic but you can! And recovery is possible. And alone time, although really difficult, is very beneficial. Warming your own soul. 

In a bpd book I read they talk about how we think ‚Äúothers act upon me, therefore I am‚Äù. And when people aren‚Äôt there to love us at all times, we can be inescapable voids. So when you are alone maybe ask him to try reassuring you more, sticking to what he says he‚Äôs gonna do, and also filling up your cup. Snuggle in bed, go for a walk, watch your show, make yourself happy, even if it‚Äôs hard. Hang out with your pet or cat. Knit/crochet, whatever makes you happy, but while you 2 are apart.

3,"I feel you. All but one of my romantic relationships, and many friendships, have ended with me lashing out when I couldn't stick up for myself properly over time and couldn't communicate what I needed because I didn't trust people to have my back in a face-to-face, and then eventually exploded on them. They lashed out back and ran away terrified; never got a second chance. Part of that's on them, both for not listening over time and for being the type of people to run when spooked once. But part of it's on me, especially the part that doesn't fit with the standard of how I want to hold myself. That's what gets me--the sense that I was supposed to be *perfect* and this *should* have been *avoidable*.

It hurts a LOT. So, so much. To the point that I want to throw it all away sometimes, when I'm between good groups or getting back in that 'I don't know what to do' place again with a new group and get scared.

But that's part of the disease still--""perfect"" ""should have"" ""my responsibility to predict their response."" 

Still, I use that term too on myself--monster.

But you know what? The behavior was 'monstrous', you can see that clearly now, so you can know it's not them being afraid of something innate to you. Which means you can do better. I find comfort in that, because humans exist to learn and grow. Does the Oak give up when it loses a limb? Does the forest give up when it loses an acre to fire? No; it keeps going. It grows a new branch, gives life to new plants. 

For me, I'm going back to school online. I'm getting a haircut (after ten years of the same one). I'm taking care of myself and cutting off the people who put me down. i'm reaching out to old relationships and being candid with new. When you feel like you've wasted everything, I find it helpful to pick one thing you've always wanted for yourself and then just...give yourself the excuse to do it. Building from one small thing can get the ball rolling back on that hope train. Part of that is depression talking, so you gotta give yourself a ball of yarn to play with when you feel that way.

I think you're right that acceptance is part of the situation. We must grieve our failures and losses, which is hard for us, because the entire condition exists as (unhelpful) coping mechanisms to prevent loss and sense of shame/self-hate. It's a cruel hamster wheel. But, that's exactly why accepting that horror as ""past you"" helps. You didn't mean to hurt people; but others have hurt as well. They probably were hurting you too, but maybe not proprotionally to your devaluation of or spite to them. But at least you weren't someone who did it on purpose, as people with no scruples exist, but you're not one of them.

That said, part of acceptance is forgiveness. Alcoholics and addicts have a step in their programs to ask forgiveness from the people they've hurt, to help alleiviate some of that heavy guilt and sense of wasted/ruined time. You might try it too, where possible. Some people might even understand and forgive you. You can always reach out to people you really did love (and who loved you back) and explain what was going on. They might have changed for the better since then too. They may have unresolved feelings too. You may not get them back romantically, but you can both get closure. And by doing that, you can see that things aren't always black and white, open and shut. Thinking that way is another trauma response. Give yourself the gift of some slack in that regard.

Your post is pretty vague, so I'm not sure how much this will help. But I hope it does. I'm struggling with this right now too; don't get me started thinking on the heat death of the universe, Jesus, everything will seem worthless then for days. Instead, just remember that you, little person, were not meant to hold up the world. Just take care of yourself and the people you love. Cry in apology. And then forgive yourself for letting down your little self, too. You might find out that your little self forgives you, and wants you to be happy. In which case, nothing is wasted. x",Zippy_G_1,d0jptp

I think about this a lot and its true. But the fact is, there really was no way around it for me. Both sides of my family are full of undiagnosed personality disorders. Every single one of my Grandparents had one. But:

This also means I didn't ""miss the best years of my life""... The best years of my life are still to come. Once I make some changes and accept who I am, then things should get better. But, my childhood and 20s were filled with so much abuse that it wasn't possible for them to be ""the best"".

0,"Hi.:) Thanks so much for this post. I share a similar sentiment. I'm in a space where I would say I've come to terms with my BPD, and I know how to deal with it and with certain triggers for the lost part. When it comes to trauma though, I agree with you in the sense that it does feel like something so deeply ingrained into one's psyche that it feels like only changing your entire identity could erase it. But I think, what I'm working on, is this notion that it needs to be erased. That this trauma is such a stain on my identity that it cannot be ""removed"" or even reframed. I guess that is partly because of the rigidity/black&white thinking that comes with BPD. So I am trying to work on seeing it for what it is. How they affected me, and how I can unlearn or relearn certain things, thus gradually overcoming it. So, I guess, focusing less on overcoming it, but on recognising and acknowledging it. 
Once I can name it, it doesn't seem so big and scary. It's less of a mountain and more of a boulder, and then eventually a pebble. You know?

I don't know if this made sense, felt like I was rambling lol. Sorry! X",kemkem97,m9rvh6

2,"I feel this for sure. Dealing with trauma is one of the hardest pieces of long-term BPD recovery IMO. 


I'm not sure we ever ""move on"" or forget our traumas. They were huge parts of our formative experiences and even once we learn to process them in healthy ways and heal from them, they've played a huge role in shaping our lives. That being said, I think we can definitely get to a place where the traumas don't hurt so much and we can make sense of things when we are triggered. For me, a big part of that has been addressing the trauma in therapy and then learning to slow down when triggered long enough to ask myself what I feel, why I might feel that way, and how to care for myself through that.


So, when I start to split, I always try to dig for the emotions and thoughts that are buried under the anger. Usually there will be shame, or fear, or sadness, some base emotion that's coming out of that trigger. Focusing on what's inside of me means I can work to tend to that instead of directing it at other people. That's been a long-term learning experience -- there are times when I take ages to even *know* what I feel -- but it gets easier with practice.",torgoboi,m9rvh6
3,"IMHO it depends on trauma type, severity, and the choices made.

with severe trauma, the onus is on surviving--- to the point that  *victim* becomes an identity.

when the focus turns to *survivor*, the identity of victimhood shifts to one not of constantly processing, but adapting and ultimately thriving.",justanotherdays,m9rvh6
4,"We're in a similar place, you and I.  The more prevalent symptoms these days are associated more with the c-ptsd.  Something will happen to instigate a trauma response, cortisol dump, and then  - hello darkness my old friend - bpd starts poppin' like kernels.  All of that physically wrecks my body so now at my age it's important to me to bury this agony and maintain recovery.  There's not a lot of options that line up poverty with availability of mental health services so when I was psuedotransient and unable to access the guidance of a professional I had to figure it out for myself.  It wasn't really enough but it was something.  I'm in a better place now, have been consistently, working with professionals & taking medication.  That, combined, with the stuff I'd done for myself in the past (reading, workbooks, etc) is helping to unhook the bpd monkey from my back.  Anxiety Monkey has deeper claws though.  That's what's amazing to me.  After *years* of climbing up BPD Maintenance Peak I get to the pinnacle and lo, the next obstacle clearly laid out before me- the Valley of Traumas.  Can't even see beyond it, it appears to go on endlessly.  Knowing I got to that point means I know I can also make it to that one and I already have a lot of the basics down for what's ahead.  I believe I can work through my trauma over time but I don't know/believe that realistically I'll ever be ""normal"" again.

I spent the better part of the afternoon before my session looking for a gift to buy Robin.

No matter the frequency and the duration of the waves, the light was always on. For the first time, it was nice purchasing a gift that did not represent one of persuasion, but one of gratitude. 

To say the last session felt bittersweet is a lie. There is pain, sadness, and a little bit of regret for getting better enough that my time with Robin has to end. I feel real emptiness. It scares me. It is not perceived emptiness or heightened sadness. It is real because throughout my journey with Robin I finally have an accurate emotional baseline for comparison. 

I am not sure if Robin will ever know that she is the most influential person in my life. I don‚Äôt know if she will ever comprehend the gratitude I have for her saving my life. Not from committing suicide, but saving my everyday life. I don‚Äôt know if she will ever know that some part of me will always want to pay her back for what she did for me.

0,">I‚Äôm worried they are not well enough to really understand how hurtful they‚Äôve been to me

This is a really thoughtful comment - they probably don't/can't empathise at this point how hurtful the situation is. Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, you can't help someone live comfortably with BPD when the sufferer isn't trying to improve themselves. The work that I did through therapy that helped me all relied upon better understanding inner needs and coping with impulses - that's something that's easier to do with a supportive partner but relies upon that drive to self-improve. 

Healthy BPD, to me in part, would be being aware of one's own impulses and limitations - i.e. understanding that a desire to run away from someone might be driven by emotional reasons, and engaging with it is refusing to engage with rational reasons. 

Or the opposite, a desire to cut someone off from their life without a word might be driven by rational mind (""This would be healthier for me not to be with this person"") but lacks emotional mind (""I would miss this person"")

Even if someone can't reach wise mind - What is the best choice that fits between rational and emotional wisdom - understanding that they're being torn between these desires is a healthy start, as well as the impact it's having on others and being able to address it in a healthy manner - ""I'm sorry that what I did hurt you, I'll try to address it in future"", not ""I'm sorry that I hurt you, I'm useless"". 

There are books and topics for being a partner to someone with BPD and engaging in ways that are more appropriate to someone who's dealing with it, such as how to address criticism in a non-combative manner (DEAR MAN is used by sufferers, but it's also great for getting needs across to anyone without being hurtful. [(link about this)](https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/using-d-e-a-r-m-a-n-to-get-what-you-want). 

This isn't my relationship, so I'm cautious about overstepping what help you want, but I'd discourage you gently from having the boundary being medication as well as therapy. BPD, in a lot of cases, is pretty medication-resistant. That said, I don't know your partner and in their case medication might be something they do require, in tandem with therapy, or by itself, for recovery.",Lifaux,d3cs6o
1,"Hi there. As someone with BPD myself, I'll echo Lifaux and say that BPD isn't really the type of mental health condition where ""you have to take your meds"" is a blanket helpful statement, and will probably come across the wrong way. In fact, I did much better with a partner when I didn't tell them I had BPD, because it forced me to be responsible for myself and not use its existence as a reason to cling to them. It forced me to ""behave normally and reasonably,"" basically, because I couldn't just use ""I'm sick and underdeveloped"" as an excuse to hurt them. I also did better without a therapist because...well, my state is dead last for mental health, therapists suck here, and actually make things worse. I just read books and was self-reflective instead.

Eventually, I learned to tell my partners and friends the underlying issues I discovered -- ""I have a fear of abandonment and get scared/lash out when \_\_\_."" Like, THAT'S being responsible with your issues, and is something the people around you can help you with.

Now, that said, someone threatening suicide if you leave them is absolutely NOT acceptable in ANY relationship. This person is too unstable to be in a relationship of any kind and is feeding off you like a hungry, binary neutron star swallowing its partner. Anyone who behaves like that is giving BPD a bad name, probably has other issues, and is definitely using/abusing you. I would suggest leaving and sending this girl back to...well, probably not her mother as the mother is probably a big cause of her problems. But you get the idea. 

Good for you for being willing to try to stick around, but as someone who's witnessed many a relationship like this around them, by the time they do that, you can't help them. You simply aren't the one who can. They are an exploding star. Get the F away from the meltdown range and know that you tried, but you just couldn't help. Let the erupting little fishie go back to the galactic pond and get yourself a partner who can appreciate you for you, not your ability to be a crutch. If you were really capable of a healthy relationship together, that ask would look more like:

""Hey. I'm really scared tonight. Can you sit with me till my anxiety goes away? Maybe help me talk through some things?

0,"I recognize this. I have sort of a ladder of mantras that I use to climb out of it. A lot of them are stolen from codependent‚Äôs anonymous, which is a program that has been very helpful for me. 

So here‚Äôs the ladder:

My job is to stay healthy and safe. By doing this, I keep the people around me safe. 

There is no price too high to pay for my safety. 
It is so important to me to stay safe that I have to immediately leave any situation that is unsafe for me. 

To do that, I have to notice when I‚Äôm feeling unsafe. 

Here‚Äôs the trickiest bit:
By the time I notice that I feel unsafe, I am already too dysregulated to analyze or reason through anything. I can‚Äôt do it in that particular moment. Once my body is sending me signals that I‚Äôm unsafe, it‚Äôs already too late for that. 

What I can do is build trust with myself by taking my body somewhere safe. For me that means behind a locked door where I‚Äôm unlikely to be disturbed. A car meets this purpose. 

In the beginning, it took a LONG time to get regulated and feel my way back to safety. I found myself leaving a lot of conversations/parties/events to go back home and get regulated. I made a lot of hard choices, and I never regretted one of them because I‚Äôm so proud of doing what I need to do to keep my loved ones safe.

Btw: Every time you push an emotion away, it comes back stronger. You‚Äôre going to have to feel all the emotions you‚Äôve been repressing ‚Äî you‚Äôre gonna need to find safe ways for you to release that emotion away from other people so no one gets hurt.",arithmetok,qtl9ck

There are many consequences I face and limitations I operate under for no other reason than the environment my brain developed in. 

I raged against it for a long time, denied it for even long than that, and punished myself incessantly for it for‚Ä¶ever. 

When I radically accepted it, like, ‚Äòokay, these are the tools I have to work with and their strengths/weaknesses, how am I gonna work within this framework.‚Äô Everything got so much simpler. 

I let my black and white brain go buckwild when it comes to safety. I‚Äôll accept all the consequence and limitations in the world if it means never hurting myself or others the way I have in the past. It‚Äôs just not worth the risk. 0% success rate. 

When that‚Äôs your rock solid foundation, it becomes so much easier to make new choices. To recognize the compulsions for what they are and to say ‚Äònope, that behavior is not aligned with my values so I won‚Äôt be doing that, what are my other options.‚Äô

To be honest, I don't want to let go of the guilt, it reminds me who I want to be and how I want to conduct myself. Again, my experience is different, in that you find it empowering, whereas I have felt humiliated and ashamed. Reading books and coming to terms with the fact that I was abusive and manipulative was so hard. I'd find myself trying to convince myself I didn't carry these actions out or I'd notice my thoughts were always attempting to justify my behaviour. It was exhausting having to analyse each thought during conflict. The result is that I am now an incredibly open and honest person and I explain my thought path, then I explain how that makes me feel, and then I actively listen to the opinions of the other party. I also think before I speak. I feel I need to stress that I still fuck up every now and again, I close off, I catch myself gaslighting someone and when I'm in that headspace I cannot drop that pride and admit fault, the angers rages in my stomach and I don't drop an argument when I should or in the way I should. I know I have come such a long way and I am proud to say I have done so alone, but fuck me, it sucks that after all this hard work, one occasional appearance of BPD during conflict can still cause complete chaos to our relationships.

I wish I had *THE* words, or even some words, to help you through this, but I don't think I do. 

One thing I do know is that you are worth good things. Without knowing you or your past or your inner self, I stand firm in saying that you deserve good things in life. Why? Because you do. If you want to be with your partner, don't reject them because you think they deserve better. Then again, if you're finding that they're not the partner you want then it's OK to let them go. It may be hard (either way), but you can get through it. 

BPD is hard. We feel deeply and a lot, and experience struggles that even others in the bpd community don't experience. The flip side of that shit coin (I believe), is that the good can feel pretty awesome too. So if we're dealt the hand we have, might as well try to work towards what makes you (feel) best?

0,"From what I've read, she's just trying to have a normal friendship, a close one for sure, to be able to laugh about the past and share those things. It doesn't give the vibe of just using you as a stepping stone, given you went 2 years no contact too.

All your feelings are valid tho, and if that triggers you, well, it does. And given you have a normal friendship now, I guess you should tell her that's a boundary for you.

You seem content to talk to her everyday and all, just not the jokes about relationships? And the fact that you could ""see"" her getting into other relationships and ""possibly"" ruining it? I mean you said yourself she's been in therapy and you're able to have a friendship due to that. Maybe she won't ruin anything just...have another relationship (and that doesn't mean she'll replace you as a friend either) That's why I wonder if you maybe still have romantic feelings for her and that's why it triggers you so much?",Aureolindaisy,123z3y4

2,"Yes I think I have some sort of feelings for her still. I don‚Äôt get into many relationships and I only do when someone is very significant to me.  She‚Äôs the only woman I ever wanted to spend my life with. And for the past 2 years I had to realize we were over and that wasn‚Äôt happening. Now, here she is.  

That‚Äôs not to say I have an agenda with her. I‚Äôm getting to know her again, and I just want authenticity. If that means she‚Äôs with someone else eventually, then so be it. I want whatever is authentic and real.  

But when we talk as much as we do, it‚Äôs difficult to not feel close. For instance, our day begins with her messaging me good morning. Then we talk all day, like sharing what we‚Äôre doing, laughing at things, and having a game going together on our phones.  I‚Äôd say we talk about 30 hours a week. So, given the way we vibe and connect, it‚Äôs not unusual that I‚Äôm beginning to become attached 

But the reality is we have a history and ya I guess I don‚Äôt want to sit here and learn about her New Romantic endeavors as much as I want to be a good friend, that‚Äôs hurtful.  And there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd be able to continue talking to her this much if (a) she got into a new relationship or (b) I got into one.   

So I feel like I need to stop talking to her because I don‚Äôt want to get hurt.  But at the same time I‚Äôm not expecting anything.  If that makes sense. Both things are true at the same time. 

I‚Äôve never felt the way for anyone as I did for her.  And the chance of seeing her again, someone I valued so much‚Ä¶ on one hand sounds like something I want to do. But I feel I‚Äôm just opening myself up for hurt because if our connection is still there, which it is so far, it will likely cause me to have feelings for her after I meet her.  Then it will be me having to mourn and let her go again, when I already did that 2 years ago

I never forgot her. I had to learn to get used to life without her and it wasn‚Äôt easy. Why would I put myself through that again?  But then part of me feels like running away is the wrong thing to do as well.

Maybe those memes are either just memes or a ""what do you think"".  


So my advise, would be basically sitting down and talking to her. If you can in person, because body language helps. Running away will only lead to ""what if"" in your brain, given that you talk so intensely about her. What if it could've worked this time, what if she felt the same and I didn't do anything even tho we're both better now. And if you're considering runaway, then you shouldn't be afraid of the ""possible"" negative outcome right? And about ""going through that again"" will happen now either if she ends up in another relationship or you leave now. You're already sharing those hours of your life.

But you‚Äôre right, if I shut down and run away it‚Äôs the same outcome.  I‚Äôve convinced myself it‚Äôs just a safer one.  But really, it‚Äôs the same.  And my therapist has told me I make up stories then run away from them and then spend my life down a rabbit hole of ‚Äúwhat if,‚Äù and she tells me I need to face reality and accept it.  Maybe this is an opportunity for me to practice these new tools. 

As for my ex, no she doesn‚Äôt ask about my relationship status, I think she knows just by the fact we‚Äôre talking this much.

For me, it can be really hard to admit that my self destructive tendencies, though it isn‚Äôt intentional, does have repercussions with those I love. I think accepting that and asking for advice is an amazing step and it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve had the courage to do. As someone battling with really intrusive self esteem issues, it can be hard to walk the line between getting caught up in the bad brain times while also trying to do what I might think is best for my partner when I am having it really rough. Something I like to keep in mind when this happens, as much as I can, is that intention isn‚Äôt everything. 
My parents and I used to have a hard time communicating because we are REAL bad at tone reading most times and we have short tempers. But one day I decided to break it all down in simple terms, ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù statements, and explained things very explicitly as my perspective, whether or not I‚Äôm interpreting their intentions correctly. It actually kinda broke down a really big barrier for us and I was able to communicate my needs while also hearing what theirs were. Maybe, if you wanted, you could try to sit down with your partner with some talking points and discuss things like things that validate you, things that invalidate you, comforting items/phrases/routines, and other relevant things for communication. I‚Äôm actually putting together a list for my whole family that we can use to talk about things, especially hard things. 
I can also relate to what, from my perspective, seems a bit like a split second kind of impulsive-ness because you so desperately don‚Äôt want to mess things up. Because holy shit me too. To me, it seems like the reasons he‚Äôs telling you this stuff is because he loves you and wants to continue having a relationship with you.

1,"Hi, I couldn't read your text message picture because I don't know how to configure my screen reader to read pictures, just actual text.  I got the impression tho that from your partn'ers perspective, you are in the habit of placing yourself into an inferior and submissive role, and elevating him as someone with all the authority and autonomy in the relationship.  If that seems to be the case, mapping out the experience could be helpful for you, it's unlike you just launch into a soliloquy of how you are undeserving out of the blue, there's usually a start, middle, and end to these that have predictable and consistent elements, it's kind of like a broken record effect, the pattern starts and you are conditioned to complete it.  Once you have the highlights laid out, take a closer look at how you're feeling and reacting at each step.

I've found it helpful to watch a youtube channel that discusses Cluster B relationships from the perspective of the neurotypical partner, maybe it will help you also.  Here's a linky:

https://www.youtube.com/c/LiseLeblanc/videos",,x2s4b6
2,">In an argument we had today, which started from a facetime call when I began to rant about some interpersonal troubles I was having with friends and then became embarrassed / felt like he didn't understand me and ended the call, 

I have a partner with BPD.  One skill I have had to learn is to ask whether they want help or someone to commiserate with and experience support.  Help likely means doing something a little differently or suggesting things and the possibility of you feeling invalidated.  Commiseration, and support, well you know what that feels like.  This skill is enabling for me I. The relationship because I don't end up in these arguments - because I don't engage in suggesting other paths for my partner.

It's also critical to remember that your partner's needs might include not seeing he cares about be hurt all the time by the same interpersonal difficulties.  That's probably why helping behaviors occur in the first place which cause you to feel invalidated.  If you set up this conversational trick with him it can help.  But take time to check in to see if you are relying on him supporting you too heavily when you're not looking to change behaviors.  It can be hard listening to ones partner in pain, especially if we feel it is preventable.

>He asked me whether I was trying to hurt him on purpose. I said no, I am trying to understand why someone so stable would stay with me(this is a continual issue I face, embedded in the fact that I don't see myself as healed yet and thus convince myself I'm undeserving of secure attachment).

So it sounds like you felt upset and invalidated by the conversation.  Outside of the conversational rules that you can ask to put in place with him, there is some work on yourself here.  If you want to understand why he's with you, it's ok to ask for understanding.  But you'd better respect that what your receive back is simply ENOUGH for him.  Write it down if you need to.  Whether you feel that you deserve it or not, it's why he is with you.  You DO NOT get to decide whether he should stay with you.  He does.  And it's best to stay out of his lane when he communicates that choice and those reasons.  That is a choice you can make every day of the week.  

In point of fact, you can ask him to hold you accountable to it and make up a catch phrase when you're trying to push him away so you can catch yourself ""in the act."". It's good to then say thank you and TAKE TIME to look at your emotions and how you got here as a result of the conversation.

Second, attachment styles are something you have (and can change with effort.  A secure attachment is a healthy attachment.  It's not about whether you deserve it.  It is an end goal to look forward to.

Lastly,. Give yourself time to take apart your emotions and your ""why's"" for acting as you do in a conversation.whst triggers this ""I don't deserve you,"" spiral and how can you learn to noticed those things so you catch yourself first.  Telling your partner he should leave you is unfair for BOTH of you, and ineffective in making you feel better, while also effective in making him feel worse and frustrated and pushing you away.

Healing is a process.  And sometimes the best you can do is cease the negative behaviors, watch your tendencies to go back to them and learn the triggers.  After some time of recognizing those, you at start to feel like you have clarity to this who ""do I deserve it,"" thought process.

It probably feels like he is pointing out your flaws and it hurts.  And because of this dysfunctional beliefs of yours, you start telling him what he should do, which is against what he wants.  As a person with BPD, I'm willing to bet you know exactly how bad this can feel.",advicethrows,x2s4b6
3,"It‚Äôs difficult, and while higher IQ is positive in terms of prognosis, it can also drive one a bit mad to watch the circus on repeat. Nothing you can really do about that other than be patient and accept that you are the way you are and your partner loves you DESPITE being able to see your many shortcomings (as we all, BPD or not, have as human beings). If you tell yourself you‚Äôre not good enough these arguments will multiply. This is your choice.

My heart sank to my stomach reading about your struggle with loneliness. I'm a very affectionate person. I've only ever lived by myself for a few months (parents, roomies, FPs). Even then it was pre-covid and I had fwbs. For me, loneliness is already a struggle with the restrictions necessary during covid. It's been a few months since my breakup too.

0,"I think that blocking him sends a message that you're very upset with him but it isn't a solution, I think it's important not to act on anger or fester in emotions but to be clear that you're disappointed in this behavior when it's clearly been addressed before. I don't think you're being too harsh, especially since you'd been clear that you didn't like that behavior before. It's a pretty important thing to be respectful about. I'd suggest unblocking him and seeing what he says, it's gonna feel better to get your feelings out there, just remember that your feelings are important.

* visiting my psychologist - 
I went to see my psychologist on a weekly basis for a couple of months. I found having the regularity really helped, and encouraged me to put my 'home work' into practice. 
My psychologist started me on DBT, which I found very helpful. It worked better than other therapies  (e.g. CBT didn't seem to work for me).

* apps!
I love apps on my phone - it encourages me to practice dbt and mindfulness on a more regular basis. I particularly like the DBT self help and diary card. Available at: http://www.dbt-app.com/
I also like the 'headspace' and 'smiling mind' apps for mindfulness practice. 

* yoga
I started practising yoga, and attended a studio which had a focus on yoga for mental health. We had lots of guided meditations, and breath work. This has been great.

4,"Ah.  So the pain of loss is the issue.  This is a pain that fades with time, but does hurt.  I'm hearing that it's too much for you right now after this last breakup.

I also notice it conflicts with the idea that you'll never be rid of the pain.  My intuition is telling me that the sentence should be ""it feels like I'll never be rid of the pain."". You've proven that you don't exist in pain as your default state, read your first paragraph.  You have been rid of the pain but it takes hard work.

I am not diminishing the hurt you feel.  I am certain I have very little understanding of just how big and crushing it must be.  But this type of pain is, by definition, temporary.  If you choose the suffering, however, that is much more permanent if you can never apply acceptance.

I hear your emotions saying the pain is too much right now, it's not time to accept.  That's hard to hear, but it's a bit different perspective.  What are your thoughts?  Hopefully I didn't mischaracterize or diminish your feelings.  I know it hurts an unimaginable amount.  <3 *hugs*",advicethrows,oybeu8

0,"Narcissists and the Scapegoat, they are trapped somewhere in their own childhood in a loop, that is why therapists can't get through to them, because they don't have an adult brain. 

Feel sorry for your parents that they are trapped in their own hell. 

Because of cognitive dissonance they will never accept or chose to accept reality, the terrible people they have been, the failures that they were to you as parents, because that would be too much to realise about themselves. Their false ego, false sense of self, will never allow them to see what the therapists are saying to them.

No contact or Low contact are the only options, and continue on with your life.

The best 'revenge' is to be happy and successful. These people are not here for you so don't try to create a relationship that was never there. It is sad, but it is the reality, they cannot change or admit they were wrong so they won't become supportive. 

From what you said, they are still trying to scapegoat you by picking fights, they haven't changed and won't.

Continue with therapy to mourn what you never had, what you realise to be the truth because it will take some time to process, how you had to parent yourself.

1,"I can completely relate almost exactly. It's really reassuring to know that other people are having this same struggle while trying to recover. My boyfriend and I had this same conversation about a month or so ago, and it was really eye opening to see that we started off really toxic. We discussed what needed to change in our relationship and how to fix the miscommunication. So far it has been going really well, and I don't feel my intensified symptoms as often. I think you and your partner need to have set times to give each other space daily. It will give you some alone time to work on yourself, same with your s/o, and also continue to enjoy the relationship. If you were to give up the relationship, it may affect your recovery because it's really not what you want. Becoming a more healthy relationship doesn't happen overnight, so breaking up would only add on to your guy's distress. If you both want your relationship to work, that is good enough to keep going, but also growing as individuals.

If you‚Äôre nervous about surgery, having someone there who‚Äôs going to give you even more anxiety certainly won‚Äôt make it easier. I think you made the right decision, though I know it‚Äôs hard to go through that alone. But you can! 

Go easy on yourself for trying to force the conversation. We‚Äôve ALL been there, even while doing DBT. It‚Äôs hard for people to understand how hard the anxiety is to handle.

I‚Äôm proud of you for looking at this situation skillfully, knowing what‚Äôs best for you & calmly asking for what you need. I don‚Äôt think I could have done that so early in DBT. The more you use your skills, the more your husband will recognize that you‚Äôre not lying & that you‚Äôre actually making progress. It‚Äôs going to take time & patience on both your side & your husband‚Äôs, but you‚Äôll get there! I‚Äôd suggest trying some self-soothing techniques to get you through this time.
