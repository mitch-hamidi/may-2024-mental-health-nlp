0,TMS therapy for BPD?," Hi!

I am 22m, diagnosed with BPD. I have tried so many things, been constantly diagnosed and rediagnosed. I've seen therapists, homeopathic therapists, psychologists, and completed an intensive outpatient therapy program. I have tried CBT, DBT, talk therapy, EMDR, and group therapy. I recently started with a new therapist with a mental health treatment system. My responses during our intake session tagged me as a potential candidate for TMS.

I haven't seen much about TMS for BPD and was hoping to hear from folks who have BPD and tried TMS. I have three therapists right now (two individual and a group facilitator), and have talked to the group facilitator and the new therapist, and they didn't have a lot of info for me. I'm going to talk to the other therapist, who I've been seeing for years, and hear his thoughts, as well as talk to the TMS therapist, but I would really like first-hand accounts if I can get them.",1703880646.0,False,2,10,worthlessinsum,None,18tw66e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18tw66e/tms_therapy_for_bpd/

12,THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don‚Äôt delete mods! I‚Äôm trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren‚Äôt lied to. 

Terence Watts‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrainWorking Recursive Therapy‚Äù or, ‚ÄúBWRT‚Äù is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a ‚Äúfull proof‚Äù solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it‚Äôs giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I‚Äôd finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true‚Ä¶ so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn‚Äôt want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don‚Äôt respond or you don‚Äôt see this post anymore‚Ä¶ well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct‚Ä¶ but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another ‚Äúexpert‚Äù who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

EDIT: another very interesting link‚Ä¶ [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the ‚ÄúUK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.‚Äù](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

‚ÄúThe Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.‚Äù

13,Has anyone ever taken the DES assessment while receiving therapy?,"Recently, I‚Äôve experienced a severe mental breakdown - to cut a long story short, the experience resulted in several hospitalisations and taking time off work for 2 and a half month to the present date.   

The aftermath of this was me receiving a care coordinator and psychologist, who have decided that given my recent experiences, they want to do an ‚Äòextended assessment‚Äô to clarify my diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with BPD for close to 3 years now and when initially diagnosed, I did not have to take the DES assessment.  

DES stands for Dissociative Experiences Scale, which is essentially a test of 28 questions relating to dissociative tendencies that you rate between 0-100% based on the regularity of your experience with the posed scenario.   

This is not anything I have ever been asked to do before, and I am unsure if this is a typical part of a BPD diagnosis. I have made peace with my diagnosis and being presented with the DES has sky rocketed my anxiety that it might not have been right all along.   

The last thing I want to do is send myself down the rabbit hole by googling to try and find any form of clarity on this, and I would be immensely grateful if anyone could shed any input on this or if they have any experience (personal or not) with the DES assessment.

Ive been thinking about it lately, and I decided to quit therapy after being with my individual therapist for like 6 years and then a year in a DBT group. I feel like I stopped improving. I just feel like my treatment plan needs a change. Its not that I feel the most mentally stable, in fact the first thing I thought about when I woke up yesterday was self harming. But I do know that I need a change, and that I dont feel like my mental health is progressing in a way that I can really see. My mental health is definitely better than it was last year, but Idk. I dont really know what else to say about it. I just feel like its not grounding me as it used to, and that Im not really finding group helpful. So im raw dogging my mental illness. No meds, no therapy, just me. BPD and PTSD. The next time I go to therapy, it will probably be doing EDMR. But guys. GUYS. I still need to take care of myself and treat my mental health in some ways.

33,Therapy session too long? Dissociation / zoning out during session,"Hi all, I've had my diagnosis years, and due to a couple of very scary crises over the past couple of years, I'm now under the local mental health team (UK) and am starting my referral to the PD team. I've started having monthly one-to-ones with a specialist PD person (therapsit? nurse? I'm not sure of their title but they are full-time personality disorder worker). 

My session earlier this week was maybe my third of fourth session with them, and it just seemed soooo loooonggg. We did a catch-up, talked about some extreme emotions that I've been through this week, and then did some worksheets and paperwork. Then we started on relationships, and discussing healthy vs unhealthy. 

The thing is, by the end of the session, I was totally zoned out, I have no idea what we were on about, I had totally checked out. This is common for me when personal interactions have gone on for too long, and I have no idea how I come across to the other person. I feel like there is a lot of me just nodding and mm-hm -ing. 

I know is is kinda normal-ish for me, and probably for people with PD in general. Should I discuss this with my therapist? Should I say I have no idea what happened in the last part of our session? I don't know how to handle this going forward, and how to get the most out of our sessions if I just start checking out during them. 

I would love to hear your approach to this, and ideas on what I could do. I know I'm incredibly fortunatle to be getting this treatment. I had my origional EUPD diagnosis in 2002, and this was reconfirmed last year as 'complex' BPD (same thing, their words, not mine) with a bit of ASPD.",1582879340.0,False,10,22,badgerhoneyy,None,fars15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fars15/therapy_session_too_long_dissociation_zoning_out/

37,From the other side of recovery: realizations after 10 years of therapy,"I no longer identify with my BPD and rapid-cycling bipolar diagnoses, mostly because I do not fear abandonment like I used to, and I have fewer extreme highs/lows. It took 10 years of weekly therapy (sometimes 3 sessions a week) and lots of meditation/DBT/studying Buddhism, but I think I'm finally there. I told my therapist two months ago that I was ready to stop seeing her and try to work through things all on my own. 

It's been going really well, and my family has been supportive of my decision. I think they can see how much I've changed, which makes me really proud of myself. I've been considering whether my decision to end therapy was just another BPD splitting thing or manic decision. After two months of being locked in the same house with my family (thx COVID), it's clear that I've actually made progress, so I made a list of things that I am grateful for because of therapy/recovery from BPD--on the other side of it.

1) Having BPD means that you've been through the lowest of mental lows. I can't count how many times I felt like I was physically dying because of a BPD-related fear/sadness. Once you get better at managing BPD, you'll realize that other people don't have past experiences like that to help balance catastrophic anxiety. We already know what ""the worst"" feels like, so it's not as scary. And we know it'll get better (life has its own mood swings), even though that's hard to remember. Ngl-- knowing how deep in the dark I've been makes me feel kinda badass for making it out.

2) Our emotional depth lets us experience life in the most immersive way. Humans have something like 30,000 emotions, but I swear the people I know have 10 max. The capacity to feel is what makes life worth living. When you can manage how you respond emotionally to things, this is probably our superpower imo.

3) Compassion. The drama, trauma, and general intensity that comes with BPD has put me through a lot. Like with any hardship, getting through it has made me aware of how life is tough on all of us. I crossed paths with SO many people who had no idea I was struggling with BPD, and I'm grateful that some of them showed me compassion when I had hurt them. Now, when someone is unkind to me, I recognize that it probably has nothing to do with me. Everyone is going through something, and we're all just doing our best.

4) DBT skills are just awesome in general for everyone. I've had psychologically-sound friends tell me they need advice (read: anxiously rant while I make a mental list of DBT skills that could help them). When I share the skills that have worked for me, I realize that DBT was a HUGE stepping stone that helped me become more emotionally healthy and self-aware than the average person without a mental health diagnosis.

5) This one is personal, because I don't know how many people with BPD experience symptoms from a young age. I was diagnosed at 15 years old, and I am now 21. (My parents sent me to therapy for anxiety when I was 11, so 10 years of that). I can't believe how far I've come in terms of emotional maturation, and I'm still so young. It just makes me excited for future personal growth:)

TLDR; If you're working on recovering from BPD, you're doing great! Recovery helped me develop mental strength, capacity for emotional connection, compassion, widely-applicable DBT skills, and a better future.",1586820768.0,False,56,10,pancakes904,None,g0uafg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/g0uafg/from_the_other_side_of_recovery_realizations/

And I am STRUGGLING with this ending. I don't feel like I'm ready at all for the end even though I have improved since starting, there is still a lot I need to work on. I knew this ending was coming from the time I started but it does not make things easier. Especially since in August I cut ties with my family and that felt like a massive lost and something I'm still getting over and now this ending just kinda makes me feel like ""People are leaving me"" kinda thing and nothing or no one is permanent. Which is just so dishearting. 

I do plan to see another therapist but it will probably be a little while since I'll need to get on a waiting list (NHS things) and go through the whole process of building a new relationship with a therapist etc. 

But yeah what are some things I can do to prepare or deal with this massive loss/change in my life?

44,About to embark on a 32 week DBT/Therapy program - spaces available in the group DBT sessions,"I am about to bite the bullet and begin a course of therapy and DBT training.  It‚Äôs going to send me into debt, but I‚Äôve been in debt before and never for anything this valuable.

After searching online, I have found a licensed professional counselor and psychologist who is trained and experienced in working with pwBPD and in facilitating DBT Skills training sessions.

This therapist has a solid track record and (like Linehan) does not suggest medication ‚Äì and very importantly to me, does not suggest facing or exploring traumas during this program.  This appeals to me.

I am in Asia, so I have been looking all over.  This counselor is based in the UK ‚Äì and recommends a 32 week program ‚Äì two sessions a week. One session each week will be group DBT Skills training, and the other will be 1 on 1 sessions exploring and applying the DBT training.

Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 2 (8 weeks) 	emotion regulation
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 3 (8 weeks)	interpersonal effectiveness
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 4 (8 weeks)	distress tolerance
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness

What is really tough for me is the cost ‚Äì the session cost is 95GBP per session.  However, they would pro-rata this rate for the group DBT sessions ‚Äì 95 divided by the number of participants.  That appeals to me because I learn very well in a group, and the pwBPD support group I take part in has been very valuable to me.

They are currently reaching out to colleagues to learn if there are others being treated who would like to be part of DBT Skills training and therapy.  So I want to share that opportunity here.

I recognize it is expensive.  I am fortunate enough that a close friend has seen how I suffered in the past 18 months and is lending me the money ‚Äì it will take me quite a while to pay it back but its so much more important than anything I ever went into debt for.   It is also a solid commitment ‚Äì they require we sign a contract  to commit to the program.

While it might not be for everyone here, I thought it might be worthwhile to present it to see who in this subreddit is interested.  I am eager to get started, to finally take a step I have never done and commit to 8 months of difficult weekly work.  It would certainly make it easier if the group sessions had 3-5 people, and not only me or me and one other.

IF you are interested, feel you can manage the cost (with a group session reduction as indicated), and want to know more; PM me.  I am happy to share the therapists profile and answer what I can, and connect you with them if you want to know more ‚Äì they offer a free consultation session to help you decide if its right for you.

Help. 

She has pursued recovery in the past for codependency from her parents, believed she might be NPD, and reached out for therapy for it, and perused therapy again for PTSD. 

I see how amazing she is. I want her to take the next step.

Overall its a whole new world for me. I had never experienced actually being calm in my head, without also feeling numb (used to be on ritalin, which had very negative side effects in my case). And it feels like i can finally profit from all the hard work id been doing in therapy.

I (23f) have been diagnosed for 3 years, and reflecting, recognize how and where my bpd has come up, where it‚Äôs been prevelant and caused issues in relationships.


Here‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm currently with a new(ish) (5 months) partner (23m), and it seems like it is a safe place. He knows about my bpd, he tries to understand, he sets boundaries, he asks questions, he knows im in therapy yaddayaddayadda.


Normally, I have pretty quiet bpd, I don‚Äôt lash out (I did when I was a teen), I bite my tongue when I split, I realize when im devaluing someone and don‚Äôt make rash decisions I know I‚Äôll regret. However it obviously still comes out sometimes. It looks like it not seeing the other side, taking accountability, seeing im wrong, stuff along that nature.


But, when I do come around and realize maybe I was wrong, I feel so much shame and saying ‚Äúim sorry here‚Äôs why I was wrong‚Äù feels‚Ä¶ vulnerable?? I don‚Äôt know what my issue is haha. I‚Äôm not sure how to describe the feeling of 


Nonetheless, I have been trying to slowly recover, I have started a new intensive therapy program, im trying. But I feel like im messing my bf up along the way.

I‚Äôve been meaning to look for another therapist but hate that I have to go through the whole process of meeting someone new and the whole thing makes me mad sometimes.

92,how to deal with rsd related to bpd?,"hi, i've been in self guided recovery since 2020. i got into a relationship last year and it has gone very well so far, but i'm starting to notice some of my symptoms are still here. therapy hasn't been an accessible option for me because of how expensive it is.

we are long distance. this isn't an issue. but she lives with her abusive parents and her sense of physical affection is messed up and she doesn't know how comfortable she will be with physical affection when we eventually meet up. it makes me really upset, i know i will follow her boundaries and she is very willing to cooperate with me and meet me half way because physical affection is so important to me. but i cant help but be upset. 

people in the past have rejected my affection towards them because they just hated me but kept me around anyway for years, them rejecting my affection was simply because they didnt like me. i internalized it and now my brain thinks thats the case with everyone.

i know realistically this isnt the case with her. i know she loves me, but i still have so many insecurities and doubts. most of the time, my bpd isnt an issue and i have no doubt she loves me. but when my bpd flares up, i feel like i live in a delusion and that she doesnt actually like me that much. its almost always caused by us talking about having to slowly build up her comfort with me.

i think the most insane part is that i know i'm going to have to have this process too. last time i was physically affectionate with someone i got so sick that i thought i was going to throw up. i know it's going to be a joint process but for some reason it just doesnt register??

is there any sort of coping mechanisms or self help therapies or even books i can read to help with this?? i feel like its the biggest issue in my relationship right now and it feels like it should be really easily solved.

96,Am I evil ?,"22 F. Diagnosed at 17. 

I act out. Irrationally. Violently when I‚Äôm super angry. I‚Äôve threatened people. Said such foul horrendous things to people. Used their insecurities and fears and personal history against them. Gaslight them. Said mean things to make them cry and feel small. 

It‚Äôs gotten way less since I stopped drinking; and mostly seems to be triggered by romantic interpersonal relationships. I was emotionally, verbally & physically abusive to my last two exes. 

I was angry at a guy I was recently involved with and was kinda holding it in acting like everything is okay. Then he came over and he tried to take my vape and I told him give it back and he didn‚Äôt and I tried to get it from him and I think he thought we were play fighting but I was  kinda irritated and when he wouldn‚Äôt let it go I bit him. So hard and it scared me how instinctive it was to hurt him. 


But recently I acted out and I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm just inherently bad, or evil. 
I showed up at someone‚Äôs house cause I was angry that they‚Äôd said something about me behind my back . I didn‚Äôt do anything physical but I sent horrible messages. But my friend who tried to stop me ended up getting into a fight with one of the girls there and I know that the altercation wouldn‚Äôt have happened if I didn‚Äôt act irrationally and go there.  And now my friend is in trouble with our institution. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm like this. Sometimes I‚Äôm just mean/attitude to people, and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the moment I know I‚Äôm giving an attitude and I don‚Äôt know why! Like I‚Äôll make small little comments that are mean. I hate that I‚Äôm like this. I wish I could be nice naturally and I didn‚Äôt have to try. I wish I wasn‚Äôt evil 

I‚Äôm in therapy but I‚Äôm scared. Cause even with my first ex I was in therapy and thought I‚Äôd change but I didn‚Äôt in my next relationship I was the same. 

& now recently having acted out in a friendship situation I‚Äôm scared.

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm just evil and gonna keep hurting people. What if I don‚Äôt really have BPD, or CPTSD and I‚Äôm just actually a shitty person 

The shame and guilt eats me and it makes me anxious thinking about the ways I‚Äôve probably made people feel. 
Then I just start feeling like maybe it‚Äôd all be better if I wasn‚Äôt here. 

Idk I don‚Äôt know what this is but I feel like I‚Äôm a shame to the BPD community.
Cause how can I know what this feels like and act that way towards others . 

And in the moment it‚Äôs like I know it‚Äôs wrong but I can‚Äôt help it and that makes me feel sick and depraved. 

I heard narcissistic personality and BPD are similar. What if I‚Äôm just a narcissist? 

My mum once told me that I was a manipulative spiteful and ungrateful child; and maybe that wasn‚Äôt traumatic. What if she was just actually saying the truth. 

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm gonna hurt everyone.

100,Holy wow DBT is amazing,"Wow dudes. It seriously is.

I‚Äôve been in CBT with some DBT features for like a year and a half and I made huge strides! But now I moved, and am starting DBT group and a one on one CBT therapist in my new city in two weeks.

I haven‚Äôt started the new therapies yet - but my friend who is a psychologist sent me a packet of DBT worksheets for my time off therapy and holy WOW - they are effective.

Personally, they take a long ass time for me to fill out, and I only feel like they work for me because a.) I already have experience with doing logs like this and with cognitive distortions and schemas through my time in CBT, and b.) I already have worked on emotional awareness a lot for several years with several therapists.

But like - this morning my partner said something innocuous of course which scared the shit out of me and immediately felt anxious and scared and angry and confused and I wanted to ask him all these questions and interrogate him and do all my impulsive behaviors‚Ä¶

But then I filled out ‚Äúcheck the facts‚Äù and wow. It just wild.

104,I've lost my hope,"I've been fighting this for two decades. I've been fighting hard - advocating for myself, going to therapy, doing the work, using the skills, doing everything that I should be.
I've had long stretches of time (years!) where I barely had any symptoms. When I had some stumbles, I'd return to the therapy, work harder, make more changes, and stand up stronger.

But the last 5 years has kicked me down over and over. I keep getting back to push onwards, but it's harder and harder. And now, this last kick... I don't know if I have it in me anymore. I have no hope in the future thanks to two chronic diseases, one of which stole my fertility and the other my career. I have friends, but they only want to love me from a distance.

What's there to hold on for, to hope for, when my future is filled with pain, disappointment, loneliness?  A decade ago a therapist had me write out the things I want to have/achieve in my life. Something to keep me going. Well... Not a single one is achievable at this point.

And don't tell me ""it gets better"". I'm 37 and it isn't likely  to be getting better for be. I'm thinking it's time I just cut my losses and give up. I'm just so tired of fighting.",1678944269.0,False,3,6,aerinne,None,11sl4ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/11sl4ez/ive_lost_my_hope/
105,"I feel like I‚Äôm being used, a fill-in, I need a reality check","So I‚Äôm on the cluster b spectrum as well and didn‚Äôt know. I got into a relationship with someone who had BPD, and neither of us knew. 

I was the one who got hurt when she split, she got hurt too but it was moreso her delusions which caused the splitting.  This was one of the ways we discovered something was wrong and lead to the diagnosis.  

Anyway, I can‚Äôt talk to ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù about this because their advice is to demonize cluster b people and they only say to ‚Äúrun!‚Äù  I don‚Äôt find it helpful, I‚Äôve been through years of therapy and I know what it‚Äôs like to see danger in everything and I empathize. I‚Äôm not an angel either and I‚Äôve been lucky to have people who offered me grace and redemption 

Long story short, when I began to understand our relationship was abusive, my ex and I went no contact and it‚Äôs been over 2 years. I spent the time single and in therapy and wished her the best 

We‚Äôve recently reconnected and it‚Äôs only been because she too has been in weekly therapy for at least a year now.  I immediately noticed we have new abilities regarding taking ownership of our emotions, and we‚Äôve been talking every day.  For the most part it feels healthy, there‚Äôs been nothing strange with the correspondence. In fact, I enjoy it. 

It‚Äôs platonic enough‚Ä¶ we do reminisce about memories and such, but we mainly just share our days with one another and discuss health and therapy. She told me she missed my friendship and wishes things ended differently.  

Thing is, I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs just using me to fill a void until she gets into another relationship.  She did tell me she was single and I mean, I‚Äôm not her bf, she can do as she pleases

‚Ä¶. But I don‚Äôt want to get used or be a fill-in for anyone.  

She sent me a meme today that said something like: 

‚Äúme: I‚Äôm not going to be in relationships for now, I need to work on myself

The moment someone attractive looks at me: I‚Äôm ready to get hurt again‚Äù

I‚Äôm not interested in making jokes like this given what happened between us, not interested in being some stable friend for her while I watch her ruin more relationships, and herself.

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm catastrophizing and spiraling over something that was just a joke meme and it triggered me?

I just want to be the healthiest I can be and sometimes I can‚Äôt tell if my fears are valid. 

I don‚Äôt want to be used.  I don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt.  But I also don‚Äôt wanna run away if there‚Äôs no real reason to and I know at least part of what I‚Äôm feeling is triggered anxiety. But that also doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs not a real concern underneath it all. My go-to reaction is to jump ship and run away. But I‚Äôve learned that isn‚Äôt healthy, so here I am trying to figure out what I feel and why, and then a healthy way to address those feelings. 

She wants to meet up in person and a part of me does‚Ä¶. Not with any expectations other than authenticity from both of us. I‚Äôm so happy that she put in the hard work to face her trauma, I‚Äôm happy for myself for doing the same.   But I think full recovery is a life long journey; one that I can understand.

111,How do you guys cope with moving out of the 'Honeymoon Phase' with a partner?,"I'll put a TDLR here just in case you don't want to read it all. My partner is my FP and we've been dating long enough now that we're 'settling down' and moving out of the honey moon phase and I'm struggling because my silly little black and white brain can't comprehend that the dynamic has changed. 

So my partner and I have been dating for going on four months now, and while I'm feeling proud that I've managed to maintain a relationship this far without sabotaging it, we've been transitioning out of the initial 'Honeymoon Phase'. This has led me to really struggle with the change in our dynamic. 

The thing I struggle with first and foremost is that we don't spend the same amount of time together as we used to. He spends more time with friends and tbh i don't have many friends. I have about four and two of them are a married couple with a child who we are both friends with and the other two I'm not *as* close with and don't see very often due to work and their own lives. TO MAKE THIS CLEAR: I do not wish to stop my partner from seeing his friends, I respect and understand his need for a fulfilling social life and I want him to be happy and maintain his connections outside of our relationship. As I mentioned before though, I don't have many friends. I live in a town in rural England and don't get much of a chance to branch out and even if I did I don't drive and have crippling social anxiety on top of the regular BPD crap that makes forming new relationships unreasonably difficult. This means he's the only person I spend regular time with and that time is a lot less now he's seeing friends more. 

Beyond this, I've also noticed things like we have sex less, due to time constraints and tiredness, we call less between weekends and he doesn't do the small gestures that make me feel warm and tingly anymore. I know this may seem small but I know that many of you will understand the need for validation I feel. I hate it but I feel massively insecure in relationships regardless and those small things meant the world. 

I'm seeking therapy through my work but I know that will take time and I was wondering if any of you had any advice to carry me through until I make real progress in therapy? Right now my black and white brain is SO convinced that it's because he has lost interest and no longer wants to see me even though he hasn't expressed this in the slightest. No matter how hard I try to logic my way into thinking clearly I have this horrible feeling in my gut that usually means that *I'm* about to unintentionally do something to end the relationship. It's happened so many times and I want this to be different. I really think this is my chance to make things work and learn how to be a healthy and functional partner. 

Again I know there are no quick fixes I'd just really appreciate some advice and skills i can try to use until I can properly dig into my therapy and start making progress. It's so frustrating knowing that there is part of me that can see and implement logical thought that's constantly overridden by BPD panic and fear of abandonment.",1668117450.0,False,18,20,Immediate-Visual4021,None,yrt0cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/yrt0cz/how_do_you_guys_cope_with_moving_out_of_the/

Recently over the last month things have changed. In June she found out that her ex husband had moved on and found a new girlfriend. She called me crying and wanting to hurt herself. I talked her out of it and went over cuddled her until she fell asleep and then I left. Since then she has started changing, she seems annoyed to be around me, if I ask what‚Äôs wrong she flips out, she‚Äôs kicked me out of her house twice for trying to hold her while she‚Äôs upset. She admitted to me about a month ago that she and her ex husband and her never stopped sleeping together, that they had only been living apart. I asked why she kept it a secret she said she didn‚Äôt want to lose me. She then admitted that two weeks after seeing the exs new girlfriend she started talking to a guy she met on a site. They in just a month they are talking all day, have been on 8 dates, FaceTime at least three times a week, and they are going on weekend away trips. She‚Äôs rescheduling her kids and other friends to make sure she can squeeze him in, all while complaining she has not time for anything. I told her therapy is something to look into. She got herself set up and started going. I went with her to her first session and after the therapist asked if I was aware that she showed traits of bpd. I asked what it was and the therapist explained. They set her up for an evaluation and the doctor said it bpd was indeed the case. The therapist set up therapy for us together because she doesn‚Äôt have much family. The first session was brutal she never liked me, she couldn‚Äôt stand me, I wasn‚Äôt her type, she finds me disgusting, I‚Äôm annoying, I‚Äôm a bother, I‚Äôm a crybaby, I‚Äôm not her thing, I force her to sleep with me(not true at all), I cause nothing but drama. She goes back in the timeline and say she felt a particular way at whatever point but I can tell you the things she says didn‚Äôt happen and I actually at that time got something completely different. She does this with her ex husband as well she says she felt certain ways but he says that there was no way, that they actually were really good at the points she says they weren‚Äôt. The therapist says she editing the timeline with intrusive thought to try and justify behaviors. She We had , had  sex two weeks prior to the session and she actually asked me for it  and about two weeks before that same thing. When I asked about the guy she‚Äôs going away with she gets angry, she gets dismissive and says I‚Äôm bothering her. She‚Äôs been talked out of quitting therapy twice because if the therapist brings up the guy she gets big mad. When we see eachother I get the complete opposite treatment as long as I don‚Äôt bring up the guy. Shes also when given examples of fp or devaluing says she doesn‚Äôt see it that everyone is just making it up to make her sound crazy, she‚Äôs living life as a normal person would. When you point out that she‚Äôs doing thing out of the norm you are the issue. I miss my friend take away the sex and this is my friend someone I care about a lot. She‚Äôs an amazing person but I don‚Äôt know how to help or support her.

114,BPD & ADHD,"Hi guys :)

I (27f) was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 9. My parents didn't really believe in therapy so they kinda forgot about it, never did anything with it, and haven't told me about this diagnosis until a few years back. I've been diagnosed with BPD for 10 years. I mentioned the ADHD thing to my psychiatrist but never really focused on those symptoms as I've always been more preoccupied with the BPD symptoms.

Now, I know that ADHD could be mistaken for BPD and the other way around, but I definitely have BPD, so let's not get into that.

**I wanna ask those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD if you're taking**¬†(or were in the past)¬†**any medication for it? How did it work with the medication prescribed for BPD**¬†(yes, I know BPD can't be treated with medication alone, but again - let's not go there)**? Did it make your life easier on the BPD side of things too? And in general, did it make your life easier?**

I'm tired of having to work/study twice as hard as people around me to achieve the same results. Among other things. But this is my main issue atm.

If that makes any difference, I take Effexor (venlafaxine) and trazodone.

Please be kind.",1712258208.0,False,9,6,WinterTangerine3336,None,1bvvzny,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bvvzny/bpd_adhd/
115,Why won't I change?,"I just *won't* do things. I have a therapist, she helps me understand things better. I know when I'm doing something that's not helpful. Right now I'm sitting here watching TV and playing on my phone instead of doing work or housework. Even if I was going to take the day off, I could do something nice or healthy. But I'm hiding and avoiding and sitting alone in the dark. I know I'm avoiding things, I understand I find things overwhelming and I'm avoiding feelings not tasks. I know I could do some mindfulness or grounding, or work through a DBT workbook, or read schema therapy things online, or remind myself I can do things even though it feels unpleasant now and will be happier afterwards etc etc. I could do yoga or go for a nice walk. But I just *won't* change. I know about tools, but I *won't* do them. This is now my 8th consecutive day not leaving the sofa. 

Is this not bpd, am I just lazy? I want ask ""why can't I change?"" But it's not that, I won't even try. But I hate this, I don't want this, I want to be different, I'm just not prepared to do it and I don't understand why.

Edit to add: thank you for your responses. I was feeling very sorry for myself, and really appreciated your compassion and helpful thoughts. Like *really* appreciated.

116,Should I continue with this therapist?,"
Hello, guys! I am attending scheme therapy, and for the most part we‚Äôve been doing a simple version of the Recognizing your emotions worksheet from the DBT workbook (what happened, when, how did it make you feel etc.). It happened a few times that the therapist interrupted me in the middle of my sentence/ chain of thought, and today I finally asked them if I could finish my sentence (bc unspoken words leave me with a weird feeling in my chest), and they said they interrupted me because I wanted to prove with a negative past experience why something is not possible, instead of focusing on the future outcome, when in fact I just wanted to mention another maladaptive pattern of mine, and it wasn‚Äôt obvious to me they already knew that, they could tell. 

When we explore a maladaptive scheme, I think I feel the need to justify it, to explain my reasons behind my actions, why I feel the way I do, and they called this arguing, because when they say it‚Äôs a maladaptive thought, they expect me to accept it right away, and move on. It kinda terrifies me that my brain is so rigid, and that I didn‚Äôt see a problem with my response, cause they are right, I am there because I need to change my approach to certain situations, and they no something that I don‚Äôt, but it feels impossible to me to just accept what they say without going into detailed explanations. And they stop me, because they know and understand how I feel, and it‚Äôs not important, we need to change the scheme,  I might be dumb, but it‚Äôs not obvious to me that the other person know what I feel, so I don‚Äôt try to argue, I just try to paint the whole picture of my interior world. How could I make my brain more flexible?

I think this therapy could work, because it‚Äôs so different from what I am used (overanalyzing every emotion and situation, and constantly trying to find the root of everything), and my way didn‚Äôt take me far, so I thought this ‚Äúaction taking‚Äù approach could actually help. But my therapist said we might not be compatible, if I question everything, and don‚Äôt trust their knowledge, and they like to move faster, we should have achieved something by now, instead of going over my same emotions.

Now I have this weird feeling inside me, like I hesitate to talk about stuff.

How could I make my brain cooperate? I heard great stuff about scheme therapy for people with bpd.",1681824274.0,False,3,1,captainhook1975,None,12qmzuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/12qmzuk/should_i_continue_with_this_therapist/

All i can think about is how I do manipulative things so often and I'm scared of it. I'm in therapy and working on it but I've questioned my whole life now.

It feels like I don't know who I am anymore and that I'm just a terrible, manipulative, and spiteful person. I've been staying away from romantic relationships since 2019 but definitely more so now.

This is such a difficult diagnosis to process and I'm learning so much about myself that I never understood before. That being said, existentially, i don't know anything about myself that isn't somehow manipulative.

I just don't want to feel alone in this, because I know no one who has the condition. 

One of my most favorite things about myself was my compassion, and now I feel that it isn't actually compassion, but a way to control people. Baseline me doesn't give two shits about anyone that isn't close to me.

123,How do you get know if you‚Äôre projecting or not? I asked chatGPT. The response made me realize that I might. What now?,"Here‚Äôs the response I got: 

Projecting involves attributing one's own thoughts, feelings, or traits onto another person. Here are some signs that may indicate you're projecting:

1. **Overly Critical of Others**: If you find yourself frequently criticizing or judging others for traits or behaviors that you dislike in yourself, it could be a sign of projection.

2. **Strong Emotional Reaction**: Feeling intense emotions, such as anger or resentment, towards someone else for reasons that seem disproportionate to their actions may indicate projection.

3. **Denial or Rationalization**: Ignoring or denying your own feelings or behaviors while focusing on those of others, or rationalizing your actions by attributing them to someone else's behavior, can be signs of projection.

4. **Repeated Patterns**: If you notice recurring patterns in your relationships or interactions where you consistently attribute certain traits or motives to others, it may be worth examining whether you're projecting.

5. **Lack of Self-Awareness**: Difficulty recognizing or acknowledging your own emotions, desires, or flaws, while readily identifying them in others, can indicate projection.

To address projection, it can be helpful to practice self-reflection, increase self-awareness, and explore the underlying reasons for projecting onto others. Therapy or counseling can also be beneficial in gaining insight into these patterns and learning healthier ways of relating to oneself and others.",1713518997.0,False,3,3,NightStar_69,None,1c7sm45,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1c7sm45/how_do_you_get_know_if_youre_projecting_or_not_i/

140,One of those world ending kind of nights,"Hi friends. Last night I went out drinking with friends and a friend who I‚Äôd had a recent falling out with came unexpectedly. This led me to drinking excessively and ultimately texting her that ‚ÄúI just wanted one fucking good night but you couldn‚Äôt give me that. I‚Äôll catch you in my suicide note if I don‚Äôt catch you later‚Äù

I was drunk and in pain - I‚Äôm not excusing it just contextualizing. She read the texts but didn‚Äôt respond or call me. Next thing I know 3 armed police officers are knocking on my door at 2am, my neighbors staring as I let them in. They were luckily nice and understanding and didn‚Äôt involuntarily institutionalize me. 

Now from what I can tell most if not all of my friend group knows. I texted each of them to ask for privacy but I don‚Äôt feel like I can ever look them in the eyes or stay in this city (luckily was planning on moving later in the year).

I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm asking for. I‚Äôve had something similar happen before and I know I‚Äôm resilient and in a better place (I know it‚Äôs still not the best place lol). But I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to any of my friends and although my mom and I are really close, I don‚Äôt want to burden and scare her more than I already have in the past. Any and all advice and thoughts would be greatly appreciated. This feels like a huge ‚Äúrelapse‚Äù for the immense progress I‚Äôve made and I can‚Äôt help but feel that these past 3 years just went down the drain in an instant.

141,Looking for resources,"I started seeing a psychiatrist, who specializes in TFP, 2 months ago. She diagnosed me with BPD. When I questioned the severity she said I‚Äôm ‚Äúon the healthy side‚Äù. She explained that now that the assessment portion is over, the sessions would now be twice a week ($80 a week with my insurance). That was going to be a lot financially, as I dropped to working part time this year to help care for my baby. My husband supported my therapy and we agreed I would proceed with therapy and take a financial hit for one year for my well-being. I started to get a bad feeling about the psychiatrist when she prescribed me a sleeping medication and my insurance charged me $100 for the medication management code that she billed bc the insurance company said two codes were billed so it appears that 2 separate visits were completed when the medication management was discussed during our visit. I emailed her and told her I can‚Äôt afford $80 a week plus $100 every time she mentions medication to me so I would have my PCP take over this sleeping medication bc I don‚Äôt get charged when he writes me prescriptions. The psychiatrist then proceeds to send in a new prescription for a higher dose, which I didn‚Äôt ask for, after I was clear that I didn‚Äôt want to discuss medications with her again. This resulted in another $100 charge. She then took a 2 week vacation and we picked back up last night for our first real treatment session. She started the session by saying she needs to charge my credit card for the second medication charge. I let this go because I‚Äôm working on not cutting ppl off after a bad feeling. Then she says she has two requirements for me: 1) I need to ‚Äústart a weight management program like weight watchers‚Äù. I gained a significant amount of weight during my pregnancy and can‚Äôt get it off. My PCP started me on Ozempic which has already helped me lose 40 lbs. I told the psychiatrist that I‚Äôm already taking steps to help with my weight (which was discussed in previously sessions) she replied ‚Äúya but you‚Äôre really not‚Äù and implied she didn‚Äôt trust my PCP of doing enough to manage my weight 2) since I couldn‚Äôt have her manage my meds due to insurance, she wanted me to have a regular psychiatrist manage my meds (vyvanse for ADHD and have been on for nearly 10 years and trazodone for sleeping which she put me on last month) bc she didn‚Äôt trust my PCP to manage them. 
All that was going through my head was this is more money I have to spend for things my PCP is doing for free. When I pushed back she said these two requirements were necessary for us to start therapy. She said it would be irresponsible of her to not have me do weight watchers and said it was the same as if I was an alcoholic and she required me to go to AA. 

She told me to cut my mom off and ‚Äúhave a hotel on speed dial‚Äù when I visit her but then later apologized and said she shouldn‚Äôt be giving me advice. She also made numerous little digs about my husband. Again, I brushed those comments aside bc I‚Äôm working on not being impulsive when it comes to cutting ppl off. But I‚Äôm really uncomfortable with her giving me an ultimatum and now  talking poorly of a third person on my life, my PCP. 

I emailed her and said I‚Äôm not comfortable with her two requirements and I understand this means we can‚Äôt move forward with therapy. I feel like the past two months of assessment and building trust with her was just a waste. I‚Äôm not ready to start with another therapist so I‚Äôm looking for other resources like books, videos, workbooks, etc that you feel helped you.

142,Advice Wanted - Space after arguments not matching up,"Hi! I (22f) have known about my bpd for several years and am in therapy regarding it, however I was wondering if anyone had advice on a specific issue.

When my partner and I get into an argument, they often need more time and space after it than I do. This often leads to me seeking reassurance and company too early, and we tend to start another fight.

I know that the answer is to be mindful and be aware of their need for space, but how do you handle the feeling of abandonment that tends to come with it? I find I feel abandoned because it means that I don't get to spend the limited time we both have with them (we live together but we both work full time and have other commitments) and then I worry that they won't come back.

146,Inner child work and reparenting might have saved me,"Hey guys, I‚Äôve been going to therapy for about a year and a half now and early in my therapist started talking about inner child work. It has honestly been a game changer. I know not everyone has the time, money, support or other means for therapy so I wanted to share a tactic that has really helped me take care of myself when I wanted to do the opposite, or it can just be food for thought. 
A lot of people with BPD are prone to self-harm and self-deprecating habits that stem from our childhood due to childhood experiences, as well as survival tactics and defense mechanisms to protect ourselves from more trauma. My therapist told me to imagine myself as though I was my own child. Would I think think of my own child as worthless, not worthy or food or care? How would I take care of my child if they were sad? Would I treat them the same way I treat myself? Would I treat them the way my parents treated me and my feelings? Would I validate them? Would I rationalize things for them? I know this can be hard, especially for the less nurturing type of person, but we also all want to love and be loved. It is only a small part of the bigger picture, but when it comes to self-love and taking care of myself, it has played a huge role in my process of recovery. You cannot stop other people from abandoning you. That‚Äôs a harsh truth. But you do not have to abandon yourself out of feeling worthless or acts of self-loathing. I want to hear your thoughts and how you see it, or what your experience has been with reparenting yourself or even the lack thereof. 

Also, book recommendation: The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D. It‚Äôs a popular book, but for good reason. Bessel encapsulates trauma in a way that is easy to follow yet so profound and has brought a lot of pieces together. There are sensitive subjects in the book that he gently discusses in order to explain the manifestations of trauma. TW for sexual assault, violence, abuse, etc.

148,Question from a nonpwbpd married to a pwbpd,"I hope it is okay to post here as a nonpwbpd. My thought was that people who are working hard towards recovery could provide some insight.

My husband with BPD and I have been together for 18 years, married 12. We have 2 amazing kids in 3rd and 5th grade.

I love my husband very much, but every year he seems to get more verbally/emotionally abusive. 

He's splitting almost daily, and he says the most hurtful, horrendous things possible. I try to ignore/block out the insults, but it still really hurts. Unfortunately, about 50% of his outbursts are in front of our children.

He is convinced that I am cheating on him everyday. I have been 100%  faithful throughout our relationship. 90% of our arguments are about my (imaginary) ""boyfriends"" that don't exist.

Is there a way to save this relationship? I just want a break from the false accusations and daily chaos. 

My husband has so many amazing traits, and he is great in many ways. But as his FP, I am the punching bag (figuratively).

Right now he is resisting therapy/professional help.",1667009888.0,False,16,33,So-Done9779,None,yg7dgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/yg7dgi/question_from_a_nonpwbpd_married_to_a_pwbpd/
149,Advice: Dealing with Physical Symptoms of Emotional distress,"Hello, as the title suggests I am looking for some advice on how to deal with the physical symptoms of emotional distress. 


Maybe 2 weeks ago the low had hit - crying all the time,  having to fight my body so I can get dressed and go to work, struggling with getting house work done, showering, brushing teeth etc. 


Now recently, I had to face great emotional distress and hurt, and on top of that it has triggered everything that happens within an episode physically - I can't eat, I sleep only few hours per day, cannot stop moving, find myself purposefully almost dehydrating myself (where I feel thirsty but just don't act on it for hours etc), feel sick to my stomach and have issues with having an upset stomach, etc. 


The issue is living alone, having a full time job and not really having much of a support system. I tried getting on w my DBT workbooks, everything I have learned in therapy over the years etc, but I also know that until I can address the physical part and start taking care of myself on a ""being made of flesh"" level, the emotional distress will linger. 


Unfortunately I cannot take time off work or work remotely, so i am loss at what to do that can really help to address at least the physical aspects so I can perform.

161,Question to those who are recovering from BPD - how long does it take to 'fix' identity issues?,"Hi everyone!

I am 28 (f) and I have been diagnosed with BPD \~2 years ago (I've been in therapy long before, but it was not helpful until I found good DBT therapist).

For 1 year I had a very intensive personal therapy and DBT trainings, finished it 1 year ago (the demand is high that's why my therapist let me go once she admitted I was stable enough), I am still doing exercises, reflecting a lot, and I feel like I am recovering.

Don't take me wrong - BPD is still part of my life, but life is *in order* now.  

Here's the trick - although I managed to gain distress tolerance skills, improved interpersonal communication, managing emotions etc - disturbed identity is something that I can't 'fix' yet.

I keep questioning where's me and where's the disorder, and it seems like the most difficult part of my recovery. This is one of the reasons why I am hesitant about getting into a new romantic relationship - I am scared that because I sometimes don't know what I want/need, this won't be healthy.

I'm starting to suspect that this is something that I cannot force and it will take years of life without BPD turmoil before I start feeling more 'solid'.

164,BPDlovedones‚Ä¶helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I‚Äôm talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It‚Äôs all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that‚Äôs for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don‚Äôt really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I‚Äôm sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I‚Äôm trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I‚Äôve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs real, what‚Äôs a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. I don‚Äôt want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that‚Äôs why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn‚Äôt have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don‚Äôt have a father. I don‚Äôt have siblings. I don‚Äôt have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought ‚Äúit will never get better‚Äù for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there‚Äôs still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don‚Äôt even know what ‚Äúthis‚Äù is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can‚Äôt just give people psychedelics and say go crazy‚Äîit needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,13,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/

Not sure why I am writing this. I am 21. And I am losing hope. My borderline patterns started at 12. And they keep getting worse and more complicated with time. Never been in proper therapy. I was not compliant. Never found a good therapist. Was just heavily medicated with antipsychotics. But my patterns? Worse and worse with time. Dad died at 18. No financial stability and abuse at home of all kinds. Writing this post outside of my family house where my brother broke my nose. 

Just following with a convenient psychiatrist for the time. But no real change. Just staying afloat. CBT doesn‚Äôt work.

I am lonely. I do not fit in. People mostly bullied me for being autistic. In teen years and adulthood, I was sometimes repulsive. I lost my elementary school friends. I traveled and didn‚Äôt contact them for a decade. I don‚Äôt make real friends . I just act like a clown and mask. Or trauma dump.

Was stuck in a toxic FP situation for 3 years. Took my emotions and energy and complicated things. Much older person (3 times my age) and was pretty much groomed at 18. Finally left him . I was clingy desperate for a toxic person.

But I am always emotionally promiscuous anyway. Any guy shows the slightest bit of attention, I run into his arms regardless of red flags.

Together for a little over a year. 

For context I have BPD and am in therapy and take meds. 

I (25F) hurt my boyfriend (26M) yesterday night with my overly emotional raging reaction to something small. We were at baggage claim after a long delayed flight and it was 3am. He showed me texts between him and his friend (who is a girl). He was laughing at the phone and I felt a pang of jealousy in my chest. Something I could normally suppress much more easily turned into chaos. The next five minutes were a blur. I pulled away from him and paced around the carousel like a fucking baby rejecting all his loving advances. I have no clue what happened to me, I was operating on a motor. It was confusing and scary. I finally settle a bit and he shuts down. Says I made him feel like shit. I immediately go into panic mode trying to win his affections back. I apologized profusely and said I was exhausted and that was bad and tried being sweet but he was just shut down. I feel awful. He doesn‚Äôt deserve this.. The last few days were tough too because I cried over little things and it exhausted him. Anyway it‚Äôs the next morning and he‚Äôs still being distant from me and I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs going to leave me. I‚Äôm in so much pain. I want to control myself because I know the best way to ease the situation is to not cry right now and have another insane abandonment reaction. But it‚Äôs so hard. 
I know he‚Äôs going to want some space from me for a couple days because of this. And he‚Äôs probably going to be happier away from me probably rn.  That‚Äôs causing me so much pain that i cannot show. Anyway, how do I deal with his distance? And if he in fact does not dump me today or tomorrow, how do I work on this?

168,My therapist questioned her own diagnosis,"Hi everyone!
I've been in therapy doing DBT for over 4 years. I first went to that therapist in 2018 and she pretty quickly (2 months/3 appointments) diagnosed me with BPD. To me it made a lot of sense and helped me understand myself better, and DBT has worked wonders throughout the years, with ups and downs of course. But still I have changed enormously so much so that my therapist told me a few months ago that she thought I didn't meet the criteria for diagnosis anymore.
I still struggle with BPD, and sometimes it gets frustrating that I'm not ""completely normal"" (i know, no one is) and can feel awfully intense things even though I'm managing to not let them impact my life negatively anymore. I was talking about this with my therapist at our last appointment and she reassured me that to her, I was still making progress. And then she said: ""you've improved so much since our first appointments that sometimes I question if I even got the right diagnosis"".
I've tried to not give it too much thought but!!! It's very hard not to have an existential crisis over this. I've already had an ex partner (ADHD+autism) who told me numerous times that they thought I wasn't BPD but rather autistic etc. The fact that even my therapist would come to question my diagnosis makes me really anxious and sad, like I could lose a part of myself. I know I shouldn't over-identify with BPD (even if the diagnosis is/was correct) but I would much rather think that I have BPD and therapy helped that think that I have another, yet undiscovered problem. I'm trying not to let my mind spiral about it (did I have PTSD? should I get tested for autism??) but I don't know what to do.

178,Dating app advice,"I recently came across a guy on a dating app whom I went on a couple dates with in 2015. (I'm very good with remembering faces!) At that time in my life, I was incredibly dysregulated and undiagnosed/untreated, and was using sex and substances as coping/connection.

Out of curiosity, I looked back at our texts. Apparently, we sexted A LOT and, also apparently, had sex once or twice. (I have very poor recall of this time.) We ended things after he stopped responding and I got prickly and confronted him. He apologized and told me I was ""amazing and beautiful,"" and that I deserve honesty. He said he gotten sick, and during that time he realized that he wants a relationship, which at the time I said I did not want. I got mad and texted something snide, and he did not respond. I totally get it. Again, dysregulation. 

Now in 2023, I am looking for a relationship. I'm medicated, in therapy, and actively working on getting my life together.  I remember liking him, and would be interested in seeing him again. 

Part of my BPD means that I get SO excited about someone, and then do Too Much.

179,Am I crazy or did I use my skills/boundaries properly?,"(Originally posted in r/BPD but since I'm in recovery for awhile with my BPD I thought posting here would be better)

Update as of 10/13:

//My husband and I ended up looking through other messages between social medias we used together to come to terms with their behavior and again, find more patterns because I'm still trying to fight against their gaslighting. What we found was years worth of posts switching between talking absolute ill of our friend group and idolizing me, dragging and making very long hateful posts anytime one of us ended up in a relationship, the amount of hate and jealousy filled posts related to me was so nauseating that I've been sick for the past 15 hours. There's a lot more but I don't think it's quite on topic for this thread.

I feel much more confident and happy with myself that I was able to control my emotions regarding this situation and know I really did make the right decision. Thank you everyone for the support as well üß°//

Long story short I had to end a friendship recently due to my boundaries not being respected and asking for mutual respect/support in specific areas of my life.

 I've brought them up for over a year until it got to a point where I needed to take time away to think about my future relationship with this person as their actions were not only harming me mentally but settling into my relationship with my husband and kids (my husband is aware of my diagnosis and is very patient with me. However, I did split more regularly during the times after interacting with this person which initially made us realize maybe I needed to reevaluate the friendship.) I've been going to therapy for my BPD for 6 years, know my subtypes, know my triggers, know when I need to step away and use wise mind. I have multiple workbooks that he and I do together in between the times I don't have therapy to keep up with my recovery as I very much want to work on myself and have for years.

Here is where I feel like I'm crazy: after bringing up that we needed time away from each other and go our separate lives and stating why, I am hearing from others that they're telling people that I abused them. That I sent hateful messages and that I was clearly devaluing them because they've been researching BPD for a little. I was very confused. Had my MIL, FIL and other family look at the messages. They said what I said wasn't hateful. I even showed my therapist and she said no and that I shouldn't be made to feel guilty for putting my kids first regardless of my diagnosis or not.

Am I crazy? Did my black and white thinking kick in? Or did I truly do the right thing and trusted myself? So many people use my diagnosis against me and many times I have to spend DAYS making decisions so I can make sure I'm not reacting out of pure emotion. However, this is my family and they ARE more important to me than anything else. I know after this I don't want them around me or my family ever again anyways, especially for what lies they're spreading. 

Being a mom with BPD is hard but I will always put them first. Their safety and security is most important to me. So why do I still feel bad for ending this friendship?

To update as of today as well with talking with my therapist; she mentioned that my friend is probably a covert narcissist and that it is common for them to shift blame, lie, and fake memory issues to avoid accountability. And since I have BPD that my friend probably dipped and played into that against me, especially since i was never originally diagnosed with it during the start of our friendship.",1697085744.0,False,5,3,WanderingFoxWitch,None,175yhrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/175yhrw/am_i_crazy_or_did_i_use_my_skillsboundaries/

I will be offering a 12-session support group for those who struggle with borderline personality disorder/emotionally unstable personality disorder this summer! This group is for you if you have trouble regulating your emotions, you struggle in your interpersonal relationships, you find yourself making impulsive and potentially destructive decisions (do they even feel like decisions??), you have an unstable sense of identity, and/or you find yourself frequently ruminating on the past or future. This group is also for you if you have a loved one who is struggling with these symptoms. While the group is centered around the struggles of those with BPD/EUPD, you do not need to identify with this condition to be welcome in the space.

Group will be held on Zoom from 7:00-8:30pm PST on Wednesdays, dates listed below. In group, I will share a new skill each week, and open up space for sharing and discussion. This group is NOT a substitute for therapy, rather a supplemental peer support space. I have been managing EUPD for over a decade, and I have lots of resources and compassion to share with those whose lives have been touched by this painful condition üì∑ Influences will be drawn from my own personal therapy, as well as teachings from my MACFT program. I will be drawing from evidence-based treatments for BPD, and this group will have a strong mindfulness component, with recommended weekly journaling/practice assignments. Please share with anyone who you think would benefit; I think it's going to be a beautiful space!

Energy exchange/financial support is negotiable on a sliding scale, with discounts given to those who sign up for the entire series, BIPOC, and trans folx. NOTAFLOF! Drop-ins are also welcome! If you would like to have your camera off and remain anonymous, that is also completely acceptable, and we will have group agreements regarding communication and confidentiality. Sessions will not be recorded.

Because I was very young they couldn‚Äôt actually diagnose me with BPD but my therapist went through the criteria with me and I met 9/9 to the extreme. 

Before finding out about BPD I felt like I was just crazy I knew there was something more than just anxiety and depression and when I finally found out what BPD was it legitimately saved my life. 

I finally had a word to describe what I was going through I knew it wasn‚Äôt just me I found communities that helped me and told me I‚Äôm not a horrible monster because of my BPD. 

I fought tooth and nail to get the diagnosis of ‚Äúemerging BPD‚Äù and now that I‚Äôm recovering and getting better I‚Äôm scared that if my symptoms do go into remission it‚Äôll be dismissed as ‚Äúteenage hormones‚Äù 

I‚Äôve been out of therapy since May 2023. I‚Äôm living a good life I have two amazing partners that I adore (I‚Äôm polyamorous) and I‚Äôm getting so much better. I still experience the same symptoms I did before but now I have the skills to manage them. 

I‚Äôm scared that if my symptoms go into remission and I no longer meet the criteria for BPD then that means that all the fighting and begging to figure out what was wrong was for nothing. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be dismissed as just a ‚Äúmoody teenager‚Äù in future years. But I‚Äôm not going to let that stop me from recovering. I know a diagnosis isn‚Äôt the be all and end all but my BPD diagnosis genuinely saved my life and I don‚Äôt want to let go of that ",1710335537.0,False,2,3,Tanno8490,None,1bdr418,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bdr418/im_doing_really_well_but_im_scared/
184,BPD Podcast,"Hey all!

This is my first reddit experience (bum bum baaaahhhh!)! I was diagnosed with BPD about two years ago, underwent DBT therapy for about a year and have been working very, very hard to work the skills-- to find that ""life worth living"" they're talking about. The transformation has been amazing to my day-to-day life, by no means is life perfect, or am I recovered. But holy shit, I can mostly functional again, and taking these little steps is giving me hope through the challenges for the first time in a long time. 

I'm a fortunate lady, not everybody is lucky enough to get diagnosed, much less, to wrack up their credit debt to get to go to therapy. I want to share my personal experiences because what I found in group-therapy was people didn't understand the skills in a real-life scenario. It all made sense in group but the practical application piece was missing. Our dear leader had examples that frankly were a little soft while we were all living the extreme version of it- which felt invalidating in itself. So I'd really like to share my stories, share the skills, and help others feel better-- if only it helps to hear they're not alone.

I've come up with a few episodes that are ready to record-- being based off what I've struggled with most and the skills that have most impacted my life. BUT I'd really like to hear what you all struggle with the most and hear your success stories of how skills have helped you! If you care to comment, I'd really like to hear where you're at.

185,I thought I recovered but now I feel ashamed.,"I (27F) have been dating my partner (29M) for almost a year now, this relationship is very meaningful to me because of the amount of trauma therapy I went through to be able to date again after a 4 year abusive relationship. I think I waited a good 3 years before dating again when I found my current partner at the beginning of the year. 

As someone who‚Äôs been diagnosed with BPD in the past it‚Äôs very hard to be in relationships, and I genuinely think I had come a long way in my recovery when it came to developing a more secure attachment style, communication,  and  self regulation. 

My partner and I have come a very long way from when we first started dating and I genuinely felt so proud of myself for coming this far in improvement and feeling secure, until today. 

My partner just left for a week long vacation with their family, and while I‚Äôve been happy they‚Äôve been able to do that, it‚Äôs been causing me some unease to the point I‚Äôve been crying. They‚Äôve gone on trips before where communication is limited and I was fine, so I‚Äôm not understanding why my separation anxiety all of a sudden has become so bad. It‚Äôs the first night and I‚Äôve cried so many times because I haven‚Äôt heard from them and I just feel like I‚Äôve taken a huge step back from recovery.",1698027448.0,False,11,5,BoysenberrySea3670,None,17e9seb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17e9seb/i_thought_i_recovered_but_now_i_feel_ashamed/

187,Struggling with some things in regard to DBT treatment.,"Hi guys. Thanks for your time. I'm living in the UK, and have had CBT and counselling. I found that neither of those were helpful. DBT is, but my only option to self administer. I've already noticed that distress is much easier to tolerate, I'm more mindful, etc. It's nice.

However - there are certain things I'm struggling with, and dont know what skills to apply to combat. These are two things.

The first of which is the awareness of futility, and fear of the future. I am painfully aware of the fact that tomorrow, my entire family could die, or I could face brutal abuse, and no amount of therapy skills could help me. Frankly, the world can be a horrible and cruel place, and it makes any amount of self improvement feel almost counterintuitive, and as though as the smart solution is to...Off yourself. I won't, I'm just aware of this thought pattern, and I think it impacts my commitment to the treatment.

The second is my struggle in identifying which of my interpersonal needs are valid, and which may be unfair. For example - my boyfriend and I had a fight last night because I felt as though he never listens to me (I was showing him YouTube videos, and he rolled over and groaned). Objectively very rude - but what degree of response is warranted? Or the time I got upset with him over something I completely made up in my head, and was quite unpleasant about? In the moment - how do you distinguish, find, and calmly communicate your own fair needs as a person from mental illness symptoms when they often feel identical?",1698636329.0,False,5,6,recovet,None,17jkbv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17jkbv2/struggling_with_some_things_in_regard_to_dbt/
188,"I need help to understand, please help.","Okay, so this is going to be a long one. And I will throw in a TL;DR for those of you who want the spark notes, the full details are below. 

TL;DR: I (23M) have BDP, my partner (24F) and I have had a very hard year. Tomorrow is our anniversary. My BPD diagnosis is very recent, and it makes a lot of sense as to why I am the way I am. I hate that I have the tendencies to lie and distrust in the relationship and keep myself so guarded and try to grab control so badly when I feel I have none. I need help to understand where I‚Äôm going wrong and suggestions if possible on what I can do to better myself and to recognize when I‚Äôm splitting to stop dropping the ball in this relationship. I love this woman to death and I hate the way I am but it feels like I can‚Äôt help it. 

Okay, for those of you who want more of the picture, here you go, buckle up, because this is going to be very lengthy. 

I (23M) met my girlfriend (24F) last year in October on bumble. I haven‚Äôt had any relationship that has lasted or ended on good terms with the exception of a couple years ago (2019-2020) I was set to be married to a woman, joined the military, but shortly after boot camp and all that, she told me I changed too much and called it off. (Pretty much the longest standing relationship I had that was positive for me that was not abusive or a trauma bond, but I‚Äôll spare your time and annoyance) I digress. We ended up chatting each other up, bonding and playing video games together and got into a relationship on New Year‚Äôs Day. Things for the first few months were stellar, but I kept secrets and lied to her about things in regards to myself because I hated who I really was ( I know it‚Äôs shitty and I hate myself for it). As time went on, I found that I only ever wanted to talk to her, be around her and do things with her because she helped me feel happier than I was. She noticed things were off and just not right. Caught me in my lies and called me out for it (rightfully so.) instead of owning up to any of them, I doubled down on them and I got defensive. I felt as though I was being attacked and threatened. The problem is this caused a lot bigger of fights and I felt like I did when I was a kid, and the way my dad yelled at me to get me to listen, I found myself doing the same to her and making her cry. I hated myself for it, but I just felt like I wasn‚Äôt getting heard at all. Like I was actively being ignored or blown off. Her attitudes about everything (justifiably) felt off, she seemed to be acting different toward me ( yes I know it was probably my anxiety and other issues picking up on things that weren‚Äôt there.) and she began talking to people I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with. And her response to the situation was ‚Äúwell, you need to deal with it. You need to trust me and it‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt.‚Äù The problem is I do trust her, but I don‚Äôt trust the people she started talking to. I know she is okay and not going to do anything but I can‚Äôt seem to put the feeling off that someone will dupe her or steal her away or do some shifty things that will devastate me. This has caused a lot of issues between us because I can‚Äôt shake the feeling and she‚Äôs getting upset because she feels suffocated by me. (This has since changed because her stance is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really care anymore. If you can‚Äôt figure it out then you need to find someone who will put up with you doing this because I can easily find someone who won‚Äôt.‚Äù) so i have pretty much decided to just keep it to myself. Which truthfully messes with my head but it gives her the piece of mind so i will take that loss and try to turn it into a win somehow. 

Over time, i began therapy and she began telling me, ‚Äúhey, I want you to answer yes or no to a couple things. Don‚Äôt explain, just yes or no.‚Äù And essentially asked me the questions that fall onto the MSI-BPD, and I answered 9/10 yes. She said to ask my therapist about her opinion on BPD, and when I did, she ended up telling me ‚Äúactually, that‚Äôs something I have been wanting to bring up, I was looking at the notes from our previous appointments, and i would say you have anxiety issues, depression, BPD, and PTSD.‚Äù And this led into a whole rabbit hole.  I‚Äôve kinda gotten to the point of noticing sometimes when I‚Äôm going to start having issues that are very abnormal and I chalk up to BPD and being over dramatic. Personally, I took the diagnosis really hard. Because growing up, I was a massive Star Wars nerd ( I still am) and always idolized Obi-Wan. I felt terrible watching Anakin go through what he did and the more I watched it growing up, the more I realized, I felt bad for Anakin (it‚Äôs assumed he has BPD, if you haven‚Äôt looked into it, please do, it‚Äôs actually very interesting to watch his journey through that lens.) I related to just wanting to be in control of my life and not have an obligation to what is supposed to be. I hated watching those around me that I love suffer and most of those times, I am the one to cause it. And getting the diagnosis to me, to me it meant I can never be like Obi-wan, always at peace with the lack of control. But it meant that I‚Äôll always be like Anakin. And it broke me. I hate that I‚Äôm like this and have absolutely 0 control and that I feel destined to lose and fail at everything I do. 

Please, please give me advice, anything helps. I need help so I don‚Äôt lose this woman, she means the world to me and I hate that I keep failing her this much.",1703987661.0,False,0,1,MHRB010123,None,18uw9p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18uw9p9/i_need_help_to_understand_please_help/
189,Should I be concerned?,"
I'd like to preface this post by stating that I have toxic behaviors in the relationship, such as invading space, being overly critical, heavy splitting, not listening to his side well, as well as my own yelling and general outbursts. I am in therapy partly to work on these behaviors.  
  
My bf does have some behaviors of his own that bother me, however I'm not sure if some of these are normal and I'm just splitting when I freak out about them. I've communicated about most of these and I've noticed some of it get better, however he's also told me he feels like I take everything as a personal attack and like I don't trust him. Sometimes when conflict has been very heated and I point out something that bothered me, he corrects it but explains he feels like he needs to keep a 'checklist"" of bad words/things to say. The behaviors that have been bothering me are:  
  
\-Swearing during conflict, but I've even corrected him when it isn't directed at me  
  
\-Yelling, he's also explained much of the time he does not mean to yell directly at me, but I have noticed it improve over time.  
  
\-Sometimes when we disagree he says what I said was ""stupid"", I've tried asking him to change it to say that what I'm saying doesn't make sense or something more neutral. I have noticed this get better as well, but he does get frustrated about it at times and doesn't always know how else to describe something  
  
\-Saying what I said was ""useless"", but this is often when I've repeated the same questions over and over or don't add anything to the conversation. He has gotten better about it but also does get frustrated about needing to stop.  
  
\-Saying that I'm being stupid/am stupid, however this has only been when I've highly bothered him and wouldn't give him space during the argument. He's only said this when I've split very hard and have had a giant episode where I won't let him calm down, so he likely does this because he doesn't feel like he has a choice. He does want to work on it, but I understand I provoke it and don't give him much of a chance to act differently.  
  
\-A few times he's hit things, such as the couch or his desk, but this is also often when I won't give him space when he's asked. He has thrown his phone once or twice when I was splitting very hard on him as well, but I've also done this to my phone much more. He's never thrown anything in my direction or near me, and I don't feel like he's trying to intimidate me.  
  
He does know these behaviors bother me, and when things are calm and we try to problem solve again after escalation he usually apologizes and wants to be better. However, sometimes he will say that I took some of it personally, such as swearing. Another thing that concerns me is that during arguments when I ask him not to call me stupid, he'll say ""I didn't call you stupid, I said you were being stupid."", I've read from some people that these things are forms of gaslighting, but I also know I provoke some of it after crossing his boundaries, and that BPD can often make us overreact so I am looking for input.  
  
Many of these things didn't start until I split on him more, however the yelling, swearing, and some moments of him saying I'm taking stuff personally did, as well as saying what I say in arguments at times is ""useless"".  
  
I've been bringing up couples therapy, now that our lives are less busy he said he'll try going. Going is very out of his comfort zone, as he's had trauma around therapists and doesn't think couples therapy is effective, but he said he'll try once a month then see if he's okay going more often. He's also told me if he can't figure out his behaviors on his own he'll try to see a therapist himself. For the couples therapist, he has said he doesn't want to do much of the work of looking for one, but it was my idea so I'm not sure if this is fair.  
  
We were trying to call each other out on these behaviors during conflict and then taking a break before re-engaging, but I've often failed at following through as I've explained. I am in no way trying to excuse my toxic actions. I'm just asking if his behavior seems like a valid reaction to my splitting and how I act, or if I should be concerned and he seems toxic as well.",1683955962.0,False,2,3,thelittlestone568,None,13g8f5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13g8f5z/should_i_be_concerned/

193,I'm terrified my partner is cheating,"I've been diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this but maybe someone has some insight or tips on how to handle this, my first instinct was always to ""cheat back"" once I've felt threatened.",1696423146.0,False,2,7,SilverGirl-,None,16zm5er,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16zm5er/im_terrified_my_partner_is_cheating/

195,"Not sure if it's just how I love, or if this is a bad relationship","I just need a place to talk.

I (22F) feel things so deeply, and although my partner (of >4 years) is very sweet and supportive when I have mood swings or meltdowns in front of him, I can never tell him (30M) about the private hell I go through when we are apart. I am in a much better place now than I was 3 years ago. But recently living sober from weed has forced me to be with my huge emotions again. It's very difficult to write this, knowing I will not numb myself with THC afterwards.

I get incredibly insecure when he doesn't respond to my texts. I am incredibly hurt when he leaves me hanging even for a little bit. For example, even when he told me he was too busy to hang out, I wrote long long texts at 3 AM pleading to spend an evening with him. And although I felt it was very sincere and genuine emotions I was portraying, I felt hideously embarrassed and deleted before he woke up. But now again, he is late on the video call he promised over the weekend. I have already cried multiple times today about this. In some ways, I wish I hadn't deleted the texts, so he could see how viciously I am feeling about this, maybe he would be more understanding of it all. But also it just isn't fair for me to beg and plead while he is asleep when I think I know how he will respond when he wakes up. 

The worst part of this is, the moments of heightened insecure attachment leave me feeling so rejected and so desperate, often in the hours or moments leading up to us hanging out. But when I see him, he is expecting to see a happy bubbly version of me, and I instinctively snap into a frantic idealization instead, and happily forget the hours or sometimes days of agony leading up to it.

It is made much worse by some notable trauma he inflicted on me earlier in our relationship. We have had positive and healing conversations about it, but I cannot help but be aware that I am in a trauma bond at this point. I don't think he 'leaves me hanging' any more than a normal relationship, I don't think he does it to hurt me. But there are other highly questionable dynamics in our relationship where I do feel he plays on my emotions to elicit a certain response from me. On the other hand, maybe this is just what love will always be like for me with Bpd. 

I'm already embarrassed to have typed this. I don't know if these huge feelings are because it's a part of my sober BPD brain, or if I am just very deep in a toxic relationship with someone I have feelings for.

The smallest things can cause an outburst, meltdown and my reaction is an insane rage, to the point where I physically have to hurt myself to let it out and I shout and look scary.

200,looking for hyper self aware bpd cuties,"Hi friends! (I copied this post of my Tumblr) I'm looking for some very self aware people with specifically BPD. I've been in therapy for 9 years and I'm working towards being ""normal"". But maybe that's not realistic. How do you know what you actually do need to work on (for example: making people feel guilty when they do something and that causes you to have big emotions even though they didn't do anything wrong) or what you don't actually can or have to change and that people should accept about you if they really care about you (for example: having mood swings, I can't do anything about the fact I have them so they should accept that, but they don't have to accept if I react poorly to them)

They are really bad people - racist, sexist, homophobic, gossipy, no boundaries etc. but he will not cut them off. They have accused me of some very bad things which are not true at all.

205,A reflection on my view of my favorite person,"
(I posted this as part of my journal so i explain some stuff that i‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall know about already. It was before i knew reddit and this subreddit. so I‚Äôll just paste it right away. And i need your opinion)



Female, 19. 

Hi. I think I‚Äôll just get into it right away. I‚Äôm never the first choice in anyone‚Äôs life. Maybe i got too detached in my last depression episode i pushed away everyone and created that barrier that i grew comfortable with. I feel like nobody truly knows me. 


I took a walk today with myself alone just to reflect and cried so much. I realized I‚Äôm really lonely and nothing i can do can fix that. I either have the choice to ignore that feeling and move along like i always did and hopefully find someone who can really connect with me (na√Øve isn‚Äôt it?) or just come to peace with the fact that i have to adapt to my loneliness. 


Through my life cycles i had that one close friend that i painfully realized I‚Äôm not as important to them as they are to me, so i get to know another and another and with this one of 8 years is what really broke me. I wish she knew how much she means to me. If she left i‚Äôll never recover. It‚Äôs strange but friendship breakups can give me the most severe depression episodes. I can go on and on about how i never leave the bed somedays. 


My parents knew there was something wrong with. Hell i knew that too. And as the therapy sessions went i was diagnosed with BPD (borderline personality disorder) and having an FP (favorite person) is actually one of the symptoms of it. Ironic, right? I didn‚Äôt tell my parents about it. I pretended i was fine. It‚Äôs not like i can cure it and mom noticed that i was fine so she took me out of therapy. It‚Äôs been more than 10 months since my last appointment. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want to get better. It‚Äôs truly not but i was really doing great i was fine i overcome thar episode and made so much friends in my sophomore year in college went to a lot of activities did so many things. 


Even if i was still doing therapy I wouldn‚Äôt have the time to it. That friend of 8 years we had our ups and downs and we became close again or at least i thought we were. I don‚Äôt she hold me to the same place i hold her to. Sometimes i feel like she doesn‚Äôt care about me at all. And i don‚Äôt want to lose her. I CANNOT. We talked fought and went through a lot of things but i still have that feeling that she‚Äôs gotten bored with me? She found new friends now and she‚Äôs hanging out with them basically spending the whole last week of summer with them and she didn‚Äôt even think about me. 


She didn‚Äôt invite me. She didn‚Äôt care. It feels like she didn‚Äôt want me to come and it really kills me that i didn‚Äôt even cross her mind. Because i know if i were her i would always chose her first. Think about her first. Invite her first. But she didn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm left again to be that last choice. 

I can‚Äôt tell her how much this hurt me because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll get called childish or my company will be a burden to her later. I know these feelings are not mature but I‚Äôm sick and tired of pretending like everything is okay. I can‚Äôt get back to therapy so consider this one my journals. Likewise romantically i‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù it‚Äôs all failed talking stages or weird situationships. I still am holding that barrier , no new friends are allowed, no new lovers are allowed, i‚Äôm just so afraid that I‚Äôll get too attached and get hurt when they leave. All my relationships are so hollow. 

I think I‚Äôm incapable of making any human connection. It‚Äôs all just shallow and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know how to open up again. Or how to not let my 8yo friendship consume me. Sometimes i think I can‚Äôt be fixed. And i know all these kept up emotions will eventually explode and i‚Äôll lose everyone and everything again. I really really really am afraid of loneliness. I don‚Äôt want to die alone. I think it‚Äôs beyond repair now, my ability to form any human connections. I just really wish that someone can understand how overwhelmed i am right now. Anyone. 


I really don‚Äôt know what to do. And I can‚Äôt get back to my therapist again as I‚Äôm still a student and can‚Äôt cover the expenses of it anymore. 
What should i do? Please give me any advice. 
Thanks for reading all the way to the end.

My biggest struggles with BPD have been the social aspects of it -- having a FP, splitting on someone, intense fear of abandonment, etc.

I just saw a post that a former FP (honestly don't know if they're really a ""former FP"" or not because I've been going back and forth from thinking their shit to thinking their Godly every other minute) where they called someone else their favorite person. I immediately felt like shit because I know no one would say this about me. I'm no one's favorite person and probably will never be. Right now I'm devaluing this ex-FP hard, but the fact that they used to be my FP doesn't help.

How do you guys handle this feeling without self destructing? I know on an intellectual level that this shouldn't upset me so much and that people do love me even if I'm no one's ""favorite person"", but I can't help but try to warp my logic to fit with my emotions.

208,hitting rock-bottom,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439573.0,False,1,7,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ad08qo/hitting_rockbottom/

216,Struggling with people believing my diagnosis,"Hey guys. I was told I had bpd at 17, officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist at 18. At the time I pretty much had 8/9 of the symptoms, but I was never overly impulsive. I‚Äôve been in and out of therapy since I was 13 for about a decade. If you like using the subtypes, most of my symptoms lined up with quiet or discouraged bpd (or even high functioning bpd). After a lot of work, I got to a place where I felt stable and my symptoms were manageable. I‚Äôm back in therapy now that the symptoms are becoming more intense and unmanageable and my new therapist said the very same sentence almost everyone* (everyone new, my old friends and family do not say this) in my life keeps telling me: you don‚Äôt seem like you have borderline. 

I am starting to become more and more frustrated that the better I am at controlling myself and my symptoms, the more people dismiss those symptoms. I spent years without dealing with suicidal thoughts and those came back this past year. My mood swings and paranoid thoughts are more intense than ever before. But no one seems to believe that I am struggling because‚Ä¶? I guess because I am not screaming at them? Or yelling hysterically? It took a lot of work to get to where I am, and now that I am experiencing a setback, it‚Äôs frustrating that people won‚Äôt acknowledge I am struggling until I reach a breaking point. Has anyone, especially those with discouraged bpd or if your symptoms are more inwards rather than outward, dealt with this? How do you explain to someone that just because you are using coping and dbt skills to manage symptoms it doesn‚Äôt mean that they aren‚Äôt there?

218,Some help here.,"

Can anybody help me. I am all alone. I am 31 yo Indian man.I feel stagnant in life. I have never been in a relationship and never will be. 
I have a family that has mental health issues. I got them from age 16. I know no one cares for this too but atleast some might gaze through.
I have no talent. I lived my life fighting what was diagnosed OCD and anxiety in the beginning and now after 15 years passing through psychotic diagnoses, has reached dependent traits hyper vigilant and now I conclude based on years long suffering and self redirections, and recent counseling that involved a psychometric test as a form of bpd known as quiet bpd. Now, before seeing my worthlessness right away for a relationship, I am not harmful like the other bpd types( even though they suffer much more and get no help from society), mine is not evident and hence took so long to find. 
Now, I have no purpose in life no self image, dependent, people pleasing( I hate myself for that, because world is so selfish when I look it through my bpd glasses.)I worked in different domains in a job I got and now I am a jack of all.
I hate myself.
I don't want this life. But I am not suicidal. I just want to walk away. Just avoid the trauma altogether. You know what on top of all this I took an snri a few years ago along with the high dose ssri(prescribed) without asking anyone or consulting, because I felt ( rn I am sure nobody will read it but there is a very small hope a little light, a fantasy rather. It's very painful to recollect it in a way that conveys my situation here).
So I took that snri because I felt so down and afraid of myself and my future as I stayed alone in the apartment and thought atleast I overcome that fear, because somehow I had to complete the integrated mtech that was the only way forward for me. I did all the work I could and somehow got out with some experience and the degree sponsored by the company.
In the end, here is the funny part, the snri complicated my condition. I have this frozen feeling with no emotions. I was in a constant fight or fright mode and it even affected my health. I started feeling zero hope in life. All I could do was sit on a bed and being I don't know just felt empty all the time. Actually I stopped feeling anything, let alone fear. No docs could help. Because I don't know how to relax. I am processing that stressed state in some other way
that I can't let go. I just start to panic when I feel stressed. I tried many relaxation techniques like emdr and eft and all that. I am now using CBD daily and it is helping my psychotic mind as well as slowly I am able to process the stuck energy.

So I honestly thought I was doing everyone a favor by starting drama, I thought I was getting what was hidden all out into the open, and helping everyone feel like they could be more honest.

It took me a long time to realize that I was wrong, It was making people feel uncomfortable around me and pushing people away. But it‚Äôs also so addictive in a way. Now I don‚Äôt crave drama or chaos at all, but it‚Äôs kind of like an addiction that when I get a taste it throws me off of it and I almost feel like I need to detox.",1663652442.0,False,34,11,CodeRound4851,None,xj0bs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/xj0bs1/have_you_been_accused_of_creating_chaos/
221,Family Doesnt Respect *MY* Boundaries,"I know this is somewhat long but im looking for insight so please bare wih me. I'm 24F and I have come a long way in my recovery. As I've moved into adulthood and have gotten more serious about my recovery, I have noticed the further away I am from my family the better. I dont have issues with others to this degree, if im upset we'll talk it out calmly and in a mature fashion or we share our boundaries and what we need in the moment. When it comes to my family, despite them watch my journey with mental health and all kinds of therapy, their own behavior and actions seem to never improve or change. For example, Im on vacation with my family in new york to visit my sister and her husband and my baby niece. I just wanted to enjoy my time away and have fun in their company. I got irritated because we were trying to figure out plans and nobody was answering my calls/texts (were in different rooms) at this point, im not even acting out or screaming or being rude in any sort. even when im in control im aware that there can sometimes be a tone of irritation in my voice. and so do they... despite that I clearly set a boundary as simple as ""stop"" as I've learned to from therapy only for them to continue. instead of disengaging, they scream at me loudly telling me to calm down or continue invalidating me saying in the moment. Again, i was only mildly irritated. there was nothing major happening for me to \*normally outside of them\* get to a placewhere my anger gets so intense i cry. Instead of respecting my boundries after repeatedly saying ""Stop"" and giving me time to regulate myself (after pushing me to a point where i actually raised my own voice to again say STOP"" its as if they'd rather push my buttons until i get to point to where my anger gets so intense i react. And then they blame \*ME\* and feed into eachothers energy of being nasty laugh at me and sayi ""I cant deal with this"" or ""this is why we dont go on family vacations when all i want is respect and when I try to vent to the opposite party they dont want to deal with it either and tell me to stop. At 24, I've so tired of this despite living on my own already, Im finally at a point to where im ready to be financially independent, leave (them behind or go to a new state or go to school away from them) and pursue my own contentment. I'm not perfect, but there is no respect or awareness held when it comes to me in my family. Has anybody else gone through this? I'll take whatever advice I can get. I know I struggle with a disorder but I can't convince myself its just me anymore. I cant handle the invalidation of them thinking and acting like "" shes just crazy so we dont have to respect her cause its her fault"" just because of my disorder. Thanks to everyone in advanced and have a happy new year!",1672248728.0,False,10,10,KirbyInTheClouds,None,zxfia5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/zxfia5/family_doesnt_respect_my_boundaries/
222,"For those who completed their first year of DBT, how often do you go now?","So I finished up my first year of DBT late last year - easily both the hardest thing I've ever done, and the best thing I've ever done for myself, I really didn't think I'd ever get to this point when I started. 

I've been trying to tack back to sessions every other week instead of weeklies like I'd been doing through the first year and the holidays, but I find I'm REALLY struggling with the increased gaps. I know I'm still adjusting and all that, but it's frustrating because I do feel like weekly is probably too often, but every other week doesn't feel quite often enough (and since I work a day job doing sessions every 10 days or something like that isn't a realistic option).

I guess I'm curious for those of you who ""graduated"" DBT, how often did you still go to therapy? My person is a fucking rock star and I know I always them by phone coaching if I need it, but I'd like to not need it, ya know?",1679776496.0,False,3,1,SomeWhiteDude312,None,121ya0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/121ya0y/for_those_who_completed_their_first_year_of_dbt/
223,Newly diagnosed,"I haven‚Äôt been in therapy for long but after my 3rd session my psychologist and I decided I should do an assessment and the results came out to be major depressive disorder and bpd. I was surprised by the bpd diagnosis because when reading things online everything seems very intense very often and while I do experience mood swings, fear of abandonment etc I just feel like when I‚Äôm fine, I‚Äôm fine? Is that normal? (Sorry if this doesn‚Äôt make sense I guess I‚Äôm just doubting the diagnosis a bit)",1646854136.0,False,1,4,kasespaced,None,tafhst,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/tafhst/newly_diagnosed/
224,Breaking up?,My partner and I have a pretty good relationship but I have been splitting on them more and more lately as my depression has gotten really bad. It's gotten to the point where I start almost end the relationship every time I split on them. I don't know how to actually know when its time to throw in the towel. Im trying so hard to not just give up on this relationship just because my disorder is telling me to. Most advice blogs and subreddits just tell you if you are thinking about breaking up with someone that it is time. How do I actually know when its time vs when im just spiraling splitting and black and white thinking? Are there skills or coping mechanisms to stop doing this? I am doing my best to make sure I just bite my tongue and give it a week before acting on major impulses which is extremely difficult and distressing. I'm worried one day I'm going to just break up with them even though I dont actually think I want to.
