0,"I had TMS! Just finished about two weeks ago. Here‚Äôs what I noticed. 

1. My physical symptoms all went away. My *physical* depression (fatigue, brain fog), anxiety (stomach aches, nausea) etc. all disappeared. It also helped greatly with binge eating. I don‚Äôt find myself craving unhealthy habits anymore, for the most part lol. 

2. I still get sad and anxious as any other human, but I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs appropriately placed. For example, instead o being anxious all the time, I‚Äôm anxious when a cop turns on their light behind me, as most people would. And then I‚Äôm able to calm down pretty quickly. I get sad when something sad happens, but I am quick to address it. 

3. I‚Äôm able to address and cope with my emotions much easier. I still deal with mood swings, but instead of being held down by my moods, I‚Äôm able to use my coping skills and self care to address them. I‚Äôm able to say ‚Äúokay, right now I‚Äôm feeling angry. What can I do in this moment to deal with this?‚Äù And then I follow through. That‚Äôs been the biggest improvement for me - being able to actually follow through on the emotional regulation.

4. I have more energy to do things. I picked up hiking as a hobby and it‚Äôs been going great. I usually quit things easily (ADHD) but with hiking I stick to it and I don‚Äôt get discouraged when it gets hard. 

The way I view TMS is not a cure for the symptoms, but it‚Äôs like taking the huge weight that‚Äôs crushing you off in order for you to be able to address what you need to address. The physical symptoms are gone, the trauma is still there, but I‚Äôm able to work through it because I‚Äôm much more clear headed. 

If you can get it covered I‚Äôd highly recommend it. In total, I had to spend about $600 out of pocket, but the total cost would‚Äôve been somewhere near $16k without insurance. 

I‚Äôd highly recommend also finding a clinic with a good technician. Some technicians just turn on the machine and leave you alone. My tech actually did some CBT and DBT skills while the machine was on, and I feel like it really helped to solidify those therapies in my head. She would have me journal or would talk with me about something stressful that happened and it was really helpful. 

It‚Äôs a time commitment, but I‚Äôm so glad I went through it.",,18tw66e
1,"hellooooo so I did tms from end of august until late october (I was bad abt going 5 days a week lol but it‚Äôs still okay). I am not completely sure if it‚Äôs tms that has made this change in me cause I started going back to my long term therapist I love for the first time since june around the time I ended but. 

since I finished my life as improved so much, I am able to look at things differently and deeper. I am soooooo much less dissociated and even more recently have been noticing things more in general that I never had before. I‚Äôm also at a stage where all my friends are positive supportive people in my life. in the beginning of this year I still had a lot of toxic friends. I have a lot of hard stuff going on currently that I think would‚Äôve destroyed me before. I also started on lithium in August so it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint if it‚Äôs tms exclusively. I think it‚Äôs a combination of everything but yeah i‚Äôm so happy I did it",,18tw66e

5,"Depends on the treatment! Mine was 6 weeks, 5 days a week, then three weeks of tapering where you do 1-2 treatments a week. For 9 weeks in total. Each treatment was about 20 minutes long, so it‚Äôs more so just having to go each week day. 

There‚Äôs another version where you go for one week, but you‚Äôre getting treatment all day everyday. Most people don‚Äôt do this one, but I‚Äôve heard it can be just as effective!",,18tw66e

0,"It's possible that since you canceled many times they might have decided not to schedule you anymore, but if that's the case I would think they'll tell you. Maybe they'll get back with you on Monday. You can always start with a new therapist if the current one terminates you though.",rescuelady111,110bg8l
1,"If you‚Äôre chronically canceling you‚Äôre costing your therapist money. Imagine you were a shift worker and your boss kept canceling your shifts? Time you‚Äôd set aside for work, now canceled without pay at the last moment. That‚Äôs not ok. You‚Äôre not building a relationship. 

My therapist told me that BPDs are notorious for bailing on sessions and ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù arrangements. I never had this problem with her, I think I‚Äôve missed all of 2 sessions in 3 years of seeing her twice a week because I was sick‚Ä¶ but it would definitely screw with my relationship security if I knew I was wasting her time and being unreliable. 

If you want help you must stop canceling and get serious about this. It‚Äôs a professional service and this is your life. BPD can ruin it and your therapist is trying to help. Stop being irresponsible. Tell your therapist that going forward you will pay for any and all missed sessions, and see how many you miss.",Ill_Spirit_233,110bg8l
2,"BPD is really hard to treat. Most therapists are scared of it. It has a reputation of being untreatable.  


In the DBT manual there are clinical guidelines about how to handle things like no call no shows, scheduling, ending therapy. Guidelines for staying professional through the stress and difficulty.  


As a therapist, also, they are supposed to expect their DBT clients to flake out ... it's the territory. If you want to give this therapist an out, ask who they'd refer you to.  


I hope this goes well for you.",,110bg8l
3,"Although I believe that you'll be able to get therapy regardless of this, I do agree with some of the commenters here that it is time you take it serious, and make it a point that you'll NEVER miss another appointment. Or at least try to. Make it a part of your identity that going to therapy, or constantly working on yourself, is the person you want to be.

There are plenty of distractions in our day-to-day lives and it is hence easy to get lost in them. But once you do, all the problems you experience whether it is with interpersonal relationships, jobs, intrusive thoughts, etc, will always resurface if you do not make improving yourself a priority as an individual. 

Try to implement a long-term vision for yourself rather than short-term. I know you've got this! Life is a lot more peaceful & enjoyable on the other side.ü§é",ditograss,110bg8l
4,thank you it's reassuring me,R1HMkk,110bg8l
5,"Most therapists have cancellation fees, and your therapist making generalizations about ‚ÄúBPDs‚Äù is incredibly problematic, if not just flat out ableist.",ncndsvlleTA,110bg8l
6,thank you,R1HMkk,110bg8l
7,"sorry for the late reply but one thing that stops me from compliance is I do it in secret of mom. and I live with her , she always worries where I am going. My therapist thinks it's best not to tell mom as I think she's not ready to admit I need help.",R1HMkk,110bg8l
8,"Lol?! Ableist? Please tell me you‚Äôre joking. A therapist who specializes in treating borderline personality disorder isn‚Äôt allowed to describe the challenges the disorder presents? May I also please point out that she helps people correct the disorder at a structural level. If you do the right therapy you won‚Äôt have BPD eventually. You‚Äôll have completed the psychological milestones to grow out of it. Therefore it‚Äôs not a birth defect. You can change it if you can tolerate the honest discussion. 

Ableist. Lol.",Ill_Spirit_233,110bg8l
9,"Yes, ableist. It is ableist to make generalizations about a certain illness, just like it‚Äôd be ableist to make generalizations about people with other disabilities, just like it‚Äôd be racist to make generalizations about a certain race, or sexist to make generalizations about men or women. Plenty of people aren‚Äôt born with certain disabilities, develop them, and then go into remission, that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt experience ableism in that time. Try not to lash out at facts. I also didn‚Äôt say that your therapist saying one bad thing made them an overall bad therapist.",ncndsvlleTA,110bg8l
10,"I‚Äôm surprised that explaining the challenges of a condition is not allowed. Sex and race aren‚Äôt disorders. You cannot compare being female and suffering with BPD. She was describing expressions of the illness itself (fear of intimacy). An expression with the therapist is missing sessions. If we cannot sit down and have that chat then we‚Äôre validating the illness and submitting to the disorder. 

You do whatever you like, and that‚Äôs your right, but for anyone else reading this ‚Äî if you want to get better, the best thing you can do for yourself is face the facts. 

It‚Äôs not generalising when it is quite LITERALLY the disorder. We all fear abandonment. We‚Äôre all afraid of intimacy. Giving us the heads up that we might engage in XYZ behaviour as an expression is assistance, not generalization. We pay these people to work for us and help us out of the lack of insight. Now it‚Äôs ableist to share insight. I get it‚Äôs hard to hear but then you‚Äôre in the wrong therapy.",Ill_Spirit_233,110bg8l
11,I‚Äôm not going to be petty and downvote you back.,Ill_Spirit_233,110bg8l
12," I didn‚Äôt compare having BPD to being female, they aren‚Äôt similar things. Mentally ill people and women however are both examples of people who experience discrimination or poor treatment due to things they can‚Äôt control. You can generalize a disorder, because it does not present the same in each person. No matter how badly your therapist wants it to, their experiences with people who have bpd, and your experiences with people who have bpd, are not definitive, they are anecdotal evidence and spouting them as if they are fact is harmful. Downvote me or don‚Äôt, my world will keep spinning just like yours.",ncndsvlleTA,110bg8l
13,"Sigh. I didn‚Äôt downvote you. Maybe someone else did. My therapist told me, a pwBPD who does not miss appointments, that this is something she often deals with, with her BPD patients. I don‚Äôt express my BPD that way. I didn‚Äôt feel offended in the slightest. Maybe I would have felt offended if I were someone whose BPD was making me miss appointments‚Ä¶ but then it would be a very helpful thing for me to hear? And yes, just like cancer and diabetes, borderline personality disorder does have specific markers common to all sufferers. That may, apparently, in the case of BPD, express as missing appointments. For example - a deep fear of abandonment, incomplete object relations, no object constancy, split self and object representations. 

If my therapist were to say that many of her BPD patients have self harmed, been angry with her, or think about suicide‚Ä¶ would it be ableist? What‚Äôs the difference? She‚Äôs there to help. 

My world isn‚Äôt spinning. I‚Äôm just wanting you to see that people aren‚Äôt out to get you. This is such an important step. Trusting help. You‚Äôll be stuck as long as you‚Äôre raging against sincere attempts at help.",Ill_Spirit_233,110bg8l
14,"I‚Äôm not raging, generalizations are definitely bad, what your therapist said was definitely a generalizations, and your world is definitely spinning. I didn‚Äôt mean it as metaphor I meant like the literal rotation of earth. (I mean it was kind of a metaphor as I was saying ‚Äúno matter what is said here on the internet life will go on‚Äù but eh) 
Eta: you may be under the impression that I‚Äôm offended by what your therapist said bc I miss appointments, that is not the case. I‚Äôve never bailed on a therapy appointment and I‚Äôm also otherwise disabled and I‚Äôve never bailed on my many doctors appointments, if for some reason I couldn‚Äôt attend, I give as much notice as possible. But because of this, I would be upset to hear a new therapist say that to me, I would feel they already have a negative idea of me that is not accurate.",ncndsvlleTA,110bg8l
15,"I see from your post history that you haven‚Äôt yet received therapy for your BPD. I know this is scary and it‚Äôs probably hard to trust that you will be respected, appreciated and seen as a valid human being despite your disorder. If you find a therapist or group specializing in BPD I can assure you that the first thing they are concerned with is validating your experience and reminding you that you are just a human being with a set of specific challenges that there are known tools to overcome. You‚Äôre also young, so your BPD is only going to get better once you access treatment. In 5 years if you work hard, you‚Äôll be living a good life. I promise. Try to trust your therapist when you find one, it will change your life.",Ill_Spirit_233,110bg8l
16,"I‚Äôve definitely been‚Ä¶in therapy. I‚Äôm just not currently as my insurance allots for a certain amount of appointments, but I‚Äôm actively looking for new therapists, I‚Äôm actually awaiting an email from a potential one as we speak. I‚Äôm very open and excited towards treatment, I just wouldn‚Äôt appreciate being told that ‚Äúbpds‚Äù are chronic bailers, also bc I have friends with bpd that aren‚Äôt like that.",ncndsvlleTA,110bg8l

0,"If you can afford it, I'd say stick with the therapy. Even when you're not in a relationship it can still help you to manage everyday life and build skills that will improve your relationship with yourself, your friendships, and prepare you for challenges in your next romantic relationship.

I don't know if therapy is the only reason we lasted so long. I finished my course in November and we fought a lot and broke up start of this month. 

I will never regret him, but one thing I regret is that he was my whole world and my main insecurities and issues. It feels like 18 months of intensive therapy was wasted on someone who's now just a stranger. 

It would have been better to be alone. Work on the issues of being alone.

2,"100/10 for noticing the source of your frustrations - sounds like you're torn between wanting to change the situation, and having to change yourself to meet the needs of the situation (again!)

Should you?

Like, if it's not for you and you know it's not, what's the problem?

The problem is the same as for the rest of us - you're posting this because you know you have vulnerabilities. 

There are ways in which you're different from others and these frustrate you because you have to do all the work to close the empathy gap, and one of the results of that empathy gap is that self-compassion has been harder to learn from others for you.

You're used to dealing with things on your own, but this psychodrama group represents a thing you don't know how to deal with (yet), and you're doing the intuitive thing in seeking reassurance about it. You're probably reasonably good at dealing with most things on your own - I know I am, because I've had to be.

But fml if I wasn't trying to paper over some vulnerabilities with toxic masculinity. Fellow man, I say this in all seriousness - trying to do so is less like shooting yourself in the foot, and more like shooting yourself in the dick.

Bell Hooks:

*""The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves. If an individual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem.""*

**It is not your fault**

Some people might use this kind of sentiment as an excuse, as a 6'2 hairy drummer with no need to, I can tell you with absolute certainty that understanding this kind of thing has been key to recovery.

You're seeking reassurance because you don't know what's going on inside, like a driver taking their car to a mechanic worrying about whether the problem you can't identify is actually going to get solved, or whether you're going to get ripped off.

You're worried about getting ripped off, and, frankly, why wouldn't you be?

I've tried drama groups. I can see how they 'work' for some people. Ask yourself what your recovery goals are, and whether the situation you're giving your time and effort to is helping you achieve those, and then... bro - unless you live in a very small country, ask yourself how you can know that your therapist is one of the best in the country.

Been where you're at, and I still find myself inexorably drawn to people of higher competence and compassion than my own. Some people are just golden, relativistically speaking, but so could you be.

Keep giving yourself opportunities to learn from yourself, and to road-test any new skills and learning along the way, and eventually you can be your own mechanic.

I mean that - these emotion things are just combinations of hormones and neurotransmitters as interpreted by your thoughts and memories. Yours are just different - and if you're afraid because there are things you don't understand, or angry because there are things you'd like to change, that is entirely normal for someone from where we're from.

7,">How do you know that your struggles are more important than others? 

Cause I've been there for six months already and I know their lives. Where I live there are two kinds of psychodrama groups: therapeutic groups for chronic and severe life problems, people with personality disorders and neuroticisim; and self-exploratory groups for people with more general problems that require deeper understanding of themselves.  

Some of the people in my group have problems with which they should be attending the second type of group therapy. Their lives are fully functioning and themselves are generally happy and content. I am there with no real connections to people, sitting or lying by myself all day, depression and frequent suicidal thoughts. I've been chronically stuck in my life for more than 10 years, doing nothing. I just don't have time for more lingering. Either I find a way to fix my life, or I'll give the fuck up. I won't be living this life for decades to go. This is not what I signed up for. Someone who feels good the way they are and has their ups and downs but is generally content with life and has emotional and other types of pleasure has no idea what it feels like to be deprived of all of this. The only reason I tend to be careful with these thoughts is that I think really highly of the therapist. I know a good therapist when I see one and I fully trust her. But still, I feel that my situation is becoming untenable. I just hate who I am becoming and I cannot emphasize how much nobody gives a shit about me.

We recently had a drama play with someone who is deprived of human connections too, but within the first 5 minutes it became clear that he actually has friends that invite him to themselves and attends them regularly. This is not something that happens to me. I have friends who are busy living their lives, they don't think about me. Most of them would only notice if I hanged myself. I don't blame them, I wouldn't be thinking about me if I had a meaningful relationship either.",JasonZZ369,z26w5y

One in which I do creative and constructive work and I am rewarded appropriately by it. And where I can make an impact and can be an outstanding expert of my chosen field.

Unfortunately I am far from this, and frankly, I am doubting if I can and will ever achieve it. Which makes me both depressed and furious, for I believe that it's not on me. My NPD and BPD traits developed over the years, I was put in the wrong school where I sustained lifelong injuries, my parents gave me little or no guidance and never nurtured my talents of which I have plenty. I could be a scientist or a musician by now, instead I am a nobody. And nobody cares. And there are few people if any, that believe me. 

I just had group therapy and I got really worked up. Nothing gets solved here. I cannot solve my problems because they'd require so much attention and care coming from outside that it's unrealistic because I am not a child anymore. I'll never get enough attention to heal. The thing is that I cannot and don't want to live with this pain, the pain of neglect and lacking an own identity, a true self I live by. 

I am nobody. I've been living my life trying to subconsciously avoid sticking out and make an impression, when in reality there's nothing I want more. My true, daring, endeavouring attitude was buried in my teens and since then I have been resentful and felt that things are not okay. It's not okay not to be pursue things I am wildly interested in, it's not okay not to do what I am good at; it's not okay not to play in a band with an absolute pitch, it's not okay not to go for academia with my keen interest and excellent records, it's not okay to have a very low self esteem with my intellect and handsome appearance; it's not okay to be alone all the time, to do nothing, to sleep hours a day, to act myself like I am an actor in the presence of my 'friends'. During my teens I learnt not to be myself and by the time I was supposed to make my own choices I had become utterly lost. And my parents couldn't make any of it.

And now here I am at 30, grasping at therapies, none of which work, because all they try to do is to integrate what I have become and help me settle with it. To which I say f\*ck them. If I cannot unfold and become the guy I should've become in my teens and be who I felt I wanted to be back then, then I don't want to be anything. In that case I don't want TO BE. And it's on my parents and my environment. So fuck them and everyone.

Maybe their problems aren't ""as severe"" in your mind, but they still deserve to get help and deserve the same amount of attention you are getting so that is most definitely not fair to them. How would you feel if someone was taking up all the group therapy time and was just hard focused on themselves? It probably wouldn't feel too good and would make you feel like you were less important. 

If you think you are needing more attention, this is something you probably should address in an individual therapy session. If the individual therapist you've seen isn't clicking, maybe you should try seeing someone else until you find one that clicks.

Besides in a group like this nobody has reason to hide their emotions. It's about the opposite, this is where we can open up.

1,"DBT my beloved. ‚ù§Ô∏è

No seriously, it‚Äôs made a world of difference for me. For years and years of my life I was just fluctuating between passively and actively suicidal. Just swinging from crisis to crisis while trying to keep it together on the surface. Self-worth in the gutter. One dysfunctional relationship after another. Self-harm, substance abuse. I was very unwell and traditional CBT barely made a dent in my issues. 

I started DBT when I was at rock bottom. My life had completely fallen apart and I could barely imagine it ever would be okay again. It was hard work but the tools I learned through DBT changed my life. I don‚Äôt self-harm anymore, I don‚Äôt abuse substances anymore. My self-worth has improved tremendously. I‚Äôm much more able to handle intense emotions and overall feel much more at peace. I‚Äôm no longer suicidal. I still have a lot of work to do but compared to where I started, I‚Äôve really come far with DBT. 

STICK WITH IT!! DBT takes a lot of time and practice but it‚Äôs so worth it. Be patient with yourself. It‚Äôs kind of like building muscle. Day to day you don‚Äôt notice much of a difference but one day you‚Äôll look at yourself and think ‚Äúdamn, look how far I‚Äôve come‚Äù. 

All the best to you, you got this!!",Budget-Astronaut-660,11wmwyx

I don‚Äôt really have access to therapy, so I do a lot of self-learning. I find that BPD and ADHD share a lot of traits, since they are both characterized by impulsiveness.

2,"I still use normal talk therapy (cognitive). I started in DBT but it slowly transitioned to talk therapy.

6,That has to be frustrating that you want to make that turn and you're not able to because your therapist does not want to!

I'm getting better therapy and treatment from my therapist that works. Half of it is because my therapist did the test and put a treatment plan together with me to achieve my goals. The other half is me keeping up with what I practice and learn in my sessions. 

If your therapist is planning on doing a DES do it! Also, I was told to fill it out over the span between sessions and not at one single time. Its an over time assessment.

My therapist presented me the DES to take home with me and complete and return to her with my answers and I found it rather confusing to rate past or episode exclusive behaviours into a percentage of effect however if it is intended to be done over a period of time, that does make sense as to why I found it a little hard to answer.

But if someone comes here and tell me stop recommending weed I expect reasons, specially since OP has no access to the sweet meds (Olanzapine, Risperidone or Quetiapin)...


If people is against weed for ""moral"" I'll tell them: fuck off and put in our shoes 1 month and enjoy the sweet ride if they manage to make it to the end.


If people is against because it may cause an anxiety attack I obviously won't recommend and when people describe their problems with anxiety I will recommend only CBD and CBG because THC obviously doesn't work for them.

Typically I find weed works best in moderation when I'm already capable of doing other self care practices and am in therapy.

I was smoking 3-4 blunts a day recently because I was in a really bad place and I was running from that truth. When you can't manage your emotions it becomes easy to get really high and distract yourself, and then you start losing your shit because the emotions end up just hitting you like a truck when you're sober again.

It may be worth noting that I'm a cis male who experienced neglect/non-attachment with my mother and psychological abuse from my father. I'm not sure that it was intentional that I'm in a time-limited program and I worked first with a female and then with a male. I experienced significant transference with both therapists and not coincidentally primarily worked on issues relating to my mother first and to my father second. My fellow clients represent a wide range of identities and ethnicities, and everyone is well-treated and (in my estimation) making noticable progress.

I'm currently transitioning out of the program and have been advised to work with an individual therapist twice a week, a process group once a week and continued medication management.

For me, I'd already done a ton of other therapies before this so I went in with some tools prepared, and so I've found this group to be very helpful in terms of working on core issues derived from childhood and getting to deep, buried emotions.

however, you should also talk to them. explain how you're trying to get better but that it's a process and you can't be expected to magically get better immediately. if they feel as strongly towards you they should understand and be willing to help. ask them to communicate when things hurt them, but you can also communicate what things trigger you so they could be a bit mindful of that.

1,"Coping skills. Coping skills. Coping skills. Research the heck out of them online and it‚Äôs going to be a trial and error in finding which ones work for you. And even once you find what works for you, it‚Äôs going to take a loooong time for you to be able to use them in times of crisis. I hope your SO understands that getting better isn‚Äôt a fast process. It takes a lot of time, and you‚Äôve got to train yourself to react appropriately when you don‚Äôt feel good.

My coping skills are mostly distraction and redirection exercises. Listening to loud music on headphones, coloring, going for a walk, spending time in a small safe space. Also I journal out all the negative thoughts I would usually say out loud, then tear them up and throw them away. 

You can‚Äôt ‚Äòremove‚Äô your triggers, that‚Äôs impossible. However you can train yourself to react more positively, or at the very least, not have a meltdown about it. 

I hate to say this‚Ä¶. But you‚Äôre going to have to step up your self control. A lot. If you want to keep them in your life, you‚Äôre going to have to make yourself get up and use your skills. There‚Äôs no easy way, no shortcuts. Sheer force of will is what it will take. It‚Äôs so fucking hard dude. I‚Äôve been there, and still there now. But over time, it gets easier to pull from your coping skills and you don‚Äôt have to force yourself so much. 

You‚Äôre simply not going to get better immediately unless you really get your act together and start forcing yourself to react better to your triggers. No excuses, no ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äô etc.

Im betting they love you, and I‚Äôm betting that leaving you won‚Äôt be an easy choice for them. But they are absolutely right in that they deserve to be treated better.

2,"I have moderate BPD. I‚Äôve been in therapy for almost two years, and on medication for 8 months now.

I do not like the way my medication has made me feel lately. I‚Äôve been doing some research for a more natural route and found some interesting benefits of Ashwagandha, Magnesium, and B6 specifically for BPD symptoms. I already take magnesium for my health, but I also use the app Headspace in the mornings for guided meditations and try to shoot for daily yoga, if I can‚Äôt get my yoga in I‚Äôll do a quick mediation with breathing exercises. 

To offer guidance to you and your loved one;
Abandonment is our number one trigger. You‚Äôve now been made aware there is a possibility that you may be abandoned by the one person you thought was going to be there forever. Communication is very important, as well as a persons mental health. I understand they may need to do what is best for them. If they desire the forever as you do, communicate that gently. You need to be sure you‚Äôre both creating a secure attachment for each other. It is not a solve all, but it‚Äôs a strong start. Clear communication, trust and holding each other accountable to that will definitely help. Actively listen, do not defended yourselves when explaining how one is feeling, do not invalided each other. All of these will lead to triggers and one not being heard. Keep a journal for your eyes only if this helps, write in it about every feeling you have. This can help pin point feelings that you may not have words to describe them.

This advice was all from my therapist over the years, it has helped me immensely. I still have my days but I have more understanding of how to help care for myself. Really take the time to learn your triggers and describe them to yourself on what a specific word, phrase, or look can cause you to lash out and become angry. If you‚Äôre anything like me, I would become very angry and I really despised that about myself, I would say the most cruel and hurtful things to my significant other. I regret it very much‚Ä¶thankfully he has been so understanding and compassionate over the last 6 years it‚Äôs really helped and eased my symptoms of abandonment knowing he is always there for me, but he is sure to hold me accountable and has learned with me over the years to know when an episode could potential happen.

The best thing about your post is that you acknowledge when you‚Äôve done something that has hurt someone, you are aware of your actions. Wanting to better yourself in any way possible it a very strong start. I hope this helps guide you in a direction that offers you abundance.

The yoga channel I follow on YouTube is Yoga With Adriene. She has playlists for every months that are free.

Headspace has some free guided meditations, but in app purchases. My work offers free subscription, so I am sure you can find lots of videos on YouTube as well.

3,"I‚Äôd start by reading some self help and taking some time to really get in touch with yourself via journaling your feeling both good and bad.

Start figuring out where the tender parts of your heart are. Once you uncover some triggers you can start making a plan for how you‚Äôll act when your upset in those moments.

For me I take a lot of time away to settle down. Even if it takes hours that‚Äôs ok? The important thing is you take that space and don‚Äôt create more damage while upset in the deep feelings that come up.

You got this! The desire to improve is the biggest thing you need to change and then the willingness to pick up some new tools

Their mental health is important as well. You don‚Äôt want them to put your health above their own, that‚Äôs unhealthy and also a recipe for building resentment. 

It might be a good idea for you guys to consider taking a break for a few weeks. Your partner can focus on resting and rebuilding their stamina and you can focus on starting your own self care - watching the Dr Fox videos, starting the DBT workbook, getting into a regular routine of eating healthy, getting enough sleep, regular exercise if you aren‚Äôt already doing that.

I would also suggest a few books for at least your partner to read, and even you as well, since you sound pretty sure you have BPD: ‚ÄúTalking To A Loved One With Borderline Personality Disorder‚Äù by Kreisman, ‚ÄúStop Walking On Eggshells‚Äù by Mason & Kreger, ‚ÄúLoving Someone With Borderline Personality Disorder‚Äù by Manning.",Random_Enigma,13twhcv

As some folks have mentioned, it's helpful to communicate your triggers to your partner and ask them to consider them. Although we can be challenging to be with, every relationship requires effort and support from both sides.

However, on a side note, individuals with BPD tend to idealize their partner, considering them their favorite person, and may believe they won't find anyone else like them. The truth is, there are plenty of people out there who may be just as good or even better.

When you begin Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and learn how to be comfortable being alone and the peace that comes with it, as well as how to become emotionally independent from your partner, your perspective will become clearer and more rational.

As someone with BPD, I can assure you that recovery is indeed possible. However, it's important to acknowledge that it won't be an easy journey. The key to recovery lies within yourself, as you need to actively work on improving and grounding yourself, as well as changing your thought patterns and perceptions. It requires consistent effort from you.

It's crucial to understand that while help and support from others may be available, you shouldn't rely solely on external assistance. The primary responsibility for your recovery rests with you. It's essential to take ownership of your healing process and not expect others to do the work for you, even if assistance is offered.

Remember, your commitment and effort in working on yourself will play a significant role in your path to recovery from BPD",Teesamaha,13twhcv

0,"He explicitly told you not to text so much. That's a very polite ""leave me be"".

You may want closure but you don't need it, aren't entitled to that contact with him, and he doesn't owe you that. Leave him alone. I know how hard it is, I really, really do, but you need to stop this now. He doesn't want to be with you and that's alright.

You don't need to hide anything but you ARE responsible for ensuring it's not ruling your life, that you're not out of control, and that you can regulate yourself in healthy ways. THAT'S why you need the help and it will take you some time, so focus on doing that sort of work instead of dating and that sort of thing until you're healthier and more well.

It is abundantly clear that you need help and support in learning how to engage with others appropriately, how to regulate your emotions healthily, and how to self-soothe without using maladaptive coping mechanisms. DBT is likely your best bet and it's important that you find a therapist who has experience with people with BPD. 

Your therapist is both right and wrong. You can't (and shouldn't) tell everyone everything all the time because it isn't appropriate, healthy, or always safe, BUT there are people in your life who can help support you...but they can't be doing all the heavy lifting and hard work, that's your job. You very clearly need professional help and that's going to require YOU to work hard at healing and learning, as well as actually doing what's asked of you.

You can have a really nice life for yourself once you get this under control and learn how to manage yourself, but if you don't you're always going to be in this cycle of finding someone, getting too into them, pushing them away, and then obsessing when they leave you.

0,"dbt is the best treatment for bpd! you can say, ‚Äúi want to learn some dbt skills, can we do that today?‚Äù

with my therapist, i like doing worksheets. at my last session, she printed out a dbt worksheet, i filled it out, then we discussed it. this has helped me personally with being able to express how i feel, because i get to lay it out on paper first/ think through how im feeling when i write. 

your psych is there to help. their words can help you, but especially when youre open to working with them; they can help you best when they know what‚Äôs on your mind. 

there are FREE dbt pdfs online that you can look at/ work on at home by yourself. you could fill out a couple worksheets and bring them to your sessions to discuss any questions/ things you‚Äôve noticed with your psych. 

when you have an appointment, bring a notebook dedicated to your sessions. write down info/ statements that your psych says that you feel are helpful/ important/ useful. if you dont know where to start when taking notes during sessions, write down what you can during the session, and afterwards you can go back and highlight/ underline the info you like best. 

one thing that has helped me immensely with feeling more in touch with myself/ my mind/ my feelings is journaling. you probably hear it all the time, but genuinely it has helped me SO much; getting my thoughts out on paper helps me realize okay, this is what i think about, this is what im feeling, oh okay id like to talk about that with my therapist next time, etc.

you can:

‚Ä¢brain dump- write everything that you think as you think it. don‚Äôt worry about grammar/ punctuation/ complete sentences, just write. even if you feel stuck, literally write ‚Äúidk what to write about‚Äù and keep writing it, and eventually something comes to mind. it feels nice to get shit out on paper, and if you experience a lot of chaos/ racing thoughts this helps you pick apart what youre thinking about. 

‚Ä¢make lists- your likes and dislikes, how youve been feeling today/ this week, things in your life that may be difficult for you, etc. again, just getting your thoughts out on paper helps you see that you are your own person, you are experiencing life, and you can become more in touch with the world and yourself. it just takes practice:‚Äô) 

‚Ä¢mindfulness- this helps with being in touch with yourself and your surroundings. you can look up mindfulness prompts online that you can write about. like, what do you see/smell/feel/hear/ taste right now? what do you feel in your body right now (i.e. tension? warmth? coolness? a headache?) there are lots of prompts out there and you can choose which you want to write about. mindfulness has really helped me connect to myself & my body, as i experience a lot of depersonalization/ derealization 

therapy takes practice, it really does. it takes both the psych and you to get the most out of each session. its okay that it feels difficult for you now, and just know that that CAN change with your effort & attitude towards therapy. 

i feel you on this one, and im sending lots of love. im here to tell you i have been there, and i have made improvements, and i still am. it is possible to get out of these feelings, and to become more in touch with yourself & the world. most importantly, it is possible to learn the skills that will help you navigate these feelings whenever they surface. i wish you the best of luck, and i believe in you<33",radishpatchkid,104qbn5

0,"Not sure if I'm a bit late to the party here but I'll let you know what you're in for. 

Generally schema therapy works with BPD but its also used to treat a variety of mental health issues. What you can expect is to be more aware of when your behaviours change, also the history of certain beliefs you have. 

Schema therapy is great because it doesn't just look on the surface, it takes a deeper look and even helps you identify patterns in yourself. This is something I personally feel CBT doesn't delve into as much. 

If you are interested in Schema Therapy I've started a sub here on reddit. r/SchemaTherapy",Superdk55,m4fou0

0,"My therapist and I stop having regular appointments when I'm stable and in a good place. I get a certain amount of government funded appointments a year, so why waste them on check in appointments? It would be the same if I was paying. If I'm doing ok at handling things myself why would I spend the $150 to tell her that. If something comes up that is a ""I definitely need help here"" thing, she will always find an appointment for me ASAP.

So I don't think it's unethical at all.",SadieSadieSnakeyLady,k54cus
1,"Many therapists (the *more* ethical ones, typically) see therapy as something that shouldn‚Äôt last forever. They don‚Äôt want to siphon your money away from you for the rest of your life‚Äî ideally, they want to help give you the tools you need to be somewhat self-sufficient before sending you off into the world again.

However... I‚Äôve had a therapist tell me this when my problems had absolutely not been solved with her whatsoever. I‚Äôd been working with her for a year at that point. I think she saw my self esteem issues tied to my siblings as ‚Äúthe main problem‚Äù and once we had sorted through that I‚Äôd be fine on my own. But I proceeded to be transparently not-fine for the following eight years, and had to stumble through a spotty and inconsistent treatment history the whole time. It was frustrating. Some therapists just can‚Äôt help you anymore because they‚Äôve given you all they know, I guess.

Back to the point: If your therapist has broken up with you and you strongly disagree/want to find other solutions, you could request a call to discuss alternate options. I personally might recommend something like Betterhelp, where you have continuing access to a therapist for a cheaper price. Alternately you could start investigating therapists who specialize in different modalities that you think you could benefit from‚Äî aside from the obvious shorter-term DBT, there‚Äôs also schema, mentalization, and transference based therapy. I believe those are all promising options for treating BPD specifically, though you may struggle to find folks who fit your insurance if they fall too far outside of typical CBT.

If you‚Äôd like to take a break from therapy for a time and see how it goes, though,  that could be interesting to track and see what happens. Considering non-therapy self-care options is a valid treatment approach too‚Äî what would it be like to spend that time and money on regular massages to help you relax, or on volunteer work to build your sense of purpose & community? Is there a self-improvement endeavor you‚Äôd like to join, like an ADHD skills coaching group or a kickboxing class? What are you getting out of therapy now that you could potentially find in a non-therapy context? I wonder if that‚Äôs partly what your therapist is encouraging you to consider.

But if you know that you have other pressing problems that you need the extra professional support in untangling, you could certainly start investigating some new therapist options. It‚Äôs your life and you get to choose how to best take care of yourself moving forward.",twigathon,k54cus
2,"Therapy shouldn't be a live long proces, but personal development is. Maybe you could consider group therapy? I was in a group of 8 girls with BPD, and it actually really helped me in ways individual therapy didn't.     It gave me strength to face things on my own.",,k54cus

11,Dissociation is when people literally forget where they‚Äôre at. Google it. ADHD is zoning out for the most part. Most people on here are over exaggerating their mental illnesses for attention.

Do reach out to people, maybe old friend who you've lost touch with? You could also consider joining another weekly group that isn't therapy-related?

It might be worth practicing some radical acceptance surrounding the ending of this stage of your therapy. Tough, I know, but you'll have gotten a wealth of support this past eighteen months, and you will be stronger than you realise. But I do totally get that this must be so hard for you right now.",badgerhoneyy,fankjy

I mean we have been talking about it these past weeks and I guess that is the guidance and like I do have some ideas based on what we talk about on what I need to do like keep myself busy with schedules and take what I've learnt with me etc. 

Noo we aren't really allowed to keep in touch with the others, unfortunately. Yeah, that's a good idea I'll have a look at what kind of weekly groups are in my area. Yeah that is very true, im hoping it all works out and that i do have the skills necessary with me.

I was diagnosed with bpd 10 years ago and the first few years were hard, but now, with the help of therapy and many, many grounding techniques, I have it under control. 
The dbt workbooks are really helpful. I also found a deck of dbt cards, that each have grounding techniques aimed in specific areas which are amazing to keep in your bag if you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed. I also used the headspace app for YEARS to help me sleep and it taught me some great breathing exercises.

2,"HERE'S MORE INFORMATION:

The 32-week program is led by a chartered counseling psychologist in the UK with over 20 years of experience. It's a 32 week program with a commitment of 2 sessions a week - one DBT group session each week (4 modules of 8 weeks each) and one 1 on 1 session each week. It would be a virtual (likely Zoom) program, and the psychologist and the organization for which he works require a contract of commitment between the patients and the psychologist..  
  
The psychologist will schedule a 15 minute consultation (NOT therapeutic) to check chemistry and explain what they do, and answer questions you may have.  If you and they agree to work together, they require you to fill out a diagnostic questionnaire (again, I really respect how careful their intake process is).  
  
While they are sympathetic to the cost of the program, my research has shown that this program is still significantly less expensive that inpatient programs or psychiatric-medication-inclusive programs I have also explored.   They are not in a position to offer financial aid, so that is why I keep mentioning the cost ‚Äì this cost must be something an interested party is willing and able to bear. (assuming only 2 people in the DBT Group sessions, the total cost for the 32 weeks would be 4500-5000GBP)  
  
The payment would be in bank transfer to a UK bank. At this time I do not believe they offer alternative payment methods.  Therefore it will be up to the patient to find the way to accomplish the bank transfer.  (I do not believe it would be a lump sum, but I suggest fellow patients be prepared to pay in advance for each month‚Äôs sessions)  
  
(It is VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE:  This is not a service for people in immediate distress or in need of emergency therapy for life-threatening situations.  This will be over Zoom so they cannot  - and will not ‚Äì help with that.  Additionally they are very good at setting boundaries ‚Äì although I find the psychologist very kind, my interactions with them will NOT include messaging at any time I feel a need.  If your previous relationships with therapy included messaging your therapist at any time, this is not for you.)",IraJohnson,nkry8m

4,"Frankly it saved my life.  Not only did I get a good group and a great psychologist who is well trained and believes in what he does; the twice weekly (one group, one one on one) sessions really helped me take in, practice and internalize most of the skills.  Today the therapist and I are at monthly frequency and I'm managing better and better and have really learned to embrace the dialectical ""I like who I am yet I can still become better.",IraJohnson,nkry8m
5,"Caveats:  Very expensive ($7000+ for an 8 month twice weekly program; YOU MUST DO THE WORK and its often difficult, counterintuitive (Marsha LInehan was clearly brilliant but not well organized in some ways, the Diary Card can be frustrating); I still have depressive episodes and even suicidal ideations and its super super hard at those times to do the work - but if I do it makes a difference.",IraJohnson,nkry8m

0,5 years in therapy... triggers still happen daily. What has changed in those 5 years is how I react to them. Give yourself some grace friend. I find myself getting so caught up in what I want to be that I forget how far I‚Äôve come. You said it yourself‚Äîsometimes you‚Äôre doing great! What are you doing in those moments that makes life more tolerable? The journey is repetitive. Don‚Äôt get discouraged. One day at a time.,optimistic69er,naplxh
1,"7 years in therapy, triggers happen less often than before. I did tremendous amounts of personal growth and work on myself to get to where I am. (went no contact with nParent, finally have healthy relationship, learned how not to self harm and skills, etc.). I still feel intensely, and theres better and worse times but now i have a cushion and i stopped pushing people away. After 4 years of DBT me and my therapist have decided that I could benefit from EMDR for the trauma and I am gonna do that. For me, Teal Swan, Sam Vaknin, Dr Daniel Fox and Dr Ramani on youtube have helped immensely. I do a great amount of work outside of work and in my free time. As long as you don't give up (and I know how hard it is, trust me) you will be great. There are amazing remission rates of bpd, I believe that by the age of 45 people sometimes will have magically 'healed' and dont fit the criteria for bpd anymore, even without treatment. Now imagine the amazing life ahead of you with treatment and you designing and working on your personality. :) Trust the process.",Cheap_Skate69,naplxh
2,"I get triggered occasionally, but I no longer have suicidal ideations (and I suffered from those for YEARS). 

I still have obsessive thoughts, mainly about mistakes I have made in the past that I wish I could fix or take back. I am working on forgiving myself about some things. I don't know if I will ever get there, but I'm trying.

My self esteem has improved but it's still probably on the lower side. My boyfriend tends to check me when I start to get really down on myself and I try to look at who I am from his point of view. I believe I am worthy of love now, which is something I was sure wasn't true for many years.

It is possible to recover if you work your program. It can take years, but it's worth it to keep trying even when you feel like it is pointless or dumb.",RadicalAcceptanceFTW,naplxh
3,"20 years in therapy, ""in remission"" for like 3.
You will still get triggered, but less often. You will learn ways to avoid triggers and to cope when they happen. 
The thoughts don't necessarily go away forever, but they get weaker and lose their power. As your self esteem improves (and yes it will), you will gain more control over your mind and your thoughts. You will also learn how to resist those thoughts.
For the first like 15 years I was in therapy I didn't think it was helping. It felt like I was beating my head against a wall and making no progress. But I didn't give up, and I'm here to tell you it does get better. Just keep at it.",originalangster,naplxh
4,I wish i was still in therapy but have been using the DBT handbook on my own. My triggere are largely the same but how often they actually trigger me is different?

6,"A thousand years in therapy, technically in recovery. I still encounter triggers but I'm able to prevent them becoming triggers if that makes sense?

8,"I‚Äôve had about six or seven years of therapy and started DBT a year ago. My idea of recovery was basically a cure and because I strived so hard to get there when my symptoms didn‚Äôt go away I fell hard. Now that I‚Äôm actually like using the skills I feel more prepared. Nothing has gone away but now I don‚Äôt feel utterly helpless in dealing with my problems and I‚Äôm not running away from things just because I‚Äôm worried that they‚Äôre going to trigger me. There have definitely been some really frustrating things that have held me back a little bit and sometimes I get triggered and then get mad at myself because I‚Äôm supposed to be getting better not worse. Progress isn‚Äôt always linear and the best advice I have is to be kind to your self, validate yourself for wanting to change behaviors and don‚Äôt put yourself down for  feelings that you can‚Äôt control. This is coming from someone who is it necessarily recovered but is doing pretty well in therapy so I hope this helped a little bit",cosmoscomedy,naplxh

I made a valiant effort with meds but alas I just experienced far to many side effects to even focus on therapy and getting better so 8 years ago I stopped them all. No one do this without a doctor's guidance I almost died because I'm stubborn af lol. So instead I chose DBT, CBT,  EMDR and trauma therapies as well as traditional talk therapy.  I exercise eat relatively healthy but still enjoy the not so healthy in moderation (after all we ain't getting outta this bitch alive folks! Eat the slice of cake). These were effective for me.

Medication can be a tool in the toolkit, though. It can help manage some of symptoms, which can make it easier to focus on doing the work and learning the skills that you need.

Some people find that something like an antidepressant is extremely helpful for the ""early"" stages of healing, and then are able to taper off as they learn more skills and heal some. But meds aren't for everyone, and not everyone will want or be able to come off of them (depending on other depression sources besides the BPD). YMMV.",solidparallel,10zm9b5

1) Set repeating alarms to go off 30 minutes before every therapy session you have. Do this in advance for every session you have booked.

2) Make a Wallpaper on your phone saying something similar to 'Always Attend Therapy' or '9.30 Therapy Is Amazing'. Do the same for your room by writing this somewhere visible.

With all the compassion in the world I have for you as someone also going through it, and has made making BIG strides in recovery: it matters to you, if this is truly life or death, you need to take EVERY STEP possible to get to therapy and making it an unmissable priority, the only expecting would be a physical emergency (e.g. hospital for you or a loved one).

I'd definitely sit with it for a little longer before telling more than... anyone that you *already* keep promptly updated on your therapy sessions, really.

4,"CPTSD ADHD and quiet BPD/CO-dependant here.

I cope with my diagnosis as I understood it.
CPTSD is at the core of my issue, this one I share because it makes it relatable. 

ADHD because either trauma reactions take too much of my brain capacities or the fact that it started during a crucial phase in my development.
I sometimes share it as I am taking medication.

BPD is the set of coping mechanisms that I developed in order to survive with my trauma.
I identify less and less to it after lots of therapy. 

I do not share that one as almost nobody can relate.
If anybody ask I would explain that, due to trauma I developed disregulated emotions and that I just need time to ""collect and reflect"" .

I have shared my diagnosis but it has been used against me. It gave a free path to all the assholes I tend to associate with to blame me instead of taking ownership of their own malfunctions.

It's kind of disgusting seeing how people just turn a different tune after you say it. 
As said above, I said it from my need for validation.
I wanted people to understand me, to love me ""completely"".
Turns out,  it went the opposite way.
Turns out I need to love myself that much, nobody else's can understand myself as much as I do.

I am glad you're a therapist,  this is helping me so much when my therapist can relate to my internal turmoil or make it look less heavy.

People tend to think of personality disorders as a true crime show. For them you become evil and manipulative...
It's funny because many of those in my surroundings who overreacted have  themselves some kind of personality disorder too.

My ex partner even dared to put his lies and cheating  on my PD. His mother and sister labeled me as highly toxic while they are themselves way above the norm in that area.

It's like it's blinding self reflection for people.

Some of my friends reacted really well. Not precisely the people I thought would. Very securely attached people aren‚Äôt that scared, or people that already had a long therapy and know themselves well.

I really think it's time to reframe BPD for the public.
We are not all hysterical and manipulative.

I am for instance very controlling to MYSELF and give the benefit of the doubt to people I love without setting boundaries in fear of abandonment. 

If there is anger or emotional turmoil it's inward and people outside just see someone at most ""slightly irritated "".

My emotions run fast yes, again,  inwards.

You wouldn't label me as volatile. People think of me as ""emotional"" but before I tell them my diagnosis they tend to find it very manageable. 
After, all of the sudden, I am evil.
And if I dare yo put a boundary, which is very healthy, it suddenly become something else.

You'll be amazed by the amount of persons willing to put their wrongdoing onto your diagnosis if you tell.

I am usually for opening up about my mental state, but borderline is, with NPD, the ones you do not want to share.
Either people think the diagnosis is wrong (especially with quiet BPD) or do a 180¬∞ behavioral change and you become evil.

Even a sociopath could share his diagnosis with less  trouble honestly as we have had a bad rep on social media these last years.

All of my symptoms and co-morbidities come from long term trauma. 

That's what I say now.

5,"So, in my experience, I‚Äôve told people that I‚Äôve trusted in the past about this. My platonic friends? They have always been so accepting because they see me for who I am. I show up with enthusiasm and I always manage my emotions around them pretty well. My relationship partners? Well, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ended well. All of my past traumas have been weaponized against me at some point. Just pretty much reading me to filth. Which is unfortunate because a.) when I first got diagnosed with BPD, I was struggling IMMENSELY from transitioning to adulthood. I suffered very extreme trauma as a child. I was overprotected and not allowed to develop normally as an adolescent. I was very, very socially inept. I was dealing with very complex PTSD. So, during my intake, at age 18, at a community college psychiatric office, I was diagnosed with BPD. I don‚Äôt align with that diagnosis, to be honest with you. I think i got misdiagnosed. I truly do believe I align more with my autism diagnosis. It makes abundantly more sense. Now, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with the fact that I was diagnosed with BPD. It was very eye opening. But all of my partners, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if my recent ex would say this, have all written me off as a ‚ÄúBPD ex‚Äù, when, in reality, I have sensory overload and years of trauma that I‚Äôve handled to the best of my ability. I don‚Äôt snap at people. I don‚Äôt paint them black and white and I haven‚Äôt in years. I show empathy and I do my very best to respect boundaries once they are established. I enjoy spending my time alone. 
If you do decide to share that diagnosis, that is entirely your right and no one else‚Äôs. It is very stigmatized and I don‚Äôt really trust people that say they had a ‚Äúcrazy ex girlfriend‚Äù without giving any real context from both sides. Very neutral standpoint. 
I‚Äôve yet to meet a person, namely a man,  who hasn‚Äôt demonized their ex without providing full context. Not that anyone is entitled to that, but a lot of people will simply PUSH women to their absolute emotional limit and when they have a strong reaction (i.e., reactive abuse), they are painted as monsters for finally sticking up for themselves.

6,"First thing, wait a couple of weeks. Maybe a month
 Take some time to absorb the new information.

If you eventually decide to tell people, don't do it en masse. Do it individually, and face to face. Avoid using your diagnosis to explain away past behaviours - it'll sound like you're making excuses.

7,"I tell people about BPD the moment I meet them. It's a good filter for those who will not be able to handle me anyway, for those who are not genuine and for those who judge others.

I don't need people who can't accept my diagnosis - if merely hearing about it will scare them away then they could never handle truly knowing who I am anyway. And I don't need those kinds of fake friends. I also find that it makes my life easier and more free: don't have to hide anything. I can openly admit when I struggle. When I have a massive meltdown because my seat belt won't work, my boyfriend knows exactly why and won't mock me but instead knows how to handle the situation. 

I would encourage telling your loved ones. The ones that truly are worth sticking around for will have your back. It will make it easier for them and most of all for you. It'll give them a reason why sometimes you are one way and the next second the other. It'll give them answers on why you sometimes behave the way you do and perhaps will help them be more understanding and encourage you instead of blame you.

After a few years of intense and dedicated healing, my conclusion is that you need to do things like go to therapy and dbt, build a reliable support system, and generally feel stable in life before you can really benefit from the use of psychedelics. Not saying you won't benefit otherwise, but for me the change was remarkable after I had laid the groundwork for me to truly benefit from psychedelic therapy. 

Doing psychedelics in the early stages of recovery helped me cry and feel some self love, for instance. But it didn't last as my mind wasn't yet structured in a way to sustain that feeling long term. Basically, psychedelics are not a silver bullet but they can help tremendously when used to assist other approaches to recovery.

1,"Two things have helped me most:  

1. Psychodynamic psychotherapy. It's not a quick solution, but rewarding

2.  LSD therapy. It's also rewarding, but not easy.

Maybe I'm cynical, but I have a feeling that there's no easy way to resolve our relationships with the causes of our suffering and dysregulation. It's almost as if we contain measurable amounts of pain and effort that we need to expend. 

Think of it this way; ""I have 50 units of pain i need to drain off."" I can drain it all at once or very slowly, one unit at a time. If that metaphor doesn't work for you, think of a reservoir. A river is dammed and the outflow can be completely stopped. If you want to change the depth of the water and the pressure on the dam, you need to drain off water. It doesn't matter if you only let off a trickle or if you completely open the floodgates: the water needs to be drained in one way or another.

It was incredibly helpful for me to use psychedelics, but I can't recommend it to anyone. Psychodynamic therapy took much longer, but the pain was drained off thoroughly but much more slowly.

People say ""the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" You need to take the first step, but the first step isn't the journey. You need to take the first step, and then the second first step, and the third first step, the fourth first step, and so on.

Reading what you wrote, it seems that you want to take on way too much. Let me ask you a question - why? Why is it so important for you to be needed? Why do you want to take on a parental role? The best question you can ask yourself is what motivates me here? If I do all this for her, what will that say about me? Do I base my self-worth on being needed by others? Or sacrificing myself? Those are the hallmarks of codependence. Does focusing on her issues get me away from my own self-esteem issues?

This wouldn't be healthy for either of you. She would be dependent and you co-dependent. Yet you want to put so much energy into her. Did you have to emotionally take care of a parent and that's why this is normal for you? Because this would be taking on a parental role and would be enabling and reinforcing her and your codependence. 

What if you set healthy boundaries and honored her boundaries. She is taking some space. What if you respected that? If she reaches out, you can mention therapy but she has to want it. You can't change her. If she needs support, she will let you know. Honor that. Don't parent her and get enmeshed in her life. Take this time apart from her to focus all that energy on yourself.

>I am doing it for me

Okay that's sounds like you want her to change for you. I'm sorry but that's not possible. And if she desires a parental role which most BPD's do, she'll be angry at you not filling it. It's a lose/lose. You become the parent, she doesn't change inside because you can't change from external validation and she is still angry at you because of her needs to place blame outwards and be the victim. If you put boundaries in place and engage, she gets angry that you won't be the parent. And again she is playing the blame on you for her emotions. So both these options are the opposite of helping her because they just reinforce her disorder of outward blame. And they enable you to be co-dependent instead of healing.

What if you enacted heathy boundaries by disengaging? That's the kindest thing you can do for her. It's what may actually motivate her to change or just find a new ""parent"". I know the pull for you is strong, it's an addiction. It's like you're in a cult and she's the leader. It's very hard to see reality and get out. The time and energy you spend on her just strengthens your indoctrination.

I don't want to be in a parental role.

For reasons I'm not gonna get into, I don't have many people and have difficulty getting close with most. I do like her as a person and unless I'm completely off in my assessment of her mirroring capabilities (which I think are mediocre), I think she's a good person. And also good at promoting my growth and I hope I am decent at promoting hers.

I don't base my self worth at all based upon others. It's been very internal to me for a while.

Sacrificing myself: there is an amount of myself I'm happy to give in any friendship/relationship, she does push boundaries but we're not going to live together this time. And I've learned a good bit about my limitations, boundaries, and we're not getting close to those limitations this time. I've also learned alot about her. I pushed so many of her buttons without even realizing. I pushed them alot. Hell I would push a normal persons buttons unknowingly in the past. It's good to have discovered and lock down my boundaries as it pertains with her. I don't think she'll push too aggressively. She'll be upset but I fully expect her to be ok with them. Or move on.

Codependent? A bit.

I'm not letting her become my life this time. And also making an active effort to build a full life.

Her boundaries, yes I will honor them. Considering everything that went on the past few months, I am impressed she managed to push through and do the right thing. Considering how much it ate away at her. I'm gonna make my peace with her and then I'm leaving her be. Ball is in her court. I'm not gonna BS her. But I do expect her to bite.

She's wanted to change since before she met me, she doesn't quite understand what's going on. She used to believe she was a narcissistic and doomed and did pursue therapy for that and made me aware of it in the beginning. I let her know a few months back that I didn't believe she wasn't one and that there is alot of hope for her. The happiness on her face was priceless. I shared info about DBT w/ her and there was an overwhelming fear on her face. She primarily attends therapy when it allows her to continue assuming the victim role. But I have seen her take responsibility and direct feedback, from me and therapist. I think DBT and the right therapist can make a big impact. 

The ball is going to be in her court entirely, she will have to take responsibility but I will be there for her in a few couples sessions just to make sure the therapist isn't being a dick to her. After she's gotten off the ground, and her personal therapist is in sync. I'm planning to step away from it. If she wants me to come for sessions here and there I will.

I'm not nearly as attached to her as most people become w/ their pwBPD. She didn't destroy my self esteem or worth. Mine is pretty concrete.

0,"I was diagnosed with both. I was diagnosed with BPD as a teenager, but every mental health professional I saw didn‚Äôt point out my ADHD. I moved and I was misdiagnosed with bipolar (that‚Äôs a whole other story) and I was also diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety

I found a really good psych and therapist 2 years ago and I‚Äôm ‚Äúproperly‚Äù diagnosed with BPD, C-PTSD (no longer meet criteria now for both), ADHD-combined type, and OCD.

ADHD symptoms and BPD symptoms overlap a lot. It‚Äôs not in the official diagnostic criteria, but people who have ADHD struggle with low frustration tolerance (low ability to manage anger) and effectively regulate emotions. People who have ADHD can also experience more moment-to-moment mood changes, which can also look like BPD. Among the poor impulse control which is also a BPD symptom.

How to differentiate? 
-BPD experiences instability in sense of self, lack of knowing who they are
-severe abandonment issues
-experience transient dissociation/paranoid ideation 

So they can kinda mesh with eachother. I‚Äôve always had a hard time managing my emotions, on stimulant meds I can manage my emotions- ESPECIALLY anger- much better. My mood is also more level during the day. I‚Äôm less scattered, more patient. Meds have made my ability to function so much better. I can participate more in therapy, regulate my impulses, I‚Äôm more calm during the day. 

The biggest role meds have in treating BPD is treating co-occurring disorders to lower distress, so that the BPD sufferer can further use skills to regulate themselves. I‚Äôve found this to be very true with my adhd meds and my ability to regulate my other BPD  symptoms. 

ADHD is a self-regulation disorder, and in my opinion, I think ‚ÄúADHD‚Äù is a terrible name. It should be executive dysfunction disorder.

I went to get diagnosed with ADHD, and ended up being diagnosed with BPD first, and then ADHD a few weeks later (two different psychs working under the same company with two different specialties). I also have C-PTSD, anxiety and depression. A LOT of these things can overlap, some symptoms can mask others, or other symptoms can amplify others (eg. when I'm frustrated by my lack of executive dysfunction from my ADHD, my BPD rage can and does kick in and take things to a whole new level). Learning to manage certain triggering symptoms has led to a greater ability to regulate BPD and anxiety symptoms. ADHD medication also changed my life, it made me feel like I could actually breathe, and think without being assaulted by 10 thoughts and 2 songs and a random Spongebob quote being repeated over and over in the background.

The BPD discovery happened at 20 (I'm 22 now), and personally, **yes** when I'm on stimulant medication my symptoms are SO much less severe. (20mg Vyvanse has been best for me).

I will say however, as a woman, I've realized that if I'm under more stress, or if certain hormone levels are higher for me at certain times of the month, stimulant meds can either make symptoms way worse, or they just don't make a difference at all. 

Generally, they're very helpful, but unfortunately, sometimes they are a big factor when it comes to bouts of mania. So unless you're REALLY in tune with yourself, or you at least have someone around that could recognize any negative signs,  I wouldn't recommend stimulants until you feel more regulated more often.

2,"What helped me a lot is understanding the physiology going on in the brain. BPD sufferers often have under developed amygdala‚Äôs from childhood trauma so it doesn‚Äôt fully develop. Amygdala‚Äôs regulate when there is a threat, but because ours are smaller they quickly get triggered/over stimulated, releasing cortisol and adrenaline into the bloodstream which makes us much more likely to freeze, fight, or flight. Often fight/yell is the reaction, together the frontal lobe that does the executive thinking eg.Frontal Lobe: ‚ÄòIf I swear at the doctor the next time I visit ‚Äôshe‚Äôs‚Äô not going to be happy with me‚Äô is turned off, the frontal lobe closes down because we think it‚Äôs an emergency like jumping out of danger of a car running us over but it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs just the doctor being difficult. Taking notice of when I‚Äôm getting anxious eg when I feel a pressure sensation in my brain (flood of adrenaline) or sometimes my eyes get watery I can be aware more and more that I‚Äôm getting wound up. Each time I notice, I can just reduce talking/overthinking take some breaths and not let the horse bolt. I used to be extremely volatile (smash windows) and I‚Äôve become soooo much calmer from just noticing this whole process unfolding. Sometimes I have anxiety attacks that go for 5 hours, but I just go for a walk with some music on and it helps reduce it.

0,"TLDR: 3 years +/- after starting DBT and I never found groups helpful so this was all workbooks and readings and modalities from my counselor, done with her or by myself.

Quit alcohol mid 2019. Alcoholism was basically a giant tarp thrown over the BPD and related issues, keeping me or any counselor from getting to the root issues. I certainly *had* BPD before then.

Had a kid mid 2020.

Diagnosed BPD late 2020.

Started barely looking into DBT throughout 2021 while I looked for another counselor (the one that dx me ultimately wasn't a good fit). 

Got another counselor late 2021. Started doing DBT in earnest.

Left my abusive relationship early 2022. Also started reading up about CPTSD and trauma, which was very helpful.

Got a couples counselor to try and work through the abusive relationship in early-mid 2022. Found out quickly that my ex was aggressively against any kind of help and was actively sabotaging my own attempts to get better, practice DBT, etc. Dropped the couples counselor and chose my mental health over a garbage relationship in mid 2022.

Started doing DBT and looking into IFS therapy approaches from mid 2022 onward. Did it like it was my job. Books, workbooks, reminders all over my house, etc. Shit, I still have an emotion wheel on my fridge. This *was* my main hobby for almost a year.

Started a new relationship with an amazingly grounded, patient, understanding person in mid 2023. That turbo-charged everything I'd been working on because I had a supportive partner.

Literally this past Tuesday my counselor said I no longer fit the dx criteria for BPD. My homework for our next session is to decide whether I want to drop to monthly check-ins or quarterly or as-needed, etc.

Dude, when I started, I was seeing my counselor twice a week. The fact that I'm now in a place where it's like ""you got this now; wanna just call me if you have a problem you can't fix yourself?"" is WILD.",Much_Difference,1bv50qp

I'm still stuck on this but I've decided over the next 12 months I'm going to devote my energy to therapy, self care, learning to love myself for just being me rather than filling the void I feel with another attempt at achievements or success, because I know I'll self destruct again if I don't learn to just accept who I am. I think we need to find value in just being, rather than only valuing ourselves for achievement, because that can only last so long.

(I believe there has been research into this too, not quite sure though). Instead of letting my eyes get teary, or expression 'look angry/sad', I simply try to keep it neutral.

Taking a nap, a walk, or exercising between the start of those clearly spiraling thoughts, and acting on them. Or a full night's rest. The number of times that a very angry ""this won't help anyway"" walk followed by a night's sleep have stopped me from \*many\* bad choices.

Consciously thinking about the situation after, and figuring out what thoughts or feelings I ascribed to the situation, that caused the spiral to start (e.g., a partner rejected spending time with me, which brought back memories of parents acting a certain way, etc.) - this helps me set precedents in my head for ""sometimes I act in ways informed by trauma and not grounded in reality"", which has over time started popping up in my thoughts as the spiral starts; over time, I'm sometimes able to anchor myself in that, and examine the spiral a bit as it happens‚Äîand even stop it before it gets worse!

0,"It can be a boundary for you to want them to check in. Sometimes their needs might conflict with yours - that‚Äôs where the relationship-ing comes in, weighing your needs and desires vs. theirs, deciding what really matters to you in the long run, sacrificing some comfort for the sake of the relationship (hopefully on both sides).

My partner is the space-needer, I‚Äôm not. But when he goes away and is doing something that causes me a lot of anxiety - I will tell him ahead of time, and set a boundary: please check in with me at lunch and before dinner, it means a lot to me and will do so much to set me at ease. You don‚Äôt have to explicitly out-loud say: or else!!

But in your mind? Maybe. 

Seriously, is it important to have a partner who can be understanding of what you struggle with and who is willing to meet you halfway? Yes.

In those situations I personally am also giving up a lot of my comfort because I am at home usually going hard on my distress tolerance skills, doing my work to practice emotionally regulating and staying calm. I‚Äôm constantly fighting scary thoughts as they come up, constantly dealing with the trigger over and over, struggling to do work, struggling to stay distracted from the thoughts. The least he can do is make a point to stay in touch with me and be there for me as much as he can while I do my best to give him space.

It‚Äôs ok for you to say: I want a partner who knows what I struggle with and is willing to support me while I get my BPD under control. I need you to check in with me. It‚Äôs also totally valid for you to question if this is the right person for you‚Ä¶.

Also - space after fights is a different beast: It feels like the world is going to end and everything is terrifying so often those of us with BOD crave more connection and lots of reassurance as our fears rear up - but when we put the fear down it slowly loses its power which allows our logical brain to come back online. 

Space helps in these instances even though we crave connection and closeness. It‚Äôs confusing - but the space enables the connection and closeness. Think of it like holding a balloon underwater. If you keep shoving the balloon underwater it keeps popping up more and more. But if you shove it down deeper the air starts to compress and the weight above the balloon increases and the balloon will literally shrink. Eventually you‚Äôll get to a point where you have a withered little balloon under like 50 feet of water - and it‚Äôs much easier to deal with then. It feels like we aren‚Äôt honoring our feelings because we are ‚Äúshoving them down‚Äù. But it‚Äôs not truly shoving it down. If you recognize the fear is there and that it isn‚Äôt helping the situation / you have to ignore it until it deflates a bit and you can handle the situation better.

Does that make sense? An argument on the space side and on the non-space side. There is room in relationships for needing both space and closeness at different times.

Also sorry: one last thing: remember that a boundary-less love is not a healthy one. We don‚Äôt want boundaries, but that doesn‚Äôt mean what we want is healthy or correct. If we are looking for a HEALTHY relationship, then the goal is equal space and connection. If you change you inner goal from: ‚Äúhave the relationship I desire‚Äù, to ‚Äúhave a healthy relationship‚Äù, you may find that your idea of your ideal relationship will change.",Astrnougat,1bd5dm7
1,"I‚Äôm going to think on this more and try to get back to this discussion hopefully after thinking further on this because that‚Äôs a great question and expression/insight; I can definitely relate to it. 

One thing to consider though is that boundaries can be for others, but they‚Äôre also for ourselves. And sometimes that may look like or be ‚Äúboundaries we‚Äôre working on for ourselves that help respect the boundaries for other people‚Äù, but ultimately I think they‚Äôre also beneficial for sufferers of bpd that want to be able to manage their symptoms. Like, I want to not bother people too much via text or other communications (so I don‚Äôt overwhelm them, sure, but more importantly for me so I don‚Äôt lose them through overwhelming them), but I want to talk to them/ connect, so I‚Äôll make sure I‚Äôm cognizant of how often I text a day/week and then set the boundaries for me that way also by leaving things in their hands of replying. It‚Äôs hard but it helps me and them in the end.",the-panda-general,1bd5dm7
2,"it's something I'm struggling with too, I don't have a need for boundaries. but I've been learning recently that boundaries are more about yourself than the other person. so it's more just listening to your body and saying things like ""okay I get anxious needing to hear from them all the time, so my boundary is that I won't check my phone and respond to them the second I get it"" or ""I really want to see them tonight, but it's already very late and I work tomorrow, so my boundary for myself is that I can't see them right now even though I desperately want to, I'm going to take care of myself and go to bed early"". it's extremely hard when you're not in tune to your body and value them over yourself. it caused lots of issues in my last relationship because I'd bend over backwards for him and abandon myself for him, and he never once did the same. but it wasn't because he didn't like me, it was because he valued himself more than me and I didn't. for BPD it can seem like they don't care about you or are being selfish, but it's really just about looking out for yourself and getting yourself in a position where you can have a healthy relationship with them",Individual_Salad587,1bd5dm7
3,"while I agree with your comment, I don't think that falls under boundaries. if you're controlling someone else's behavior (or asking to), that becomes a request. boundaries are solely about yourself, such as ""when you're not being responsive and checking in, then I will have to pull back to self regulate because that makes me anxious"" or something like that. I don't disagree with what you said, I think it's healthy to communicate the expectations and that you'd appreciate it if they could be more responsive, but I'd disagree that it's a boundary",Individual_Salad587,1bd5dm7
0,With my dbt outpatient programme if someone refuses therapy they are discharged as therapy is the main treatment option aside from medication semi-suppressing certain symptoms alongside the therapy. It may be different w others though! I also do uni alongside it and it‚Äôs 2x a week! x,,x3fooa
1,"Think of it this way - how well will you perform at uni if you‚Äôre struggling so much mentally? You‚Äôre more likely to perform poorer than you hope, and probably more likely to drop out. If you have those coping skills in place, you are more likely to succeed and have a better time at uni (both socially and academically).

I did terribly in my A levels, and was also struggling a lot with my mental health at the time. I was diagnosed and then treated when I was about 21. I have no doubt that if I were to do my A levels now, I‚Äôd do much better.

It‚Äôs up to you what you decide is your priority, but I personally have begun to view my life as before- and after- therapy.",tihurricane,x3fooa
2,The choice is yours. It sounds like you don‚Äôt want therapy though. Twice a week therapy is a gift that will benefit the rest of your life.

5,"My personal opinion is that it would be unwise to not accept help that is offered to you.

Im sorry to hear you were taken off your meds, i can imagine that negatively impacting your daily life in a huge way!

I am actively working on a plan to handle these times. I have somewhat of a plan in place so when I‚Äôm too stressed or feel myself going into that space I pull out my plan and talk with my therapist. The periods of recovery range from weeks to years. I had four almost five solid years of ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù then I started law school and it‚Äôs been more up and down. I‚Äôm looking forward to another longer period of recovery.

You could also try talking to AI psychologist about it before it gets to the point you wanna self harm: https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=Hpk0GozjACb3mtHeAaAMb0r9pcJGbzF317I_Ux_ALOA.

There‚Äôs also other feelings like anxiety and depressed thoughts, or unbearable thoughts about the trauma possibly mixed in there with the boredom. I think it‚Äôs the combination of all those really unbalanced thoughts and emotions at the same time that makes the boredom worse cause as soon as we don‚Äôt have something to distract us we focus on how bad we‚Äôre feeling inside.

It sounds like your sister isn't quite there with learning how to rewire her responses; with me, I had to kind of remove myself from my anger and observe it neutrally. Just really sit with that anger but don't react to it. See how long it takes each time and try to go a bit longer for every try. Eventually, someone with impulsive anger issues can slow down their thinking to strategize how to best handle the situation instead of being hostile with a less favourable result.",ScarySuggestions,17dljpo
6,"I completed a DBT program back in March after multiple previous attempts. Like your sister, I became more angry and, for me, more in crisis. I think there could be several reasons for this, but for me, previous attempts at DBT felt very invalidating and accusatory. When I was in full blown crisis, it felt invalidating to have someone just ask me what skills I've used - ""Did you remember to breathe?"" That used to piss me off so much. I can understand and appreciate the question and would be grateful for the reminder today, but early on, it enraged me. It felt like no one wanted to know *why* I was angry. And that hurt, so I quit numerous of times. I continued to work with my trauma therapist in addition to going to DBT and it deepened my understanding of the why behind the skills. Hope this makes sense.",Alainasaurous,17dljpo
7,"I got really mad when I started DBT. Why? Because it's really hard work and it requires self reflection on times when you have struggled with the behaviours that can accompany being unwell.

8,"I have an oddly similar experience to your sister. I was in trauma based therapy and I was doing *really* well. Then that therapy ended and after a few months I finally found a therapist who does one-on-one DBT with me - and I FUCKING HATE IT.

My entire session today was me telling my therapist why I hate DBT (despite the fact that it's working so far). I prefer trauma therapy and IFS (Internal Family Systems) to DBT hands down. Supposedly IFS can be done without a therapist, so I'm considering trying to do that on the side and just show up at the DBT sessions and try not to get angry. lol

I think the reasons for my anger are personal rather than universal. For example, the goddamn worksheets remind me of hospital IOPs that I've had to attend (that made me similarly angry). Or busy work handed out by a substitute teacher in school.

2,"You say you do therapy, is this just talk therapy or is it DBT therapy? Because talk therapy does not work for alot of people with bpd. We need something targeted towards bpd behaviours. I have cptsd as well, so I am currently doing emdr as it is specifically for trauma.

If you aren't already doing DBT see if you can get into it, whether with your therapist or even start looking by yourself, becuase although it is not near a cure, it really does help alot of people.

There is also CBT, which although not always effective on bpd, can help depending on why you are treatment resistant. It may even help change your thoughts around the therapy itself.

I was classified treatment resistant for a long time. It took years of dedicated therapy and several dedicated therapists to get me to the point where I will be discharged at the end of this year once I complete my emdr. It has taken me over 9 years to get to this point., do not give up, you may, like me, need multiple people and have to work on multiple different therapies to get anywhere close to better.

0,"My friend.... it's your therapist. Respectfully, this is their job. They're showing empathy because what you say is important to them, and they're probably glad you're being vulnerable instead of talking about ""normal,"" superficial stuff (which is what I always did- and it's exactly why therapy got me nowhere.)

Don't overthink it, because (with so much love lol) I can tell that you are. Y'all didn't fight, you didn't cross a boundary, you didn't go over session time. You didn't do anything wrong and you have nothing to apologize for. If it's really ruining you, bring it up at the next session and ask if it was okay that you did that. But seriously. There's absolutely no problem here, and trying to make one up is counterproductive to your healing.

I hope this doesn't come off as harsh. I just genuinely don't see why this is a bad thing. You were vulnerable in therapy and your therapist needed a second to process it. That is... totally normal, even for a trained professional.",witchcrows,1bap05u
1,"Your question called to me as I have had a similar experience. I so understand you ! I'll share my way of thinking about my own experience and how it evolved, hoping it helps.

My therapist often ask me for a pause to think, or to breathe, during our sessions. The first time, I thought "" here we go, he's overwhelmed, I said something I shouldn't have and he's gonna ask me to leave"". Actually, he explained to me that he want to make sure he respond in a way that will help me and is therapeutically sound. Also, sometimes, I think he just need a time to manage his own emotions. The stuff I talk about may trigger his own stuff, we don't know the traumas and experiences of our therapists.

I think this is a sign of a serious therapist, who tries to be the best help they can and not be simply in ""reaction mode"". 

As for the ""I'm winning at therapy"" joke and her reaction‚Ä¶ I often joke in tense moments in therapy. A interesting question is ""why"" ? Talking about it, my therapist told me that he's careful to not encourage it, as it divert attention from the unpleasant stuff that caused the tense moment. The unpleasant stuff is where we do work.

So, my message is : there are other, more positive, ways to see what happened. I'm not saying my interpretation is right for your experience, just that your interpretation, which sounds negative, might need to be challenged. The only real way to do that, that I know of, is to talk about it with one's therapist.",Upstairs_Nebula_6345,1bap05u
2,"Absolutely this. I'd like to add extra emphasis on bringing it up, mention how opening up made you feel, and explain you're worried that you overdid it or something. Your therapist will understand your sensitivity and will be able to offer more clarification. Sometimes it just takes a second for someone who hasn't been through your situation to understand it, and that's perfectly okay! Especially on more sensitive topics, they don't want to approach the situation in a way that would make you feel worse. 

Also, you are far from the first person to use humour in an uncomfortable or vulnerable position. You really did nothing wrong here.",espirose,1bap05u
0,"It does. But it takes more than a couple of months of theraphy and two months of ""feeling good"".

I have only recently really feel I'm ok, after two years of no splits or overwhelming negativity feelings.

At first it also felt like all I did was learn to not show it, to ""appear"" normal. To hold back. But with time, I realized that wasn't it. Distress went down. I stopped policing and controlling who was my FP (still in my life, closest to my heart together with my family just not my ""FP"" in the bpd sense anymore)

Not in a romantic relationship by choice but loving myself. Not chronically lonely. Going to work is not the worst mental drag. I can handle stress.

4,"Yes. If you MAKE it better.

It took me a year of DBT, then four months of Schema therapy (because you don't do trauma therapy before you can regulate your shit lol), concurrent with individual therapy. It took actively working the skills especially when it was easy so it'd come more naturally when things were hard. I've learned I can't drink anymore, can't fuck around anymore, and had to clean out a lot of unhealthy people in my life. There are environments I don't spend time in and I figured what works best for me (not for everyone, for me) -- a small, quiet life with few close friends and a family who loves and supports me. I'm connected with my communities, I'm involved with my family. I'm whole.

Am I always happy? No, of course not, because happy is an emotion and emotions are fleeting, but I AM content and that's such a blessing. I'm deeply grateful for the life I have, for everything I have.

Remember that this is about literally changing how your brain works. Changing your behaviour changes your brain but it means that in EVERY instance you have to do the new behaviours, not just when it's easy or suits you. This isn't about tolerating distress because all of life is about tolerating distress, it's about doing it effectively without hurting yourself OR other people. 

Life is hard and it'll never stop being hard. It's hard for everyone (not that that helps lol), and we have a little extra difficulty sprinkled in because of our big feelings and poor interpersonal skills, regulation skills, and self-soothing skills...but things got easier to manage once I figured out how to utilise those skills.",elegant_pun,1b9yxxt

38,"DSM-V criteria for OCD; THEN BPD
Specific Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Criteria

The physician or mental health professional will determine whether you meet the specific obsessive-compulsive disorder criteria listed in the DSM-5, during the psychological evaluation portion of your visit. Your symptoms must meet both the general and specific characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

To receive an OCD diagnosis, you must meet these general criteria:

You must have¬†obsessions and compulsions
The obsessions and compulsions must significantly impact your daily life
You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable

Your obsessions must meet specific criteria:

Intrusive, repetitive and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that cause distress
The thoughts do not just excessively focus on real problems in your life
You unsuccessfully try to suppress or ignore the disturbing thoughts, urges, or images
You may or may not know that your mind simply generates these thoughts and that they do not pose a true threat

Your compulsions must meet specific criteria:

Excessive and repetitive ritualistic behavior that you feel you must perform, or something bad will happen. Examples include hand washing, counting, silent mental rituals, checking door locks, etc.
The ritualistic compulsions take up a least one hour or more per day
You perform these physical rituals or mental acts to reduce the severe anxiety caused by the obsessive thoughts.





The Borderline pattern specifier may be applied to individuals whose pattern of personality disturbance is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:

Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.
A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, which may be characterized by vacillations between idealization and devaluation, typically associated with both strong desire for and fear of closeness and intimacy.
Identity disturbance, manifested in markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.
A tendency to act rashly in states of high negative affect, leading to potentially self-damaging behaviours (e.g., risky sexual behaviour, reckless driving, excessive alcohol or substance use, binge eating).
Recurrent episodes of self-harm (e.g., suicide attempts or gestures, self-mutilation).
Emotional instability due to marked reactivity of mood. Fluctuations of mood may be triggered either internally (e.g., by one‚Äôs own thoughts) or by external events. As a consequence, the individual experiences intense dysphoric mood states, which typically last for a few hours but may last for up to several days.
Chronic feelings of emptiness.
Inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger manifested in frequent displays of temper (e.g., yelling or screaming, throwing or breaking things, getting into physical fights).
Transient dissociative symptoms or psychotic-like features (e.g., brief hallucinations, paranoia) in situations of high affective arousal.

Other manifestations of Borderline pattern, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following:

A view of the self as inadequate, bad, guilty, disgusting, and contemptible.
An experience of the self as profoundly different and isolated from other people; a painful sense of alienation and pervasive loneliness.
Proneness to rejection hypersensitivity; problems in establishing and maintaining consistent and appropriate levels of trust in interpersonal relationships; frequent misinterpretation of social signals",Born-Value-779,1b9yxxt

0,"You are not your BPD. Hear that loud and clear; your personality disorder (keyword personality) and you are completely separate entities. Your BPD is a complex network of trauma responses, high emotions, and the resulting defense mechanisms (eg. biting, in your case) are the result of trauma. Remember that this is not your fault. Remember that there's a glimmer of you in there, even when it feels like your BPD is completely out of control. You're still there, and you are a good person.

You're in therapy, so there's a good chance that you want help, and that you've dedicated significant time to it. I'm not dissing people with Narcissistic PD here, but how many narcissists do you think actually go to therapy?

Also, I see you say ""I thought I'd change."" Were you... making any changes yourself? I mean this as nicely as possible, because it comes from a place of relatability. I had this notion that, to recover, I didn't need to actively ""do"" anything- just go to therapy, and that was that. I'm ""better,"" and everyone's happy, right? Not really. You need to put your individual effort in, too. You need to take what you talk about in therapy and apply it to situations like this, whether that's in the moment or afterward. I'm saying ""need"" because you seem to want to recover, really bad. But it's not something you ""need"" to do- it's being respectful to yourself and your loved ones.

Has your therapist given you any ideas on how to handle yourself when you're triggered? Have you considered getting up and leaving the room (just an example, not saying it'll work for you) to calm down before you cause harm to somebody else? Reminder, it's totally okay if you haven't considered these things!!! We need plenty of reminders about our coping skills before we actually use them. I'm struggling with the same thing- I'm still learning how to regulate myself before I explode. My friends often need to tell me to calm down, and it's only then I even realize I was getting worked up.

We aren't bad people for struggling. We aren't bad people for hurting others. Bad behavior DOES NOT always make a bad person. Hurt people hurt people. What matters is that you're attempting to break the cycle, instead of hating yourself for being stuck in it.",witchcrows,1c0y9io

Is your therapy DBT? If not, here's a brief summary - It is actually originally designed BY a person with BPD, FOR people with BPD. It gives you great ammo on how to deal with your emotions at different levels of intensity.

I'd get started here:
https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/

It's a free online course of DBT. There are plenty of work books available online that you can also use simultaneously to practise (recommended). The point in DBT is that the skills that it teaches you need to be actually practised over and over again until they become a habit. Like YEARS. It's a long process to replace all those unhealthy coping mechanisms and bad reactions. But it IS possible.

Find which skills work on YOU, which help YOU. Not everything will work on everyone. Find out ways to help yourself and practise them over - and over - and over.",Melthiela,1c0y9io

Beat the shit out of a pillow, clean furiously, even run laps around your house/apartment/whatever living situation you're in. Temperature can also shock me back to baseline- I love grabbing an ice cube and rubbing it on the back of my neck or throat. Even strong flavors can help, like eating a really sour candy or a spoonful of hot sauce.

It sounds a little insane LMAO, but forcing my body to experience overwhelming, and sometimes mildly unpleasant, sensations takes my brain out of the rumination stage, because my brain has that animal instinct to take care of something that makes me physically uncomfortable. ""Oh wow, this is really sour and painful, ouch, let me try to finish this candy before it destroys my mouth.... what was I so upset about ten minutes ago?"" It's not always magic, but for me personally, it's pretty foolproof. Plus, this is something that can be collaborative! Your friends or partner could start carrying around a little packet of sour candy, and if they notice you're getting really upset, you ask for it or they offer it to you. That way, it also takes off some of the burden of having to ask for help, which is something I struggle with.",witchcrows,1c0y9io

You have to accept the consequences of your actions. 

It seems like you‚Äôve edited your post, because you‚Äôd previously said you‚Äôve hit people, etc. 

Instead of saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything except X‚Äù, own up to it. ‚ÄúI did this thing and that was wrong of me‚Äù. 

If you‚Äôre worried about how people feel about you or burning bridges, talk to them, apologize, take accountability. 

‚ÄúHey X, I know that I did this, I‚Äôm sorry, and you didn‚Äôt deserve that. I know I was upset but I had no right to do that.‚Äù

The important thing is to not expect them to accept your apology‚Äîapologize because you mean it, because you value that person and their feelings. Let them make the decision. 

Learn from your actions. Therapy will help, it‚Äôs helped me be more mindful of others but as well as myself. 

Learn new coping skills, there are plenty of DBT workbooks, mindfulness exercises, etc.

You have to stop making excuses for yourself and your abusive actions. 

Bpd is an explanation, not an excuse.

And please do not take this as attacking you; I‚Äôm not. But sometimes things don‚Äôt need to be sugarcoated; they shouldn‚Äôt. Your actions are harmful to others, and yourself. Look at how they make you feel after the fact.

You have done SO much work, please don‚Äôt waste it. 37 is still so young and you have so much life ahead of you. 

Reading this gives me hope for my exwBPD that someday he will be as strong as you to start fighting to get better. Please keep fighting, you‚Äôre so much stronger than so many others that haven‚Äôt made it as far as you.",Ladylillyx,11sl4ez

2,"Hey buddy. So sorry to hear you feel like this, no one deserves to feel like that. Life is however unfair, and we must make the best of it. When you get kicked down, you get back up. Not for anyone else, but for you. For the 10 year old version of you. For the ambitious 20 or 30 year old version of you. Keep chasing your best life, your happiness, your tranquility. I know it is so damn difficult, but the fight makes it worthwile. Enjoy the process, rather than the outcome. 

What's there to fight for, you ask? What's there to hope for? That's something you'll have to discover. Go on that journey - leave behind all the social conditioning that shapes us and look for your own happiness. There isn't just one way to happiness - there's infinite. We only live once and you cannot waste it. You being alive is a blessing, even if it may be full of pain right now.

I'd recommend focusing on finding your purpose, first. Are you on this planet merely to have a career? To have a job? Is that it? Aim bigger. Chase something that will leave a positive mark on other people. Something that will impact their lives - other people's happiness that you can be responsible for. It can be as small as a community or a neighborhood, but it will be rewarding. Be the best friend you can be. Be the best stranger you can be. It will fill you up with purpose. How about helping animals? Not everyone is destined to have a kid of their own. I can understand how horrible it must be to no longer be fertile - but you can still care for a life, regardless. Rescue and nurture a pet, maybe. And be the best pet owner you can be. I am only spitballing here, but I sincerely hope that you get the point I am trying to get across.

You are resilient and you are a fighter. Don't let that negative voice in your head convince you otherwise. Think back to the years of no symptoms and how wonderful that felt. Please don't give up! I am here for you to lend an ear, if you want to talk. If you want to vent. If you want encouragement. Please don't hesitate to get in touch. I know you'll come out on the other side stronger than ever before. Stay safe friendü§é",ditograss,11sl4ez

5,"I appreciate your kind words, truly. ü§é I've gone through several tough-to-overcome existential crisis, and I know how lost you can feel when the whole world comes crashing down and people around you cannot even relate. So I can empathize and understand how alone and isolating it can feel. Our brain likes to play tricks on us sometimes, and because life is so complex - we cannot ever fully understand it. 

I read somewhere that our brain is not us talking, but rather someone else talking constantly and us listening. That's so true if you think about it - our perception of reality is shaped by what we learn, or pick up on, on a daily basis, all throughout our lives. It's tough to break out of it but it is certainly possible.

I am so glad you have a purpose. Even if everything else goes to shit - you'll have that to keep you going! :) In terms of being afraid - I've found that fear can be useful if utilised correctly. To help us plan things, prepare things in order and avoid any wrong turns. But it cannot act as an obstacle. Please do not let that hold you back!

0,"From what I've read, she's just trying to have a normal friendship, a close one for sure, to be able to laugh about the past and share those things. It doesn't give the vibe of just using you as a stepping stone, given you went 2 years no contact too.

All your feelings are valid tho, and if that triggers you, well, it does. And given you have a normal friendship now, I guess you should tell her that's a boundary for you.

You seem content to talk to her everyday and all, just not the jokes about relationships? And the fact that you could ""see"" her getting into other relationships and ""possibly"" ruining it? I mean you said yourself she's been in therapy and you're able to have a friendship due to that. Maybe she won't ruin anything just...have another relationship (and that doesn't mean she'll replace you as a friend either) That's why I wonder if you maybe still have romantic feelings for her and that's why it triggers you so much?",Aureolindaisy,123z3y4
1,"If it were me, I'd know I should stop talking to her...but I probably wouldn't because attention is being paid to me.

That being said, if it causes you that much stress and is messing with your stability, end the relationship.",blackest_francis,123z3y4
2,"Yes I think I have some sort of feelings for her still. I don‚Äôt get into many relationships and I only do when someone is very significant to me.  She‚Äôs the only woman I ever wanted to spend my life with. And for the past 2 years I had to realize we were over and that wasn‚Äôt happening. Now, here she is.  

That‚Äôs not to say I have an agenda with her. I‚Äôm getting to know her again, and I just want authenticity. If that means she‚Äôs with someone else eventually, then so be it. I want whatever is authentic and real.  

But when we talk as much as we do, it‚Äôs difficult to not feel close. For instance, our day begins with her messaging me good morning. Then we talk all day, like sharing what we‚Äôre doing, laughing at things, and having a game going together on our phones.  I‚Äôd say we talk about 30 hours a week. So, given the way we vibe and connect, it‚Äôs not unusual that I‚Äôm beginning to become attached 

But the reality is we have a history and ya I guess I don‚Äôt want to sit here and learn about her New Romantic endeavors as much as I want to be a good friend, that‚Äôs hurtful.  And there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd be able to continue talking to her this much if (a) she got into a new relationship or (b) I got into one.   

So I feel like I need to stop talking to her because I don‚Äôt want to get hurt.  But at the same time I‚Äôm not expecting anything.  If that makes sense. Both things are true at the same time. 

I‚Äôve never felt the way for anyone as I did for her.  And the chance of seeing her again, someone I valued so much‚Ä¶ on one hand sounds like something I want to do. But I feel I‚Äôm just opening myself up for hurt because if our connection is still there, which it is so far, it will likely cause me to have feelings for her after I meet her.  Then it will be me having to mourn and let her go again, when I already did that 2 years ago

I never forgot her. I had to learn to get used to life without her and it wasn‚Äôt easy. Why would I put myself through that again?  But then part of me feels like running away is the wrong thing to do as well.

I‚Äôm so exhausted trying to navigate human emotions and relationships. I‚Äôve put in so much work in therapy yet I‚Äôm sitting here feeling sick and wanting to just run away from everything.",minimalistdesign,123z3y4
3,"Then that's another thing, entirely.

I mean, she clearly wants you close, I can't say about her feelings but she is sharing a big chunk of her time with you. And... she has bpd. Doubt she'll be risking the emotional damage for a stepping stone. Don't wanna lead anyone on, because I don't have universal knowledge, but does she ask you about relationships as well? Maybe those memes are either just memes or a ""what do you think"".  


So my advise, would be basically sitting down and talking to her. If you can in person, because body language helps. Running away will only lead to ""what if"" in your brain, given that you talk so intensely about her. What if it could've worked this time, what if she felt the same and I didn't do anything even tho we're both better now. And if you're considering runaway, then you shouldn't be afraid of the ""possible"" negative outcome right? And about ""going through that again"" will happen now either if she ends up in another relationship or you leave now. You're already sharing those hours of your life. You're going to suffer and miss it all the same so... just give it a shot? It could be a yes.",Aureolindaisy,123z3y4
4,"Thank you for taking the time to respond in a rational manner which looked at potential outcomes and flaws in my thinking 

I now realize I was having an episode. I should know now the feelings of intense running is a signal to me not to trust my feelings in that moment or to engage with people.  I think posting here to reality check was a good safe call 

But you‚Äôre right, if I shut down and run away it‚Äôs the same outcome.  I‚Äôve convinced myself it‚Äôs just a safer one.  But really, it‚Äôs the same.  And my therapist has told me I make up stories then run away from them and then spend my life down a rabbit hole of ‚Äúwhat if,‚Äù and she tells me I need to face reality and accept it.  Maybe this is an opportunity for me to practice these new tools. 

As for my ex, no she doesn‚Äôt ask about my relationship status, I think she knows just by the fact we‚Äôre talking this much. She just tells me she‚Äôs single but we haven‚Äôt went more in-depth than that.   She‚Äôs told me she missed our connection, and mentioned a list of things, including my laugh and voice.  That didn‚Äôt seem completely platonic to me.  

I told her I miss all of those things about her too, because it‚Äôs true, but I guess it all just freaked me out because of what happened last time.

I am going through something similar my my ex where he saw that side of me and stuck by for afew months after I apologised profoundly and promised to do therapy that helped me alot especially DBT and journaling like writting down all my horrible thoughts when splitting from him and the pain confusion and all on paper then burn it. He also has quiet BPD and we love each other alot but its too painful to be in a romantic relationship where we just trigger each other and bring out the worst. Romantic relationship I believe for me is a safe haven a refuge from life and support one another but it must be both sides to work. Unfortunately my partner saw me as overwhelming and such a burden when I just wanted love and to be close by him body mind and spirit he felt too overwhelmed and split from me. Which tbh was very cruel and hurtful from him especially when I had been making huge improvements in terms of emotional regulation and no panic attacks for months. Instead of celebrating this he threw it all in my face. 
Thinking back it would‚Äôve been better if he let me down gently in the beginning before leading me on into a committed partnership and making me believe his intentions and love is strong to hold both of us. 
Heck we even agreed to do couples therapy if he had a splitting episode. Alas that was just talk and he broke that promise. 
He decided that we need to put our romantic relationship on hold till we do healing work whatever that looks like for him I have no idea. 
I finally realised through doing the work of DBT and CBT that the only thing I can control is my own behaviour, my attitude and reactions. Even my thoughts I started to be able to observe them and release them saying to them that is not helpful (insert your name) that thought is ruining the day for you choose another thought a more pleasant one. This realisation came shocking to me like a light bulb suddenly lit up I don‚Äôt know if it was the CBT+DBT+ voice recordings where I would imagine the person who angered me sitting infront of me and I‚Äôm offloading venting ranting a method from Psychotherapy or journaling. But all I can say is that it works as 
I switched from controlling behaviour towards my favourite person to a more accepting and control my own self instead. 

My therapist advised me not to disclose mental health personal sensitive info early on till I can see clear signs of trust, which she says takes around 200hours of interaction with someone to really know them well enough.

1,"I find that no matter how stable I am, a super low dose of seroquel makes such a difference to everything.

2,It‚Äôs funny how unique we all are. I had to come off of seroquel because it was depressing me... I was like a zombie,,nty430
3,I'm also in the process of coming off seroquel due to a serious health issue. Down from 525 in January to 250 now. I found that reducing by 25mg every 2 weeks lessened the impact of reduction and withdrawal. How quickly have you come off and was it from a high dose? It takes a while for the brain to adjust sadly. When I tried to reduce by 75mg at once I felt like I was coming off hard drugs. How long have you been off them? Maybe an alternative is possible?,Danidinger,nty430

6,Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt start to impact me until 150.,hopeful-pessimist13,nty430
7,It takes me usually two weeks to phase out of that. At first it‚Äôs almost like I can‚Äôt wake up in the mornings. And it‚Äôs like that whenever I got an increase in dose as well. Once that adjustment was over it was like the only thing that controlled my extreme highs and lows that happens throughout the day. Intermittent bursts of anger being the biggest thing it zapped.,hopeful-pessimist13,nty430
8,"We did 50mg at a time until I was at 50, then did 25 for five days. But I could already feel the negatives at 50 mg. I wanted to give myself more time to adjust in theory, but within days of being completely off the medication my sugars dropped into the 100‚Äôs and have stayed there (we couldn‚Äôt bring them out of the 300‚Äôs). 

I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve tried *all* the alternatives, but it certainly feels like it. Seroquel was the hesitant choice anyway because I‚Äôm just someone that balloons up on it and that‚Äôs mostly all without dietary change, since it‚Äôs metabolic altering. It‚Äôs not about the vanity, if it was just losing out on the beach body of my dreams I‚Äôd take mental health in a second. Unfortunately I‚Äôm in a dangerous zone with weight. Uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, fatty liver. 

I know normal is all relative but I just hope to have some semblance of it again. I was really beginning to think age and therapy were crucial to my recovery. Feels like I‚Äôm picking up all the pieces again and I just don‚Äôt want to destroy anything in the process.",hopeful-pessimist13,nty430

I'm proud of you trying to do what's best for your overall health even if it's not an easy choice at all! this wont undo all your progress even if it feels like it is.

I‚Äôm only off of it for two weeks now, but instead of feeling like I‚Äôm making progress my mental health seems to be getting worse daily. But I‚Äôm trying to believe that it just takes time and two weeks isn‚Äôt long at all. I know how difficult relationships can be for those of us with borderline and it‚Äôs been profoundly impacting my emotionally state with my partner. He‚Äôs understanding but also I think doesn‚Äôt really like me coming off the medication. He knows why and gets it, but I totally understand why it‚Äôs literally like being with a different person right now. I feel bad for him and me. 

Thanks for understanding! Have you found any methods to help being off the medication?",hopeful-pessimist13,nty430
15,Your reason why you had to come off of Seroquel is the exact reason why I came off of it last month. My resting rate was super high and it was causing heart palpitations.,gooseglug,nty430
16,"It is apparnrlty known to have impact on the heart but it seems to be somewhat ignored until its serious enough! I found that if I didn't eat with it at night it would shoot up so I've managed to settle it by eating beforehand until this year when I got rushed to hospital! I've not yet had confirmation it's the medication but the episodes only happened within 2 hours of taking seroquel (once even eating a bunch of chocolate after taking it resulted in a hospital trip in an ambulance) I eat chocolate in the day fine but not within an hour of taking seroquel.

I imagine that's so tough! I'm sadly still on 250mg for now so my side effects have just been me being more emotional to situations I dread the lower doses. I only have learnt coping skills for when I have dissociation episodes which is to use comforting scents to ground me and therapy putty. I've also learnt the importance of a ""break"" to process my emotions when conflict arises or I get an overwhelming emotion. My partner also struggles with knowing how to support the mood changes when it comes to adjusting to lower doses so far. I try my best to explain it when I'm in a calmer state but it's not always easy is it? :( 2 weeks feels like a lifetime right now I'm sure!

It was only when I increased my dose and it caused an episode similar to something like svt that I became aware of what had been happening for years. I've had to slowly taper off it and it seems to be slowly improving but after 2 hospitalisation nobody has linked it to my seroquel it's me who's basically raised the issue!,Danidinger,nty430

5,"As the longtime partner of someone with BPD, and I am their FP as well. I can recognize a couple things here.  You should also be proud about how maturely you are able to express things here.  The dialectic between your emotional side and wise mind side is exceptionally well stated.  Great job.

First, while it can be frustrating, sometimes my partner needs to ask things of me that are a result of their BPD.  The reality of BPD is that it will be most significant and present in a relationship like this.  So giving your partner room to support you matters now and will in the future.  I'd share what's going on in a way you would feel comfortable with, while also ensuring:

1. You clearly express that the logical side of your brain understands these things are normal, and that you are glad he spends time with friends and know that growing into a more mature phase of the relationship is normal and positive. 

2. You explain that the emotional side of your brain is very reactive to these situations because of BPD. 

3. You help draw the line for your partner that you know it is up to you to manage those symptoms (i.e. it's not his responsibility to).  However as part of that, he can help by [very clear list of OPTIONS].

4. You express that you do not want him to feel obligated to do those things if they are not genuine.

5. You let them know that [list possible behaviors] may occur, and if they do, it's ok to say something about it in the moment, and you apologize in advance.

I'd think carefully on the list of things you provide him, to ensure they are items that will legitimately help with your triggers, and aren't trying to ask him to take responsibility for your emotions.  When talking about your possible behaviors, I'd also emphasize that they are not aligned with an integrated (wise mind) sense of how you feel, instead they are about emotional in-the-moment reactions that can be difficult for you to control due to BPD.  They are extremely valid feelings, but that doesn't mean the reactions to those feelings make sense in the present.  When my partner is in ""reactive"" mode instead of responding, their reactions are more often about their past than they are about their current reality.  While it is unfortunate, BPD is ultimately part of your relationship, and these symptoms are realities.  Address them as such instead of avoiding it.

As a long time partner in a relationship that has poly elements to it, I know it is tough for my loved one.  I've had to come to very difficult learnings on my own about their BPD and how I need to manage myself.  While I'd love to ""fix"" these kinds of feelings for my partner, I cannot.  I have to be VERY careful to ask what I can do to help them, but also ensure those actions are genuine coming from me.  

I'm sharing this because it's crucial your partner put their honest and genuine needs first, even if they may trigger you.  If they do not, resentment may fester.  I know BPD is part of my partner that they are doing their best to work on.  I give space for episodes of difficulty when they occur, but I also have to ensure that my needs are met and to make them aware of the impact episodes can have.

It takes a lot of emotional intelligence and very strong communication skills on my part to navigate those things (nonviolent communication guidelines can help).  My partner's BPD will always be a component of my relationship with them. I cannot fix that, I can only respond well when it happens and not take things overly personally.  One of the things I do on my end is recognize that BPD is mercurial. So I keep my expectations low when I can.  When I can't, I am sure that I'm clear about my needs.  I'm a very steady person emotionally, and that helps stabilize my partner.

If you have questions on how certain things feel from the side of the partner, feel free to ask.

Lastly, for you, I can speak to what I notice helps my partner in these situations.  When they are able to sit with their emotions and triggers while in a mindful state, they are FAR more effective at communicating their needs to me.  While they can sometimes ask for more than is reasonable (and I must be honest when I start to feel ""obligation,"" instead of genuine willingness), the clearer communication often helps me offer up solutions that do work for me.


They are also helped by DBT skills when they can engage with them. Because I have a genuine interest, I can direct them to skills that may help.  However I cannot force them to use the skills.  It has to be their choice.  It really helps when they are able to make that choice.

Lastly, it's my belief that these abandonment feelings and BPD in general are about past trauma.  I have noticed my partner does well when they recognizes there are differences between their traumatic past and our present relationship.  Sitting with the past fears helps them learn what their body does when action urges start. They have seen success with the three step process of 

1. learning what  sensations occur in their body, when they are prone to reacting in a heightened state. E.g. chest feels tight here, shoulders do this, throat feels like this

2. Recognizing those embodied sensations when they occur

3. Reminding themselves that the past situations that triggered them aren't occurring, these are different things, and they get to choose how to navigate them

BPD is a member of our relationship.  There is no changing that.  But we both know it and understand it, allowing us to face it together.  With knowledge, care, and GENUINE actions, we can help each other when BPD stuff hits them and me hard.  

I can't ""own"" fault for their feelings, even though sometimes I accidentally start to try to.  What I can own is doing things they ask for when I can, and also also always ensuring I'm genuine so there is no resentment.  For me, having hard conversations up front or early is important.  I also have to put myself first when I feel I need to even when I know it may hurt my partner.  It's rarely about them, even though it can feel that way to them.

The reality is that the relationship may end.  Or you may explode.  Or sixty other different things that are BPD or not BPD related might occur.  The only thing you can do is to do your best with where you are at on your journey to wellness.  Your partner isn't everything, even when your feelings tell you they are.  

I also strongly recommend getting into therapy for you.  DBT is the gold standard for BPD.  

Wishing you the best.  I'm sorry it's hard.",advicethrows,yrt0cz
6,"I wholeheartedly agree- I know the honeymoon stage doesn't last forever I just don't want to demand too much of him (as I have no idea of what is too much) the thing is, he's SO busy. He works nights in the week so he only has the weekend to see everyone who's important to him. There's also the matter of when it's a good time to broach the topic as I don't want to freak him out by making it seem really serious but at the same time I'm often guilty of downplaying my needs and feelings to accommodate those of others... (It's important to me that I mention now that I hugely appreciate that he makes time for me amongst all of those people). I'm worried if I ask for more of him it'll be too much if that makes sense? Another concern I have is that he doesn't seem bothered- he's taken the transition like am absolute champ and I'm utterly floundering. 

I'll take your advice on the planning actual dates with him, we have definitely lost the spontaneity of our connection which is almost certainly impacting how I feel.

11,"The last couple of weeks his schedule has gotten busier but that was because he was dedicating most of his time to me and work. He only saw his friends during his annual leave (when I nearly lived at his place for two weeks anyways). In the interim his friends have gone back to uni and he's having to travel further to visit him so the change is schedule while very real is also very 'justifiable'. Even if it wasn't the case that his friends had dispersed a bit I'd understand the urge to spend more time with them when that initial phase of the relationship came to a very natural end. While it hurts and my BPD is horrified there is a small speck of logic that can see that this is a normal transition in a relationship. 

In terms of the 'little things' it was more that he'd call me when he was driving for work (he works nights) and he'd compliment/validate me a lot more frequently than he does now (telling me I'm beautiful and that he's proud of me etc). He'd also do things like hold the car door open for me and point out if my shoe laces were united or there were other general trip hazards. If I had to jump off of anything or step over something big he'd hold my hand (or just hold my hand in general) all of which hasn't happened in a couple of weeks. 

It's important to note that he's also having a really hard time with work at the moment and he's under a lot of pressure leaving him with significantly less energy for sentiment. This doesn't mean he doesn't show me affection at all (he consistently tells me he loves me and we spend a lot of time being close and cuddling etc) I'm just so highly aware of any slight change that I spiral into self doubt and panic. 

Something happened this evening which triggered me which prompted me to write this post and I'm sort of swinging between BPD and logic at the moment and I'm just seeking clarity and advice if that makes sense- I just need to ground and stabilise and develop a plan for how I'm going to manage this within myself.

12,"Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read my post and then write such a detailed response. It means a great deal to me and your thoughts on this matter are extremely valuable to me. 

One of the things that struck me the most was your honest but respectful feelings around 'asking too much'. It's something I consistently fear doing as before I'd reached this point in my self reflection I've done this to previous partners and friends and it has ended just as you have said; with resentment. I'll take your advice on board regarding expressing my feelings in their most true form, as feelings and not a manifestation of the reality of the situation. I'll also put some thought into what my partner could do to support me whilst still meeting all of his own needs. I strongly believe that in order for a relationship to be functional all individuals need to prioritise their own needs as caring for others is nigh on impossible if you are not caring for yourself. 

Another thing that struck me was your mention of poly elements to your relationship. My partner and I also engage in a level of polyamory and while I struggle with it often it's one of my favourite things about our relationship. If you're willing I'd love some more information on how you and your partner navigate this? I do understand though that it is a highly personal part of your relationship with your partner and I wholeheartedly understand if you wish to keep this private. 

I very much agree that the abandonment issues I have are the result of things in my past. I know where the root is and I know it's not my partner's doing. one of the biggest current issues I have regarding those struggles is that I often make the mistake of assuming that everyone thinks like I do- despite my worldview and thoughts being fairly abnormal. I see certain things as a sign of abandonment not only because they are things I've seen in the past in far less healthy relationships but also because there are behaviours I exhibit when I am splitting or having urges to push people away in the interest of protecting myself. 

In therms of therapy I'm really hoping to get DBT eventually but the service I'm using right now offers interpersonal psychotherapy as it's closest option and I think it will be a good way to bridge the gap before I eventually reach the top of the list for DBT. 

Thank you again for taking the time to respond to me with such detail and respect. Your honesty is something I value very highly and I'd just like to say that I wish you and your partner every happiness your relationship could grant you. From what you've said, your relationship is almost exactly what I seek to forge within my own.

15,"I recently went through something similar so I will speak from my experience. I have been in a relationship for a little over 4 years. I would say that in the last 2, I‚Äôve done a lot of black and white thinking for the similar reasons you mentioned. He‚Äôs been a lot busier since he switched jobs and he‚Äôs very close to his family which are nice qualities right? Hard working and family oriented. It‚Äôs all great until there‚Äôs no time for me. We‚Äôre in a long distance relationship so those ‚Äúlittle‚Äù things are definitely much needed. Even if it‚Äôs something as silly as adding a an excessive amount of heart emojis like in the past. 
I had mentioned how this bothered me before and how it makes me think he loves me less, and he‚Äôd agreed he‚Äôs been more busy and stressed, but things never really changed much until I split really bad and blocked him. I told him we need to take few days to NOT talk for a while until he sees if he has time for me and is willing to learn to balance things. I was sick of feeling like a burden so I thought this break would help him see if he can make it possible despite his responsibilities while also giving me time to think rationally before I say something disrespectful. He never invalidated my feelings and promised to work on it better. It‚Äôs been a few weeks and he really has made an effort.
I‚Äôm definitely not encouraging you to block him by any means but I think the key here is communication. Mention everything you said here, you understand his need to spend time with friends BUT you feel he hasn‚Äôt put as much effort and you‚Äôd appreciate if he would be able to give you what he did before. Just because we have BPD does not mean that all of our feelings are invalid or always irrational. I think that you recognizing that he has other things going on and you don‚Äôt necessarily want to pull him away from that says a lot about your ability to see things as a whole and you‚Äôre not being selfish about it. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre asking for too much, just a little more effort like he gave before. I too, tend to chase the honeymoon phases. It‚Äôs like that rush of excitement that is so addicting. IMO just because that phase is over, it isn‚Äôt an excuse for people to get ‚Äúlazy‚Äù in relationships, not saying thats the case here but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting a little bit of reassurance and some balance. 
If communicating with him respectfully doesn‚Äôt help or  he gets offended by your needs, you don‚Äôt need to settle for less. I know we often tend to distort realities but sometimes things actually are what they seem and it‚Äôs not just us ‚Äúbeing crazy‚Äù.
I hope this gave some decently helpful insight. I wish you the best.üíõ",Fantastic-Evidence75,yrt0cz

So there is a piece that is your responsibility, and a piece that isn't.  Your responsibility is asking what you need, full stop.  Sometimes that **is** more than reasonable.  Your partner is responsible for figuring out what they can give.  You can be responsible for telling your partner to be real about what they can do.  And for holding up your end of the bargain when your partner says no.  This is trust, on both ends. 

You: my partner will tell me what they can and can't do.  My partner will do well enough to figure that out for themselves.  

Partner: they will accept what I can and what I can't do when I share it.  They will support me and accept my limitations even if they do not like them.

Importantly, even as a neurotypical, well-regulated partner, this is HARD.  I have had some codependency flavored speed bumps in my past. I have worked on those things, and watch them, warily.  Not everyone knows how to do work like that, or has had the opportunity, or (frankly) cares to.   Support each other in that work and ask if it's hard for your partner to say no.  Share your understanding, and also your wise mind's desire that they be careful with responsibilities they accept.  Share why.  Then when they say no they know their honesty is helping you and them.  When they are careful they know they are doing what they want for both of you.

>If you're willing I'd love some more information on how you and your partner navigate this?

It isn't your typical poly relationship, and I'm well aware that it's pretty weird to put typical and poly in the same sentence.  But we're pretty out there.  I'll send you a direct message with the portion I don't want to share on this account.  From a partnership perspective, the requirements for new partners are testing based, and we're both free to seek whatever we want.  I support them in finding partners who seem emotionally good for him, as opposed to toxic.  I make him aware of possible interest in new partners for me early.  

I also ensure I remind them that regardless of what happens in our relationship (and it is expected to evolve and change for both of us through our lives), my love doesn't (and never will) go away, nor will my willingness to be present in their life (in a healthy way).  That particular thing is specific to me.  Most other people aren't like that, and cannot make that statement honestly.  I'm an odd one in that respect.  I guess I'm just built weird, since very few seem to share the way I look at love.

>I know where the root is and I know it's not my partner's doing. 

Good.  Focus on that.  One recent success we've had that helped is that three step process.  It did not relate directly to the abandonment issues in that instance (and that is like **the core** BPD thing), but it was significant.  

1. Recognize those feelings in your body when the abandonment fears come up.  Learn them so you can use that information, and figure out what your body is reacting to (when it comes to trauma, the body keeps the score, and it's rarely reacting to the present, it's remembering the past).  

2. That is your trigger to be mindful.  

3. Recognize what those fears felt like when they got built and why.  Show yourself the difference.  Your body can understand that if you do it skillfully, and it will amp down so your mind can too.

""The body keeps the score"" is great reading on trauma.  It also can help you learn the fundamental thing: your body is reacting to emotions and stimuli before they get to your brain. Your brain gets the reaction from the body first, and then gets the understanding of what happened.  Order matters though: if your body is freaking the fuck out first, your mind will have a ha re d time sorting through the understanding so it impairs function.  The process above gives you space before you just take the body at face value.  

Also, EMDR is frickin brain magic for trauma and PTSD/CPTSD.  So explore that modality as appropriate.  It's so fucking interesting with major evidence based stuff around it despite the strangeness of the whole deal.


>one of the biggest current issues I have regarding those struggles is that I often make the mistake of assuming that everyone thinks like I do- despite my worldview and thoughts being fairly abnormal.

Yeah.  It's hard to catch that.  Personally, I find exploring the vast differences between cultures helps me understand how widely varying the human experience really is.  I also am a fan of firefly, and when I'm particularly confused as to why people think the way they do, I think of Wash, ""Some people juggle geese!"". Reminds me.

If that doesn't click, well, think of the differences you do see between people and how they experience the world.  Find those that you respect but contrast with your version the most.  It will provide appreciation for how differently we all perceive things, and how differently we experience the world.

One funny example of that is the internal monologue thing.  I don't have one.  Some people do.  Both groups are like ""how the hell do you even like... Exist?!?! When considering the other.

Lastly, your partner is your best resource for how they view the world.  You can ask to learn from them, and start to understand what they see.  It mm ight act as a foil to some of what you tend to assume.

World's a big place.  We're all weird in our own ways.  Some people show love by calling each other pieces of shit, some people do it by bickering constantly, some do it as pda, some hate pda.  World's a funky ass place.  I am certain if you have BPD, you have an appreciation for the wide array of quirky ways people do their people-ing.  One of the pretty things about the PD.  Use it :)

Edit:I'm noticing a level of discomfort with the idea that you're supposed to lay all the needs out for your partner.  It's accurate though, but there is a subtlety I'm missing.  I'm not sure what it is at the moment.  It's like... You have to lay out what they CAN support, maybe? Idk.  Sorry, haven't thought that one all the way through yet.",advicethrows,yrt0cz

0,"First off I'm sorry for the situation you are in. As a woman with BPD, I can tell you straight up she is using your friendship to get what she is lacking romantically and emotionally from her male companions which isn't fair to you because it seems like you want to be with her. Personally, I would take sex 100% off the table but make it a point of discussion at the next therapy session so that her response is neutralized by the therapist. She will more than likely get mad at you for this but I would tell her that losing her friendship is more important to you than having a sexual relationship with her and that if ending the sexual nature of your relationship is an ultimate for her she needs to explain to you why. If you do want a relationship with her please for the love of god don't go the route of sleeping with her while she dates other men. I honestly think that this will make her split on you even more because she is going to perceive you as the reason her relationships don't work. I know it's difficult but you need to put the ball back into your court and define how you are allowed to interact just because she is going through a hard time does not give her the right to treat people like a POS. If you want to make this friendship/relationship work while she is actively in a BPD episode which it sounds like she is you're going to need to be patient, very forthcoming, reassuring, and have clearly defined boundaries.",FerkinSmert,16hql3t
1,"I stopped sleeping with her after the comment was made that I forced her. I also strangely don‚Äôt want to be with her, I did at one point but that faded after I noticed the lies along the way to this point. I see her as my friend some would say best friend, I‚Äôve spoken to her ex husband and he said he got a similar treatment at different stages in their marriage. She told the therapist she doesn‚Äôt want sex from me but, it was a lie. The therapist confronted her about it in a session we had last week and she said ‚Äúoh I haven‚Äôt wanted to sleep with him in a long time, I never found him attractive I had to force my mind to let me do it‚Äù. When the therapist asked what was unattractive she took like 5 mins and said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs really tall and doesn‚Äôt have green eyes‚Äù. The therapist just sort of looked at me with a smirk and said ‚Äúis that a serious reason or are you winging it‚Äù and she went on a tangent about how she‚Äôs saying how she really feels and everyone is saying she feels different. I left the session early because it broke my heart, to see her like that. I don‚Äôt want her romantically at all but she‚Äôs an amazing person and it kills me to see her so different. I spoke to her yesterday and she told me that she wants to go to a friends party on Sunday, I asked if she felt up to that, she said yea. But Tuesday in our session she will say I asked her to come, I made her go, I can already see it coming, so I told her I wanted to go alone and that I thought she should spend the day with her kids to which she said ok",Fire-bird67,16hql3t
2,"The forced thing is tough because she could have easily wanted to have sex with you but also didn't want to for a variety of reasons and she is now allowing herself to say it was forced to excuse her own actions. I would literally ask her, ""So, you feel like I took advantage of you?"" because that's essentially what she is alluding to when she says forced. I would want her to say to my face that she genuinely felt forced and to explain her perception of the incident. Also, if she really felt like you forced her to have sex I can assure you she more than likely wouldn't be trying to maintain a friendship. I would also tell her how the way she described the sex as ""forced"" has affected YOU, not everything should be about her.

Also, can I ask...Do you actually care if she's attracted to you? Especially if you don't want to be with her physically or emotionally. I understand that as a friend it would be hard to hear that they aren't attracted to you but if you're not romantically interested in her why care about her opinion? I'm sure 10 million other people find you attractive who could be better looking and nicer than her so why put so much investment into what SHE thinks of you? Personally, I think you should distance yourself a bit until she can view your and her relationship the way that you want her to. This isn't a one-way street where she only gets what she wants and I can tell you the perception that I get from the way you describe things is that she's not super great for your self-confidence. I wouldn't end the relationship but I would for sure take a big step back to make her realize she needs to treat you better as a friend. Again BPD or not the world doesn't solely revolve around her.",FerkinSmert,16hql3t
3,"The attractive thing was more of a ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù Type thing because it‚Äôs literally one of the things she‚Äôs said most often was how attractive she found me.

It difficult to explain how quickly all of this has happened I‚Äôm just stunned by the speed everything was good with her and it was like over night bam a complete 180. She doesn‚Äôt hurt my self confidence it‚Äôs just not the best feeling to hear someone seem so cold and completely different. I have stopped texting her as often, and I‚Äôve set up a rule that we cannot see eachother so often and that I‚Äôm going to be doing my own thing for a while that I‚Äôm happy to support her if needed but I‚Äôm not going to be revolving my life around it. I also feel really bad for the guy she‚Äôs talking to because he does genuinely seem like a good dude, and he shouldn‚Äôt have to go through it. She admits he knows nothing that she‚Äôs lied to him about most things. What really got me what when she said I like being with him because my kids are not around and I like life without them. That‚Äôs when I got her ex husband involved. Because she‚Äôs pawning the kids off to do things. I do have a question though. Does she actually know what she‚Äôs doing, because when she does have moments of clarity she says that she just doesn‚Äôt see how she‚Äôs doing anything wrong it all just seems normal to her? And she does get quite emotional and you see glimpses of her and she says she‚Äôs sorry to us and she knows something is wrong but she just can‚Äôt see it no matter who points it out she can‚Äôt take herself out to see it , it just feels like she‚Äôs doing thing how everyone else would.",Fire-bird67,16hql3t
4,"You're going to hate this reply but more than likely no, she doesn't know what she is doing is wrong until after she's reacted but she still needs to be held accountable for her actions. I have been in a relationship for 10 years and to this day there are instances where I perceive my actions or words as ""normal"" when in fact they are the complete opposite. It's also difficult because he also faced a decent amount of abuse and neglect as a child. One example I can give that's always stuck with me was when I was watching a TikTok of a woman who recorded her abuser verbally harassing her and I was genuinely confused at what everyone was so upset about in the recording thinking, ""Ahh he wasn't that bad"" (He was 100% saying awful, vile things). Yeah...I literally didn't realize a video of a man berating his girlfriend about how worthless, ugly, etc was an abusive situation...YIKES...and it wasn't until I went to the comments and realized ""Oh, people actually aren't supposed to talk to each other like this,"" but I honestly didn't know...I know that sounds stupid but it's a sad reality for many with BPD especially those with negative internal dialogues and past trauma. Truthfully, I can really only see things with clarity once I've already acted on it which means I have to be surrounded by strong, compassionate, forgiving people who know that I am seriously trying my best. So to get back to your original question...more than likely no she doesn't know she's being horrible but you need to hold her accountable for her actions and get her to care about more than just her own feelings. Also, I hate to say it but it's probably better for the kids to be with the dad and not see her if she truly thinks her life is better without her children. Sorry if that's harsh as someone trying to conceive I'm sick of hearing about shit mothers.

1,"Hi, I didn't become aware of my BPD until my 40s after experiencing some substantial losses, I think the pandemic served as the tipping point where I hit rock bottom mental health wise.

I've been getting a lot of help from watching videos on YouTube.  Psychology in Seattle, Daniel J Fox, Lisa LeBlanc,  Tracey Marks, and Todd Grande.  Surviving Narcissism (channel) if appropriate to one's trauma.  I did a lot to address my extensive identtity disturbance it was a little easier knowing I've had a full life and career behind me to renounce the sensation of not existing or having a personality of my own.  I lost every source of externalised identity this summer, I'm rebuilding from the ground up.  Assessing yourself using the five-factor model of personality (OCEAN) is a really straightfoward and helpful exercise imo.

I've found the BPD subs on Reddit to be incredibly helpful, once I got to the point of handling reading my experiences and symptoms in words, and having the opportunity to engage in compassion with experiences we've been at the pointy end of.  Like, we all know how harrowing and painful living with BPD is, especially when it's uncontrolled or undercontrolled.  So it's not light reading by any means, but invaluable.

Favourite People are where we sink our attachment needs and have an odd blind spot that distortsaway any flaws.  Maybe your friend's blind spot resembles a parental figure's toxic traits.  My last FP was a total turd of a human, at the time I thought he was kind and caring; in hindsight, his actions never matched his words, ever.

Him being older, it might help tremendously. I listen to it every morning, and the things that Rose and Jay have to say have been very helpful to me in my journey, and are generally good imo for anyone. 

I definitely recommend having an open heart and mind, and being willing to confront the things keeping one stuck, though, if he does embark on that podcast.

Informationally, also, I recommend ""We Can Do Hard Things,"" with Glennon Doyle, as well as Early Morning Barking, on YouTube. ""Borderline to Beautiful"" is also a good resource. These are NOT meant to replace therapy, though. 

If therapy cost is an issue, there may be local, state-run help. They are there to help too, if one can manage it.

In the meantime, self-care and journaling, meditation (starting with 5 minute ones is recommended, guided ones are available for free on YouTube), and making a routine are good places to start on any recovery journey.

0,"I was diagnosed with BPD back in 2015. I was just diagnosed with ADHD not even two months ago. I‚Äôve been on stimulants a little over a month now. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned this last month:

- the stimulants have made my BPD symptoms go quiet. They‚Äôre legit a whisper. 
- the stimulants have made my depression become 85% better. Its so much better Im going to be lowering the dose of my Lamictal the end of this month to see how i do. 
- stimulants don‚Äôt work as well the week of my ‚Äúperiod‚Äù (it‚Äôs not a true period because I‚Äôm on the pill)
- the week of my ‚Äúperiod‚Äù my BPD symptoms came back with a vengeance on that Wednesday and lasted till that Sunday. So, a total of 4 days out of the month i had BPD symptoms. Once that Sunday was over, my BPD symptoms have been quiet again
-  the stimulants have improved not only my BPD and depression symptoms but my overall focus/concentration, executive dysfunction and overall energy are a so so so much better.

1,"BPD and ADHD here, diagnosed a little over a year ago. I found that the Straterra (Atomoxetine) has worked VERY well for me. I don‚Äôt know if it made enough of a difference on its own, as I also went extremely heavy into mindfulness, meditation, DBT and CBT therapy up to 5 times per two weeks at max). All of this along with a ton of reading on stoicism, Taoism, and Buddhism (especially the Plum Village/Thich Nhat Hanh writing/podcast etc). 

So, I find myself at a 100% different place and, of course, still working hard to ensure that the me I am each day is me, authentically.

2,"I was diagnosed ADHD as a child, and got on stimulants at a very early age. Proceeded to have a troubled childhood, and developed BPD diagnosed later in life. Still taking stimulants to this day.

I would say DBT helped me the most. Ive had huge emotions my whole life, and was never believed for my genuine meltdowns, by parents or school. Learning to cope with those feelings and express myself appropriately was a skill that came with time, practice, and therapy.

My point is, I don't personally credit stimulants as doing much for me emotionally, other than reducing the stress I feel for having uncompleted work (hah, as I type this having procrastinated myself into a corner). I like my ADHD meds, and take them every weekday. I have never been prescribed any meds for my BPD. I was offered antipsychotics, but turned them down in favor of therapy.

Bad therapist, that's not how people work. They are expecting you to bow to their authority rather than care about you authentically understanding yourself. But that would, in my amateur perspective, create eternal dependency on relying on others to tell you what's right. You need to understand how they got there. That often requires a little discussion.

*but it feels impossible to me to just accept what they say without going into detailed explanations. And they stop me, because they know and understand how I feel, and it‚Äôs not important, we need to change the scheme, I might be dumb, but it‚Äôs not obvious to me that the other person know what I feel, so I don‚Äôt try to argue, I just try to paint the whole picture of my interior world.

Again, I'm no therapist. But I cannot imagine any worthwhile therapy that expects a ""yes sir""/""no sir"" approach to things. 

*But my therapist said we might not be compatible, if I question everything, and don‚Äôt trust their knowledge, and they like to move faster, we should have achieved something by now, instead of going over my same emotions.*

They're dictating at you instead of making sure you authentically understand and implying therapy should be moving at *their* preferred speed?

BPD came later on.

All in all it's not really the time invested it's the proper therapy type and therapist that counts.

EMDR and schema therapy is what really makes a difference.

I wish EMDR solved all, it really helped with minimizing the triggers though and saved my life at the time.

When it comes to real results with personality disorder, schema therapy hands down.

It helped me recognize my own dynamics, ""who"" was talking in my head and therefore be able to apply the proper strategy when I feel an episode coming.

It improved my life greatly although I am still BPD (even though my therapist would say that I do not really meet the criteria anymore, they classified it as ""mild"")

To avoid the pain I even went to a cult , without much success aside of extra trauma.

I still feel more than a neurotypical person.

I learn now how to deal with that without blaming myself or retreating. 

My life is now 10000x better than it used to be. I have normal relationships,  no extreme outburst anymore. Still not easy to live around but I am still very caring and loving.

I started to get better and then got pregnant. I thought it was gonna kill me because dealing with bpd and postpartum hormone fluctuations is incredibly hard, so I started therapy again immediately. With a fixed routine (lots of therapy, medication I take religiously and staying away from toxic people and social media) I‚Äôve managed to keep a steady job, get rid of all my comorbilities, avoid postpartum depression, became the mother my kids deserve (no yelling, safe boundaries, keep track of everything they need, give them a steady and safe childhood, no more outbursts).

I basically tried all of these things (at different times)  and was consistent. The days I felt terrible and miserable and couldn‚Äôt function, I still pushed myself to follow through with these things DAILY.

The most important part I think is making yourself do these things on your worst days. 

Some of the techniques didn‚Äôt work for me or fit with me as a person after many  months so I stopped doing some of them. But the ones I did see results in I continued to do every single day.

I'm a good person and I can say that because I put in the work tirelessly to become what I and my husband deserve.  So Yes relationships can be successful with bpd, it all depends on how much work we put into our therapies and most importantly being self aware. Owning our negative behaviors. I will say an apology without changed behavior is manipulation, I know because I did it, all the time. Bpd is only a life sentence of loneliness and despair if we CHOOSE that.

- something you can feel (tactile feeling you enjoy; I included some satin-y material and lip gloss) 
- something to look at (can be art, picture, a little token of some kind; I made a ""happy"" album on my phone and included material that is special to me)
- something you can taste (gum, or mints, or some other small item that you aren't worried about going bad or making a mess; I included some gum)
- something you can hear (like a Playlist on your phone, which is what I used)

However, it is critical for a therapist to have objectivity, maintain boundaries, and leave their emotions/judgements away from the session. I would suggest looking at why her demeanor is affecting how you feel because a lot of us get triggered by not getting validation as it confirms our presumption that we will be abandoned. Also, some therapists have their own biases when it comes to our diagnosis due to the stigma and she could be projecting a little bit as well. Discuss the issue with her in a non accusing manner and hear her prespective, if she doesn‚Äôt seem willing to compromise or find a different way that better suits your needs then you might need to have a new therapist. Not all therapists have the same tools and they are also people ( we are not supposed to like or connect to everyone just like we don‚Äôt have to with therapists, doctors, etc.) it is someone who is providing you care and you should feel like you trust them.",Substantial-Rub-2156,10e21oy

Anyway, how do you recommend I approach this conversation? She‚Äôs also a DBT therapist so I would hope she doesn‚Äôt have a stigma but we‚Äôre all only human. You‚Äôre right that I need to assess if our relationship is strong, I think she challenges me in a healthy, productive way (this might just be another hurdle that I need to jump) so I think a conversation is the right move.

Or see if they have a DBT group. DBT has been shown to help significantly in reducing BPD symptoms and making them more manageable. There are a couple of subs on here to get you started on your own. r/dbtselfhelp and r/DBTskills are a good place to start. There are 4 modules in DBT and you should start with mindfullness. It is the core skill of DBT. It can be a hard concept at first and I would recommend reading everything you can get your hands on to help you understand it. There are tons of YouTube videos too. I like Kati Morton's channel and would recommend her as a start. She is great at explaining BPD and has videos on DBT. Also, get you husband involved in learning with you. Start journaling everyday and learn what your triggers are. It can be very eye opening to both you and you husband. Maybe consider having your husband get individual therapy for himself, as well as joint therapy for both of you. Unfortunately this disorder can take a toll on our loved ones as well. Now this all sounds like a lot I'm sure, but have faith in yourself that you can do this. It's a long process but well worth it. Never give up. I have faith in you!

Edit: Also, get Marsha Linehan's second edition DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets book. I got mine on Amazon for fairly cheap. Make copies of the worksheets if possible so you can do them multiple times.",,iekf5o

2,"It is a relapse, that‚Äôs good you recognize it because the hardest part of this disorder is radical self honesty. This is just more proof that the relapse did not negate or melt away your progress. That still belongs to you and you have the right to still be proud of it. Just try to remember you have survived melt downs before and will survive this one. 

I have been trying my best to stop drinking too, I tell myself in those moments when I want a drink ‚Äúalcohol is not my friend‚Äù. Then I think of times I hurt my actual friends because the alcohol lowered my inhibitions. But be careful not to let your brain lie to you, you are not broken or damaged. You are human, just take accountability, make amends, respect boundaries, continue your process, and give yourself grace to trip up.

Lastly, please use a therapist who is willing to work with you using an evidence based practice. That will give you the structure that we all work best with, building that muscle memory we can tap into when in need. If you have health insurance, you can use the ZocDoc app to find a provider and make an appointment for as early as the next day in most cases.",dustyprose,1azzunu

personally I did one session a week for a year(after initial diagnosis) and one session a week gave me plenty of food for thought and reflection For the next week till I went back. if there‚Äôs anything about BPD it‚Äôs pacing your life out to remove as much stress as possible. I got diagnosed late (m44) now 46 so Im burnt out, and I‚Äôm now on the pension(but stable phew!).

so i can‚Äôt stress enough to really take as much time needed to remove unnecessary stresses in your daily routine. I have a saying; there‚Äôs nothing in my out tray. If I have a problem with a friend or anybody I have to sort it immediately, stewing on things will just make the anxiety and quality of life go down hill quick.here‚Äôs a little article with a picture that explains the different parts of the brain that are effected. I keep going and studying on from there and little pieces of the puzzle begin to fit into place more.

It seems to be a constant remembering of certain things, like the damaged amygdala is creating too much cortisol to the blood stream that makes us anxious and easily moody. So by reminding my self of that I can separate the ‚Äòcontent‚Äô :as in some one who did me wrong and how I‚Äôm annoyed and the pysical: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got massive amounts of adrenaline and cortisol running through my body that‚Äôs making the pissed offness highly exaggerated‚Äô‚Ä¶..and repetitive. any way I‚Äôm also on a learning curve hope this helps a little.

0,"I have BPD and my boyfriend and I have been together for around 5 years.

I‚Äôd been in a string of abusive relationships before I met him because my parents showed me no other example. I am very lucky that my boyfriend is probably the kindest person I know. On top of that he‚Äôs a critical thinker and he absolutely supports me during therapy.

He taught me healthy boundaries, he was the first one in my life who noticed my PMDD symptoms, and most importantly HE ONLY GETS MAD IF I BREACH SAID BOUNDARIES AND I DO THE SAME.

I put those in capitals because for us to feel safe and healthy in a relationship, we need consistency. We can‚Äôt be with people who constantly breaches our boundaries but wants you to respect theirs.

The very, very important part of this piece is that I apply DBT RELIGIOUSLY. When I feel like my boundaries are breached I take the time and effort to separate myself from my trigger to really examine if my anger is warranted or if it‚Äôs a BPD symptom. This takes conscious effort and it means that he needs to respect me when I need the space to process these feelings.

When we do get angry at each other, we never let the anger linger (after the feelings have been properly processed) and both of us are CONSCIOUS of our responsibility towards one another. If there are chores that I should‚Äôve done and I didn‚Äôt, then that is my bad and I need to take responsibility. If he forgot to do something then that is his bad and he should be taking responsibility.

It takes a LOT of accountability to manage your BPD and for anybody to deserve said accountability, the other person needs to completely understand the full context of what BPD is. This does NOT mean that the other person should continue tolerating you breaching their boundaries just because of your BPD symptoms. Conversely, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt get to make mistakes especially as somebody with BPD. It is all about a critical, conscious effort on both parties‚Äô part to be accountable, thoughtful, respectful, and ultimately kind when the other party makes a mistake once in a while.

YOU DESERVE SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS YOUR BPD AS MUCH AS YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR OWN BPD. This means as much as you are putting in conscious effort to mitigate your symptoms when they do flare - your SO should be understanding of this and you should never tolerate breaching of boundaries like gaslighting, passive aggressiveness, or other forms of emotional manipulation. This goes without saying that you shouldn‚Äôt ever employ these tactics either.",Dependent-Childhood,o5wykd

3,"Well, we kinda do have a succesful story. We've been together for a couple of years, married and have a baby. At first while dating everything was fabulous. When we moved together, her symptoms were pretty much at the worst end of spectrum. Drunk all the time, using drugs, violence, dissociation, psychotic episodes, insomnia, twitching, treating me like trash, selfharm, eating disorder etc etc, you know the drill. Like the last poster said, only after she started to realize the harm she is doing, taking accountability of her illnesss, realizing it's her traumas that trigger her, not me, she started getting radically better. She's been sober as soon as we got the positive pregnancy test, and her last psychiatrist said, that she has borderline traits, but don't fill the criteria anymore. Her diagnosis probably will changed later. So uh, i don't know, the more borderline time was hell, but it's way better these days when she doesn't fulfill the criteria anymore.

Edit. Just to mention to the previous posters, i was the one who understood better where her symptoms were coming from, so for that to matter, the person with the bpd needs to be self-concious on a very deep level",toxicwasteoflife,o5wykd

My (29M) girlfriend (28F) of just about a year has that unfortunate BPD/PMDD combo as well. I'm trying my absolute best to be just as supportive as your boyfriend. I've got the critical thinking (or at least I'd like to think so), the emphasis on healthy boundaries, and trying to gently steer toward that mutual accountability you mention. I'm already well on my way to really accepting her challenges onto my shoulders so she doesn't have to bare it alone. That's why I'm here browsing this subreddit and replying to your comment. :)

0,"Hi! I am slowly on the path to start inner child work soon. I am not full blown into it yet, but am placing the first bricks slowly. 

Recently I was doing a guided meditation where they told us to meet our inner child in a difficult moment that happened for them. It didn't say how but it encouraged us to be there for our inner child in that moment. To let them guide us to how they would have wanted to be comforted (a hug, silent presence, reassuring words...). Whatever your inner child might have needed at that moment, but not received. 

So I did. I spent a good ten fifteen minutes with my inner child, letting her lead the moment. Accepting her feelings and letting her know they were normal. 

When the meditation ended, in my head, she was now resting her head on my shoulder, sitting facing me on my lap. Quietly. As if almost falling asleep. As I said the meditation ended and the audio said ""When you are ready, slowly open your eyes and come back to your surroundings"". 

I mentally told my child, ""Ok sweetie, time for me to go"". But I felt her quietly grip me, like ""No, please, not yet"". I said ok. It was a surprise to me but I accepted her needs. I started rocking myself, while hugging myself, softly, kindly, caringly. Eventually another 5 minutes later or so I was like ""Are you feeling better?"" And she was like ""yeah"", so we gradually let go, until I was ready to reopen my eyes and carry on with my day.

When that happened, I thought, OK, I need to dig deeper here. So I bought a book, haven't read it yet. I can come back and review once that it done.

I also selected a picture of me when I was a child, a positive one, and I keep it visible in my living room, I look at her when I can, I try to smile at her. 

Thanks for the book recommendation! I will definitely give it a try as well!",clamdeu,10ywrod
1,"Hi, I also have found inner child and reparenting really helpful in healing.  It's part of the process once I identify very reactive memories and name the feelings they give rise to.  Once I've done that, I start to ponder upon the things I'd like to go back and say if I could.  But reciting them to my inner child is the best thing for it.  

I've got to say, this is a technique taught by some MLMs, it's been parroted at me by others but lacked the weight for true healing because it was so contrived.  Plus, the ppl in my life parroting it were the ultra toxic ones..  Probably few ppl recall Mork & Mindy, the scenes where Mork was standing in a black room reporting to Ork, that is the kind of vibe and focus to elicit poignancy for me.",,10ywrod

I've been involved for decades with a 12-step program called ACA or a ACOA, a brilliant program modeled after AA that changes lives for the better... ""It works if you work it"" this program gives you instant and basically free access to decades of healing work that is very much based on reparenting yourself to overcome past traumas abuses neglect losses Etc sustained while a member of a family with either drug and alcohol abuse or any other form of addictive behavior that rendered parents unable to give really healthy good kind-wise direction consistently to you as you were developing. This results in adult shortcomings that are predictable and listed on a laundry list, of which there are two forms, a shorter one and a longer one, and they are both easy to Google. It turns out that the shortcomings and difficulties on these lists match pretty closely a lot of mental health diagnoses including bipolar borderline depression anxiety Etc. so maybe duh the answer is healing the trauma and not taking drugs and going endlessly to talk therapy that doesn't have these tools that are so wisely part of this program.
If anyone relates to any of this to yourself a favor and research this group and meetings near you both on Zoom and in person. I started going in 1989 and went on and off because of busyness and self-love issues but I'm back again and loving it and good things are happening.

Another pwBPD here... while I fully support the comments and commenters above, I also want to provide a somewhat alternative perspective: DBT is not always as helpful for one as it can be for others.

If your partner is resistant to therapy, maybe try to find out more about what makes them so reluctant? 

Likewise, I would highly recommend that you look into some personal counselling: loving and living with a pwbpd can be super impactful and you deserve an ear just as much as they do.

I don't care if he apologizes and says he didn't mean any of it when his splitting ends- it is incredibly hurtful to hear, and it is damaging my own mental health.",So-Done9779,yg7dgi

I‚Äôm learning techniques but it also is hard to remember those when you‚Äôre in the moment.

I‚Äôm sure he loves you and all this hateful language towards you is because he‚Äôs so scared of you leaving that he‚Äôs creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. All I can stress you to do is try to convince him to get treatment specifically if he can get into a DBT program.

Basically you make yourself do something even though you really don't want to/don't feel up to doing it etc.  And setting out small, attainable goals for yourself each day. Simple goals like brush your teeth, brush your hair, washed some dishes etc. 

If you also keep track of everything you do during the day, no matter how small or irrelevant it might seem, you'll see how much you're actually accomplishing! 

For water intake, keep a big bottle near you, if you don't have to move around to get a glass you might be more likely to drink it. I also find using a bottle with a straw helps me get through it better. Theres also a very cute app called Plant Nanny that you can input your water intake and make cute plants grow, might encourage you to keep up the habit!

Most importantly, don't forget how much you're actually doing every day already. You're getting out of bed, you're going to work! and doing so much else.

most days i dont get any ticks, its a work in progress, and i celebrate if i do get some ticks during the week. my goal is for these things to be daily habits that i dont have to make an effort to do. 

i do find that if i drink water i feel more awake. ive started to put water reminders on my work computer that pop up ""sip some water"", and i have to accept or ignore, so i sip some water and accept LOL.

i suffer from stomach troubles too, any bit of anxiety and it kicks off. You can try to eat probiotics yogourts or add probiotics to your water when your stomach is giving you troubles and I also find some light yoga or calming meditation can work wonders too.

I began seeing her with run of the mill depression- which has been a factor in my life since middle school, but as time went on, life events became heavier, BPD symptoms magnified intensely.  I internalize mostly, so have done a decent job hiding it or distracting people with something else and generally polishing up my practice of ineffective coping mechanisms. The carefully constructed house of cards fell eventually, and hard.  

I, too felt like some things just totally didn‚Äôt fit. I have been in a committed marriage for 15 years- how could this be?  I googled ‚ÄúWhat does BPD look like day to day‚Äù and read around.  Mostly the thoughts and feelings were so so so relatable, more than anything ever in my life.  I read The Buddha and The Borderline- the author is younger than me and showed her traits at a much younger age, she also had some more obvious trauma, where my trauma is emotional only- mostly my family not recognizing and meeting my emotional needs.  But again, she writes her book with lots and lots of her internal dialogue, and so much of it was right from my head, down to the exact word.

I went for the full DBT model for treatment, I‚Äôve tried damn near everything else on the planet.

1,">She‚Äôs my FP so she‚Äôs taken a lot on and it‚Äôs put a strain on our therapeutic relationship.

If she‚Äôs taken on more than she can handle, that‚Äôs on her. It‚Äôs on the therapist to make sure they set healthy boundaries and don‚Äôt get enmeshed in anything. I read your other post from three days ago about her, and she has failed to set boundaries. 

It sounds like she has some resentment towards you for what she chose to do, which was fail to set clear boundaries, and instead of recognizing this, she‚Äôs blaming you and wants you to leave. She allowed you two to argue about termination. That sounds incredibly unprofessional. 

I don‚Äôt agree that this is your fault. In my experience, this sort of dynamic (FP) forms when both parties have issues of some kind, and in a therapeutic relationship, that‚Äôs on the therapist. (Of course, within reason‚Äîlike a blatant disregard of boundaries on part of the client isn‚Äôt okay, but it‚Äôs on the therapist to set those boundaries and appropriately respond to them.) 

You might find [this](https://www.contemporarypsychotherapy.org/volume-4-issue-2-winter-2012/living-between-rewarding-and-withdrawing-paradigms-of-experience/) article on a
theory of the borderline attachment system helpful. At least the diagram that‚Äôs a bit further down. 

The way I see it, it‚Äôs not about looking past the black and white thinking, but seeing through it. What is it telling you about your needs, wants, and the situation as it relates to your personal history (I.e., childhood and past experiences, if applicable)? What does it protect your from realizing or seeing, what function does that way of thinking have?

Is it irrational? You feel like you‚Äôre bad and to blame, because of the situation and your way of relating to it, and you‚Äôre overwhelmed by these feelings. So,
you project those feelings out onto the other person. That doesn‚Äôt sound irrational to me. That sounds adaptive. The key is to try to take it apart and look at what those feeling are really telling you.",thewilltobehave,l3yszj

I have homework with her that details all of this and maybe I should do it and sort some things out. We‚Äôve been focusing on dbt work but it might be worth going back to this.

It wouldn‚Äôt take long - like you said a couple of weeks - for it to really calm down and me to not be a mess but that would be achieved by me trying to dissociate her entire existence rather than me coming to an understanding that she‚Äôs doing the right thing.

I was referred to therapy for these issues and giving up just feels like even in therapy where it‚Äôs meant to be a safe space to learn how to cope with these kind of attachments, I‚Äôve managed to screw up.  

I‚Äôve discussed love with her and she says it‚Äôs inappropriate in therapy for her to feel any sort of love for me. She‚Äôs trained against that sort of thing. It‚Äôs perfectly okay for me to love her though.

As I write all of this I feel like I‚Äôm betraying her and should defend her completely and say she‚Äôs perfect and wonderful and everything she‚Äôs doing is correct. I want to argue that if I just stay with her things will get better and she‚Äôll start to care for me too. That‚Äôs what probably makes it entirely necessary for me to go non contact with her because I feel like I need her right now and that‚Äôs not what therapy should be.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
6,"Yes it must be terribly hard. I dont know how exactly your relationship looks like. But she should do everything so that the relationship ends in a good way. If she doesnt she is not a good therapist. 

She offered to become friends after therapy? How should that work???

Could you not just write her an Email saying you are not feeling well and like to see her some other day? Without getting into detail how you feel?

We need to learn to only let people that deep into our hearts who deserve it. It is also called self protectjection. Not nearly the same interest comes back? Distance yourself! It will hurt - sometimes like hell. But just suffering and waiting for them to give us love or attention wont bring us anywhere. So what to do instead? Stop/reduce contact, take care of yourself (eat, drink, sleep well, exercise, no drugs), learn, ways to calm yourself down, and concentrate on people that do love you. This selfcare is not easy. It is not just taking a bubble bath and then everything will be fine. It is fighting for yourself, cause I dont know if you reached that awarness but: no one else ever will do that for us. We want all the love and care we miss from our childhood. And that is too much to ask for from others it seems :/",ClouldoftheNight,l3yszj
7,"These are my thoughts, and just my thoughts. They are blunt. Feel free to disagree!

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre putting her in a bad position by bringing up a commitment she made in the past. She should be owning up to that and express her new stance in a way that isn‚Äôt shifting blame onto you. 

She seems set on her position that your work in therapy together will be detrimental. This seems a bit shitty, don‚Äôt you think? If she really was committed to caring for you as a therapist, she should be looking for new ways for things to work and trying to figure out what isn‚Äôt working. Sounds like she‚Äôs given up and is continuing things with you to feel like she‚Äôs doing something, even though it sounds like a way to just avoid emotional labor on her end. She doesn‚Äôt want to break your trust by ending therapy, yet she broke your trust by failing to uphold her boundaries which was to your detriment. I find that hard to reconcile, especially since she seems to be making no effort to regain your trust regarding her flat out enabling an attachment dynamic to get out of control in therapy. 

I see what you mean about the irrationality part. In my view the surface appearance of things, i.e., what looks irrational, has very rational functions. And just focusing on the symptoms but not the functions of them is akin to going in circles. I‚Äôve found that the feeling of irrationality is the mind‚Äôs way of staying stuck, not being able to integrate parts of itself that are overwhelming; thus, it labels those parts as irrational and nothing gets resolved. This is one reason why I strongly dislike DBT or CBT as a primary treatment method. (I‚Äôm very biased towards a psychodynamic approach.) 

Whatever you decide to do, I hope it goes well! I have a bit of a bone to pick on this topic, since I had a therapist who I became attached to in the same kind of way. It turns out he had a whole lot of stuff going on for him and the dynamic turned into an abuse of power. Not sexual, but he betrayed my trust multiple times, and I was stuck in a cycle of feeling happy I was so ‚Äúspecial,‚Äù impressed at myself for being able to have this dynamic with a therapist, anger towards him, guilt at said anger or at myself for being so terrible in general, or thinking it was all in my head. I realize now that nothing about it was special or impressive‚Äîthe entire thing was just degrading and I blinded myself to the truth. 

As a side note, attachment-based therapy like the psychodynamic approach actually thinks that forming a strong attachment to your therapist is vital to healing. If that at all interests you! Best of luck once again!

9,"She‚Äôll make sure it ends well. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if we ended with cake or chocolate which probably also isn‚Äôt appropriate.

Not really sure. She said we could slowly start texting about things non therapy related and catch up occasionally and friend. She‚Äôs made it clear she‚Äôs a shit friend though and barely contacts people which isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm looking for. We talk pretty much daily now and I don‚Äôt see why she can‚Äôt continue that. 

I‚Äôve written her like 6 emails about this in full detail. She‚Äôs been camping with her family the last 4 days and completely non contactable. It‚Äôs the longest we‚Äôve gone without talking in months. The earliest she can see me is Saturday because of her only working two days a week, one is those is today and she‚Äôs off work. I‚Äôve asked her if she can give me an hour of emailing time Thursday night but it‚Äôll be a busy night for her with her kids so she probably can‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm taking care of myself now. Self care is one of the things I‚Äôve worked on with her because I can get really bad at it. It‚Äôs the distancing myself from her for my self care that‚Äôs hard. I remember the last time I distanced from an FP and i spiralled so hard it cost me my job and I can‚Äôt afford that right now. I guess that‚Äôs where the finding another therapist comes in, if I can find someone good they should be able to help me through those feelings. I understand mentally that nobody can give me that love but emotionally I can‚Äôt feel that. I‚Äôm desperate for that love and trying to get it from anywhere.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
10,"Great comment by Thewilltobehave. It seems like some enactment is occurring . it is her job to manage her countertransference , and to use it in service of helping you. It seems like she is just dumping her countertransference into the room. You wrote she gets supervision specifically for you- that just has so much both stigma/ special- like you are if not her FP her FC.  She seems to disclose too much of the wrong things to be helpful.",EsmeSalinger,l3yszj
11,"It‚Äôs exactly what you just described about feeling special and every other emotion. And she plays into that. She‚Äôs not a terrible person or therapist. She‚Äôs been really damned good with trauma work and she is trying to help with the attachment stuff but I think she‚Äôs overwhelmed. She has a whole supervisor specifically for the treatment of me and she reads and researches more on everything I send her. She - and she probably shouldn‚Äôt have - has told me this year has been really rough for her and I know I‚Äôm making that worse. That‚Äôs on her, not on me, she needs to manage things better. Can I ask how you dealt with this? Because right now I know having her make me feel special is not going to help me in the long run. Did you end up getting another therapist? 

I looked at getting an attachment based therapist but unfortunately because of my work hours and where I live it‚Äôs hard to find someone to work with. And a lot of the therapists who claim to be attachment based and do work my hours are babies who are fresh out of uni and I think I‚Äôll just destroy them completely. 

I agree that an attachment to your therapist is vital to healing but that attachment needs to come with boundaries, not be codependent.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
12,"This is actually really helpful to hear. 

Where I am, it‚Äôs not going to lose her her registration to be friends with me after therapy ends. We‚Äôve both acknowledged that it would be super hard because we have different expectations on what a friend is. I‚Äôm looking for more than she‚Äôll ever be able to give. 

I am hearing this massively and you‚Äôre right. I need to stop begging her to want me when she never will. It‚Äôs not okay. I shouldn‚Äôt have to do that. Someone should be wanting to be there for me. I guess it just feels like she does want me in her life with the offer of being friends. 

Even writing this I know that I need to give her up and let her have a life. She‚Äôs told me outright that she has neglected giving her kids attention simply because I wanted her attention at the time. That‚Äôs not sustainable and it‚Äôs not fair. Just as you need to make him happy, I need to make her happy and stop being detrimental to the life she should be leading without me in it. 

I need her to be the one to end therapy. Like you, I‚Äôm nowhere near strong enough to give her up. And even if I did I‚Äôd be apologising and running back the next week. She needs to set boundaries against this and she never will. She‚Äôs going to leave it open for me to contact her whenever I need to. 

I don‚Äôt have any pride left at this point. I‚Äôve put it all on the table as to what I want from her and she‚Äôs outright rejected me and said it‚Äôs not possible for her to be anything more than my therapist at this point. I haven‚Äôt cried but I‚Äôve certainly had whole sessions of just begging her to love me and care about me and she does in her own way but it will never be enough. 

She‚Äôs suggested she ask her supervisor that she sees for me to give recommendations for a psychotherapist and not a psychologist and I think I need to okay that with her and start the goodbye process.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
13,"That was my old therapist too. As nice as it sounds to be the ‚ÄòFC‚Äô, it‚Äôs basically just being an emotional garbage bin for the therapist, and then them getting upset when you make any reference to the trash they dumped on you. üö©",thewilltobehave,l3yszj
14,"That sounds like a super similar dynamic to my therapist. He ended up telling me so much, way too much, about very personal details of his family and work life. In the end, behind ‚Äúhe‚Äôs telling me these things because I‚Äôm special!‚Äù, hearing those things just made me feel guilty, ungrateful, and like I was the problem‚Äîall while he was the saviour that I wasn‚Äôt appreciating. I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt mean to do this, and he is a good person. At the end of the day it‚Äôs not about blame but me validating my experience of therapy with him and setting my own boundaries. 

My therapist got consultation (like supervision) for me. He ended up taking a course on dissociative disorders because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm dealing with. I don‚Äôt think any eduction or consultation would have helped, since the biggest issue was how I felt like I was being treated as a person by him. In fact, I know it wouldn‚Äôt have helped, since even after he learned a lot and had gotten a lot of consultation, it was the same dynamic, just in different packaging. 

I didn‚Äôt deal with this well. I waffled a lot, sometimes in intense ways because I was trying to repress my real feelings. I tried to terminate twice but it was overwhelming. I tried to bring up my concerns in the past, but it was never successful. I ended up emailing him about my experience in a very clear way that had no ounce of blame in it, and he sort of got it and was responsive rather than acting like I was nuts. He ended up telling me all about the family and work life stuff to explain why he had acted that way. 

We were going to try to address things, but I realized it was a losing battle. I decided I was just going to ‚Äútry‚Äù another therapist to do short term work. I told myself I was just going to see what it would be like and that I‚Äôd go back to him in a bit. I couldn‚Äôt fathom him not being my therapist or at least in my life. My secret dreams of running off with him or saving him were as strong as ever, but I felt I was at the end of my rope and like nothing was improving. I began to feel like I was his therapist or parent, trying to meet his needs.

I think think getting my thoughts out there helped, by communicating them to him in a clear but kind way. It felt like I gave myself a voice while also stating compassionate, and I was able to listen to myself without thinking I had just been acting crazy.  It‚Äôs been over a month since I terminated and I haven‚Äôt looked back. I was really disoriented when I first left, but kept telling myself I‚Äôll go back to him in a bit. That feeling died down and I can think clearly about everything now and see just how unhealthy it was. It feels amazing to have a validating therapist where I can just breath. The feeling of specialness lost its allure to the feeling of being heard. 

That‚Äôs too bad about the attachment therapists. There should be some therapist who can at least take a good approach and have enough sense to not get caught up in anything.",thewilltobehave,l3yszj

17,"Her telling me things and sharing photos of her family and her life definitely serves to make me feel special. It‚Äòa the jealousy I feel surrounding that that makes me feel ashamed and guilty. We‚Äôve set boundaries surrounding this because therapy used to divert into her telling stories to try and relate to me and it just made things worse. I admit I really do miss those stories. 

Yeah, that‚Äôs very similar. She‚Äôs done all the training and gotten all the supervision to help me but it‚Äôs just the same problem and a new way for it to not be fixed. I‚Äôm in therapy for this problem to be fixed and she‚Äôs done nothing but make it worse. I feel like I‚Äôm failing by giving up with her and admitting that even a therapist can be screwed up by my attachment issues. 

I‚Äôve emailed my therapist about this many times. She‚Äôs on holiday at the moment and I emailed her today trying to explain how I felt about not seeing her any more. I threw it back on her and accused her of not caring if I stopped therapy because I was nothing in her life. 

This is my exact approach right now. I‚Äôm just trying a new therapist and then when my transference is gone I‚Äôll go back to her and we‚Äôll get all the trauma work done that I can‚Äôt imagine telling anyone but her. I‚Äôve relied on her and trusted her for 3 years, how could I possibly create that bond with someone else? I know I will but I‚Äôm terrified of falling into the same patterns with them and ruining another therapists life. I‚Äôm holding onto hope that even if I‚Äôm gone from her life for a year she‚Äôll still take me back at the end of it and everything will fall back into place in my world. 

I‚Äôve narrowed it down to 4 who I will look further into when everything is opened back up on Wednesday. I need someone who works on weekends though and is also able to take my insurance. Hopefully one of them can provide me with some support.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
18,"I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll set boundaries. I think she‚Äôll leave it open and say I can contact her as much as I like as long as it‚Äôs helping me. I‚Äôm not in a position to decide what‚Äôs helping me. 

The types of contact in our relationship have always changed. We‚Äôve tried boundaries around contact but they always get broken. The only consistent rule is that I‚Äôm not allowed to text her whenever I want. Though when I did this to test this boundary she responded positively and talked back to me instead of reprimanding me for breaking it so I don‚Äôt know. 

She says our boundaries are more like guidelines and they‚Äôre going to get broken and change with time. This hasn‚Äôt helped me when she said dating her was a no boundary because of all her boundaries are inconsistent how can I not see this one as the same? 

I know the next step is leaving her and going non contact. I guess I just want to leave knowing this affects her in some way too. Like she actually does care about me. That‚Äôs a massive achievement. I‚Äôm still seeing this as entirely her fault though because as the therapist it was her job to enforce boundaries and make sure this didn‚Äôt happen and she failed at that causing these issues. 

I am worthy of being loved. I just wish I could find someone who was willing to do that.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
19,"I have to wonder why she shared those photos and things with you, knowing what she does about you and what you‚Äôre dealing with. That would make me feel jealous too, as thought they‚Äôre trying to show me all the parts of their life I will never be in. Or serve as a harsh reminder that I‚Äôm just another client to them so I need to watch it. But I would also feel a conflict between this and the sense that I‚Äôm special, since she‚Äôs doing things like showing me photos. I should be grateful, not jealous, and approve of her sharing‚Äîboth so she knows I appreciate her and also to uphold the closeness of our relationship. 

No idea if your thought process was similar, but this would be a bit of a mindfuck for me. All these things put us between a rock and a hard place where setting healthy boundaries feels like we‚Äôve done something wrong and will get something taken away, but not setting those boundaries leads to enmeshment where we don‚Äôt have room to grow. 

I don‚Äôt think you screwed her up. These things go way back in people, to their own family dynamics. I‚Äôm willing to bet her relationships have the same dynamic you do with her, just to a lesser extent, since the dynamic in therapy tends to exasperate things. I often felt discarded when my therapist gave me the cold shoulder; he did it in a way that made me feel like a toy that wasn‚Äôt living up to his expectations, and the thought of him finding a new favourite client killed me. I had so much secrete knowledge about him and he knows so much about me too, and I didn‚Äôt want to lose that to some other client or even person in his life. But at the end of the day, I really was discardable to him, and if he ever has the same thing happen with another client, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll end up discarding them too. 

I get the feeling of not wanting to throw it all away, have it feel like it was at least worth something. Having a heartfelt discussion with my old therapist helped me feel better about that, but if those kinds of discussions are too triggering or anxiety provoking that‚Äôs understandable. I found I was able to squeeze out a ton of self-knowledge from my experiences. I learned a crap ton about my own defences and needs, and how to set boundaries.

I hope you can find an awesome therapist, even just to see what else is out there.",thewilltobehave,l3yszj

21,"I don‚Äôt know why she shared them. Like she shared a photo of her at her sisters wedding. Like I know you‚Äôre in love with me and want a life with me so here‚Äôs a photo of me looking super pretty. I know she doesn‚Äôt think like that. She‚Äôs ridiculously dense in all of this but yeah it only served to make me feel jealous and extremely special knowing she‚Äôs not showing these photos to other clients. 

It just feels like I‚Äôm being punished when she puts in boundaries now. She‚Äôs given me so much and made me feel so important in her life that when she puts in a boundary I just feel like she‚Äôs punishing me for being so attached to her. 

Because she‚Äôs made me feel special and said she wants to be friends with me when therapy ends I don‚Äôt feel discardable to her. She‚Äôs made me feel like she actually likes my company and wants to spend time with me outside of session. I can recognise that this is wrong of her but I‚Äôm so caught up in the idea that I‚Äôm special to her, she‚Äôs never done this with anyone else so clearly I matter to her. 

It just feels like a waste of 3 years of my life where I could have been with someone else getting better. I‚Äôve learnt so much about myself from her and I know that even if I stop therapy with her it will be with the knowledge that she taught me so much about how to love and look after myself but it still feels like wasted time.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
22,"Having that realisation and taking steps is harder. I know she‚Äôs only staying because I‚Äôm forcing her to right now. She made a promise never to leave and I‚Äôm holding her to that. She can‚Äôt end therapy without breaking any trust we have left. I trust her to not block communication, she isn‚Äôt terrible and she‚Äôs not going to deliberately hurt me if she doesn‚Äôt have to. I know she‚Äôs a wonderful human being, she‚Äôs just maybe not the therapist for me right now. I know she‚Äôll give me the closure I need and as much time as I need to actually say goodbye properly. She won‚Äôt just cut off contact and refuse to speak to me one day. 

I‚Äôm just getting old and finding love is hard. Someone will love me even if I‚Äôm old though haha. 

She‚Äôll give me referrals but they may be useless. She‚Äôs really far out of area for me - I travel an hour and a half to see her - so any referrals she gives will be in the same area and if I don‚Äôt have to I‚Äôll avoid travelling over there. I also don‚Äôt know if I trust anyone she refers. They‚Äôre likely to practice like her and that‚Äôs not helpful to me. She was going to ask her supervisor for referrals and that may end up being better for me.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
23,"These dynamics are largely unconscious. But that doesn‚Äôt make it any less real. For me, I realized I was compartmentalizing my therapist‚Äôs behaviour, thinking he didn‚Äôt mean it, so it‚Äôs okay, that there‚Äôs two sides to every story, etc. I can see now that I was, in a way, seeing him as not having control of himself by compartmentalizing, like almost infantilizing him. It helped me to see that I was actually empowering him and respecting him as an adult and therapist by not making excuses for him. 

That‚Äôs a super fair feeling, with her telling you that you guys will be friends after therapy (üö©). Once again though, I have to wonder why she said this. I‚Äôm sure part of it is that she genuinely enjoys your company, but lots of therapists feel that way about their clients and still are able to act professional. On feeling discarded, I guess I read hints of that in how you felt abandoned by her wanting to terminate things. Like you didn‚Äôt meet up to her expectations and now she‚Äôs done with you and wants you to leave. I could be projecting my own experience onto that though. 

I can so relate to that feeling of having wasted time. I saw my new therapist today and had the desire to see my old therapist come up after session. It‚Äôs sucks. But I also think that it will always feel like wasted time to me, because nothing will ever be satisfying. I can‚Äôt think of any tangible ‚Äúfinish line‚Äù with my old therapist that would make it seem worth it, aside from him crossing major boundaries which I know would be incredibly harmful for me in the end.",thewilltobehave,l3yszj
24,[deleted],,l3yszj
25,"You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs very real. I feel like if I brought it up with her she‚Äôs apologise and never do it again but another part of me realises that would take away me being special and I‚Äôm fighting that. I see her as in complete control, she could do anything and I‚Äôd allow it. 

Yeah, probably is a massive red flag. She said it when I told her I didn‚Äôt mean anything to her and she‚Äôd never speak to me again outside therapy. I guess it‚Äôs not an abandonment of me entirely, it‚Äôs like - if you‚Äôve ever done parts work - she‚Äôs abandoning little me who still needs a lot of help in favour of only accepting who she wants me to be now. 

I hope it doesn‚Äôt always feel like wasted time. I have written a list of everything we achieved together that will help with that. We did some really good work before everything started getting really bad. I am attached enough that I would happily let her cross those major boundaries despite the damage and I know that needs to stop.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
26,"She referred to herself as an addiction and said every time I came to see her I was harming myself because I knew it was doing damage and still kept going.

I‚Äôve done exercises on what she can give me, the whole things was piled into a table of what‚Äôs logical and what‚Äôs not. I know it‚Äôs not possible to have a relationship with her - sexual or even just dating - but I can‚Äôt seem to get my head around it. I can‚Äôt go cold turkey because it would send me spiralling way too hard and I can‚Äôt afford to have that happen. 

What I need from her is not possible. She would say I simply want it and it‚Äôs not a need but it certainly feels like it in my head. I need to know in some way that she ever actually cared about me.

Listen to all your parts, validate them, and tend to their needs, but don‚Äôt let a sad child make decisions for a company. 

Having that list is a good idea. Maybe I‚Äôll do that if it comes up for me again. Hopefully you can find a good therapists who will help you process things so that it doesn‚Äôt feel like a waste, but a part of the process.",thewilltobehave,l3yszj

I hope so. Otherwise it will continue just being a complete waste of 3 years of my life.

We both know that it‚Äôs harming me and probably causing more damage to my life than I need but I still can‚Äôt find myself ending it. I have done all of these things. I have screamed, begged and cried for even a tiny bit more of her attention and she gives it. She sacrifices her time with her family to cater to me, making me feel special when she shouldn‚Äôt, and probably causing her more damage too. That‚Äôs valuable time she‚Äôs missing with her small children because I‚Äôm being needy and demanding she love me too. I know I‚Äôm missing out on life. I‚Äôve had things go okay with people I‚Äôve tried to date - though not often - but every time it seems like it‚Äôs going somewhere I back out because what if, what if she says yes, what if she chooses to risk her job and her marriage for me. I‚Äôve said I only want one night with her but I know I‚Äôm entirely kidding myself, that would never be enough, I‚Äôd want more and more and it would ruin both of our lives. 

I think the plan needs to be doing this slowly. Her backing away and lowering contact at a reasonable rate. I‚Äôm going to throw tantrums and beg for her to come back but I guess I need her to be the strong one and say this is for my own good. I don‚Äôt know why I trust her to do that because she never has in the past. I can‚Äôt just have her disappear, I want things to fade out like a friendship where you kind of just lose touch because you‚Äôre leading different lives. I don‚Äôt want her to be gone forever though and I guess that‚Äôs the hard part.

She‚Äôs made it clear that she thinks I should be referred elsewhere and I feel like the only reason that isn‚Äôt being enforced is because she‚Äôs said it‚Äôs always my choice to end therapy. If it was her choice this would probably be our last session. I know I‚Äôm way stronger than I feel I am. It just feels like giving up.

At the same time I wonder if she gets therapy would she be able to deal with me just a little bit longer and that‚Äôs not the way I should be thinking. 

Having this conversation has kind of made me want to take that power but I also feel like I‚Äôm just taking power and ‚Äúdumping‚Äù her just because I want her to hurt as badly as I am but that‚Äôs a little bit nasty of me.

I feel like she‚Äôs going to manage this way better than I am. As you said my heart is worth protecting and she‚Äôs got way more supports and should be far better at protecting herself than I am right now. It‚Äôs her job to protect me as my therapist. 

I‚Äôm a train wreck now so stopping seeing her isn‚Äôt going to alter that I don‚Äôt think. I‚Äôm hurting so much just having to see her and not get anything from her. It will rip my heart out cutting contact but I‚Äôm also aware that I‚Äôm already doing that. 

I can ask her to write that letter. She‚Äôs written me letters before - again making me feel special. She gave me a Christmas present that wasn‚Äôt a present. 

I think she‚Äôs already reached her breaking point. She doesn‚Äôt know what to do with me so she‚Äôs just pushing me away as much as possible while also trying to cater to my demands. She‚Äôll email me today because I‚Äôve demanded she do that and contact me after her holiday. She probably doesn‚Äôt have time for this. It will be time away from her children and husband. 

I‚Äôm still hoping we can cut and run and I‚Äôll be able to contact her one day and say thanks for everything you did for me and feel nothing for her any more. I know that may not be possible.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj

36,"Another thing she has told me, that I will be at some point the reason she quits. I can‚Äôt be the cause of that. Her husband has so far dealt with every bit of support she‚Äôs given me, at least as far as I know. She probably wouldn‚Äôt say if he was against it. I‚Äôm not sure what he‚Äôs actually like beyond that he likes and sticks to rules and is extremely rigid. So far all of her supervisors have told her she‚Äôs doing the right thing in staying with me and that this is something that can be worked out. They just say she needs to limit contact with because the amount we have is apparently unheard of. 

I‚Äôm not sure what it will take to have a proper goodbye with her. I‚Äôm struggling to think about that. I‚Äôm not ready for it even though I know we‚Äôre headed into that conversation on Saturday. I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs going to say. I‚Äôm not sure she doesn‚Äôt want to be my therapist any more. I think she‚Äôs just worried about doing more damage and isn‚Äôt sure how to fix it without me giving up my attachment and working with her to fix it. I‚Äôve asked her outright if she wants me to see someone else but she hasn‚Äôt responded. 

I don‚Äôt know what I need from her to move on. I guess I need her to be there until I find a therapist who I like and can work with. I don‚Äôt want to quit seeing her and then end up with a therapist like my last one who was more traumatising than helpful. That will send me straight back to her. 

I need her to help me define goodbye and work on that together with her. I think it‚Äôs something we both need. I know that this is going to be hard for her as well. Despite what I think of her right now I know she genuinely cares about me, even if she can‚Äôt love me, and she‚Äôs going to be upset about this ending as well. This needs to work for both of us. I can end sessions after our next one and go non contact but I can‚Äôt hurt her like that. It needs to be something we discuss and work towards together.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj

38,"Thanks for checking in :)

Saturday was a disaster. I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her and requested some silence but she wanted to talk about my thoughts for fixing this are wanting her to be unethical which isn‚Äôt possible. I understand that, but I don‚Äôt know how to deal with that pain. She‚Äôs suggested I engage in life but I know from past FP attachments that‚Äôs not useful to making this go away. 

We didn‚Äôt really talk much about me finishing therapy. She said when I‚Äôm ready to talk she‚Äôs willing to be the adult and end therapy and help me find someone else. I know she has a meeting with her supervisor this week though to get referrals for that. She said if she was going to get overwhelmed by me and stop therapy she would have already done it and she‚Äôll end it without my contribution if she really does think it‚Äôs harming me. I‚Äôm still looking for another therapist though. As soon as I get my schedule for work I‚Äôll be able to work around afternoon meetings and such. 

She checked in after session and sent me a meme telling me to take care and apologising for a hard session. This just adds to the special feeling and makes it harder to end therapy. 

You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm not okay. I‚Äôm massively overwhelmed. We did some emdr on where the feelings come from and why it‚Äôs so overwhelmingly painful that she‚Äôs saying she won‚Äôt be unethical for me but one session of that isn‚Äôt going to help it. I have work in 5 hours and hopefully being back after 6 weeks of holidays will help bring some sense of normalcy back to my life and decrease the need for her. Lunch break is the only time I‚Äôll have to think about her and I‚Äôll spend that with my colleagues.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
39,[deleted],,l3yszj
40,"Thanks :) Her behaviour always adds confusion and it‚Äôs what got us into this mess. She firmly believes that her ignoring email boundaries and supporting me when needed is what went wrong. I can‚Äôt throw at her everything she did because I don‚Äôt want to be horrible. 

She‚Äôs maintained that so far and hopefully she stands by it. She‚Äôs really big on the not doing me any harm front. It‚Äôs why she wants to end therapy she says. She keeps questioning why I keep coming back even if I‚Äôm getting harmed. I don‚Äôt think saying you‚Äôre my FP and you could get away with anything would help things. 

She said she‚Äôd be quite when she finished talking. You mean like if she could feel love in therapy she‚Äôd feel it for me. I don‚Äôt even know what that‚Äôs meant to mean. She told me she‚Äôs trained not to feel anything inappropriate for me and because of that and because she has a husband it‚Äôs easier for her not to feel anything for me at all. I call bullshit on this, both therapists and married people do the wrong thing despite that, what makes her so holy? 
I don‚Äôt know about her not being able to leave. She said she‚Äôd care if I left but that doesn‚Äôt suggest she feels anything. I care when my favourite work colleague isn‚Äôt there for the day, I don‚Äôt have feelings for them. 

Jealousy is so hard! Well done for being able to recognise it and know it‚Äôs not a healthy feeling. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre not doing great. It sounds like things are still really hard surrounding your old therapist. Getting over an FP is a difficult thing. It sounds like emotionally he took advantage of you and then realised he was screwing up. Ive asked the same question when I‚Äôve been terminated by therapists, what about me is so difficult that even the person I pay to deal with my problems can‚Äôt deal with them? 

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôll ever be closure. They‚Äôre going to maintain that everything they did was ethical and find ways to back that up. This is a big part of heartbreak, not just for people with BPD but for everyone. We kind of just keep going on until it hurts a little bit less. For me, if she leaves, this heartbreak will be like grieving someone who has died. It will be massive. 

I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs been for you but I learnt from my last FP that I needed almost a year before I wasn‚Äôt attempting to see him or talk to him any more. It took everything not to reach back out when he‚Äôd message me.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj
41,[deleted],,l3yszj
42,"My first day back was tiring haha. Because work is so full on all the time I just don‚Äôt get a chance to think about her really. I thought about her as I walked to work so I turned my music up to deafening can‚Äôt hear myself think levels which got rid of her pretty quickly. It‚Äôs such a shame I can‚Äôt do that every time I think of her. 

I don‚Äôt understand this either. I would love to tell her I get off on the pain but I know I‚Äôd just be trying to make her uncomfortable and it‚Äôs not true. I don‚Äôt think she understands that I can‚Äôt walk away. I‚Äôve been telling her this for years, she could literally do anything and I‚Äôd still forgive her and stay. It‚Äôs pathetic. She‚Äôs got me until wrapped around her finger and I don‚Äôt know how to get unwound. 

I‚Äôve been dumped, ghosted by people, and just outright rejected by people I thought I loved. It hurts harder coming from an FP. You can ask him whatever you want but the likelihood is he won‚Äôt answer because he knows things are done and refuses to acknowledge his part in that. 

I want her because I can‚Äôt have her. It‚Äôs a relationship I can‚Äôt pursue. Real relationships are terrifying, they require work, they have fights and compromise. The fantasy relationship I have with her in my head is perfect. By loving her and trying to get her I don‚Äôt have to open myself up to the possibility of real rejection because I know the rejection is already guaranteed. It still hurts but it hurts a hell of a lot less than being in a genuine relationship for years and then being dumped. An FP takes time to get over but breaking up with my last boyfriend took far longer to get over. I was extremely obsessed with him for years afterwards. I didn‚Äôt act on it, I left him alone and went non contact and it still took ages. If I‚Äôm being honest if I stopped seeing her and went non contact I‚Äôd dissociate hard enough that she wouldn‚Äôt exist in a month and I‚Äôd feel nothing for her. 

I told her the other day she isn‚Äôt perfect. I know she‚Äôs not but I still want her. Even if she said yes let‚Äôs do this and left her husband the imperfections in both of us would ruin the relationship within a month. She‚Äôs told me she gets into screaming matches with her husband where she calls him terrible names. The person she brings into therapy isn‚Äôt that and that‚Äôs what my idea of a relationship with her is based on. Sure she gets defensive a lot when I argue with her but she never yells back and never insults. In a relationship that would be way different. 

Does he have a reception? Call them and request he send it. Or email him and say you don‚Äôt want a response. I had a friend whose therapist dumped her and she sent an email just asking for everything to be sent to her new therapist and she wanted no further contact. 
I have mostly avoided telling her about my erotic transference, she knows it‚Äôs there, she knows I‚Äôm picturing things in session but we‚Äôve never detailed what that is. I‚Äôve never been out of it enough to actually have this discussion with her. I was meant to read it to her the week she said I should see someone else so it never happened. 

I have spent ages journaling about my toxic relationship with her. I have also created a table of what I want from her, where that comes from, what I want when I can think logically and how do I achieve that. Like minimising my want for a relationship is reminding myself exactly why that‚Äôs a bad idea. Reminding myself she‚Äôs nice enough to stick around even if I treat her the same way I treat her now and knowing it would slowly exhaust her and stress her out because in a relationship she can‚Äôt escape like she can in therapy. Right now, I‚Äôm just a client who she doesn‚Äôt have to feel anything for so can just leave at any point in time, in a relationship there‚Äôs some sort of love there and it makes leaving a lot harder. I don‚Äôt want to be the reason she‚Äôs too tired to handle life. I can‚Äôt love her the way she should be loved. Knowing that puts into perspective the reality of wanting a relationship with her and helps me understand why it‚Äôs not possible. And yet, I still can‚Äôt make it go away completely and I don‚Äôt know how to.",Ill_Meat_8195,l3yszj

I got myself the BPD workbook everybody talks about (I don't have the name en but it's a blue and white book). I already had trauma therapy ( in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy) and could apply a lot of things I had learn to heal from trauma, on my BPD. Such as radical acceptance, coping skills for high stress, and mindfulness (I found the concept of meditations stupid but apparently it helps to regulate a part of our brain that is overactive and from my experience it REALLY helps to get a different approach on things). As for group therapy, I tried it and they didn't force me to share stuff about myself. I only shared when and what I was comfortable saying. It helped me a lot against shame and guilt, because I realised that I am much harder on myself than others.

11,"Honestly the first thing is to accept stuff. If you reject your diagnose, or if you deny what has happened to you (trauma) or if you avoid feelings (typically doing drugs so you don't feel sad/lonely, tired, etc). Because suffering comes from resisting/avoiding pain. So you have borderline personality disorder, you have gone through trauma. Recovery will be hard, sometimes painful. I have an exercise that consists of recording myself saying stuff like ""the world in unfair"", ""I cannot control everything"" etc, and then answer out loud ""yes, it is"". It sounds dumb but it works. Also Kristin Neff has free self compassion exercises on her website https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/

IDK, I'd love to go to group DBT therapy, but I'm in the U.S. and my insurance does not cover it (and it's incredibly expensive.) One-on-one talk therapy doesn't necessarily lead to rapid life changes or emotional relief, in fact I'd say the opposite is true.",Veryaburneraccount,rsvcs9

However, I did successfully shift the way I think about identity. I still have moments of intense dpdr sometimes, but I've come to thinking that people don't exist as a static snapshot like I was looking before and I have to consciously decide what kind of person I am and act like it, and then over time those actions really have given me a better sense of control. I think having to acknowledge a lot of trauma and process my emotions around it also made a huge difference, but that took years of therapy. A combination of EMDR and DBT has helped and treatment started doing a lot more for me after I sought out a trauma-informed therapist.

the goal of that subreddit is to DEHUMANIZE us. They do not view us as human. One tactic they use to do this is distorting our lack of sense of self/ stable self image. Another post I saw was saying ‚Äúif you start to miss them/ feel bad for them, remember that the person you knew did not exist‚Äù. This kind of rhetoric is disgusting

5,"I think you are justified to be hurt by the rejection from that subreddit, for all the reasons you listed. And I think that subreddit is also justified to reject you. It very well may perpetuate stigma, however the purpose of that subreddit is not to repair what is broken in society, or to change the thoughts of those who are unfairly judgmental. Imo, the stigma is most perpetuated by the DSM‚Äôs failure to serve humans rather than insurance companies. 

There are stages to the recovery on both sides of this relational coin, and I have found that the separation of codependents is important for that recovery to begin for both. If someone needs a space where they are comforted by the thought that ‚Äúthe person who hurt me can‚Äôt be here‚Äù it provides the opportunity for free expression of pain without the fear of judgment and the addition of support. This is something we all need, and codependents early in recovery struggle to assert for themselves if challenged emotionally. But no one‚Äôs recovery looks the same. If it is not the place for someone to recover, they can find another place or use it as it‚Äôs helpful. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware that not every place is good for every person, and I see that place as a first step for many who are ill or as maladaptive as anyone else with a PD. We don‚Äôt see the people who leave or never join. With the B&W thinking apparent in that subreddit, my hope is that it‚Äôs a stone people take a step on through their grieving.

6,"I am recovered Cptsd and undiagnosed quiet BPD I suspect my ex partner is quiet BPD too. He got super mad and gave me the silent treatment for days because he wanted to meet up one evening and I couldn‚Äôt I explained that would be great but sorry I can‚Äôt as I had such a long shitty day at work and I just can‚Äôt meetup. Another time he got angry when I hadn‚Äôt replied to him message I was sleeping then next morning he bursted down at my place looking frantic demanded why I didn‚Äôt answer the night before, he clearly saw me sleeping in bed and my phone off he got angry and left. Later I texted him sorry I didn‚Äôt reply I was asleep and thank you for coming to check on me. Eventhough we made up after that incident he became distant, disconnected whenever we‚Äôd spend time together he‚Äôd be either on his phone scrolling or watching Netflix. He‚Äôd also frequently withhold intimacy and last time when I started making out with him he turned away saying his back hurts is super tired he said sorry he can‚Äôt. I just had to suck it up and not make a big deal but I felt something was off as our relationship was built on love and alot of displays of affection and strong intimacy.
from there it spiralled quick down hill. Every attempt to address issues and talk about my feelings were met with defensiveness, blame and silent treatment. 
He had broken up with me many times but quickly would come back apologise for his behaviour and say it stems from fear and self sabotage he would tell me how much he loves me and want to grow old with me, when he was in the love/ idealising faze he asked me to please never let go even if he threatened to break up and that I would just need to remind him of the pact we made to be together no matter what. 
Now I think he is in the splitting faze and I can‚Äôt get through to him.
I suspect (he has quiet BPD with core wound fear of abandonment) so after the last episode we had agreed that do couples therapy but the very next day when I wrapped my arms around him and kissed him tenderly he looked at me with ice cold eyes sat me and to my shock broke up with me. I tried to bring him back from this dark place he was in to remind him of our beautiful love story of our pact of doing therapy. But he wouldn‚Äôt snap out of it. I had an emotional break down and he hugged me so tight for hours I cried in his arms. I was shocked, confused and in so much pain for a whole week I couldn‚Äôt function and he‚Äôd text me everyday to ask about me and how I was doing. I love him and care alot about him but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. This is my first romantic relationship after long years of violent abusive marriage so I am learning how healthy relationships feel like look like. When he is in the loving self he treats me like a princess he is super considerate and affectionate with me. But when anything small happens he gets cold, distant and disconnects from me. He did mention he disassociates sometimes, self sabotage out of fear being not good enough and abandoned.

0,"I have one gigantic tip for you. Stop hiding your feelings! Stop hiding what you're thinking! This is your significant other, and it's a joint effort. It will never, ever work if you don't learn to be honest. Trust in yourself and trust him, he will not leave you if you tell him what you feel. Even if it seems absurd, even if you 100% know it's not true, tell him.

Trying to hide our thoughts and feelings will lead into them just exploding out of us like this. Be honest, show him this post. Say that you're scared. The best way to handle it is not to hide your feelings. Ask him what he's thinking, tell him you think he's going to leave you.

 When we are emotional we tend to interpret things and jump into conclusions we think are likely. I don't think your SO wants you to be gone at all. Panicking alone is the opposite of helping the situation! 

Someone already recommended the STOP-DBT skill and I'd highly also recommend looking into that for first aid.

 It's about leadership and setting an example, I have BPD, PTSD, MDD and anxiety and this is where I thrive, learning on the spot is almost like an adrenaline rush, and I'm more likely to learn it better and in more depth screwing up on my own, than learning from someone else which, gets you noticed fairly quickly and moving up the chain.

You and I are not alone.

&#x200B;

I am finally beginning to heal, feel better, stop living with more or less constant suicidal ideation, self-harm, experience emotions etc. I believe that you can heal as well. Keep trying to get into an intensive outpatient program (that's what you mean by IOP, right?). It was my dedicated participation in an intensive outpatient program for personality disorders which started my healing after many, many years of misery. I have a long way to go, but I have some tools to heal now, and I am getting better at using them.

If possible, find a therapist who has experience and is comfortable helping people who have personality disorders trauma, and all the kinds of suffering that we experience. More than anything, it was the individual therapy component of my IOP which got me going - I finally became able to look at my incredibly fucked-up childhood and how it influences who I am. I felt truly safe for the first time in my life, and I was able to make myself truly vulnerable. My first therapist became - for a time - the first mother I've ever had. I truly felt/feel that she loved me, and helped me begin to stop hating myself.

I know far, far too well about wanting to be held more than anything in the world. It's a terribly painful and lonely feeling, and likely the source of much of my pain. Last year, by chance, I found a quote which perfectly describes that feeling and the thoughts which accompany it. I still have difficulty reading it. For months, it would make me cry uncontrollably, but as my healing goes on, the less pain it causes me. These days, although it still causes me a lot of pain, it helps me know that I am not alone in feeling this way. The fact that the pain at reading it is, I think, a barometer of how well my healing is progressing. It's all still true, and I still want these things, but I don't get so filled with despair, sadness, grief and regret. I don't know if I will ever have those needs fulfilled, but I feel that I am beginning to be able to face and feel that pain, and that I can begin to parent myself in this way. I would use the term ""re-parent"", but since I was never parented to begin with, it would be the first time, whether someone else or I gave me with these experiences.

At this point, I recognize that I will not have this need filled by anyone else, by drugs or other forms of self-destruction, and that even if I begin to parent myself, the task will never be completed - but that's not only ok, it's true, and that whatever progress I make in parenting myself will give me even more strength and sense of self and compassion for self and others. I also have begun to know (not intellectually recognize) that the more I heal myself, the less self-loathing I will feel, the better my relationships will become, and the more I will begin to love myself.

I am sorry you are suffering so much, but if I can help in any way, please ask. The fact that you have posted here gives me hope for you - it's a level of will to recover and be vulnerable and seek emotional intimacy which I have never been able to summon (at least until very, very recently).

If anyone reading this needs help finding an IOP for personality disorders, please ask. In fact, maybe we - as a group - could create a master list of programs. If you are in NYC, I strongly recommend the [Center for Intensive Treatment of Personality Disorders.](https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/west/care/psychiatry/citpd) It changed my life (and is where I began working with the therapist I mentioned above). It is a time-limited program (up to 2 years), but it changed my life, as well as the lives of many of the other clients I met there.

So - the quote. I apologize if it is too painful to read. Even if it is, please remember that you are not alone, and that the reason it hurts so much is because you are not alone, and are understood.

""And he cries and cries, cries for everything he has been, for everything he might have been, for every old hurt, for every old happiness, cries for the shame and joy of finally getting to be a child, with all of a child's whims and wants and insecurities, for the privilege of behaving badly and being forgiven, for the luxury of tenderness, of fondness, of being served a meal and being made to eat it, for the ability, at last, at last, of believing a parent's reassurances, of believing that to someone he is special despite all his mistakes and hatefulness, because of all his mistakes and hatefulness.""

I had more than one therapist tell me that I truly needed to get away from my mom for at least a year in order to heal. I started listening after the second therapist, but I couldn‚Äôt really execute getting away and separating our lives completely enough until about five years ago. It‚Äôs been worth every bit of struggle I had to go through to pull it off.

2) I did 2 full rounds of DBT and continue with therapy to this day. I‚Äôve gone from two appointments a week plus group to one individual session every two weeks. I didn‚Äôt talk to my therapist for a month over the holidays and I didn‚Äôt even notice. I was with both of my most triggering family members over the holiday - nothing happened. No outbursts or meltdowns, no nothing. I don‚Äôt know exactly how they felt but I maintained a peace and calm the whole time and I never could have done that without therapy.

3) Exercise/nutrition/declutter - it may seem that only the first two are related (and their benefits obvious) but we are a sensitive group and the environment affects the mind more than a lot of people realize. Eat your fruits and veg, shower, brush your teeth, sleep as well and as regularly as you can and those things alone can make anyone feel better.

1,"That's a lovely thought...but it's misguided at best and delusional at worst.

It is absolutely a disorder: it's in the goddamn name.  There is more and more evidence that it is a genetic abnormality in the brain that can cause this disorder, and there is no cure.  Let me repeat: NO.  CURE.  The only proven effective treatment is to learn mental karate, the wax-on-wax-off moves for your mind so that you can cope.  Someday, those techniques will be so automatic that they seem like they're not being done.  But mindfulness that you basically have emotional super-strength that if not rigidly controlled will harm others is a MUST.

BPD is not a set of ""learned behaviors.""  It is a disease.  You do deserve time and love and consideration and all that, but so does someone in a wheelchair from cerebral palsy.  Same level of disability.  And it is a disability, make no mistake.

The nice thought above is a dangerous way to think.  It leads one to believe that there is nothing wrong with you, that treatment isn't valid or necessary.  That is a lie.

Sorry for the rant.  We're all beautiful in our way, and it may sound like I'm being negative, but I'm really not.  I'm being careful.  I have a harmful wild animal in my brain wrecking up the place, and I'm trying to domesticate it.  I like to think of it as a Moose, it makes me laugh.  But a moose can kill you.

I got older but my brain was still stuck on survive and bc of that I was seeing the ghosts of what I endured in ppl around me even in times when it wasn't that way in reality.

In order for us to reach a point of understanding that allows for compassion, we need to be honest - we often cannot or do not understand our reactions, but we can learn to be mindful and manage them with effort and time. It‚Äôs the same for someone who‚Äôs say, autistic. It is in no way their fault, but they are the person responsible for learning the tools to manage it as best they can.",hustlehustle,11qxi0q
9,"I hear you and I understand your pov - do I believe that personalities can be ‚Äúdisordered‚Äù? no. it‚Äôs called a disorder because a bunch of psychiatrists decided so, if you look into the history of how the DSM was created, a lot of it wasn‚Äôt based on scientific evidence - it was based on who had the strongest voice in the room.

the symptoms are very real, the suffering is very real and there is of course an element of nature to it. do I believe that hypersensitivity (and other nature elements) can be cured? no. but I do believe that coping strategies we developed when we were younger can be replaced with new ones with A LOT of time and effort. I don‚Äôt believe there is a ‚Äúhealed‚Äù or ‚Äúcured‚Äù, I believe we are always healing and growing, it never really ends (for all humans).

I‚Äôm a therapist with BPD who works with clients with this diagnosis, this is just my opinion ‚ù§Ô∏è I do believe that we have a long way to go in the mental health field with understanding BPD and these other disorder labels but I also believe that telling people with trauma that there personalities are disordered is harmful.",Jembaby24,11qxi0q

I don‚Äôt think Autism should be labelled as a disorder either - I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a disorder, it‚Äôs a different way of experiencing the world which isn‚Äôt wrong or ‚Äúdisordered‚Äù.

0,"stick with it if you truly want this career. im in the same boat as you as well. have bpd but want to b a psychotherapist or smtg in that area. 

my advice is while youre studying classes, make sure youre also getting better. im not sure where youre at rn so maybe what im saying wont b as ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù but try doing dbt courses, r/dbtselfhelp is also a fantastic sub that offers help from others, but also many many many resources like websites, work sheets, videos, etc. 

imo, having bpd allows us to really & truly connect with someone who is struggling. we understand & feel their emotions (maybe not everyone feels them, but for me i can feel their emotions & sense when someone is upset, angry, happy etc.) allowing us to b more help than someone who just uses logic in that field. of course, its a good balance of both, however, too strongly of one or the other can b a little tricky; general statement as well. 

while working towards lessening severity of symptoms & learning how to manage them & stay there (its a up & down journey though, but its worth it & the downs only make us stronger), & learning what youre doing rn & eventually getting into that career, itll balance itself out. it will prevent what others say or feel or are going thru not b as much of a trigger; youll know what to do in those kind of circumstances to prevent it from debilitating you, while also helping the patient. 

you can do this & honestly learning abt psychology alone will help anyone who struggles w any mental health issue. you learn how the brain works, why people behave the way they do, etc. itll give you more awareness while youre helping yourself.

growth mindset & a positive attitude will help a lot negating those negative, discouraging thoughts. what ifs are what ifs for a reason :). it takes time to get there & work, but giving yourself that time is so important. remember to not overwhelm yourself too much at once as well. that can put those bad thoughts back into a place they dont belong. step by step, one thing at a time.",,18ajdv8
1,"Hey there! I‚Äôm almost done my degree in Social Work and currently working as a community counsellor. I‚Äôve lead DBT groups. I‚Äôve also struggled with not only imposter syndrome but feeling like I cant handle it either. 

Self compassion and self management are extremely important. You need to be very on top of managing and being aware of what you can handle. My advice is to advocate for yourself, and when you‚Äôre done your program to start slow. Take on part time clientele not full time. Do online if it works better for you. Have your own therapist, and the cliche eat, sleep, and take care of your own needs. 

Personally, I‚Äôve reconsidered my entire life plan of what I can and cannot handle and after completing this degree and starting to be a therapist myself, realized I cannot have children on top of it, so I‚Äôve made the decision to be child free. That‚Äôs a personal choice for me. Your accommodations and balance might look different. But figuring out what it is and sticking with it is so important. And also, you CAN do it.

Anytime I feel anger or have to end a relationship that I view is harming me I feel a lot of guilt and shame at first.

Instead now my anger comes out when I feel like I've been greatly disrespected and it 100% comes out over my kids and husband when they are targeted. 

I haven't had to end a lot of relationships or friendships. Conviently enough the relationships I ended were due to be too toxic and recognizing that their behaviors influenced me too and caused me to develop bad habits that took me years to break in my late teens/early 20s. Despite the guilt, each time I've removed these people from my life I've grown more in my recovery which is helping me fight against it.",WanderingFoxWitch,175yhrw

I explain that while I will mess up I will always come back to apologize, if I don‚Äôt that is their cue to leave immediately. I also explain that just because I have this disorder doesn‚Äôt mean my actions are excusable thus they shouldn‚Äôt brush off any abuse they may face with the thought that ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle myself‚Äù.

Ultimately it‚Äôs your personal choice but I would say if you‚Äôre still in the beginning of recovery and you‚Äôre still face a lot of symptoms and are having a hard time learning to cope it‚Äôs best to let your FP know.

I think you should acknowledge the attachment, and figure out how to transform it into a healthy connection.   


Figure out what the issues are- are you codependent? Are you obsessing over them to the point where it drowns out your other interests? etc  
Then, figure out how to solve those issues, one by one. Google lists of tips, talk to your therapist if you have one, etc.   


I don't personally think you should tell them, because a lot of the time (in my experience) that puts a great deal of responsibility onto them.

0,"For me it sounds like you have heated arguments and that you both have issues in dealing with anger. If this is his behavior only when he is angry, then I wouldn't be super concerned *if you both are working on things.*

The thing is, BPD or no, people do wrong things when they're angry. You're right to point these out and these should be things _he_  should be working on, because obviously they are not functional ways of venting anger or frustration.

*I* don't find this abusive as long as it's not a constant thing outside of anger & he apologized for things like calling you stupid. If it's in the heat of the moment and apologies are issued from both sides, it's just unfortunate losses of control that don't feel good for either. Breaking things is acceptable as long as the aggression is NEVER directed at you. 

Keep working on them, the both of you. And for the love of everything, NEVER hide something he does continuously and what bothers you. I guarantee it will come out in the worst moments and in all the wrong ways. Keep open communication, always.

Remember that he's not allowed to call you stupid or the things you say as useless or dumb, whether or not he is angry or not. He needs to realize this and apologize. He also needs to work on himself to be able to stop this behavior when it becomes too bad. Naturally the same applies for you, too.

Calling out bad things we do during conflict is not the best idea. I'd recommend when things get heated, just take a break until both of you calm down. Then resume the conversation when neither of you is that heated up anymore and are able to keep up rational responses. Try not to lose your head. I know it's easier said than done but absolute control over every reaction and minute observation is the key.

Discussing what each other did wrong WILL definitely just end up escalating things in the heat of the moment, so definitely at all costs avoid that. And what it comes to the 'gaslighting', I don't think personally that it's gaslighting. Gaslighting is something done maliciously and with the intent to deceive. Your bf seems to honestly be under the impression, that calling some action stupid is not the same thing as calling someone stupid.

We all do dumb things, we all do bad things yet they don't make us dumb or bad people. I understand it feels bad, and therefore your boyfriend should work on not saying those. But I think in this case it's about him not understanding your side and you not understanding his. Not intentional maliciousness.

When discussing who did what, the main things are 1. Both of you need to be calm. 2. Both of you need to be willing to accept each other's side. 3. Good communication. 4. Do NOT accuse. 5. Use phrases like 'when x happened, I felt belittled', NOT 'you belittled me the entire fight!'

So remember when discussing what went wrong: stay in the facts. What happened. How it made you feel. How it made you think. Do not turn your thoughts or feelings into facts. Just because you FEEL insulted, doesn't mean he tried to insult you. Try to see his side too. Remember that y'all are meant to be each other's attorneys, not prosecutors!

1,"Hi there I'm in DBT and still new. I'd say for your first difficulty, that's where the dialectical part comes in. Yes we could all die tomorrow BUT we need to carry on as if we won't because both options exist. I struggle with death a lot too. 

I think my therapist would respond to the second part by saying check the facts. Is this something that happens all the time? When you mention how it makes you feel does he sincerely apologize? If so, you have to move on but if you can't, from whatever it is, you need to break up. Hardest thing ever for me to learn. Even if he doesn't apologize or is huffy about it, is he having a bad day? Do you need space? 

Just my hot take from what I have learned so far :)",emelre,17jkbv2

8,i do understand this perspective because i‚Äôve been through a toxic hit and miss situation ship before however this was prior to my diagnosis which ever since getting i have been relatively hesitant towards dating so the choice of us not being in a relationship is shared because i don‚Äôt want to date until i have more control over my own life and there‚Äôs a bunch of other things too like school and what not but i feel that once i‚Äôm more able to control myself i‚Äôll feel more open to dating it‚Äôs just the overcoming my symptoms which i need help with as i‚Äôm still new to therapy for my bpd so i just want the process to be as fast as possible so i can feel stable enough to be in a relationship,L3Tm3live,16vso11

0,"Gonna play devil's advocate here. Telegram is used for a lot of things, I had an account I used for a while without people added on it, for example.   


If he's not giving you reasons to think he is cheating, not being even secretive with his phone, you're saying he's present for you and the kids... (No, being defensive about it even if you calmed down it's a normal reaction about feeling ""controlled"" over something small) 

In this case I think you need to process the feelings (take your time, try to think about it in a realistic way, journal about it, talk to your partner calmly about it when you're both in a good headspace, tell him why it's important, etc...) and just let go of them. Don't ruin your family that you're happy with just for a small trigger of your brain. Cheating ""back"" won't hurt anyone but you, and your kids in case things go down...)   


Also, very important...don't feel bad just because you had this small hiccup on the road. Doesn't mean your not balanced, just that bpd is unpredictable and no matter what some triggers can just...trigger.",Aureolindaisy,16zm5er
1,"The real problem is fear.  Fear is not evidence of truth.  He could be doing something worse than cheating but you don't care because you are not afraid of him doing that thing.

Just because I'm afraid of bees doesn't mean every bee I encounter is going to sting me.  The fear makes me behave wild as if every bee was going to sting.  I still don't trust bees enough to hold them, but I can walk by knowing that every time I'm afraid one will sting me I know it probably won't.

The reality of the world is that cheaters are going to cheat.  You will find out about it someday and you will be sad move on with your life.   Or they are not cheating and you will move on with your life as well but together.

If you are really serious about seeing if he is cheating, save everyone the drama and hire a private investigator.  Otherwise, process the fear to calm it down so you can both work on having a good relationship.

Research evidence based decision making.",circediana,16zm5er
2,maybe he's just doing drugs that's what telegram is known for in my community,Routine_Building5893,16zm5er
3,"I think what would help in this situation is to be open with your partner about what happened. I'm sure that's not the problem here but in a conflict it's always useful to be open about what you were thinking. 

It' s easy to get stuck inside one's own head, I know I have a strong tendency to do so! And in your situation you might want to ask yourself not where YOU are going with this but where WE, as a couple and as a family are going from here. Because this affects and has affected both of you it should be solved by you both, together.

4,"I know that you know you're in the wrong on this, at least that's what it sounds like in the post. But yeah. Him saying ""I don't need to justify myself"" is actually one of the healthiest responses to you accusing him of cheating over him having an account on a random messaging app that signed in 1 month ago.

0,"From what I have learned in years of therapy, having BPD is like having emotions everyone else has but they're typically swayed to the extremes or sometimes will be overlapping or contradictory. Add in the fear of abandonment and it's pretty abnormal to the general populace. If you are feeling distressed by what your friend considers ""totally normal"" then I'd assume that your friend may also suffer from some sort of emotional irregularity but either isn't receiving mental health support or might even be in denial about it. (Or is just uneducated on what BPD actually is).",ScarySuggestions,18d4qg7
1,"Yeah BP is dysfunctional and damaging. I had a friend with serious Schizophrenia and I used to assure him that he was ok. I wasn‚Äôt myself diagnosed as BPD at the time, so knew little about mental illness its causes and effects. It‚Äôs not so important that you get your friend to understand it. It‚Äôs important to research and understand it yourself and how to overcome the issues and challenges. One thing I noticed about myself is the emotional dysregulation/sharp mood swings. Being able to break it down into simple terms to your friend like ‚ÄòI have lots of mood swings‚Äô. Is easier than just saying ‚ÄòI have boarderline‚Äô. Here‚Äôs a diagram that shows the difference in brain function and a few other facts, some times I email it to friends to help explain. https://medium.com/invisible-illness/its-all-in-your-head-borderline-personality-disorder-and-the-brain-c14b66eb0966",DiStUrBEdMeLoN,18d4qg7
0,Try reading Self-Therapy by Earley and do IFS. Get in touch with the badly pained part inside you and let it start unburdening all of the accumulated sadness within you. It gave me the most hope I‚Äôve had in a long time!,Uncommonify,18eul1m
1,"it‚Äôs okay to have an anxious attachment style so long as you‚Äôre also fulfilling your own needs and being your own person outside the relationship. 

Now as for your partner, I feel like I could kinda tell (i‚Äôm making an assumption, could be wrong) by the way you were typing you were trying to not make him look bad, which I get because you love him. You should feel okay to be sad around him, but he shouldn‚Äôt be the only thing making you happy. If you feel like he is playing on your emotions, take some time to evaluate how and why a little more, and make conclusions for yourself. And if he knows leaving you hanging like that is gonna upset you, he should be a little more attentive. A text takes 2 seconds. 

some things are vague in this post so I can‚Äôt like confirm for sure if your relationship is super toxic but you can! And recovery is possible. And alone time, although really difficult, is very beneficial. Warming your own soul. 

In a bpd book I read they talk about how we think ‚Äúothers act upon me, therefore I am‚Äù. And when people aren‚Äôt there to love us at all times, we can be inescapable voids. So when you are alone maybe ask him to try reassuring you more, sticking to what he says he‚Äôs gonna do, and also filling up your cup. Snuggle in bed, go for a walk, watch your show, make yourself happy, even if it‚Äôs hard. Hang out with your pet or cat. Knit/crochet, whatever makes you happy, but while you 2 are apart. I hope this helps!",haldove666,18eul1m
0,"I would recommend Dr. Daniel Fox‚Äôs channel on YouTube. If there‚Äôs something specific that‚Äôs BPD-related, chances are he‚Äôs already done a video on it. I would also recommend researching Dialectical Behavior Therapy and work out of those workbooks.

If you can find any DBT specialists in your area I would recommend going to them for therapy. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I hope what I‚Äôve shared will be able to help.",Dependent-Childhood,nemm8c
1,Dr. Daniel Fox has a great work book and amazing YouTube videos!,,nemm8c
2,"The advice to look into neurodivergency is really good. There are some neuro and autism subs here. Be wary of the adhd sub tho as the mods are strict and somewhat narrow minded. 

Typically, BPD and neurodivergencies are handled with Dialectic Behavioural Therapy, usually referred to as just DBT. 

I‚Äôm recently diagnosed as well and was signed up for a five week DBT intro course through the government healthcare here. 

I would suggest immediately asking and looking into local DBT programs. Having access to a social worker if possible will also help. The biggest issue with social work is often not that there aren‚Äôt enough resources, but rather, the resources available are nearly impossible to locate or access without the support of someone familiar with them.",greendippypoo,nemm8c
3,"I like Insight Timer for meditation and sleeping. it's a free app and there are a lot of free things you can listen too, and it's well organized. when I have a bad time sleeping I'd actually listen to a bedtime story (yes some of them are made for adults) and they help a lot.

Disassociating and thinking rationally. 
I don't wanna allow myself to be mean to me and talk me into dumb shit. 
I've been dealing with those thoughts as well lately. But what is it worth? You not gonna be there to hear what others are saying about you. So why not stay and try to make a good influence on others.

6,"If I were in your situation, I would start with investigating neurodivergence, specifically the way autism and ADHD present in women and girls, and see if either of those diagnoses explain any of your symptoms. The best way to do that is to see neurodivergent women describe their own experiences on TikTok. 

Those three conditions occur together alongside each other at suspiciously high rates. But autism and ADHD are much better researched than BPD, and there is much less social stigma attached, so it‚Äôs easier to get the help you‚Äôll need. 

Support for autism or treatment for ADHD won‚Äôt necessarily resolve the symptoms that led to your BPD diagnosis, but it will make it a hell of a lot easier for you to do the hard work to address what‚Äôs going on. (If you have either of these associated conditions).

ADHD in particular is affected by estrogen levels. You mention symptoms worsening with pregnancy ‚Äî maybe something to tell your doc to convince them to evaluate you. 

Even if you don‚Äôt pursue outside treatment or support, understanding what is happening in your brain when you do certain behaviors, and that it happens to other people to, can help you keep working towards recovery in even your toughest moments.",arithmetok,nemm8c

8,"About your emotional health team, (psychiatrist, therapist, any DBT) are you saying you don't have access to healthcare, or that your health insurance has no one competent in their network?

Secondly, if you've done any DBT, I'd ask you how you're doing with mindfulness (not sure if it applies here, but I'm not a doctor) and how REST and self-soothing are going.",HugeTaters,nemm8c

10,"This is such good advice. I‚Äôm wondering how OP was diagnosed with authority if no professionals in her area feel confident treating BPD. Meds, especially during pregnancy, seem an odd recommendation. In my area no one would turn away a young, pregnant, recently-diagnosed BPD patient! I don‚Äôt understand this stigma, or how those who hold this stigma can be good at diagnosis? Anyway. I agree with this advice ‚Äî seek out support for a co-occurring disorder. For many of us it‚Äôs eating disorders. Those who counsel eating disordered patients will invariably be treating BPD. Definitely not wishing any of these conditions on anyone, but it‚Äôs the unfortunate state of the current care.",,nemm8c

1,"Try CBT it helpes me a lot with my rage outbursts.. have not have them for pretty much 2 years... rate your anger and deep breaths, really deep breatgs. Instead of punching inhale as hard as you can for as long as you can... this will disconnect yourself from the rage",Mackwiss,17312wh
2,"Here are my top things that helped me more than anything else to better respond to my emotions, including rage:
- mindfulness - i went to a course of MBSR, it is 8 weeks long and helps you work to distance yourself from the mind, and get some wiggle room while experiencing emotions. There are online ones. If you cant afford it I recommend reading ""Full catastrophe living"" by J Kabat Zinn, who has invented this course. Also, there are relatively cheaps apps like Headspace which base on it.
- particularly for rage I recommend reading some  books from Lowen's body work therapy. It is powerful thing and sometimes can be health hazard (e.g. For heart or blood pressure, so should be practiced with therapists or practicioners
- in general getting into a healthy routine helps you cause it gives your body fuel to withstand pressure, so gym, sleeping schedule, getting sunlight after walking up, good diet, supplementation of magnesium and others, are good for you
- there are DBT workbooks for patients and they provide a lot of useful skills for emotion resillience and coping
- generally planning your stay at your family with some clear goals (saving, budgeting, having clear steps for a crisis, like a plan whom to call, where to stay,somewhere on a piece of paper) will be helpful for you to get through this period 
-understanding your boundaries and treating living with the family as exercise is a good strategy - write down what is non negotiable for you and if it happens you need a strategy to get through it. Also write down what is just annoying, but is not a hill youd die at. For example, abuse is a no go- you need a place to stay if it happens and it should be agreed in advance. Mom being annoying about a tattoo - can be just a situation to practice setting a boundary and taking care of yourself. Just examples from the top of my head
-in general if you have a lot of emotions, self care, and feeling your endorphins is important. So planning nice little pleasures. Every day you do something nice for youself - a Bath, a mindful breakfast, a meeting with a friend. Practice paying as much attention to it as you can, squeeze it as a lemon. Then if you feel like you are losing control, try to remember this moment from the day or the previous day.
-deep breathing. This is understated. It is something that dissolves your emotions in second. Deep breathe for 3-5 secs into your belly. Then release breathout for 5-7 secs. Slowly feel like your feelings go away with this. Schedule a phone reminder to do it 3 times  here and there during a day. Helps to not have too much emotions built up.

3,"I live just as healthy gamer suggests. I didn't know I was, but through trial and error it just worked itself out. I can realize I'm disproportionately getting angrier than the situation calls for.  

There are somedays where someone's being aggressive with me and my PTSD flies into rage mode, but otherwise I just stopped taking responsibility for any and all situations that are stressful that I don't have to be in. 

If I can't leave them I just try to minimize the amount of participation in these events. Understanding psychology more and why people behave the way they do helped a ton. Now when I see someone acting like an asshat I just realize it's a bad look for them and other people can see that too.",,17312wh

1,"My mom has a friend/neighbor like this.  They have known each other for many many years (probably 20+ at this point).  His husband died maybe 10 years ago now and my mom really noticed a change in the way his overall demeanor and conversation topics have changed entirely.  She jokes with me now that since Paul's husband died, she is the new ""victim"" of his nagging.  He reminds her how she needs to exercise, notices when she leaves, wants to talk while she's walking her dog, the list kinda goes on.

I asked her why she still deals and her answer to me was that she thinks he's lonely and is basically at an age where changing the \*way\* he talks ain't gonna change.  He's awkward but really wants to connect, but is so fucked up mentally that it almost always comes out wrong.  She gave him the benefit of the doubt and extra effort because we knew at the end of the day Paul was an excellent individual with a heart of gold and he was her friend.

I'm not saying your neighbor even deserves a sniff (maybe not because she sounds like she smells JK), but there's most likely something less sinister going on.  She might honestly very much enjoy your company and her day is made better by your conversations with each other.",FlipMick,17qyzka

1,"Hello and welcome! Thank you for sharing your struggles and thoughts on continuing to become a better person. I think this community is a good start, and I agree with your thoughts on communication and being very self aware. I used to not be self aware and that was detrimental. Also, acceptance is such a hard thing to do as well. It includes accountability for your behavior. Any light shed on coping is great as well. I quit drinking again and I started walking, keeping up with meditation even for five minutes. I have a gratitude journal as well. Deep breathing really helps when you have those big emotions. Also being outside in nature when you can in general. I will say I have never been diagnosed with BPD. However, I was diagnosed with cPTSD and misdiagnosed as Bipolar 1. I know both cPTSD and BPD have some similarities and I plan on going back to therapy to see if maybe I do actually have BPD instead of cPTSD. I have always had suicidal ideation and was very impulsive and can be with my sexual behavior and just not thinking the risks through...(I've been abstinent now for almost a year and a half and it's been really good)  I used to cut all the time in my adolescence and young adult stages. I have a couple favorite people. And when I get triggered and I have an overwhelming feeling of emotion I feel like splitting happens. Especially when I feel like abandonment is there. And it could be they did nothing wrong but a word was said or not said, same with their action... I recently blew up on my internet friend and felt insanely awful and told them to move on because I don't need them in my life anyway and I'm fully capable of living without them. The next morning I profusely apologized and told them it was not their fault and I push people away sometimes for no reason and my behavior is no excuse to treat people that way and that I am working on being better as a person. They were gracious to me and I still have them in my life...I hope you're able to find some BPD self aware folks too! Makes one feel less lonely and validated. Know you matter!

So much so that my therapists could not help me any further with new information or coping skills. I've changed dramatically in the past 3 years since my first notion of having bpd. 

Being self aware is something that I actually struggle with, though it does keep me from doing other impulsive things that others do. It's a constant cycle of gaslighting myself, meltdowns, calming myself, and rationalizing.

3,"It's wonderful that you're trying therapy, even with your discomfort! It definitely isn't easy, so it's great that you're giving it a chance in spite of how you're feeling.

I agree with the user who says recovery is a constant process. I had a couple of years of therapy before my symptoms were well-managed, but if I have gaps in treatment it can be harder to maintain that. 

I don't think there were huge marks of progress. It was small things -- maybe there was a trigger in my life I didn't lose my shit over, or fewer bad days, or being able to do things I hadn't done before. I slowly edged into feeling okay. Eventually I had bigger milestones like going back to college and being able to work, but that was a long way into that process. It was a very gradual improvement. 

I think being in group and individual therapy helped me a lot. I don't talk a lot in therapy groups, but it gave me the sense of solidarity, knowing other people were going through what I was. If something in group was a big thing I wanted to dig into more, I could bring it up in an individual session.

I had a lot of luck with affirmations for distress tolerance when I was really upset. Things like ""This hurts now, but I can make it through this"" or ""I'm trying my best"" when I felt bad about my progress, or generally reminding myself that mistakes I made weren't the end of the world. Focusing on those over and over gave me *something* to focus on when my thoughts were racing, and I think they made me a lot kinder to myself, since my go-to was to internalize every bad thing in my life.

I also really like the ""opposite to emotion action"". There are so many times I didn't feel like doing things, especially when I was going through my divorce and things like that. The more I pushed myself to do therapy, to not push people out of my life, and to try things I was afraid of, the less I felt my mental illness was crippling me. I think I also felt more valuable as a person, too, because I became more productive and was able to see what I had to offer as a friend, a worker, a daughter, so on, which made it harder to feel that people would be better off without me or like I was a burden to the people I love.",torgoboi,jx84f2

When things get real chaotic you can rely on these boundaries keeping you from going too far. For example one of mine is no yelling, if I‚Äôm getting flustered, as soon as I raise my voice I know ‚Äúyep time to walk away and cool down‚Äù. Or no plotting, if I catch myself plotting against someone else, I leave whatever room I‚Äôm in and go for a walk or play guitar. The idea is having objective things you can look for to point to and be like ‚Äúthis is not okay‚Äù, and finding ways to disrupt those thought patterns and sublimate or redirect towards something healthier.

1,"I struggle with this too, the exact same way.

Put faith that they are not trying to hurt you. Some will hurt you, but you will see it and you‚Äôll be okay in the end even if they did. Realize that they are also human and living their life with their hardships as you are. Obviously that doesn‚Äôt make trusting them any easier, but it brings them down to your level rather than thinking they are above you in some sort of way trying to hurt you. Try and blindly trust them until someone gives you a reason not to. Try to be forgiving and realize we are all human and make mistakes. No one is perfect.

the last time similar thing happened to me i felt betrayed and lonely

if this helps, i am happy to share what helped me:

\- reaching out to others, sharing my loneliness with others. meaning they are not supposed to save me, just listen to me and be by my side at least a few min. this helps if people don't start giving advices and just hear you

\- my therapist once told me that no one will accept and love me 100%. but their 70%, 50% or even 15% is still worth appreciating. knowing this helped when my boyfriend said that he needs another close friend except me 

\- i think after my most painful breakup i realized that i don't have enough friends (or nice people around) and started 'working' on it. in \~2 years i have got way more good people who treat me well. dbt course (the part about social skills) helped with that. this helped me get rid of needing one favourite person. ofc my boyfriend will always be my closest friend, but i can't expect him to accept and love me at all times

\- a few years ago i realized that having a 'favourite person' is not a healthy contact for me. i will settle for a longer distance with my friends, because i want this relationship to last.

0,"I'm gonna be that guy here:
I think we have to reframe our thinking on BPD. We can't necessarily control it - I think this thinking leads to self harm and self medication through substances and validation and trying to control it leads to loss of self for the sake of the partner. All we can do is ensure we're not reacting with our emotional response out of control and hurting people. Over time you'll get better at recognizing when you're disregulated and what you need to do to regulate yourself. 

It's hard. Very hard to learn. But we are tough cookies in our right, just in different way than most can see and you will be able to heal and get better at dealing with and coping with your bpd and learn to live a more stable life! Takes time, patience and work. 

Remember, just because you have to be patient with yourself doesn't mean others have to be. So when people decide to take a break with you, remember, you are on your path, and to learn from your experiences. Ego is huge with validation. It is part of your growth 

During episode:
Separate yourself from your emotion, inspect it, understand it, and then connect with it again and try to work with it. Communicate about the emotion. You will feel silly likely doing so. And often the partner isn't able to appropriately assist in understanding our disregulation, nor should they have to. It is our job to work on our disregulation for the most part with a professional, barring exceptions of course. 

So I'll say, to work on it you should find a therapist who specializes in BPD or one that is willing to work with you, learn dbt, learn how to recognize episodes and dysregulation as first steps. Learn about your hobbies and what makes you, you. Journal about it. Try to identify who you are and remind yourself during disregulation. Do things you enjoy during disregulation (you may not enjoy it at that moment, but you gotta try to get out of that emotional reactive mindset).

The rest sorta comes with time and action (mistakes, unfortunately).



A good example for myself, is when I've been catering too much to my partner I find that I become more upset easily because Im losing my identity.  Not sure if that relates at all, but a point of comparison for why I would think about who I am as a person and my hobbies.

Lastly, you will make it to a better place. It seems dark right now but there's light on the other side. You got this",suberdoo,16pmakg
1,"I think you should listen to your instincts here. In many case, having a relationship IS the trigger for many of the challenging mental and behavior issues associated with BPD.

If you feel these behaviors only show up in a relationship then yeah, that makes a lot of sense. In the right situation, BPD is manageable outside of a relationship and people can lead reasonably balanced lives.

Out of a relationship, a person with BPD may not even display enough criteria to be diagnosed with BPD, as if the criteria lies dormant until a relationship starts, until that feeling of falling in love hits. It is really a mixed bag and every person is different.

That doesn‚Äôt mean BPD wasn‚Äôt impacting family, friendships and other aspects of life before, it is just people have a way of rationalizing and just making things work.

When a relationship starts, that is when things could potentially get harmful for everyone and escalate beyond one‚Äôs imagination; especially when people are not aware of the potential diagnosis, educating themselves and seeking treatment.

I commend you on seeing a therapist and challenging yourself to learn more. You should be proud of yourself, it is a massive step.

This could be a very big opportunity for you. All the behaviors you are bravely describing about yourself are, frankly, dysfunctional and not the basis of a healthy relationship. However, the relationship itself has given you the opportunity to recognize something you may have been low-key dealing with for a long time and maybe making excuses for and not doing anything about.

That is the space I feel you need to spend a lot of time reflecting on.

To simply tell you to stop behaving in the dysfunctional ways that you have described is almost meaningless when those behaviors are driven by a behavioral disorder and deeply ingrained trauma in your neuron network.

This is not to imply you do not have control. The implication is more you do not have mindful awareness in these moments. Everything just seems right and justified at the time. With treatment, you learn to identify in real time the emotional states and impulses that lead to the unwanted behavior and better manage it over time.

It is a lot of work unfortunately and you are ultimately responsible, even if you feel overwhelmed and not in control at times. You‚Äôre asking the right questions and learning now so there is no going back, but know the investment in yourself will be worth it for you and everyone who loves you.

No matter what, if you feel you are not in control of the individual behaviors, you are in control of making the choice to step back from the relationship out of love for yourself and your partner and to seek treatment, such as DBT, and be mindful of your behavior and triggers as you step back into a relationship after treatment.

With that said, you have not technically been diagnosed with BPD so keep learning and continue to be as honest with yourself as you can about your behavior.

I wish you the very best with your path ahead.",off-leash-pup,16pmakg
2,"I feel ya here. We have the tendency to push people away even when we actually need them. Talk to your therapist about some of these situations and perhaps you two can come to solutions :)

The rest of the borderline population are actually very very vulnerable, naive...child-like. Gullible. People who are easily swayed. So it's easy for a doctor to come up with some ""breakthrough technique"" such as ""DBT"",  that costs an arm and leg, and try to pitch it to people with this diagnosis. 

People with APD and NPD, even though they are flawed personality, wise tend to be a little bit more sharper, and a little bit more clever, because they have more cognitive empathy. They're not gonna fall for that. So the mental health industry sort of leaves them alone. They let them seek to help when they want to.

We resist treatment because it's so hard to accept a diagnosis that gets instantly written off as abusive and difficult. But yes, it's so much worse for other cluster Bs and that's fucked up. Someone who has been diagnosed with NPD and/or ASPD who is sincerely seeking treatment and is begging to get better already has a huge indicator for success because if you can get to the point of accepting it, you've already done something that is statistically against you and that's life-changing. 

The good news is that more and more research and people-first education for providers is shifting how the profession receives and treats cluster Bs. The overlap between NPD and BPD indicates that they're both highly misunderstood trauma disorders and probably two ends of the exact same spectrum. Don't give up the hunt for a therapist until you find someone informed enough to have the ""well *actually* we call it cptsd now"" conversation and focus on healing your trauma and addressing the symptoms of it that present as a ""personality disorder"" (whatever that even means anymore).

1,"It is normal to feel heartbreak. Don't be so hard on yourself as it is normal to feel what you feel. My partner left an afternoon. Called her brother in law and emptied her stuff from the house in two hours. I was shocked, destroyed on the inside, specially as I was an immigrant in her country so I felt completely alone. I went looking for her that afternoon so we could talk but she needed time.  


And so I did. I read at the time to create a small altar with all the mementos I had from our relationship and with this go to it once a day and empty my feelings. It helped a lot to also voice record any feelings I had and all the pain. Everything I would voice record it.  


A few weeks later she contacted me apologizing for leaving, saying she made a mistake for throwing our relationship away, that we didn't communicate and she reached a breaking point. We tried to reconnect but she kept giving deadlines herself ""I'll let you know before December if we're back together"" turned to ""I'll let you know by March if we get back together."" Eventually my situation became difficult living alone and went into therapy. Therapy made me realize I needed to move on with my life and not be awaiting for a decision from her. So I moved back to my home country.  


She ended up confessing she thought me leaving would be a relief for her but ended up throwing her deeper into sadness. I asked her if she'd move into my country and we could try be together again even if temporary (her job allowed her to take some months off).  


It never hapenned. 2 years on I moved on with my life, saved money, bought my own house and starting a new relationship with someone who seems to be more in line with me and my personality. Me and my ex we've been in contact, value what we got from our relationship but we're simply too different to work out.

1,"I have recently begun to explore the controversy of recovered memories because I was told recently that it is a controversial subject and now I understand why. 

That said, I experienced recovered memories of trauma through therapy, and soon thereafter, outside of therapy. My own queries to my parents validated many of my memories surrounding the trauma. Additionally, trauma researchers like Bessel van der Kolk, cite this phenomenon in their own research. 

My conclusion is that both people who deny it exists and insist it exists are right. There are false memories and real recovered memories but I would be suspect if a therapist suggested things that ""might have happened to you."" 

I don't know if there are any therapies out there designed just to recover memories because memories distort and lose resolution over time and the act of looking for them seems fraught with risk; though traumatic memories seem to be an exception to that according to Trauma researcher Bessel van der Kolk and other researchers.

In my case, there were no witnesses to my trauma but my parents and some internet research validated my memories surrounding the trauma.

0,"Thank you for your altruism -- it's always pleasant to encounter people who have something valuable to offer and are interested in giving it away.

There are so many people without access to mental health services, either because of waiting lists or because of the absence of services in their location or nation. 

Because that is the case, I think that the best way to maximize the impact of your gift is to either offer:

1. short-term, time-limited structured DBT groups

2. short-term, time-limited psychotherapeutic groups for people with BPD

3. some kind of (weekly) chat room for a limited number of participants on a first-come, first-served basis but allowing an unlimited number of observers -- possibly either on particular DBT skills you have chosen for each week, or offering informal, psychotherapeutic groups (again, first-come, first-served) dealing with common problems experienced by people with BPD

I don't know what platforms would be best, although my personality disorders program uses Zoom; rooms can be closed to people with the right password. I'm sure there must be video-streaming platforms with controls on the number of active participants.

Here's another possibilit: I don't know how the content could be developed, but how about a YouTube channel for which you compose mindfulness meditations and follow them up with presentations on particular DBT exercises or skills? In other words, you could start with a guided meditation on living in the moment, followed by a presentation on ""Check the Facts"" or a few techniques for surviving moments of crisis (e.g. 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear etc.; using cold water; paced breathing; etc.).

The one possible issue that comes to mind is that real-time groups with audience participation could get unfocused or worse -- imagine, for example, someone having a crisis online or being seriously triggered by something another participant said or did or showed, someone trying to hijack the group online for any number of reasons, or the awful possibility that someone could self-harm in public.

I hope you get some ideas from my ideas! Thanks again for your willingness and interest in helping others without expectation of remuneration. ‚ù§Ô∏è",Cascando-5273,ytvf3e

It's gotten to the point where I almost feel like I need to start lashing out if I want people to take me seriously. The way I explained it to the one person who has taken me seriously is:

I have all the typical BPD behaviors and you don't see them because they are only ever directed at myself. I only allow myself to engage with these feelings in private so you will likely never actively see them happening, but it doesn't mean I don't deal with it.",black-cats13,t5uh5g

First of all, congratulations on completing group, that‚Äôs a big accomplishment!!

I get this, I‚Äòm graduating my group soon as well. 

You‚Äôre in a very vulnerable place right now and it‚Äôs understandable that this is terrifying for you. It hits right into that fear of abandonment and that‚Äôs our kryptonite.

Some ideas:

-	A tip from a friend I met in group who graduated before me: allow yourself to grieve. This is the end of a big chapter in your life and it is a big loss for you. This loss demands to be grieved. Let yourself feel the grief and fear and sadness without judgement ‚Äî validate yourself and practice radical acceptance. 

-	Are there rules in your group that you can‚Äôt stay in touch with people? I really liked one of the girls in my group so I plucked up the courage to talk to her after group. We exchanged numbers and she‚Äôs now one of my most trusted friends. Is there someone in your group you would like to stay in touch with?

-	Look for self-help or support groups. These are usually free and structured by the members themselves. If you can‚Äôt find one in your area, maybe look online (I know, it‚Äôs not the same but it‚Äôs something). 

Sending you a big hug!!

I've definitely acted like a drama queen at points, but what I think was really going on there was in no way a desire for instability/catastrophe, rather that my upbringing was so chaotic and confrontational that when things were actually fine my brain was just sure I was unaware of some imminent threat, and paranoia ensued.

A few therapists, close friends, and partners have told me various versions of the same thing over the years, basically ""'breaks, I have never seen anyone as calm and analytical in a crisis as you, or someone who is so unbalanced when everything is OK.""

I kinda have to agree with that assessment, since almost all of my real breakdowns/meltdowns are at times when the only threats to me were in my head, and most of the times someone was screaming insults at me or trying to physically assault me I go into flow state.

It's almost like i needed some threat to be okay for years. I think I'm past that, finally, or have at least learned to avoid triggers to where I'm much less unstable in stable situations. Whatever it is, I'm glad I don't have to deal with that wildcard all the time anymore.",throwawaybreaks,xj0bs1

Unfortunately the parents don't often realize that. But what's important is that You do.

1,"I really understand what you're going through, my family are the same with poor respect of boundaries. Im several years into therapy and from my perspective, you may have to accept that you can't change them and continue to cultivate your own safe spaces like your own home etc. Its great that you're living independently from them already, that distance will be very helpful for you. 

I think its worth acknowledging that you cannot heal in the environment that made you sick. It may be helpful to view time spent with family as an opportunity to test the skills you learn in therapy, and to try to remind yourself that you have your own space to retreat to now where you are in control again - this dynamic is no longer inescapable. 

I think its also worth acknowledging that you can let go of the significance of a relationship without cutting that person out. 
Does my family drive me crazy sometimes? Yes. Do i wish i could change them or get through to them? Yes. But i cannot change them, and it only hurts me to try and try, and so i have to accept them as they are and take measures to protect myself.

 I can still spend time with them and make plans with them because i love them and i know they love me, even if they arent always great at respecting me. I just have to be realistic and prepared. 

I know how painful family tension can be, im sorry you're dealing with it. Ultimately you DO deserve respect, so its really important that you find and cultivate as many spaces for yourself as possible where you ARE respected. It makes dealing with family easier to handle.

if im outside of a triggered state and still want to breakup for specific reasons, i believe it means it's time.

if i only feel it when triggered and cant understand why but it fades after the event fades, i then understand it to be bpd alone. ive had some multiple day splits that i made myself sit and write pros and cons of my partner but still waited the week and turned out to be bpd.


however i truly believe if the thought is coming with or without an event triggering you it's likely there's something you're not happy with within the relationship and sometimes if the other is your FP you could be blind to what youre missing.

for me i put time into friends and myself and found i was missing big parts of what i need in a relationship but fully blind until i pulled far enough away to see it.

I think I'm going to follow your advice and spend more time with friends and alone and try to see what I nded more and if I'm actaully having my needs met or just think I am.

Usually when I get triggered I let myself angry journal about them and freak out and punch pillows or whatever I need to do, then let myself have however many days i need to chill out. Then I can use the angry journal as reference for what I've been upset with in the relationship and see if it's #1 actually something that needs to be addressed and #2 if yes then try to find a better solution than just emotional fumping or breaking up with them. Usually it just involves ""when you did ___ i felt ___. heres how i think i would prefer to handle these situations in the future, what do you think about it?""
