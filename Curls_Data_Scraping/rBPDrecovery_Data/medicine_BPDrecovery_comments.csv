0,"i’ve noticed weed has definitely made my bpd harder to manage. sure it’s helped temporarily, 100%, but i’ve noticed long term how much it’s messed me up. and it’s scary tbh. it sucks when you keep trying and trying to find different ways to heal and end up in the cycle of temporary comfort and long lasting emotional disregulation and emptiness. that was my experience at least 

i’ve been trying to slowly get myself off of it, addiction is hard period but bpd ontop of addiction certainly doesn’t make it easier. for me i try to use cbd joints with low low thc, im basically gaslighting myself into getting better. i’ll be honest, now that i’m not smoking as much and am weening off of it more, it’s a bit easier in some regards",fuckwormbrain,128ubhw

2,"Yes, I agree, cannabis got me through the emptiness during the evenings but I was always worried about random drug test at work and the stress during the day was unbearable. When I stopped using my symptoms got extremely bad and almost cost me my marriage. I’m on meds now so no cannabis or alcohol and the symptoms are manageable.",craign_em,128ubhw

4,"For me, it's a bit of both, but I feel like I've gotten to a point where it's more of a medicine. Letting yourself actively feel your emotions without dulling them is certainly important... But I have bpd. I don't experience emotions like most would.

Sometimes it feels like my insides are on fire, or like I've been poisoned. In cases like that, weed helps me to calm down a bit, and instead of feeling that searing emotional pain, I feel closer to what I'd assume is a normal amount of emotional pain?

If I'm feeling awful because of a situation, weed helps me be able to view things in a different light, which makes future similar situations easier to handle even without weed. This is also helpful for splitting, as I can actually work through the splitting feelings instead of feeing stuck in them. And if I'm just feeling awful because of like, a general looming bad feeling, weed will help calm me and let me see that there's nothing to worry about.

It completely depends on how you use it. And, in my personal experience, it's better than scrolling social media to numb the feelings, since you're not just ignoring them- You're doing something about them.

My argument would be different for certain other drugs. Alcohol- No good. Shrooms- Probably the best for working out feelings, but can be risky for people with bpd or who need immediate calming.

This is all just my own experience though, and it may/will vary from person to person.",puppyworm,128ubhw
5,"I don't know but like you I feel confused. Weed helps me tremendously in keeping the demons at bay. I could take antidepressants and numb out that way, in my opinion. I've tried many and they give me brain fog, flat affect, and I never feel better, just more empty. Why is it socially acceptable to feel numb (when prescribed pills by a doctor) but not high from a plant? I get it though, people say things are bad for a reason and my disordered thinking tends to spin things the way I want to see them. It's so hard not being able to trust your own judgement.",emelre,128ubhw
6,"i’m in australia, so you can only access cannabis through a Dr., it’s one of the most highly controlled medications here. 

for me, i have BPD, C-PSTD and about a decade long struggle with anorexia. i also have pretty bad insomnia and night terrors due to my C-PTSD. 

to medicate i take 1ml of a full spectrum CBD in the morning, and in the evening 1ml of a 25% THC oil a few hours before bed, and i have a herb vaporiser i probably consume maybe 1 bowls worth of weed in also before bed time. 

i stick to this very rigidly because when i first got my script i was vaping it all the time just to eat. i’ve gotten to a good place in my treatment where i can eat during the day comfortably, and i only take THC to unwind and prevent night terrors, for me THC has been the only effective way for me to stop the night terrors aside from heavy sedatives which impact me a lot more in the morning, so aren’t really an option for me. 

i definitely view my cannabis as medicine, for me i can comfortably manage my dose and i only get a set amount each month so it’s easy for me to not spiral in to the over use a lot of people end up in, understandably so. 

i prefer natural options where i can and i’ve been using cannabis as medicine for almost 2 years now and it’s changed my life in terms of the insomnia, night terrors and appetite. I’m very spiritual so i see cannabis as medicine given by the earth, but i know that’s a hot take lol. 

id say 1. look in to CBD! if i ever needed to go off THC i think CBD would get me through, people definitely overlook it! and 2. if you’re struggling to manage your intake you should try and set a specific dosage amount and see if you can stick to it, if you can’t it may be time to look at alternatives. 

best of luck with it all ❤️",beepdoopbedo,128ubhw
7,"Yeah, I’ve noticed a similar cycle with myself ever since I got my medical card, but I’ve also noticed that it is a very forgiving medicine and as long as I am gentle and intuitive with it, and using it when I know I need it (and obviously having a healthy relationship with it), I can titrate down relatively easily and the dysregulation will fade very quickly. That is absolutely just me though, as it’s very very different for everybody. Plus access to vape cartridges, extracts, hundreds of strains, various edibles and tincture forms, even patches; it’s a game changer as opposed to buying weed off the corner and smoking it every night lol. But I am also very new to the game, so my experience just isn’t there yet",throwaway9858428,128ubhw

I tend to agree with you that the best way to use it is as needed, but not every day. However for me personally, I can't seem to use it just occassionally.

If I could get in the habit of only using it once every couple of weeks I think it could be sustainable.",bpdlearnerburner,128ubhw

0,"Yes, you can do it. You just need a strong will and a firm intent. But theraphy is the base after all. Also how willing you are to acknowledge your emotions, keep them on check while not shoving them aside because ""this is probably bpd's fault I can't feel bad"".  


It's hard for sure. And the road is not always perfect. But I've been on it for a few years already and I can say since I started trying I've never got as bad as when I started, even if it felt like that.

1,"Technically, there isn’t a medication approved to treat BPD. Most of the time people take meds because they have comorbidity happening. I take Lamictal for my depression. It’s considered a mood stabilizer. Do I think it’s help with the symptoms of the BPD? No, but it’s helped my depression. The one thing that has truly helped me with the symptoms of BPD is DBT.",gooseglug,10zm9b5
2,"Medication is like the bandaid you use while you heal. Without the time and work, it’s useless and can cause more harm than good.

4,"I am not a doctor. This response is not intended to hurt anyone or make anybody feel shameful for their choices.  We all have to do what's best for us there is no one size fits all treatment for bpd. 

With that out of the way, I do not take psychotropic medications.  They make me literally certifiable, and the suicidal ideation and attempts were brutal. (I've tried more meds, then I can list or even remember). I made a valiant effort with meds but alas I just experienced far to many side effects to even focus on therapy and getting better so 8 years ago I stopped them all. No one do this without a doctor's guidance I almost died because I'm stubborn af lol. So instead I chose DBT, CBT,  EMDR and trauma therapies as well as traditional talk therapy.  I exercise eat relatively healthy but still enjoy the not so healthy in moderation (after all we ain't getting outta this bitch alive folks! Eat the slice of cake). These were effective for me. I still go to therapy every week without fail. Your list of options is viable and doable if you're determined.  Just know nothing is wrong with you if you do happen to need meds. That's OK too.",Ambs1987,10zm9b5
5,"Medication isn't strictly necessary for BPD itself and certainly won't treat the BPD if you're not also doing the therapy work.

Medication can be a tool in the toolkit, though. It can help manage some of symptoms, which can make it easier to focus on doing the work and learning the skills that you need.

Some people find that something like an antidepressant is extremely helpful for the ""early"" stages of healing, and then are able to taper off as they learn more skills and heal some. But meds aren't for everyone, and not everyone will want or be able to come off of them (depending on other depression sources besides the BPD). YMMV.",solidparallel,10zm9b5
6,"I said that at first but I went on meds last year. While the meds don’t help the bpd directly, it has helped my other issues subside to the point that I can focus on my Bpd. This is the longest I have been on meds consecutively (just passed a year🥳🥳) and I can say I am a much better person and I have started the process of deconstructing my trauma and addressing it.  I have also been able to go down on some of my medications. 

I say, don’t rule anything out. Try out everything, even if you think it won’t work or it’s stupid. No two people will present the same, so only you can decide what will help you.",LeadershipFar263,10zm9b5

Look, to my knowledge, I don't have BPD -- but my best friends do. I've had issues with one of them in particular, which is pretty much a given in sixteen years of knowing each other. I've also seen his relationships, and I know how hard it can be.

On the other hand, my other friend is more self-aware. I've seen how he acts in relationships, and how he acts with me. I'm not saying everything is perfect, but under no circumstances are things so horrible or out of control that it would be out of the ordinary.

My problem with that sub is their blatant ableism, and their refusal to acknowledge that not everybody with an illness is the exact same. 🙄

4,"Last time I looked at that subreddit, the first post I saw was saying “I love this subreddit but there’s so many grown men here who’ve dated teenage girls with bpd”. yeah…. speaks volumes. Pwbpd are vulnerable, and many times over more likely to be victims of relationship abuse then be the abusers themselves. I genuinely believe that most people in bpdlovedones took advantage of and likely emotionally abused their pwbpd. now they are demonizing them for their reactions. think of people who say all their exes are crazy

the goal of that subreddit is to DEHUMANIZE us. They do not view us as human. One tactic they use to do this is distorting our lack of sense of self/ stable self image. Another post I saw was saying “if you start to miss them/ feel bad for them, remember that the person you knew did not exist”. This kind of rhetoric is disgusting

5,"I think you are justified to be hurt by the rejection from that subreddit, for all the reasons you listed. And I think that subreddit is also justified to reject you. It very well may perpetuate stigma, however the purpose of that subreddit is not to repair what is broken in society, or to change the thoughts of those who are unfairly judgmental. Imo, the stigma is most perpetuated by the DSM’s failure to serve humans rather than insurance companies. 

There are stages to the recovery on both sides of this relational coin, and I have found that the separation of codependents is important for that recovery to begin for both. If someone needs a space where they are comforted by the thought that “the person who hurt me can’t be here” it provides the opportunity for free expression of pain without the fear of judgment and the addition of support. This is something we all need, and codependents early in recovery struggle to assert for themselves if challenged emotionally. But no one’s recovery looks the same. If it is not the place for someone to recover, they can find another place or use it as it’s helpful. I’m sure you’re aware that not every place is good for every person, and I see that place as a first step for many who are ill or as maladaptive as anyone else with a PD. We don’t see the people who leave or never join. With the B&W thinking apparent in that subreddit, my hope is that it’s a stone people take a step on through their grieving. It’s a process that has ugly parts many have to walk though. All emotions are valid, and morality ought to be irrelevant to them.",,15rku5z
6,"I am recovered Cptsd and undiagnosed quiet BPD I suspect my ex partner is quiet BPD too. He got super mad and gave me the silent treatment for days because he wanted to meet up one evening and I couldn’t I explained that would be great but sorry I can’t as I had such a long shitty day at work and I just can’t meetup. Another time he got angry when I hadn’t replied to him message I was sleeping then next morning he bursted down at my place looking frantic demanded why I didn’t answer the night before, he clearly saw me sleeping in bed and my phone off he got angry and left. Later I texted him sorry I didn’t reply I was asleep and thank you for coming to check on me. Eventhough we made up after that incident he became distant, disconnected whenever we’d spend time together he’d be either on his phone scrolling or watching Netflix. He’d also frequently withhold intimacy and last time when I started making out with him he turned away saying his back hurts is super tired he said sorry he can’t. I just had to suck it up and not make a big deal but I felt something was off as our relationship was built on love and alot of displays of affection and strong intimacy.
from there it spiralled quick down hill. Every attempt to address issues and talk about my feelings were met with defensiveness, blame and silent treatment. 
He had broken up with me many times but quickly would come back apologise for his behaviour and say it stems from fear and self sabotage he would tell me how much he loves me and want to grow old with me, when he was in the love/ idealising faze he asked me to please never let go even if he threatened to break up and that I would just need to remind him of the pact we made to be together no matter what. 
Now I think he is in the splitting faze and I can’t get through to him.
I suspect (he has quiet BPD with core wound fear of abandonment) so after the last episode we had agreed that do couples therapy but the very next day when I wrapped my arms around him and kissed him tenderly he looked at me with ice cold eyes sat me and to my shock broke up with me. I tried to bring him back from this dark place he was in to remind him of our beautiful love story of our pact of doing therapy. But he wouldn’t snap out of it. I had an emotional break down and he hugged me so tight for hours I cried in his arms. I was shocked, confused and in so much pain for a whole week I couldn’t function and he’d text me everyday to ask about me and how I was doing. I love him and care alot about him but I just don’t know what to do. This is my first romantic relationship after long years of violent abusive marriage so I am learning how healthy relationships feel like look like. When he is in the loving self he treats me like a princess he is super considerate and affectionate with me. But when anything small happens he gets cold, distant and disconnects from me. He did mention he disassociates sometimes, self sabotage out of fear being not good enough and abandoned.

1,"This is my first time responding a thread but this one caught my eye. As someone who suffered from both bpd and bipolar I’m gonna let you know a mood stabilizer will only work so far. It seems your dilema revolves around you not being able to give him space. It’s suffocating to him when he seems to need space in this moment. I know you mean well because you love him but your reaction to him telling you he cheated on you. I’m not trying to speak for him or your relationship. But he told you I guess to bring up trust. I’m not sure. It seems you lack trust in him a lot. You NEED to know he’s okay and because of that you don’t seem to understand the boundary of him needing space. That constant fear of abandonment is something I do understand. It’s bone chilling sometimes. The more you care and love a person the more intense the reaction. In my personal experience it has severed many relationships of all kinds. Friends and partners and family too. At this point he seems to need space and doesn’t believe you will give him that. So he blocked you and did all those things. Breathe. Accept you’ve done wrong and that he’s not perfect either. To pursue him to apologize will only prove his theory you can’t give him space. He’s overwhelmed because of your actions not with you as a person. If he cares and loves you, the space you give him will allow him to chill out and come back. But I don’t want you to also expect him to come back. Focus on what you may need in this moment knowing he’s not next to you. If he’s texting your mom, he’s okay and it’s not your job to make him okay or look for him to see if he is. Make sure you’re okay too. And I see you’re doing that. I wish you luck this is my my opinion for you. Take what you need",Bubblycat629,j146yn
2,"Yea.. your right. He’s wall is super high which is understandable, that’s what he needs to be feel protected. I just have this negative thoughts that what if I give him too much space and time, he’ll start seeing others? which I should not care about. 

I will try just tell how I feel and thoughts when he reach me. Asking him to be in a relationship again can be taken as manipulating/convincing traits and I do want to avoid that.

For myself, thank you so much for saying that, it encourages me to keep it going. It’s hurting me financially to go check in and starting counseling since I had to quit my job in there because of moving out, but I can find job soon for sure so it’s not that big of a deal. 

I’ll use these times and days for myself also, I want to be a better person. Thank you so much! <3",Milmily,j146yn
3,"Thank you for your time for stopping by/advice.
I'm currently taking one of the mood stabilizer atm. I don't know if it's working or not to be honest.. should I talk abut this to my doctor?

For the he needs space, you're right. I realize I tend to think this is the right way for everything when it's not. This was one of those moment. He said he will never stop loving me so I'll work on trust, and focus on myself. Any tip that help with the anxiety? I have this obsessions in being anxious 24/7 on everything..",Milmily,j146yn
4,">I just have this negative thoughts that what if I give him too much space and time, he’ll start seeing others? which I should not care about.

I know it FEELS that way. This is where you have to do some fact checking. If you are in a healthy loving two way relationship, you can trust that the other person will be there for you regardless of if you are in person or not. BPD can have issues with object consistency. Try to remember there are many shades of gray, it's not just black and white. You dont have to be with someone 100% or 0%. Sometimes space means no contact, and sometimes space means the freedom to do what they need to do. 

&#x200B;

Also yes focusing on yourself and getting to that healthy place so that you are enough all by yourself is the most important thing. I'm not there yet. But I've actually seen real progress in the last year or so and it feels really good. I feel so much lighter without all those negative thoughts that were filling my head. I still have them but they feel empty now. They used to feel so heavy and all emcompassing. It's nice to get rid of that weight. 

I truly wish you all the best. You deserve to be happy.",coyotebored83,j146yn
5,"I’m on lithium. I don’t know if it’ll help for you because every person is different. Mood stabilizers are more for bipolar disorder. It takes a while to take into effect. Once starting the dosage I felt impatient and agitated because I was coming off a hypomanic stage and I was crashing hard. This was for my bipolar. Any questions you have you should ask your psychiatrist but medications takes a while before they go into effect. 
   Mood stabilizers aren’t really prescribed for bpd because bpd is a personality disorder which may have developed from a childhood trauma. Children tend to not be explained situations because adults feel they don’t need to know or understand. Often times that lack of explanation let’s our minds go wild and think of worst case scenario of everything or everyone. Being on edge and extremely defensive. A tip my boyfriend taught me was to allow myself 24 hours to feel it out. Often times I’m quick to address something that I don’t like. So I’ll react abruptly, impulsively and negatively because my emotions are at the highest. If after 48 hours the  emotion persists it’s something I should address. I’ve noticed it’s helped lessen arguments and relax to think logically rather than emotionally. Realize your anxious thoughts are worry about a future you feel you can’t control. Focus on the things you can control at the moment and if there’s nothing more then let time take its course. Focus on other things you must do either tasks or treat yourself to something nice.",Bubblycat629,j146yn
6,"You're right. I have this stormy emotion that I break down crying and try to get what I want.. and I catch this more often that still have thoughts as black and white only. I don't want to be a burden, and nobody should babysit me for that other than myself. He said that he wants his time all by himself awhile, to heal. And the love towards me will never go away. So I will trust it and go focus on myself too.
To be enough all by themselves, what's that like? Mentally?

I'm so proud of you, and happy for you for how far you become!! I wish one day, hopefully sooner, I can00 be like you.",Milmily,j146yn
7,"\>  and I catch this more often  

&#x200B;

Awesome! The catching it is key. It will totally still happen BUT celebrate every catch. Each time it gets a bit easier and you start catching it more and more and it eventually becomes habit. I used to think it would take magic to change my thinking but it's really basic. lol 

&#x200B;

\> To be enough all by themselves, what's that like? Mentally?

LOL i dont know yet but I'm really excited and committed to finding out. It sounds lovely.

\> I wish one day, hopefully sooner, I can00 be like you. 

&#x200B;

Thank you! I still have bad days too. I was in a situation where I was forced to do something I didnt want to do and I have been crying for 2 days about it. The negative self talk is strong today. However being able to recognize it as 'negative self talk' and not identify it as just me anymore is really helpful. I say some awful stuff to myself in my head but that's just 'connie being a b\*\*\*\*' lol. i named my negative internal voice so i could tell her to be quiet. I read it somewhere and it helps. 

&#x200B;

Just remember to keep your eye on the goal. The goal being that you are a happy individual all by yourself. (not that that means you dont have friends and family and support, just that if you dont have them that's ok too) I make notes to remind myself. Sometimes art too.",coyotebored83,j146yn

3,"I experience the same thing to a degree. I was already on my way to recovering when i discovered what bpd/codependency was. I recognize so many bpd traits in my former self. I still struggle with the codependency part. It still takes a lot of energy to remember to make good decisions while dealing with strong emotions. I had to make that decision for myself though. I had to be able to see how my behavior had affected me/others. Then I was able to realize that way wasnt working for me. I have decent control over my emotions and do not have outbursts for the most part. I still struggle with maintaining boundries for myself and respecting others. Even though i practice restraint daily, i feel so much more free now. It was like i was a slave to my emotions before.",coyotebored83,fgek26

6,"I've done and said some pretty fucked up stuff in my past and for me, I have many regrets and so much I will never forgive myself for. I strongly encourage you and others to forgive yourselves for past transgressions, but I just know I can't let go of that guilt. To be honest, I don't want to let go of the guilt, it reminds me who I want to be and how I want to conduct myself. Again, my experience is different, in that you find it empowering, whereas I have felt humiliated and ashamed. Reading books and coming to terms with the fact that I was abusive and manipulative was so hard. I'd find myself trying to convince myself I didn't carry these actions out or I'd notice my thoughts were always attempting to justify my behaviour. It was exhausting having to analyse each thought during conflict. The result is that I am now an incredibly open and honest person and I explain my thought path, then I explain how that makes me feel, and then I actively listen to the opinions of the other party. I also think before I speak. I feel I need to stress that I still fuck up every now and again, I close off, I catch myself gaslighting someone and when I'm in that headspace I cannot drop that pride and admit fault, the angers rages in my stomach and I don't drop an argument when I should or in the way I should. I know I have come such a long way and I am proud to say I have done so alone, but fuck me, it sucks that after all this hard work, one occasional appearance of BPD during conflict can still cause complete chaos to our relationships. We cannot take back what we say and how we hurt people and it sucks we sometimes have no control over this. Well, not yet. I sincerely hope I can rewire my brain enough to eradicate all traces of BPD. Knowing my luck the final step of my transformation will be a year of silent meditation... Is being a good person really worth it? Sometimes, I do wonder.",kitamajita,fgek26
7,"I'd say more of an educated guess, to be fair. I don't feel a degree in psychology is necessary to evaluate my symptoms and come to such a conclusion. I mean... I had the vast majority of the symptoms associated with BPD, my primary source of information was the DSM:V and a previous psychiatrist stated they would diagnose me with BPD had diagnosing me with a condition been the purpose of our meet. I perceived your comment in such a way as to make me feel you are jumping to conclusions, perhaps assuming I am not educated enough, nor do I know my self enough, to know if I have a condition and what the correct terminology for that condition is. I must state clearly that I am not a person who seeks attention via umpteen fake diagnoses and a different issue every week. Do not assume I am stupid.",kitamajita,fgek26
8,"Absolutely. This resonates with me. First and foremost that the change, as hippy dippy as it may sound, really does come from within. A person must have the desire to change for themselves, not for others and especially not when given an ultimatum. I.e... you must change or I will leave etc. It's incredibly difficult for me to maintain boundaries and I still struggle with my expectations of others, but this is now internally, I am careful to express how I'm feeling but emphasise my awareness that I may not be feeling a certain way justifiably. Having ADHD can also inflate traits of BPD but I generally feel I have a good handle on both.",kitamajita,fgek26
9,"Ooo very tough one! Okay, after giving it some serious thought. The first book was 'Loves me, Loves me not'. This, along with 'Love me, don't leave me' were transformative. As I have ADHD, I really struggled with perseverance, but I cannot recommend these highly enough. My final recommendation isn't a book, per se, it's a subject matter... Read and watch all you can on Dialectical Behavioural Therapy or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Really delve into these subjects and if you think they can help, buy the DBT workbook (or download the free PDF) or the ACT workbook. I have both and I committed to doing both workbooks to the best of my ability. I still go through these books and utilise what I have learned, very often. I hope this helps.",kitamajita,fgek26

11,"I am not assuming you are stupid, lack knowledge or do not know yourself well. However, you cannot self diagnose no matter how intelligent or knowledgable you are. You're biased and can convince yourself of something. I am not saying you don't have BPD, all I am saying is that you should seek outside opinion as you have a biased opinion to your own experiences. 

The information you have gathered here is great to bring to a psychiatrist or professional to have that second opinion. I mean no harm or offense.",LimeGreenSea,fgek26

0,"Instead of telling your doctor you don’t want to be on any mood stabilizers, I would recommend that you keep a diary of your moods/ med dosages and times taken / side effects. Doctors work better with that kind of data and can adjust dosages or change your meds. It’s likely that they are trying to keep you stabilized to avoid another hospitalization, which is good! Honestly, sometimes heavy meds are worth it because the consequence of being unmedicated is worse. Doctors want to keep you stable, but also in the least restricted environment.",fashlatebloomer,gqb8xt
1,"I’m on Lamictal and have been for 5 years. It’s honestly been a lifesaver for my depression. It’s the first medicine I have taken where I don’t cycle on them.
