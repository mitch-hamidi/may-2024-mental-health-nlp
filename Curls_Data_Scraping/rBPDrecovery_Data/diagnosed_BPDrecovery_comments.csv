0,"I was diagnosed with both. I was diagnosed with BPD as a teenager, but every mental health professional I saw didn‚Äôt point out my ADHD. I moved and I was misdiagnosed with bipolar (that‚Äôs a whole other story) and I was also diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety

I found a really good psych and therapist 2 years ago and I‚Äôm ‚Äúproperly‚Äù diagnosed with BPD, C-PTSD (no longer meet criteria now for both), ADHD-combined type, and OCD.

ADHD symptoms and BPD symptoms overlap a lot. It‚Äôs not in the official diagnostic criteria, but people who have ADHD struggle with low frustration tolerance (low ability to manage anger) and effectively regulate emotions. People who have ADHD can also experience more moment-to-moment mood changes, which can also look like BPD. Among the poor impulse control which is also a BPD symptom.

How to differentiate? 
-BPD experiences instability in sense of self, lack of knowing who they are
-severe abandonment issues
-experience transient dissociation/paranoid ideation 

So they can kinda mesh with eachother. I‚Äôve always had a hard time managing my emotions, on stimulant meds I can manage my emotions- ESPECIALLY anger- much better. My mood is also more level during the day. I‚Äôm less scattered, more patient. Meds have made my ability to function so much better. I can participate more in therapy, regulate my impulses, I‚Äôm more calm during the day. 

The biggest role meds have in treating BPD is treating co-occurring disorders to lower distress, so that the BPD sufferer can further use skills to regulate themselves. I‚Äôve found this to be very true with my adhd meds and my ability to regulate my other BPD  symptoms. 

ADHD is a self-regulation disorder, and in my opinion, I think ‚ÄúADHD‚Äù is a terrible name. It should be executive dysfunction disorder. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. I clearly too my amphetamines this morning lol. :)",,1bbdsr0

4,"Omg I feel you, I‚Äôm so on this. I got diagnosed with BPD a few years ago, and recently so many people have spoke to me suggesting seeking an ADHD diagnosis. I spoke to my family about it and they mentioned about ADHD being mentioned in primary and secondary school but nothing got done.

12,"Hey! I went to get diagnosed with ADHD, and ended up being diagnosed with BPD first, and then ADHD a few weeks later (two different psychs working under the same company with two different specialties). I also have C-PTSD, anxiety and depression. A LOT of these things can overlap, some symptoms can mask others, or other symptoms can amplify others (eg. when I'm frustrated by my lack of executive dysfunction from my ADHD, my BPD rage can and does kick in and take things to a whole new level). Learning to manage certain triggering symptoms has led to a greater ability to regulate BPD and anxiety symptoms. ADHD medication also changed my life, it made me feel like I could actually breathe, and think without being assaulted by 10 thoughts and 2 songs and a random Spongebob quote being repeated over and over in the background. I hope you feel a lot more validated! It's not easy, but nothing in life is, and the relief of knowing is so much better than the constant nagging fear that you're failing because other people seem to be able to handle things that you find almost impossible",Icy_Stranger9934,1bbdsr0

14,"I (F22) was diagnosed with ADHD at like, the age of 6 or 7 but only because my twin BROTHER was diagnosed first haha

The BPD discovery happened at 20 (I'm 22 now), and personally, **yes** when I'm on stimulant medication my symptoms are SO much less severe. (20mg Vyvanse has been best for me).

I will say however, as a woman, I've realized that if I'm under more stress, or if certain hormone levels are higher for me at certain times of the month, stimulant meds can either make symptoms way worse, or they just don't make a difference at all. 

Generally, they're very helpful, but unfortunately, sometimes they are a big factor when it comes to bouts of mania. So unless you're REALLY in tune with yourself, or you at least have someone around that could recognize any negative signs,  I wouldn't recommend stimulants until you feel more regulated more often. My own doctor was absolutely no help, so I had to figure all of this out on my own.",abby_appy443,1bbdsr0

23,"This is similar to my story. The BPD masked the symptoms of ADHD. It wasn‚Äôt until i started seeing videos on inattentive ADHD that made me start thinking that maybe i had it. The real kicker and the reason my therapist told me to go tested is how i respond to cold meds. Daytime makes me groggy while nighttime keeps me awake.

26,"I‚Äôve been on Effexor before. I too had a horrible experience with it. It was not good. The thing i didn‚Äôt think of is stimulants are not like antidepressants.

My primary does want me to take my BCP continuously because of the level of hormonal anxiety I‚Äôve been experiencing. But I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm going to let the withdrawal bleed come this month just to see how i do. 

My psychiatrist did say some people experience mania when they first start stims. That was a big worry for me. I am very much self-aware.

38,"Definitely helped with the rage, I'll admit I still get angry, but it isn't made worse by my ADHD impulsivity or by the sensory issues - not that those things don't still exist by themselves but they're not amplifying the rage! And because my mind is a lot clearer, I'm not twisted by anger and unable to think clearly the way I used to be. Obviously the medication isn't a cure-all, and I've done a lot of therapy, but the meds have definitely helped. 

The splitting isn't affected unfortunately, except for when my sensories are going haywire, which is made a little easier by the meds, but splitting definitely does still happen!",Icy_Stranger9934,1bbdsr0

0,"stick with it if you truly want this career. im in the same boat as you as well. have bpd but want to b a psychotherapist or smtg in that area. 

my advice is while youre studying classes, make sure youre also getting better. im not sure where youre at rn so maybe what im saying wont b as ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù but try doing dbt courses, r/dbtselfhelp is also a fantastic sub that offers help from others, but also many many many resources like websites, work sheets, videos, etc. 

imo, having bpd allows us to really & truly connect with someone who is struggling. we understand & feel their emotions (maybe not everyone feels them, but for me i can feel their emotions & sense when someone is upset, angry, happy etc.) allowing us to b more help than someone who just uses logic in that field. of course, its a good balance of both, however, too strongly of one or the other can b a little tricky; general statement as well. 

while working towards lessening severity of symptoms & learning how to manage them & stay there (its a up & down journey though, but its worth it & the downs only make us stronger), & learning what youre doing rn & eventually getting into that career, itll balance itself out. it will prevent what others say or feel or are going thru not b as much of a trigger; youll know what to do in those kind of circumstances to prevent it from debilitating you, while also helping the patient. 

you can do this & honestly learning abt psychology alone will help anyone who struggles w any mental health issue. you learn how the brain works, why people behave the way they do, etc. itll give you more awareness while youre helping yourself.

growth mindset & a positive attitude will help a lot negating those negative, discouraging thoughts. what ifs are what ifs for a reason :). it takes time to get there & work, but giving yourself that time is so important. remember to not overwhelm yourself too much at once as well. that can put those bad thoughts back into a place they dont belong. step by step, one thing at a time.",,18ajdv8
1,"Hey there! I‚Äôm almost done my degree in Social Work and currently working as a community counsellor. I‚Äôve lead DBT groups. I‚Äôve also struggled with not only imposter syndrome but feeling like I cant handle it either. 

Self compassion and self management are extremely important. You need to be very on top of managing and being aware of what you can handle. My advice is to advocate for yourself, and when you‚Äôre done your program to start slow. Take on part time clientele not full time. Do online if it works better for you. Have your own therapist, and the cliche eat, sleep, and take care of your own needs. 

Personally, I‚Äôve reconsidered my entire life plan of what I can and cannot handle and after completing this degree and starting to be a therapist myself, realized I cannot have children on top of it, so I‚Äôve made the decision to be child free. That‚Äôs a personal choice for me. Your accommodations and balance might look different. But figuring out what it is and sticking with it is so important. And also, you CAN do it. Your lived experience makes you perfect for the job. You‚Äôre human, helping humans having a human experience",PinSpirited8787,18ajdv8

0,"I deal with the same thing. I chased unavailable people and once I craved more stability I found myself feeling like maybe it wasn‚Äôt right for me. I would focus on how he makes you feel when you are together and treats you rather than thoughts about the relationship. It seems like a lot of us can be prone to issues with pulling back or dealing with anxiety thoughts when a relationship gets serious or comfortable as it can trigger things within us. A lot of us also crave a certain type of chaos within relationships and it‚Äôs high highs but extremely low lows. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too late for you nor should you have a scarcity mindset. I worry a bit since you say the relationship has become toxic, that needs to be worked on. And if it‚Äôs abusive you need to leave. 

If you feel like the relationship has become codependent , it can be easier to feel bored as we are so absorbed into the other person as our source of meaning/entertainment/happiness. I would try to get back into some of the things you enjoy that have nothing to do with him and maybe take more time doing things alone or with other supportive people. You could also try to build excitement within the relationship

So if you get bored of your partner, cause he‚Äôs not exciting it‚Äôs normal cause we all get bored cause we are used to such ups and downs in our childhoods. There was never anyone stable around so yeah we crave those ups and downs and drama feels fun and exciting but it not a sustainable way to build a relationship unfortunately, and when you get used to it and deal with your emotions around it, the calmness and safety can allow you deeper feelings of love than ever possible with another person.",Cozysweetpea,19a5qla
0,"You don't know what an episode looks like? You said you get upset easily & have trouble controlling your emotions. An episode would usually be the thing that happens once you get upset & feel out of control. When I get upset, sometimes it continues, I keep getting triggered & things escalate wildly which is what I consider an 'episode'. 

I have extreme anxiety & panic attacks anyway and a BPD episode has things in common w/ a panic attack. Main similarity is my total lack of ability to calm down. Anxiety/fear might be involved but more so, it's rage or unbearable pain/despair. Sort of like agitated depression that explodes & spirials outta control. It's every negative miserable emotion at once, all turned up top volume where I want to smash things, people, myself, I might scream/cry uncontrollably, hyperventilate, get paranoid, feel desperate for it to stop. It's just a complete emotional overload/meltdown. Some are way more destructive than others. When I was younger, that could go on for 5-6+ hours. The older I got, the shorter the episodes became. 

For me, it typically involved an argument with someone else, usually my mom or a boyfriend. I wasn't really triggered by anyone else in that way.  A thing or occurrence could initially trigger me but what really pushed me over was when another person somehow becomes involved in it. If they say/do certain things, my emotions get directed at them. If my fear of abandonment also gets triggered, forget it, it can get *really* bad. 

So you never had situations like that before?",Piconaught,12s5i45

4,"I have that alot, just did not put it together. These outbursts are getting to be quite the strain on my relationship with my partner. I want to control it better, but I can't seem to control the emotions. It is very frustrating.",Humble_Explorer_4063,12s5i45
5,"Yep. That's it. It's caused so many relationship issues in my life. People seem to have really different descriptions/experiences of what they consider an episode vs a 'split' or whatever. People without BPD often write the most insane stuff about it that doesn't make any sense whatsoever so when you read about it online, the info is all over the place & oftentimes just so wrong. 

I've been splitting my entire life but never knew what the term was referring to until a couple years ago. I used to just think that was me being 'mad' at someone but that maybe I was a little extreme. Some people used the terms split & episode interchangeably even tho they don't always go together for me. 

I didn't even begin to really understand it or do much about it until I was around 30. Before that, I honestly still believed all I had to do was meet the magic 'right' person & things would be fine. 

For awhile I thought it was regular 'mental illness' and some version of depression with a weird anger problem. In my late 20s-30s, I spent around 9 yrs seeing a psychiatrist, trying to solve as much as I could with meds, etc.. It helped a lot, mostly by separating my issues into categories of things that could/couldn't be helped with meds, like general 'anxiety' is one thing vs the weird extra anxiety I get if a fear of abandonment is triggered by a boyfriend, etc.. The anger/rage is really hard to control though & been the most difficult aspect for me.",Piconaught,12s5i45
0,"I've only been diagnosed about three months ago, but even in that short time dealing with it got better. By now it's a label that helps me navigate symptoms and brings some  
clarity at times. But back then, everything was just a mess and I hated it, because it meant having to acknowledge that this isn't just another depressive episode and everything in the past was so much worse that I could admit - but on the other hand it was a relief, because finally things made a little more sense and I was just not failing as battling depression over and over.  
I know everything feels like shit right now, and you need to know that's okay and you can just sit with those feeling for a while before you have to process them. And while you do that, allow yourself some distraction, watch a cool movie, play a game you like, get your favourite overpriced drink. Starting to process those things is a lot easier when you're not on edge and after that really intense happening, you deserve that, you still have the rest of your life to deal with that. If you feel like you need someone to allow you that, then take it from me, certified stranger on the internet.

Another thing though from personal experience, I did NOT do myself a favour by looking up things online. All the content on Insta/Twitter/Tumblr whatever by other people with the diagnosis talking about it, or the support accounts, or even scrolling through this subreddit for days to no end wasn't a good thing for me. It made me incredibly upset at times, which is not healthy. If you feel like it could help you, go for it of course - but as soon as you notice it's not helping, let it go, you don't have to do everything at once.  
When everything has settled a little, you'll see that this doesn't make you a different person, just that you now have more tools that can help you to feel less bad. If you haven't looked into skills yet, I recommend doing so, they've helped me a lot, even before the diagnosis, when I didn't even know what DBT was or that they were part of that. Other than that, your therapist will support you to find what helps you best, that's their job after all and you're not alone with that.

1,"Hi, I didn't become aware of my BPD until my 40s after experiencing some substantial losses, I think the pandemic served as the tipping point where I hit rock bottom mental health wise.

I've been getting a lot of help from watching videos on YouTube.  Psychology in Seattle, Daniel J Fox, Lisa LeBlanc,  Tracey Marks, and Todd Grande.  Surviving Narcissism (channel) if appropriate to one's trauma.  I did a lot to address my extensive identtity disturbance it was a little easier knowing I've had a full life and career behind me to renounce the sensation of not existing or having a personality of my own.  I lost every source of externalised identity this summer, I'm rebuilding from the ground up.  Assessing yourself using the five-factor model of personality (OCEAN) is a really straightfoward and helpful exercise imo.

I've found the BPD subs on Reddit to be incredibly helpful, once I got to the point of handling reading my experiences and symptoms in words, and having the opportunity to engage in compassion with experiences we've been at the pointy end of.  Like, we all know how harrowing and painful living with BPD is, especially when it's uncontrolled or undercontrolled.  So it's not light reading by any means, but invaluable.

Favourite People are where we sink our attachment needs and have an odd blind spot that distortsaway any flaws.  Maybe your friend's blind spot resembles a parental figure's toxic traits.  My last FP was a total turd of a human, at the time I thought he was kind and caring; in hindsight, his actions never matched his words, ever.  I'm surprised he didn't fall down every time he pointed up, that's how bad it was.

Informationally, also, I recommend ""We Can Do Hard Things,"" with Glennon Doyle, as well as Early Morning Barking, on YouTube. ""Borderline to Beautiful"" is also a good resource. These are NOT meant to replace therapy, though. 

If therapy cost is an issue, there may be local, state-run help. They are there to help too, if one can manage it.

I got myself the BPD workbook everybody talks about (I don't have the name en but it's a blue and white book). I already had trauma therapy ( in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy) and could apply a lot of things I had learn to heal from trauma, on my BPD. Such as radical acceptance, coping skills for high stress, and mindfulness (I found the concept of meditations stupid but apparently it helps to regulate a part of our brain that is overactive and from my experience it REALLY helps to get a different approach on things). As for group therapy, I tried it and they didn't force me to share stuff about myself. I only shared when and what I was comfortable saying. It helped me a lot against shame and guilt, because I realised that I am much harder on myself than others.
I think that getting my diagnose really helped me because once I got it I knew what was wrong with me and that there are many things I can do to get better.

So that might be an avenue open to you. Also, I‚Äôve found there are therapists who will take patients on a sliding scale as it relates to their income, at least here in the US. 

Even if you‚Äôre using, you still deserve help. I‚Äôve also found that if one sponsor isn‚Äôt helping me, I‚Äôm free to end that association and find a sponsor that does help me.

11,"Honestly the first thing is to accept stuff. If you reject your diagnose, or if you deny what has happened to you (trauma) or if you avoid feelings (typically doing drugs so you don't feel sad/lonely, tired, etc). Because suffering comes from resisting/avoiding pain. So you have borderline personality disorder, you have gone through trauma. Recovery will be hard, sometimes painful. I have an exercise that consists of recording myself saying stuff like ""the world in unfair"", ""I cannot control everything"" etc, and then answer out loud ""yes, it is"". It sounds dumb but it works. Also Kristin Neff has free self compassion exercises on her website https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/
Also if you can, learn about BPD. It helps me understand I'm not a monster, my brain is just differently wired. Feel free to ask more questions !",1520FM,rsvcs9
12,"Because when people with BPD talk about their struggles together, they realize their problems stem from certain patterns of thinking, not from outside forces. 

It helps you understand that you may be seeing the world in a distorted way, assuming that others reject you, that people are out to get you, that others are either all good or all bad, etc.

It will actually make your problems feel less personal.",Veryaburneraccount,rsvcs9

And, just like recovering from substance abuse means following certain rules, there's a protocol for recovering from BPD that you'll learn in group therapy that has the power to drastically improve your life.

IDK, I'd love to go to group DBT therapy, but I'm in the U.S. and my insurance does not cover it (and it's incredibly expensive.) One-on-one talk therapy doesn't necessarily lead to rapid life changes or emotional relief, in fact I'd say the opposite is true.",Veryaburneraccount,rsvcs9

0,"If someone knows, I would also like to know.

But, I will say, I had an epiphany.. where I wasn‚Äôt like this for fun, I wasn‚Äôt crazy, I was REACTING to my environment. One day it hit me like a ton of bricks. I am very outwardly emotional and angry, but it made a world of difference. Bpd is very confusing. DBT didn‚Äôt really help but they only offered 8 weeks, when it takes at least a year for anyone to show results",Suspicious_Dealer815,12w2uzx
1,"A decade is a good assessment.  Not that you'll need to go to therapy sessions twice a week, but this shit is FOREVER and ten years of actively practicing treatment skills is a reasonable amount of time to be able to mimic ""normal"" function.

As far as the shame goes, awareness of it is 90% of overcoming it.  It's not you, it's your disease that causes the shame.  Recognising your shame-spiral triggers and either rewiring them or avoiding them is the big skill to cultivate.  Even when you're a master of mental kung-fu, the shame still happens, you just learn the skills to be able to choose how you react to it.

I'm 52 years old.  I still shame-spiral sometimes about an incident that happened when I was 5, and it was a nothing situation.  My dad wanted to pick me up so I could ride on his shoulders.  I freaked out because I was afraid.  He was all ""Okay, no problem.""  I still remember that, and think how it must have made him feel that I didn't trust him enough to do that, and it ricochets around in my head until I'm a gibbering mess for two days.  or it used to, until I realised that he probably never thought about it once, and I was projecting my feelings onto him.  Just one example of thousands.

You'll get there.",blackest_francis,12w2uzx
2,"First, you should realize that a lot, probably most, of the people who've called you crazy have some sort of mental health issue of their own. Some probably just as serious as BPD, even if they're unaware. 

 As you continue with DBT, one thing you might realize is just how much of the population lacks emotional intelligence. Ours is more significant than most, but a lack of emotional intelligence is a societal issue as well as a personal one.

Unfortunately our BPD minds can be impatient, and that plus the black-and-white thinking can cause an, ""I don't see the desired results, therefore it's not working."" 
But DBT takes time, along with work. If it was instantaneous, it wouldn't truly be changing your patterns. They took years if not decades to form, and they'll take time to learn to control. 

 On society/other people being assholes: 
I don't mean to say that everyone else is the problem or that BPD is not a significant mental illness. But that most of the stereotypes surrounding BPD don't fit everyone  with it, and the most harmful traits can also be found in people without BPD, or without any diagnosis. 

Recognizing that there's a problem doesn't fix that problem, but you can't work on the problem without recognizing it. 

When it comes to shame, realize you didn't have a choice in developing this disorder. But that doesn't mean you have no choice at all. No one said it'd be an easy decision, but it is a decision. 

It's not fair that you should have to work to keep the pain you're in from transferring to other people or fight the blame you constantly put on yourself. It truly isn't. 
But the alternative is not better for yourself or anyone else.

The biggest thing, is realize that having BPD means it will require work to be good to both others and yourself. 
But you're not doomed to be miserable or a horrible person, even if it's a lifelong condition.

I would really encourage you to look for an immersive program in your state!

11,"My program is 2 years. I've now just completed a year. At the beginning they ask what you what to change about yourself and they will teach you the tools necessary to do that. For example they teach you how to cut off toxic people in your life. It's certainly changed my life and made me balanced.

Quiet BPDs may be able to control their reactions outwards, but that doesn't still mean you have good emotion control. It contains so much more than that. You also need to be able to calm the storm _inwards_, because _that_  is the source of our struggles. DBT focuses a lot in what's happening _in_  you, and how you can use your body to calm your mind. 

I'm not ashamed of who I am. I have used my DBT skills: applied a meaning to my disorder. I became borderline because in the environment where I grew up to be, I had to be what I am. I would not have survived or I would have had a fate significantly worse had I not developed borderline. Now I am not in that environment anymore and don't need it to survive. Now I need to learn to turn it off.

As such, it's not shameful. It's your way to protect yourself. We can learn better ways, healthy ways. Well that's the logic I use, it might not work or apply to you. But all in all, I'd suggest trying to look for a greater meaning, a purpose behind all this. And no this does not mean anything religious necessarily, unless that's your thing. :)",Melthiela,12w2uzx

0,"BPD was added to my list of diagnoses several years ago after I finally spilled the beans about the fact that the reason I'd checked myself back into the psych hospital was because my therapist had been raping me (not that I was willing to actually call it that at the time). 

These assholes go into fields where they are in positions of power (health care, mental health care, education, military, etc). They know what traits and vulnerabilities to look for when seeking out new prey. 

It's a very real problem that is not addressed nearly often enough and is more often than not dismissed. The rapists in these fields know that and use it to their advantage as well. 

I lost years of life to that and have had to work my ass off to get as far as I have. I'm lucky that the psychiatrist in the hospital actually believed me and tried to help. I'm also lucky that I was able to find a good therapist after everything went down because I was going to just self delete if the next therapist sucked- I was not willing to put up with any more bullshit at that point in time. A lot of people are not nearly so lucky. 

I try not to think about it too much for too long at this point, but I still feel sick thinking about how many more people my rapist has continued to hurt over the years. All of my reporting attempts back then ultimately went nowhere. The cherry on top was when it was determined that he had not raped me because he said he didn't rape me when he was asked whether or not he raped me. Because, you know, most people would definitely fess up to that kind of crime and would definitely never lie about it. üôÑ

I dropped it for a long time, but after a string of hospitalizations after my daughter was born for postpartum depression, I was not benefiting from any treatment (medication, diet & lifestyle changes, intensive outpatient program, and electroconvulsive therapy). During my most recent hospitalization in October 2019, I asked to be reevaluated. To the team there, it was pretty clear that it was BPD, and I've absolutely thrived since then.

I suffered emotional neglect as a child. I think I started looking into neglect first (HUGE revelation!) and then looking at specific symptoms I was exhibiting and that lead to my knowledge of BPD.

Did/do you have feelings that for some reason you were flawed in a way that you couldn't understand but others could see your flaw and rejected you accordingly? I used to think that maybe that was just how it was, some people were born for the specific purpose of being the outcast, like some cruel assignment from the universe. So I hated myself for whatever this undetectable flaw was that others could clearly see. And I felt that pretty much everybody in the world was better and more worthy than I (again some universal assignment of roles).

0,"BPD takes years and years to 'recover from'. As it is literally our personality, one month of therapy does not change that. You and your bf needs to realize that it's a long process. You are also capable of a relapse, and I believe most BPD people do experience a relapse at some point.

You have not regressed to anything, as there is no stages of recovery. We do not recover, we change our thought patterns and behavioral patterns gradually over years. This allows us to 'recover', in the sense that we finally get out of the toxic circle that we create for ourselves and manage to find balance. In addition to this we learn emotion control, which makes everything easier.

We are who we are. We can change, but it takes time. If he doesn't like who you are, then I don't think you're a good match. You sound like an empathetic person, and honestly he sounds horrible.

This is a quick pit to fall in, whether he does it consciously or not. Every time he disagrees with something or wants you to do something, saying 'have you gone back to your old self?' seems like a quick and easy way to get what you want. He may not realize it, but I would be careful if I was you. You might want to talk about it.

And finally, I want to say this. _The way we feel about things ARE NOT WRONG_. We lack the capability of processing and controlling our emotion. But we are not living in an imaginary world where we are dictated by insanity. You have a right to feel the way you do. You are equally as sane as he is. It's how you _act_  what counts. Do NOT discredit yourself because of BPD. We are perfectly sane people with difficulties processing emotions and bad coping mechanisms which cause us harm.",Melthiela,132hnv0

My problem comes with the facts that 1) a lot of the people in there talk about partners and family members who are undiagnosed (uBPD) which comes across as armchair psychology and is patronising to everyone involved and 2) the complete refusal to allow any hope.  Anyone with a positive story is smacked down and told that they don't really understand.

When our Dr Jeckle becomes Mz Hyde... We almost feel as if we are watching a movie play out... Or maybe a volcano would be a better example. Some volcanoes in Hawaii constantly are spewing out lava, but it's easy to know where to be to stay safe. That would be the average person... But those with BPD are more like the Mount St Helens of volcanoes, where if you were anywhere in the state near it you were effected. It was devastating. One thing to remember is that from the ashes of a volcano rise the best crops, and the most desirable land. It's just the price you have to pay for the extremely good farm land.

0,"I was just recently diagnosed. Like, a week or two ago. I have never done counseling before but after a really bad breakup with my boyfriend where I had to move out of state and back home with my parents I decided to finally get some counseling for my depression. BPD was one of the things that came up in my intake and a few weeks later here I am! My counselor has gotten me into an intensive outpatient program with DBT and I start in a few weeks. It truly is overwhelming. 

Uhm, some of my symptoms include: 
-Extremely, hyper sexual, like, if my boyfriend and I went 2-3 days without sex I would start to get cranky  fast. I would prefer to have sex everyday (or multiple times a day). He would take me to gang bangs and try to help me find FWB to help me blow off steam but I just wanted to connect with him with sex.
-Crazy fear of abadnonment,
-Crazy clingy to the one or two people I am closest to
-bad mood swings that happen in the blink of an eye
-inability to process my emotions or even idtentify why I'm upset
-getting upset for stupid, small things like my boyfriend wanting to take a nap. 
-staying upset for longer periods of time than I should have (in the nap example being mad for a day or two because instead of having sex he slept).
-suicidal ideation since middle school
-self harm, not cutting but biting my lip, tongue, cheek, pinching my own pessure points, punching myself or antaginizing someone till they hit me. (I was in  BDSM relationship so that wasn't too hard often all I had to do was ask)
-Risky behaviors such as having sex with people I had just met online that night in their hotel rooms. If there weren't condoms it was never that hard to convince me to have sex anyways (seriously, I am a sexual fiend), stealing small things like breath mints or candy (this was more in high school), risky driving when I'm upset
-poor impulse control ( 2 years ago I paid off all of my credit cards and now I have like.... $18,000 in debt), I quit my job with no notice because my boss hated me and I didn't want to do the presentation I had been assigned for work, sending text messages and e-mails on impulse that I know I shouldn't send but can't help myself.
-poor sense of self. I feel like I am broken and don't belong on earth. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. My life makes no sense since my boyfriend and I broke up.
-I constantly feel like people are judging me for the being the piece of trash that I feel like I am. 
-splitting 
-I often feel like I have this lake of anger buried inside of me. 
-I can get really overhwlemed and anxious about things that should be easy to get done. 
-territorial over small, stupid things.
-I can be really petty. I think this might be part of splitting. You piss me off and I feel like I want to rip your spine out through your belly button.....
-memory issues. Apparently that's a BPD thing??
-if I am not oiving someplace, that place tajes on a dreamlike quality, almost like I never lived there. It's really weird and trippy.
-overly sensitive.  I either am over reactive or under reactive.
-along those lines I either put up a wall that is crazy hard to breach or I overshare inappropriately.

A lot less selfish, drinking is rare, hardly ever get laid or feel like I need to, healthier friendships, I am no longer abusive and have felt in my heart that it was necessary to apologize to a lot of people, a sense of true self and an actual identity. One thing I hope someone DOES bring up with you is consent (people are not obligated to have sex with you. Ever. Whether they are your boyfriend or not.

0,"The ""splitting"" is something that is more a part of the black and white thinking rather than it being a trait all of its own. I am in DBT group therapy, every one there is diagnosed with BPD and although I can relate to a lot of people in the group there are some people in the group who I do not relate to at all but I can still understand their experience. We are all different and capable of different things, it effects us and manifests in different ways. BPD is not a definition of who you are or your personality, it's a collection of traits that combine to make life difficult for us. If you relate to some and not others then that's perfectly ok, personally I don't go to the main BPD sub anymore because a lot of the posts seem like a more extreme version of what I experience and it would bring me down. 

Would it be possible for you to get a second opinion if you're not sure this diagnosis fits? Another sub you might want to check out is /r/DBTSelfHelp even if it turns out that you don't have BPD I think DBT could be useful to anyone struggling with similar issues. ",UkuCat,ba3lx2

I know up until about 18 months ago I had just accepted that this is what my life was and then one day it was like a switch flipped and I didn't want that to be my life any more. DBT has (no exaggeration) changed my life. I'm not symptom free yet (I'm about half way through the program) but I've changed and my life has changed because of it.

That said, you don't want the BPD label. At all. The stigma around it can make things so much worse. Yes, for me getting that diagnosis explained why I react the way I do, but it caused so much more pain than I had before it. I've had doctors refuse to treat me, hospitals turn me away, mental health professionals take it upon themselves to punish me for behaviours related to BPD. Getting a dual diagnosis with bipolar has meant I can just tell doctors I have bipolar and get vastly different attitudes.


I know so many people on the spectrum (I work in disability support, mostly with people on the spectrum) who have many BPD-like traits. Especially surrounding emotion control and identity issues.

Self dx is often a part of achieving the actual diagnosis, since it lets you know that you need to look into the disorder at all. I might refrain from saying concretely that you have it, but there's nothing wrong with saying you have BPD traits. My old DBT certified (and borderline!) therapist told me that she believes BPD should be evaluated more as a spectrum than as a ""you have it or you don't"" type illness. I hope that might help with some of the invalidation you feel.

It might be helpful for you to look into DBT regardless of having a diagnosis or not, namely because the treatment is helpful to everyone - the skills are multi-purpose in many ways and can be easily applied from one conflict to another and are AMAZINGLY HELPFUL at curbing self destructive tendencies - and it might help alleviate some of your suffering.

I made a valiant effort with meds but alas I just experienced far to many side effects to even focus on therapy and getting better so 8 years ago I stopped them all. No one do this without a doctor's guidance I almost died because I'm stubborn af lol. So instead I chose DBT, CBT,  EMDR and trauma therapies as well as traditional talk therapy.  I exercise eat relatively healthy but still enjoy the not so healthy in moderation (after all we ain't getting outta this bitch alive folks! Eat the slice of cake). These were effective for me.

Medication can be a tool in the toolkit, though. It can help manage some of symptoms, which can make it easier to focus on doing the work and learning the skills that you need.

Some people find that something like an antidepressant is extremely helpful for the ""early"" stages of healing, and then are able to taper off as they learn more skills and heal some. But meds aren't for everyone, and not everyone will want or be able to come off of them (depending on other depression sources besides the BPD). YMMV.",solidparallel,10zm9b5

0,"I was diagnosed with BPD back in 2015. I was just diagnosed with ADHD not even two months ago. I‚Äôve been on stimulants a little over a month now. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned this last month:

- the stimulants have made my BPD symptoms go quiet. They‚Äôre legit a whisper. 
- the stimulants have made my depression become 85% better. Its so much better Im going to be lowering the dose of my Lamictal the end of this month to see how i do. 
- stimulants don‚Äôt work as well the week of my ‚Äúperiod‚Äù (it‚Äôs not a true period because I‚Äôm on the pill)
- the week of my ‚Äúperiod‚Äù my BPD symptoms came back with a vengeance on that Wednesday and lasted till that Sunday. So, a total of 4 days out of the month i had BPD symptoms. Once that Sunday was over, my BPD symptoms have been quiet again
-  the stimulants have improved not only my BPD and depression symptoms but my overall focus/concentration, executive dysfunction and overall energy are a so so so much better. 

I did recently make about post here about ADHD and BPD. If you look at my post history, there were some great comments on it. Hope this helps!

Edit: forgot to add that I‚Äôm sleeping so much better too",gooseglug,1bvvzny
1,"BPD and ADHD here, diagnosed a little over a year ago. I found that the Straterra (Atomoxetine) has worked VERY well for me. I don‚Äôt know if it made enough of a difference on its own, as I also went extremely heavy into mindfulness, meditation, DBT and CBT therapy up to 5 times per two weeks at max). All of this along with a ton of reading on stoicism, Taoism, and Buddhism (especially the Plum Village/Thich Nhat Hanh writing/podcast etc). 

So, I find myself at a 100% different place and, of course, still working hard to ensure that the me I am each day is me, authentically. The meds helped my focus and getting stuff done ‚úÖ which allowed me to turn chores or work into mindfulness training and the opportunity to center in the middle of a storm.

2,"I was diagnosed ADHD as a child, and got on stimulants at a very early age. Proceeded to have a troubled childhood, and developed BPD diagnosed later in life. Still taking stimulants to this day.

I would say DBT helped me the most. Ive had huge emotions my whole life, and was never believed for my genuine meltdowns, by parents or school. Learning to cope with those feelings and express myself appropriately was a skill that came with time, practice, and therapy.

My point is, I don't personally credit stimulants as doing much for me emotionally, other than reducing the stress I feel for having uncompleted work (hah, as I type this having procrastinated myself into a corner). I like my ADHD meds, and take them every weekday. I have never been prescribed any meds for my BPD. I was offered antipsychotics, but turned them down in favor of therapy. 

Best of luck to you! While no pill can cure it all, I won't downplay the positive effects that stimulants have had on my adult career. Probably shouldn't have been taking them as a child, but that's in the past. I hope you find a happy balance :)",Affection-Angel,1bvvzny

5,"You‚Äôre not! Well, if you are, you‚Äôre not alone. I was diagnosed at 37 after decadessssss of running in circles trying to get myself sorted.  My Psychiatric NP diagnosed me, I have seen her for about 10 years.  I began seeing her with run of the mill depression- which has been a factor in my life since middle school, but as time went on, life events became heavier, BPD symptoms magnified intensely.  I internalize mostly, so have done a decent job hiding it or distracting people with something else and generally polishing up my practice of ineffective coping mechanisms. The carefully constructed house of cards fell eventually, and hard.  

I, too felt like some things just totally didn‚Äôt fit. I have been in a committed marriage for 15 years- how could this be?  I googled ‚ÄúWhat does BPD look like day to day‚Äù and read around.  Mostly the thoughts and feelings were so so so relatable, more than anything ever in my life.  I read The Buddha and The Borderline- the author is younger than me and showed her traits at a much younger age, she also had some more obvious trauma, where my trauma is emotional only- mostly my family not recognizing and meeting my emotional needs.  But again, she writes her book with lots and lots of her internal dialogue, and so much of it was right from my head, down to the exact word.

I went for the full DBT model for treatment, I‚Äôve tried damn near everything else on the planet.  Weekly DBT skills group sessions, weekly individual DBT sessions, with the diary card and coaching calls and all.  This took about a year. My provider‚Äôs practice also had an weekly Emotional Resiliency group, which I went to after the year, this finished in about another 9 months.

1. Yes, I have recovered. My psychiatrist declared me officially in remission back in May of this year, based on a reevaluation. I only exhibit two of the nine criteria now. 

2. You never don‚Äôt have BPD. If you have it, you have it. When a person has ‚Äúrecovered,‚Äù that just means they have developed the skills to manage the symptoms. And, you can relapse. 

2. For me personally, going into remission hasn‚Äôt affected my memory at all. It‚Äôs still the same as it was before. 

3. I was professionally diagnosed. I heavily advocate against the self diagnosis of BPD. 

4. Yes. 

5. I was diagnosed with BPD traits when I was twelve. My symptoms presented severely enough that I was able to be diagnosed when I was sixteen. I went into remission at age 22. 

6. Yes.

7. Some people with BPD don‚Äôt need medication, but many do.

8. I did a combination of DBT, CBT, and a tiny bit of EMDR. I‚Äôm also on meds, but the cocktail that works for me may not work for everyone else. 

9. This is a difficult question to answer because it‚Äôs hard to put into words how I feel, so I just put it like this: I‚Äôm not suicidal anymore. I‚Äôm happy, I‚Äôm thriving, and I‚Äôve literally never been better. 

10. BPD is the most treatable of the cluster B personality disorders. From what I‚Äôve read, recovery is pretty common, but so is relapse. 

11. I‚Äôm not absolutely horrible to be around anymore. People genuinely enjoy my company. I‚Äôm a wonderful fianc√© (his words, not mine) and my recovery is reflected through my grades as well; I‚Äôm a straight A student.",,18p8weo

2,"Well it's not a mental illness in the sense where illnesses could be cured eventually. It's a disorder that is about your personality. That's a big word.  

Can your personality be cured? No. Can it change? Yes, to some degree. Personality is a very broad term and encompasses many things. Some of which are capable of change.

I am currently in remission. I am in a stable point of my life, safe. I don't want to hurt myself, I don't feel empty, I don't have extreme emotions that I can't deal with anymore. I don't go from love to hate, I don't take eons to calm down anymore. I can be by myself and be okay with it, I don't blame myself or hate myself. I feel proud of myself! 

I just mainly feel like I'm more safe. I can have strong emotions still but I'm not overwhelmed by them. I don't feel overly scared anymore. I have PTSD though and very severe trust issues so some of my symptoms (such as stress induced paranoia) will probably never leave because they're being amplified by other issues.

I was professionally diagnosed by a group of psychiatrists. The process started when I was 19, I got diagnosed officially at age 20. I had meds for it, and started DBT. Midway DBT I quit my meds and realized that they were making me far worse and I believe that quitting them caused my remission, together with therapy. I'm now 24.

My psychiatrist together with my therapists declared me to be on remission and my therapy discontinued. My fianc√© and I are doing much better now and are much closer. Our fights are pretty far and few and very easily resolved. Generally our life is much easier.

The statistics are easily Googleable, but the likelihood of both recovery and relapse are high. I have no idea about the condition of my amygdala, I've never had an MRI or other head imaging. But as an RN (registered nurse) myself, my educated guess would be that my amygdala hasn't had any growth haha.

0,"I had TMS! Just finished about two weeks ago. Here‚Äôs what I noticed. 

1. My physical symptoms all went away. My *physical* depression (fatigue, brain fog), anxiety (stomach aches, nausea) etc. all disappeared. It also helped greatly with binge eating. I don‚Äôt find myself craving unhealthy habits anymore, for the most part lol. 

2. I still get sad and anxious as any other human, but I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs appropriately placed. For example, instead o being anxious all the time, I‚Äôm anxious when a cop turns on their light behind me, as most people would. And then I‚Äôm able to calm down pretty quickly. I get sad when something sad happens, but I am quick to address it. 

3. I‚Äôm able to address and cope with my emotions much easier. I still deal with mood swings, but instead of being held down by my moods, I‚Äôm able to use my coping skills and self care to address them. I‚Äôm able to say ‚Äúokay, right now I‚Äôm feeling angry. What can I do in this moment to deal with this?‚Äù And then I follow through. That‚Äôs been the biggest improvement for me - being able to actually follow through on the emotional regulation.

4. I have more energy to do things. I picked up hiking as a hobby and it‚Äôs been going great. I usually quit things easily (ADHD) but with hiking I stick to it and I don‚Äôt get discouraged when it gets hard. 

The way I view TMS is not a cure for the symptoms, but it‚Äôs like taking the huge weight that‚Äôs crushing you off in order for you to be able to address what you need to address. The physical symptoms are gone, the trauma is still there, but I‚Äôm able to work through it because I‚Äôm much more clear headed. 

If you can get it covered I‚Äôd highly recommend it. In total, I had to spend about $600 out of pocket, but the total cost would‚Äôve been somewhere near $16k without insurance. 

I‚Äôd highly recommend also finding a clinic with a good technician. Some technicians just turn on the machine and leave you alone. My tech actually did some CBT and DBT skills while the machine was on, and I feel like it really helped to solidify those therapies in my head. She would have me journal or would talk with me about something stressful that happened and it was really helpful. 

It‚Äôs a time commitment, but I‚Äôm so glad I went through it.",,18tw66e

since I finished my life as improved so much, I am able to look at things differently and deeper. I am soooooo much less dissociated and even more recently have been noticing things more in general that I never had before. I‚Äôm also at a stage where all my friends are positive supportive people in my life. in the beginning of this year I still had a lot of toxic friends. I have a lot of hard stuff going on currently that I think would‚Äôve destroyed me before. I also started on lithium in August so it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint if it‚Äôs tms exclusively.

0,"Hi, congrats on your new labels! I have both BPD and ADHD dxes. To me, they are both a set of maladaptive behaviours rooted in impulsivity and difficulty self-regulating. Behaviours associated with BPD tend to manifest in extreme emotional and relational disregulation, and are often thought to be developed through trauma. ADHD behaviours tend to manifest more as executive dysfunction (being late, trouble keeping a job). Learning about ADHD helped me manage my BPD symptoms, and vice versa.

You‚Äôre a human, with your own unique intrinsic value. These labels can help you better understand and recognize behaviour patterns within yourself, help you access treatment and support, help you connect with other people who struggle with similar issues. Or they can mean whatever else feels right for you. Plenty of people no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD after therapy and/or later in life.

Hope this helps!",anaugustleaf,172ngc8
1,"I received my diagnosis early last year at age 21. BPD with histrionic & aspd traits with schizoid as well as schizotypal features. I always knew there was something going on in regards to emotional regulation. Pretty much knew by the time I was 20 that I would meet the criteria for BPD after being in a relationship with someone who had BPD and how much we were alike as well as learning how to be a supportive partner in that case. Also currently going through testing for ADHD which is interesting, puts all the hyperfixations into a bit more of a context at least. As well as a lot of the executive dysfunction.

As for how to be a human, no fucking idea. Always the popular but odd one out. At the end of the day we're all just floating on a rock living in our own tiny worlds.

I will say being obsessed with the label for a while is probably going to be helpful so you have a solid foundation of understanding. I did that, and then afterwards I begun primarily just focusing on what symptoms are affecting me and not necessarily the labels. For example currently I‚Äôm focusing what it is in my behaviour that makes friendships and relationships unstable over time and why people keep falling in love with me. (No need to call me a siren, witch or banshee, heard that enough by now.) Which could both be attributed to BPD and HPD traits but it‚Äôs the symptoms that are causing problems at the end of the day.

Also just accepting that yeah there are abnormal things I have to deal with meaning I just walk the road less traveled and thus for better or worse can't live a boring life like most people.

Medication is also worth trying, it can be immensely helpful. Having been on lamictal (a mood stabilizer) for 6 months gave me more breathing room to focus on my other symptoms. I am currently tapering off of it due to side effects that only recently began, and so many things are more difficult than they need to be again. And that‚Äôs okay. The world didn‚Äôt end though and I‚Äôll be trying out lithium and ritalin or concerta after I‚Äôm done tapering.

The way I look at things is that everyone has a backpack with rocks, people with bpd just have more rocks in their backpack.In short what has helped me most has been people, group therapy, discipline, nutrition, exercise and radical acceptance. Especially just coming to terms with how dark the abyss can be one moment and how ethereal life can be the next. Most people won‚Äôt experience that, so generally I feel alone in that regard, just having one person that gets that though really makes a difference so I try to always have at least one person where there isn‚Äôt anything to hide. So I hope you have someone like that. I didn‚Äôt plan on being on this planet or having BPD but I‚Äôm gonna make what I can of it. I don‚Äôt think I would wish to be without the intensity it brings and the older I get the easier the waves become to glide across.

This became longer than expected, oh well. Anyways, I do wanna ask how important the label is to you? Or whether there‚Äôs anything in particular about BPD that is troublesome?

Oh and also, the label isn‚Äôt a death sentence despite how stigmatised it is. You have already made it this far on this surreal journey that is life :)",MemoriesChange,172ngc8

This is different than that other people expect of you, or what other people expect you to act like. It‚Äôs who you are when no one is looking. What things you inherently gravitate towards without shame. From there, you can engage in hobbies or work that reflects this. And friends/partners who are uplifting and supportive. Having supportive relationships can  validate this internal values set you have. It‚Äôs sort of then like an echo chamber of validation that solidifies the identity.

So I read ""I Hate You, Don't Leave Me"" and it really resonated. Of course, back then no one would consider a diagnosis in a teenager, and also I wasn't allowed to go to therapy until my suicide attempt at 16... 

I was in and out of treatment throughout college, but mostly out, and by now I understood the BPD stigma enough that I was afraid to mention it because I didn't trust my providers enough not to use it as an excuse to put me in the hospital (I got sent to the ER twice when I wasn't even suicidal, and it was a freaking nightmare).

Anyway, it didn't really come up again until a really bad breakup at 28. A mutual acquaintance asked if I'd ever heard of BPD. Despite that I was still hitting all nine criteria, I basically got laughed at by my psychiatrist for suggesting it. So I took that to mean I *didn't* have it, not that I should find another provider.

It wasn't until I was telling a different psychiatrist two years ago about a particularly bad episode where she was like, ""I'm not *saying* you have BPD, but you would benefit from DBT."" That was the kick I needed. I did six months of DBT skills group, started seeing a therapist again, and read as much as I could about BPD. I'm 39 now. I've decided to hell with the stigma.

11,"I can only explain what happened, that I knew I had a big problem but no idea what it was or why it was happening over & over. 

I had extreme meltdowns/episodes since early childhood. They were a mix of rage, frustration, hurt & desperation all at once. I couldn't calm down on my own whatsoever & nothing seemed to work to make me feel better. I couldn't explain what was 'wrong' during an episode because I had no idea why I felt so bad. Then depression/suicidal ideation got added when I was a teenager. The depression was pretty much constant but would dip to horrible lows. 

I never had any type of mania, euphoria or 'highs'. If I ever felt something close to that, it was only high-energy anger during an episode. I felt super charged rage, never extreme happiness or frantic behavior *outside* of an episode where I was angry/upset. 

My episodes were only triggered around my mom, never anyone else. I begged her for help, she said 'Its just a phase, you'll grow out of it.' I was fine in school & with friends. Then I started dating at 14 & boyfriends would trigger episodes. It became obvious it was just the people who I was extra close with who upset me, but I didn't know why. 

I didn't really have internet access in high school because it was the 1990s so I couldn't easily find info. I heard about bi-polar but didn't think I had it because I never had that time of mania. I thought I had 'depression' with some type of 'anger management' problem. I thought I was the only person in the world with this problem & I didn't think it was it's own disorder. I never heard of 'personality disorders'. I only knew about psychopaths/sociopaths & knew that wasn't it. 

Around 2000, when I was 22, I had a friend who got out of a psych hospital with a BPD diagnosis. She was the only person I knew who had similar problems as I did.  She told me her diagnosis, I looked it up online and it was the first time I saw anything that described my life. But back then, everything I read said there was no known treatment, prognosis was 'poor' & that nothing really seems to help it. It was too depressing to keep reading so I decided to ignore it & just hope it would go away. That's how I first 'knew' it might be BPD. 

I very briefly saw 2 therapists who suggested BPD. I stopped going because I didn't want that it be it. I didn't get any more professional help until I was around 28, after I had a breakdown with psychosis.",Piconaught,13i6vf1

In my next relationship that lasted a year I was never even once verbally abusive... I was only knowingly manipulative once and though I was emotionally manipulative it was much much less.

But at the same time, it's not really worth sharing with people in my personal life. It won't have a positive impact on my friendships if I disclose this diagnosis. My friends already like me for who I am, and this medical label isn't one that I want to be permanently associated with in the social scene.",Affection-Angel,1btf8k2
4,"CPTSD ADHD and quiet BPD/CO-dependant here.

I cope with my diagnosis as I understood it.
CPTSD is at the core of my issue, this one I share because it makes it relatable. 

ADHD because either trauma reactions take too much of my brain capacities or the fact that it started during a crucial phase in my development.
I sometimes share it as I am taking medication.

BPD is the set of coping mechanisms that I developed in order to survive with my trauma.
I identify less and less to it after lots of therapy. 

I do not share that one as almost nobody can relate.
If anybody ask I would explain that, due to trauma I developed disregulated emotions and that I just need time to ""collect and reflect"" .

I have shared my diagnosis but it has been used against me. It gave a free path to all the assholes I tend to associate with to blame me instead of taking ownership of their own malfunctions.

It's kind of disgusting seeing how people just turn a different tune after you say it. 
As said above, I said it from my need for validation.
I wanted people to understand me, to love me ""completely"".
Turns out,  it went the opposite way.
Turns out I need to love myself that much, nobody else's can understand myself as much as I do.

I am glad you're a therapist,  this is helping me so much when my therapist can relate to my internal turmoil or make it look less heavy.

People tend to think of personality disorders as a true crime show. For them you become evil and manipulative...
It's funny because many of those in my surroundings who overreacted have  themselves some kind of personality disorder too.

My ex partner even dared to put his lies and cheating  on my PD. His mother and sister labeled me as highly toxic while they are themselves way above the norm in that area.

It's like it's blinding self reflection for people.

Some of my friends reacted really well. Not precisely the people I thought would. Very securely attached people aren‚Äôt that scared, or people that already had a long therapy and know themselves well.

I really think it's time to reframe BPD for the public.
We are not all hysterical and manipulative.

I am for instance very controlling to MYSELF and give the benefit of the doubt to people I love without setting boundaries in fear of abandonment. 

If there is anger or emotional turmoil it's inward and people outside just see someone at most ""slightly irritated "".

My emotions run fast yes, again,  inwards.

You wouldn't label me as volatile. People think of me as ""emotional"" but before I tell them my diagnosis they tend to find it very manageable. 
After, all of the sudden, I am evil.
And if I dare yo put a boundary, which is very healthy, it suddenly become something else.

You'll be amazed by the amount of persons willing to put their wrongdoing onto your diagnosis if you tell.

I am usually for opening up about my mental state, but borderline is, with NPD, the ones you do not want to share.
Either people think the diagnosis is wrong (especially with quiet BPD) or do a 180¬∞ behavioral change and you become evil.

Even a sociopath could share his diagnosis with less  trouble honestly as we have had a bad rep on social media these last years.

All of my symptoms and co-morbidities come from long term trauma. 

That's what I say now.

Knowing how much rejection sensitivity I have I'll spare myself.",SavorySour,1btf8k2
5,"So, in my experience, I‚Äôve told people that I‚Äôve trusted in the past about this. My platonic friends? They have always been so accepting because they see me for who I am. I show up with enthusiasm and I always manage my emotions around them pretty well. My relationship partners? Well, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ended well. All of my past traumas have been weaponized against me at some point. Just pretty much reading me to filth. Which is unfortunate because a.) when I first got diagnosed with BPD, I was struggling IMMENSELY from transitioning to adulthood. I suffered very extreme trauma as a child. I was overprotected and not allowed to develop normally as an adolescent. I was very, very socially inept. I was dealing with very complex PTSD. So, during my intake, at age 18, at a community college psychiatric office, I was diagnosed with BPD. I don‚Äôt align with that diagnosis, to be honest with you. I think i got misdiagnosed. I truly do believe I align more with my autism diagnosis. It makes abundantly more sense. Now, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with the fact that I was diagnosed with BPD. It was very eye opening. But all of my partners, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if my recent ex would say this, have all written me off as a ‚ÄúBPD ex‚Äù, when, in reality, I have sensory overload and years of trauma that I‚Äôve handled to the best of my ability. I don‚Äôt snap at people. I don‚Äôt paint them black and white and I haven‚Äôt in years. I show empathy and I do my very best to respect boundaries once they are established. I enjoy spending my time alone. 
If you do decide to share that diagnosis, that is entirely your right and no one else‚Äôs. It is very stigmatized and I don‚Äôt really trust people that say they had a ‚Äúcrazy ex girlfriend‚Äù without giving any real context from both sides. Very neutral standpoint. 
I‚Äôve yet to meet a person, namely a man,  who hasn‚Äôt demonized their ex without providing full context. Not that anyone is entitled to that, but a lot of people will simply PUSH women to their absolute emotional limit and when they have a strong reaction (i.e., reactive abuse), they are painted as monsters for finally sticking up for themselves. 
Anyway, huge wall of text. But your diagnosis is not the full scope of you. You are more than just a diagnosis. Our stories of overcoming shame and trauma make us more empowered. Cheers",simplyexisting24,1btf8k2
6,"First thing, wait a couple of weeks. Maybe a month
 Take some time to absorb the new information.

If you eventually decide to tell people, don't do it en masse. Do it individually, and face to face. Avoid using your diagnosis to explain away past behaviours - it'll sound like you're making excuses. A better angle is that having a diagnosis means you now know what you need to work on - it gives you a clearer roadmap to fixing the issues that caused your previous bad behaviour.",BakaDasai,1btf8k2
7,"I tell people about BPD the moment I meet them. It's a good filter for those who will not be able to handle me anyway, for those who are not genuine and for those who judge others.

I don't need people who can't accept my diagnosis - if merely hearing about it will scare them away then they could never handle truly knowing who I am anyway. And I don't need those kinds of fake friends. I also find that it makes my life easier and more free: don't have to hide anything. I can openly admit when I struggle. When I have a massive meltdown because my seat belt won't work, my boyfriend knows exactly why and won't mock me but instead knows how to handle the situation. 

I would encourage telling your loved ones. The ones that truly are worth sticking around for will have your back. It will make it easier for them and most of all for you. It'll give them a reason why sometimes you are one way and the next second the other. It'll give them answers on why you sometimes behave the way you do and perhaps will help them be more understanding and encourage you instead of blame you.

9,">I‚Äôve been so emotionally reactive that I depersonalized that version of myself. When I‚Äôve felt invalidated or challenged emotionally within an intimate and vulnerable context, I split! Not only do those around me fail to recognize the person I show up as, I don‚Äôt know her as well. This lack of sense of self created such a deep loneliness that I wanted to die. Killing myself would ‚Äúshow them‚Äù, you know?

I can really relate. I named ""her"" the ice queen. Fortunately these past years she didn't have yo show up as much. But when she does, she doesn't give a second thought, it's like bringing people to their collapse without blinking.
Somewhere it's nice to know, that if I need her for real reasons,  she'll be there.
But the thing is she could come without real motive. A perceived danger was enough.
As you said especially in a vulnerable context.

What I realized later in therapy is that it was mostly a BIG reaction to a REAL event.

I know it's hard but take it from me I recently had a similar thing I got really close to a friend and we were even intimate at one point but she made it clear we could only be friends and that I shouldn't get obsessed with her. I kept telling myself that we had to just stay friends and she was also trying to give me space to get over her but I was so crazy. I kept saying ""oh this time is different, this time it's true love, this time she sees me"". When I finally talked to her about it she said we couldn't date cause she discovered she's a lesbian. I split on her because I felt so used and my brain was just like ""she never even liked you back she lied"" and now we probably will never be friends again and I had to take a leave of absence from school cause I spiraled.

1,"Yes, I was in an awful relationship before my diagnosis. I think if your therapist believes he is being emotionally abusive, that's probably a good sign that he is. Is there someone you trust other than your therapist, a close friend or family member maybe, that you can tell them exactly what he's doing and saying? My breakthrough in realising my boyfriend was abusive was when I was venting about him to a friend who outright said ""this sounds like emotional abuse, I'm worried about you"". Or at the beginning of your next session, say you want to discuss something before getting into the actual therapy and describe what he's been doing and saying and whether it sounds like you're splitting in her professional opinion, and ask outright if it sounds like it is a healthy relationship. It's hard for anyone who is in an abusive relationship to see it, and even harder for people who are otherwise vulnerable on top of that (i.e. having BPD). I would say trust your instincts as well - if you think he is being outright cruel, and you don't think you're splitting and still feel that way when you feel more emotionally regulated, then it is likely he is being cruel and saying you're splitting is just gaslighting you",eveisout,1cqnhrq

1,"Many folks with BPD struggle with abandonment, and you're in a situation where you're being repeatedly ""abandoned"" by your partner's rejection of your sexual advances. 

I'm trying to phrase this in a way that it does not sound like I think anyone ever ""owes"" anyone sex ever for any reason ever ever ever... but it's a situation set up to fail. You want something from your partner: attention, affection, intimacy. These are EXTREMELY NORMAL needs that healthy people have. Wanting sex is not inherently bad, wanting affection is not inherently needy, having a need and wanting it met is not asking too much. Your partner has made it clear that they *cannot* meet those needs for you. Point blank. You aren't compatible in that way and the ripples extend so far beyond ""meh, guess I just have sex less often.""

I was in a relationship that was (sexually) almost exactly what you are describing and I cannot tell you how fucking low it got me. I thought it would be fine, it's just sex, it's not like we never had sex or I never felt attractive, but Jesus fucking Christ, it was too much. The rejection never got any easier. Your partner's sexual habits should not drive you to suicidal ideation. Period. That's not okay. That's not a little hiccup to learn to be okay with.

Once I started getting treatment and getting mentally healthier, it didn't make me adjust my sex drive, **it made me adjust what I believed I deserved in a relationship.** And I deserved to feel desired and attractive and I deserved to have my pretty standard sexual desires met. And so do you :)

0,"I think the depersonalization feels key here for you. It sounds like you're struggling to be present inside of yourself, which manifests both in not feeling connected to relationships that you value and also not feeling connected to your own sense of self. Maybe try journalling or processing with a therapist or someone you trust, how this feels and what it is you're subconsciously trying to avoid by detaching from yourself. For example, are you afraid to feel attached - if so, why? Are you afraid to feel emotional intensity - if so, are there specific emotions that feel intense?

I can relate to some of what you're feeling. I went through a pretty intense betrayal from a person I was close to about a year ago and since then I've really struggled to feel connected to anyone. I feel like if any of my remaining relationships were to end I would feel nothing. For me its an avoidance of allowing myself to feel the strength of my attachments because I'm afraid of the grief I'll feel to lose somebody else.

Anyone else here have the realization that they're kind of a garbage human unmedicated?  
I was diagnosed back in 2018 after getting fed up with my own temper, because I knew it was way out of line and abnormal. I hyperfocused on BPD, read some books, got a few workbooks, started on medication and found my sweet spot.  
  
All of that has led to a lot of self awareness and recovery, and lately I made a casual comment to a friend that when I'm not medicated I'm overall just a garbage human and she got a little upset with me. It's not even meant to be self depreciating or derogatory, it's just the truth. üòÇ Anyone else feel that way?",RotterWeiner,16dfyra
3,"I've come a long way in the last two years being medicated.  I've also learned a lot about communicating my emotions and needs, where as I used to run away from situations that I couldn't deal with or shut down when I got overwhelmed.  I was also known to have meltdowns and self harm.

I wouldn't say that I'm a garbage human being unmedicated, but I was a human being that made mistakes and handled things poorly.  And I think that's a distinction that's important to make.

9,"Unfortunately, a lot of autistic women are misdiagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. This is because there are overlapping symptoms, but the difference is looking at the root cause of the symptom, not just the symptom at the surface level.

Women who are Autistic may also have c/PTSD, which can look like BPD to someone who is not specialized in autism, especially if you're high-masking.

If you haven't already, check out embrace-autism.com There are tons of online assessments you can take that include ones for masking as well. They even have a post about BPD vs Autism and how they overlap/why they're misdiagnosed.  
  
This is part of that post that I found really helpful:

**""Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS)**  
Another psychometric questionnaire is the VIA-IS. It looks at personality traits and has been used to investigate personality characteristics consistent with different conditions. Below you can see traits that are low and high in BPD and in autism.\[45\]  


**VIA-IS Character Strengths** ***underused*** **in:**  
BPD: kindness, honesty, self-regulation, prudence, perspective, and love  
Autism: self-regulation, zest, leadership, teamwork, social intelligence  


**VIA-IS Character Strengths** ***overused*** **in:**  
BPD: social intelligence, judgment, bravery, curiosity, and zest  
Autism: honesty, love of learning, perspective, judgment, fairness, prudence  


Based on the patterns in character strengths found using the VIA-IS, in many ways, these two conditions are very different. However, BPD and autism do share a high score in judgement and a low score in self-regulation. Using these character strengths and weaknesses, clinicians can further support the reliability and validity of their diagnoses.""

0,"My mom passed away recently after being diagnosed with a similar but much more quick moving lung disease. She would have died in six months after her diagnosis but she got a double lung transplant and actually lived for 2.5 more years before going into to rejection and passing away.

I cared for my mom for the three years before she passed - and let me tell you - she constantly felt guilty for being a burden and wanted to do things on her own, and the one thing I WISHED she had done, was tell me when she needed help. I always had to read through her insisting that she didn‚Äôt need it and that I should go on with my life - it was confusing for me, because I wished she would just allow me to be there for her. But she would cover up her pain and suffering so I could ‚Äúbe free of her‚Äù but really‚Ä¶ I was happy to be there for her, because I loved her. 

It was hard for me to be a caregiver, yes. I was unhappy a lot, yes. She was difficult and it was a trying time. But I LOVE her. I WANTED to help her. I was GRATEFUL to be there for her. 

This really opened my eyes as a BPD person to when I push people away because I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbother‚Äù them with ‚Äúmy troubles‚Äù. 

You‚Äôre about to embark on a difficult journey - and if your boyfriend wants to stay with you, then LET HIM. ALLOW him to love you!

It‚Äôs his choice. Do you respect him? Let him make his choice, and then respect it. If he wants to stay with you, it‚Äôs not your move to doubt him. Trust his ability to make the right choice for himself, and allow him to be there for you if he wants to be.

Through the three years I had living with my mom, there were these rare moments when she would let me in. She would tell me how scared she was, or we would lie in the dark and cry together about how hard things were. There were many happy days and moments together too - watching love is blind together and yelling at the TV, going through crazy situations together like when she spilled a poop sample in the car and we just died laughing while driving with all the windows down in the middle of the fucking snowy freezing winter. The way she would wake up and bring me coffee every morning even though walking was hard for her and would make her out of breath. 

Those moments of connection and togetherness were amazing for me, and it was frustrating that I had to constantly push back against her denials of wanting help, to force her to accept help, which would allow those connecting moments to come. 

By pushing him away you are not only getting rid of the difficulty, but you are also robbing the both of you of possibly many years of connection and closeness. COPD usually is slow moving and is not debilitating for a long time - it is possible for the two of you to have many very happy years together before things get really hard.

Lung transplants are also often very successful on younger people. My mom was older and in fragile condition - but many people will go on to live 15 years+ after a transplant, living a relatively normal life.

No matter what happens, you have to allow someone to care for you. I suggest getting s therapist asap because this shit is hard. I wish my mom would have had someone who would help her open up to me during that time. I wanted so badly to be let in on her experience, so I could be there WITH her. I didn‚Äôt want to be locked out and ‚Äúfree of her‚Äù. I wanted to be with her. Let him be with you now. Let yourself be with him too. It‚Äôs going to be ok",Astrnougat,16w9liz

Along my journey to self actualization or healing I was conditioned to focused primarily on Western Medicine solutions as they‚Äôve been aggrandized. 

What I learned is that the entire Health Care System is infested with con artists - covert narcissists who ignore the root cause an it contralto worsens through out your life spans by hide the symptoms. 

I learned from Dr. Sam. Vaknin, Dr. Gabor Mate, Dr. Shefali to name a few that those attracted to the Health Care System including Psychiatry were caged in the role
of care taker or rescue savior due to their dysfunctional family system. Yes they too have a false self or
God Complex like BPD. It‚Äôs rigid, omnipotent and they believe their lies. 

Those who studied health care in college invested in memorizing a script and adopting it as truth without knowing the consequences of the actions taken. 

They had grandiose hopes that big pharma was contributing to medicine as a cements. Many never realize they are living in a god complex  full
of confabulations. Once we become enlightened we all realize we‚Äôve been lied to on every level by everybody and begging to find real answers by going within. 

Health Care is laughing all the way to the bank with your money. They create dependency not autonomy in clients. A parasitic system.


You may find curing yourself through studying what works and does not work for you is a way to stay focused on yourself rather than others. Your abandonment wound is ripped open. Where you self destruct and push people away. You‚Äôll have to become friends with the many broken children inside of you before they will be kind to others. First they must learn to be kind to you and allow you to control yourself. 
We are a hostage to your own childhood until we heal
When BPD is alone they abuse themselves. When they are with others they instigate others to abuse them or they abuse others. 

There is no point for BPD to have relationships until they have 5 hobbies they are experts in. 

We are never in a relationship with anyone else. We are only in relationships with the broken pieces of our selves. With our distorted hearing filter that perceives everything as an attack, slight, criticism, or abandonment . 
We are all empty. Literally notice your body when you stay still. It becomes stuck stagnant and a black whole.


How will you close the chakras that are ripped open? 

Get involved in fitness. We can understand Psychology all day but most psychologists are at home abusing their spouses or being abused because they thought there were going to find the answer to ending the narcissistic abuse cycles they suffered in childhood. 

We have to reprogram our entire nueromuscular system. The core is missing there is only a shell of hell",,16ht0os

It may be worth noting that I'm a cis male who experienced neglect/non-attachment with my mother and psychological abuse from my father. I'm not sure that it was intentional that I'm in a time-limited program and I worked first with a female and then with a male. I experienced significant transference with both therapists and not coincidentally primarily worked on issues relating to my mother first and to my father second. My fellow clients represent a wide range of identities and ethnicities, and everyone is well-treated and (in my estimation) making noticable progress.

I'm currently transitioning out of the program and have been advised to work with an individual therapist twice a week, a process group once a week and continued medication management. It also may be worth noting that I still have a long way to go and have co-morbid treatment-resistant depression and substance-use disorder (the latter is currently in remission). I hope this helps. 

If you happen to live in the NYC area, I strongly urge you to try to enter the [Center for Intensive Treatment of Personality Disorders](https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/west/care/psychiatry/citpd) at Mount Sinai West. They staff is uniformly first-rate, and the practitioners work together on each client's case very closely. There's a waiting list, but it's worth the wait (about 4 months, I think).

For me, I'd already done a ton of other therapies before this so I went in with some tools prepared, and so I've found this group to be very helpful in terms of working on core issues derived from childhood and getting to deep, buried emotions. I can't say yet whether it'll be ""transformative"" but I know I've made a lot of progress I wouldn't have in individual therapy for sure.",IAmMeIGuess93,z8l2tx

* The Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook by Dr Daniel Fox

I haven't tried the second one but I love the author's youtube videos. He really gets BPD and is empathetic, unlike a lot of mental health professionals. and I like workbooks because you practice the skills, rather than just read about DBT and forget it in a day haha",,o7q285

I also found guided inner child meditation to be crazy beneficial - did one, cried my eyes out and hugged my childhood self‚Ä¶.

also, perhaps the dbt stuff won't always feel so hard or like extra work. for me, some coping thoughts and distress tolerance skills are becoming automatic! this is huge bc i have adhd and also struggle with habits/routines.

2,"I'm in no way experienced enough to answer or comment on most of these questions, but relationships are also my biggest trigger. With a lot of time and thinking, I believe that the reason I act more intensely with my boyfriend is because I feel more comfortable and safe with him. I don't feel like I need to hide who I am and how I handle things. It takes a lot of discipline, communication, and honesty for my bf and I to maintain a healthy relationship.",cruzbruv,zlha5y
3,"First, congrats on the 1 year mark!!! ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥  Second, I'm going to frame my answers for what I've learned about myself rather than tell you why you might do these things bc I don't want to be presumptuous and BPD is unique for how it develops and manifests. 

I think relationships trigger us the most bc ultimately BPD isn't just an emotional issue, its a relationship issue. I've been doing research on early childhood development and found a lot of my abandonment issues stem from lack of object permanence. If that milestone is not met in childhood it turns into lack of emotional permanence. I could be wrong but that is what makes sense for me. 

Work and sticking to a schedule for me is more about my lack of executive functioning rather than just boredom. I have a difficult time prioritizing and I can't stand a schedule. I had to get real with myself on this bc I was making myself miserable just by trying. Once I did I was able to balance the need to keeping a job and having a creative outlet. It helps the monotony. 

Growing out of jealousy....still working on that one. I've found that figuring out the actual root cause of why I feel jealous, and not why I ""think"" I feel jealous, really helps. I really have to listen to my inner child for this bc a majority of the time the underlying theme is I'm afraid someone will take whatever it is away from me. 

I have heard that people go into ""remission"" but really its learning the skills and applying them every day. It becomes 2nd nature and eventually automatic. 

I hope some of that helps!",Hungry_Mud8196,zlha5y
4,"Ohhh how I relate to you on this... Even the one year relationship thing. I very recently subconsciously tried to sabotage our wonderful relationship and even told him upfront that being in a relationship makes me 1000x less stable. I prefer being alone, but once you really fall in love, evidently you can't just quit. I wish I could sometimes. 

I think the DBT skills are just something we have to do forever, but from what I understand, the idea is to retrain your brain, so it should get easier the more you practice and the more serious you are about it. I'm still trying too, but damn it's exhausting. 

I also have a horrible time with jealousy. Unfortunately my gentleman is divorced and has two daughters with his ex so she's /always/ in the damn picture. I hate hate hate it and can't seem to get used to it, so I just hide it as well as I can (which isn't very well, lol). I'm lucky he is patient with me. 

You're not alone... We are not alone. I'm so grateful for this sub. Sending you loving vibes. üíìü™∑

ETA: I was doing SO WELL for like a year after my diagnosis and really regularly practicing DBT and keeping up with my journaling and reading Stoic literature... Then I felt like I just relapsed. I'm an addict, so it really did feel like a relapse... I stopped regularly doing my healthy coping stuff and just slid right back into my unhealthy thinking and my bad brain came back with a vengeance. Behavior therapy is something you just have to continually keep up, and it's so hard to constantly stick with it. People do not understand how much effort it takes for us to be okay. üòî",twirlingparasol,zlha5y

3,"Okay, so I would like to fill it out but tbh, most of my answers wouldn't indicate trauma, for the same reason that my BPD wasn't even identified until I was 36. My trauma was due to Sensory Processing Disorder that was completely undiagnosed and no one had a clue I had it until a few months prior to figuring out I had BPD and doc confirming it (in fact, not knowing I had SPD led us to erroneously thinking I didn't have any abuse/neglect/trauma, hence the delay in diagnosis). But I quite literally have lived my life in fear as a result of the undiagnosed SPD and no one knowing what it was or providing me with the tools to manage it. It led to a number of very traumatic incidences from the SPD itself, but also situations resulting from it (as in I would be convinced my mom was screaming at me and wouldn't stop, all because my senses were telling me that was the case; or I would be accused of being nosey for overhearing private conversations, unaware I had damn bat hearing at that moment and was hearing a conversation not meant for me). It caused an immense amount of trauma that I am just now beginning to unravel. My BPD reactivity seems to be very intertwined with my SPD even now - when I'm feeling more sensory overload I am much quicker to react in the typical BPD anger way. 

Anyway, I say this because it's so important to know that trauma is not the same for everyone, and issues like SPD are tremendously overlooked and can cause trauma and resulting BPD/C-PTSD to be completely missed because they weren't sexually abused, seemed to have loving caring parents, etc. Please, please keep that in mind as you continue your education and future psychology career if that's the path you take.",Brains-In-Jars,mnen9h

I'll tell you one thing. The further along in DBT I get and the more skilled I'm becoming at self regulating, the less severe my bipolar symptoms are although it's definitely a challenge to sus out the differences at times. 

A lot of it has to do with replacing drug use with healthier coping skills I think, drugs are pretty destabilizing and catalysts for bipolar episodes. 

And when I'm creating fewer interpersonal problems for myself there are fewer life stressors, which also helps curb mood episodes. I'm still considered rapid cycling and unwilling to take certain meds so this is kinda my life.

I was diagnosed literally yesterday but only because I have been honest with my doctors finally after 15 years of being in my relationship. Idk how I could have inflected this much pain without ever realizing it. 

You asked where to start, I started with watching YouTube videos last night, from licensed professionals, and was able to better understand what is happening when I get triggered. I am hopeful to practice better coping mechanisms when I am triggered rather then feed directly into my darkest emotions. Step one of many but we have to start somewhere.",Hairy-Visual-4408,17dzh35

0,"As someone with PTSD, is it possible that your wife may have PTSD? Having nightmares about past events is not uncommon and often us with BPD have a very traumatized past.

Maybe there is something there that she hasn't processed yet. Maybe it's her brain's way or telling her that there's something she hasn't gone through yet.

I know for me, I used to get these nightmares about my sister after her untimely death. In my dreams she had miraculously gotten resurrected, much to my family's absolute delight. I was the only one who knew that she was not truly alive and was some sort of a zombie that was decaying from the inside. In my dreams I was desperately trying to keep her alive so my parents would not be devastated again.

I had to truly stop and pause with my therapist on these dreams. What did they truly mean, what was my brain trying to process while I was sleeping? Was it the traumatizing event where I had to personally tell my parents that their first born had died? Was it the fact that I had to shoulder all of the regret and guilt that my sisters death had caused my parents to feel? Was it the fact that I hadn't fully yet accepted she was gone?

Dreams as they are, they might not have a clear meaning. But my dreams subsided once I actually started to discover what they meant and started to actively process them.

In addition, some really powerful sleep meds can impact your sleep in a way that it's too deep to dream. It affects the quality of sleep overall, but will probably get rid of the nightmares. I advice possibly seeking out a psychiatrist.

The environment (aka sleep hygiene, I recommend googling it!) will also help. Fresh linen, calm and quiet, slightly lowered temperature etc also can affect the quality of sleep positively.",Melthiela,174f4je

Many will say in the various threads that BPD is incurable. Don‚Äôt believe it.

Basically they ask you a few questions and give you skills that can help you cope.

Be careful with subreddits made for people who have loved ones with BPD. I've visited them and they've made me go down a doom spiral thinking that I was unloveable and hopeless. That's 100% not the case.

Make a long list of coping skills for bad days. What do you like to do when you‚Äôre happy? Movies, video games, coloring/art, listen to music, go for walks; exercise, writing/reading, hanging out with a friend. Breathing exercises.

1,"I haven't been treated. I've been doing everything by myself for the past 2 years. I've spoken to 2 different therapists in that time span, and they didn't help either. I didn't have any support systems until this year, and even then it's still hard because I have this never ending guilt that the 2 people that are there for me have to stop what they're doing to help me or listen to me. I still struggle with my symptoms, but every day I learn how to cope with them and be able to live my life.

2 years ago, I began a relationship with someone who I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. The first 2 months, we talked on the phone every day and did everything together. During our third month dating, he told me that while him and I were talking romantically before we became official, he had a sexual relationship with this girl in his friend group. I was shattered. I flipped out, crying, isolating myself, and had a hard time accepting what he told me. Not because of their sexual relationship, but because he had let me be friends with this girl, the girl who would send me pictures of my own bf, and tell me how cute we were together. I felt betrayed.

Our fourth month was rough as he was gaining my trust back, and we started bonding over video games. The next couple months were great until he told me that his friends were pressuring him to vape. I told him I was completely against this, and if he did this I would be upset. Two weeks later he told me that he did it anyway and didn't know how to tell me. Again I was very upset. Not because he was vaping but because even though he knew that I would be upset with this he didn't care enough and still did it. After this, our relationship became too toxic. I was crying nearly every day, all the time I was spending with my bf disappeared, and I was constantly waiting for his every beckoning call. I would be left for 8 hours almost every day without a text or call. And when I would ask him to make time with him, he would tell me how he never does anything with his friends, so I stopped bothering him.

I eventually voiced my concerns and told him that I'm scared that he's manipulating me. There were so many double standards, and he would yell at me for the smallest things like if I cut my hair without telling him I was going to do it, or because he told me something that upset me. We fought back and forth for months. We finally had a heart-to-heart, and he told me he was manipulating me and didn't mean to. I decided that I also had some faults in our relationship and wanted to get better. I started going to therapy again because I started self harming. Everything started to look up, until I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me.

I was shattered. The last bit of me that was begging for help was taken from me. I felt so disgusted by him, and I broke up with him. He was my favorite person though, so we did get back together. He told me he would do anything to gain my trust back and how sorry he was. I wanted to believe him because while all this toxicity in our relationship was happening, my parents were never there for me, and my boyfriend had isolated me from all my friends and family. I was scared that if I left him, I would be alone and wouldn't be able to escape my unhealthy environment.

Our 1 year anniversary was coming up, and things were still rocky. I would lash out at him and tell him I hate him. We were never the same. Everything felt like a chore to him. He didn't change his behavior for longer than a week after we had conversations about him not doing his part. After our 1 year, I finally had enough because he told me I just needed to get over his infidelity. We broke up for good, and I cried as he consoled me. We eventually stopped all communication, and I made a plan to end everything. I had no more hope and didn't see a point in living when I was always going to be unhappy. I felt incurable, and I didn't want to continue living a life where I constantly had to just survive. I texted my ex and told him what I was planning to do. He talked me out of it for the time being, and I started going to therapy again.

After months of therapy, I still felt the same. I didn't think I was going to make it to the next year. I always had a plan to end things. My parents still weren't supporting me, I barely had any friends, and school felt pointless. However, I decided that I wanted things to change. I wanted to enjoy the last few months I had planned on living until I decided it was time. I changed my perspective on life and started living in the moment. Whatever brought me joy at that time, I did it even if it was dangerous.

I researched coping skills, practiced mindfulness, and began forgiving people who had wronged me. In therapy, I was focusing on taking care of my inner child. This is what had helped me out of that horrible mindset of live fast, die young. I felt responsible for this imaginary child as if I was a mother. Every day, I would ask the child, which I knew was myself, how their day was, how they were feeling, if there was anything that was making them uncomfortable. I lulled myself to sleep every night, as sleeping alone was a big trigger for me after my break up.

I started putting myself out there and talking to more people. I listened to my body and skipped school when I didn't feel well mentally. My main priority was myself. No matter what the consequences were, I decided that I can't do anything if I am not okay and would deal everything when I was in the right head space. Very slowly things got better for myself. I still didn't have any support, I still felt alone, but I was learning to enjoy my own company. I became my best friend because I knew that I was going to be by my side through everything. I became the person I had wished was there to help me.

In the past year, I have made so much progress all by myself. I made friends that will be there for me long term, and I started dating again. My relationship with my parents has only deteriorated, which definitely affects me, but I've learned that no matter what I do, my parents will never support me unless I am doing exactly what they want.

I'm still learning how to have a healthy relationship with my partner and how to cope with daily life every day. But I want to get better, and through every hardship, I know that if I don't give into my impulsive and intrusive thoughts that things will clear up eventually, and I can continue my goal of being truly okay. I'm no longer waiting for things to be handed to me or for things to magically change. If I want something, I am going to get it. Things just take time, patience, and persistence.

Idk if this is exactly what you wanted to hear, but I'm here if you need anything. PM me if you need to :) hope this helped <3",cruzbruv,zmgsjl

3,"If you read up on it you'll find that to be the concensus through the literature of BPD. The symptoms are maladaptive coping responses tp stress in childhood that stay in adulthood. PDs are considered developmental trauma responses to compensate in childhood. It's very rare to not have any abuse from childhood and develop BPD. Neglect and overpraising/ objectifying children are also abuse. A lot of people with BPD have a very narcissistic or NPD primary caregiver in early childhood.  NPDs can also be pro-social, pillars of communities types.",,rpakkb

5,"I'm not sure what the confusion is?  Prolonged repeated exposure to unsafe environments/ trauma turns into CPTSD. A chronically traumstized/stressed brain as a child causes emotional dysregulation and maladaptive coping mechanism in BPD. I think that's one of the biggest problems with the BPD diagnosis. People are diagnosed without awareness of CPTSD and taking a hard look at their childhoods. 

I've met a lot of people misdiagnosed with BPD who just had CPTSD and were emotionally dysregulated during stressful times or abusive relationships. If you have a stable identity and are able to have attachments to others, and don't perceive intimacy and attachment as a threat, if you don't self harm or harm others when you feel threatened emotionally it is often CPTSD misdiagnosed as BPD.",,rpakkb

It is even starting to be considered a trauma spectrum disorder, and it is being argued that trauma should be part of the criteria as it is considered under the umbrella of C-PTSD. In a decade I hope it is not even labeled as BPD, because it is so often diagnosed incorrectly.  It would also take people like you without trauma off the diagnosis, which would be accurate, as it is considered a development trauma disorder throughout the world.

0,"I will always consider myself borderline. My recent relationship experience reminded me I need to.

I entered therapy about 15 years ago and was dx BPD about 8 years ago. After the diagnosis I added DBT skills to my mental health toolbox and started a routine of proper sleep, exercise, diet, etc. about four years ago I started feeling really good - perhaps even cured one might say. I began having relationships that came and went organically without toxic passion or disastrous finale. I was showing few symptoms, hadn‚Äôt split or become dysregulated in quite a while. My spending was under control and I went through an extremely stressful custody battle and the death of my step-son and was able to keep my whits about me and deal with my emotions through it all. 

Then, about a year and a half ago I met a woman who challenged every notion I had about relationships. Through the course of that relationship I became extremely codependent. I stopped all of my self-care routines and allowed my boundaries to be crossed and my values to be ignored. I racked-up loads of new debt without thinking twice. I was using sex as a means to cope with all of my emotions and was starting to feel dead inside. Eventually this all came to a head and I began splitting on her on a regular basis. I thought I could get back to good so I began trying to set boundaries again but my codependency allowed them to be trampled on. It was abundantly clear that she had no interest in saving our relationship and in April it all came to a head and I tried ending the relationship. After about a week we started trying to be friends again but through it all, it was too late. I had let my self go for so long all the usual patterns re-emerged. The rage. The manipulation. The begging. I was way behind with work and not able to be present for my self or my kid. It wasn‚Äôt as extreme as it was before I sought therapy but I still hurt this person none-the-less and I‚Äôm still having trouble letting go. She is yet another person I have to mourn who is still alive. Nothing is salvageable.

So long-story-short, for me, I know I need to continue all the self-care routines and tools I‚Äôve learned as-if I‚Äôm borderline even if I‚Äôm feeling good. To boot, I‚Äôve added work in attachment theory and codependency to my things to do list. It was scary to me just how easy it was for this all to come back. For me, I will forever need to consider myself a borderline much like they say in AA, ‚Äúonce an alcoholic always an alcoholic‚Äù. The good news is I know so so many alcoholics who, when their time on this planet was over, hadn‚Äôt drank in decades and were happier than they‚Äôd ever been having led full lives after accepting their life-long condition. I think I can do the same.

I certainly didn‚Äôt ask to be this way and I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on my worst enemy but it is part of who I am and I must accept it and work with it and on it every day or live miserably trying to fight reality leaving hurricanes in my wake.

I've always been worried something would happen to my pets while I was out, so when I get convinced of impending doom I have learned it's the S. I. P.

Stuff you're convinced will happen at any moment, with no facks backing any of it up, that's what I redirect now.   

Fun fact to know and share, when I notice odd things around my home, I will fact-check them against my common paranoid intrusive thoughts so that doesn't get a chance to fester and grow.  A few years ago I noticed a number of cigarette butts on the fairway in front of our home, I didn't want to let them turn into ""OMG they are watching me!!"" later on, so I asked my bf and it turns out they are from neighbour who has a smoke on the way to the community mailboxes.

 I am decent at detecting deception and hidden motives, also at noticing boundary issues in others.  This is from my upbringing, everyone lied to everyone else because the truth was ugly, and I was the youngest and they all chose to 'save' me from the ugliness.  I guess it was their version of trying to to stop the cycle, like giving a beater hoopty vehicle snowflake rims instead of factory black with hubcaps.

The only thing I have to say about being undiagnosed is that some of the symptoms can be from other issues.

I‚Äôm not a doctor and I‚Äôm not your doctor but that is something to keep in mind. üíñ

That being said, you know yourself better than anyone else does. Trust your gut. Look into free resources and see what is out there.

(There are free PDF versions of the DBT book and if you go to my profile and look at I believe my last post someone commented the link to the free version for the DBT workbook). I don‚Äôt know if you journal or not but writing it all down someplace so you can show your therapist what you are dealing with can be an incredibly helpful tool and can also help you spot patterns and start making some sense of what you may be feeling and the like. I also do like journaling prompts for mental health that I find on Pinterest. There are a lot of resources if you feel like the medical field won‚Äôt be helpful to you. 

Ultimately, you are going to be the one who puts all the work to make the changes that you want to see; a therapist is there to help guide you but they are not the end all be all.

1,"I second the idea of talking to a therapist. Try to find one with some experience with BPD or at least DBT. Discuss how to set clear and specific boundaries - having CLEAR rules that she can repeat back to you is very important, as is understanding what the consequences will be if she crosses a boundary.

A residential program might not be a bad idea, but do NOT just spring it on her. It will feel like a sudden betrayal, and that can be hard to erase even if/when therapy gets her to a healthier place.

I very strongly recommend looking up the SET-UP method of communication. S is support, E is empathy, and T is truth. And the truth might be that if certain behavior continues, then you will have to send her to a residential program. Right now, it also may just be that you're worried about her well-being.

BUT the S and the E are EXTREMELY important. It can be hard for us to hear the Truth without getting angry if we don't feel supported. Chapter 5 of I Hate You Don't Leave Me covers SET-UP, and one of the examples it gives feels like it could be a pretty good model for this situation (as well as examples of how to reinforce that S and E). But I imagine there are plenty of online resources as well.

This sounds like an extremely difficult situation, and I'm so sorry for both of you. She's likely going through hell, and especially at 16 probably doesn't really know what's going on or how to handle it. I certainly didn't.

BPD is treatable, and it sounds like you've already started in the right direction - DBT is one of if not the leading recommended therapy for BPD. I recommend learning some of the emotion regulation and distress tolerance skills yourself as well. She may not take kindly to you saying ""let's use a skill"" (I hate when my partner says that), but if you're able to help cue her to do part of a skill (""why don't I do some jumping jacks with you"") that might help get through the harder moments. You may have to force the issue, maybe give two options and she has to pick one. My partner has half-forced me into a cold shower before, and as much as I did not want to do it it absolutely helped.

It is a long and difficult journey, but having someone who is willing to support you in those moments is huge. It's also great that you're starting early - neural pathways are a bit less set than at a later age like 30 (when I started treatment).

9,"if there are questions you have about her experience and her pain then the best person to ask is her. she knows her experience better than anyone. she can tell you how her pain is manifesting and what helps when she is experiencing pains intensity. it sounds like right now she‚Äôs managing her pain with self harm and substance use. that makes sense to me. rather than approaching it from an abstinence perspective, i might do some harm reduction. if she‚Äôs cutting, ask her if she‚Äôs using clean tools, how she knows she‚Äôs gone too far and needs medical assistance, etc. and then, if it was me, i‚Äôd ask her if she wants some extra support because no one deserves to experience this kind of pain alone. i think with our children it‚Äôs easy to get into a response that involves restriction, control and punishment. but in my experience, those kinds of responses are rarely, if ever, helpful.",,10gkwgl

non traditional supports like art and creative projects have been a helpful outlet for me as well.

0,"i relate to you a lot in this. i work late shifts and its hard for me to do anything before my shift starts. however, what helps me most-although im still learning and its still difficult for me to actually get up and do things- is setting timers to get things done. 

set a timer for 2 minutes; pick up all the trash you see. after the timer is done, high five yourself/ pat yourself on the back. it seems silly but celebrate the small victories!! if the timer is up and youre not done picking up the trash, celebrate still, and then set another 2 minute timer. id recommend if youre doing anything at all, get the trash and dirty dishes out of the way. 

you can set timers for doing anything around the house, set them for an amount of time that doesnt seem jarring to you. i do this while i fold my laundry, tidy my room, and even do homework. and you can stop anytime, but believe that you are capable of taking care of yourself and your belongings, even one small step at a time. 

instead of thinking of evvvvvvverything that you should get done, it makes it easier saying to yourself, ‚Äúi can pick up for just 2 minutes and then i can stop.‚Äù it is good to push yourself a bit if you think its gotten too far. starting the process is the hardest. once that first alarm is done, you can realize its actually a lot easier to clean than your brain might be making it out to be. 

when i clean my room, i get overwhelmed by how many things i need to do, so i separate it into categories to make it easier for myself:
-pick up trash
-pick up dishes (could separate into type of dish; cups, bowls, plates)
-pick up dirty clothes (could separate into different colors/ types of clothes)

& try to focus on a single part of your room at a time. if im cleaning my bedside table, i literally dont look at anything else but that, in that moment. it helps me to not get overwhelmed. again, for different spaces in your room, set timers for cleaning them. 

every little bit counts. as you make timers for yourself, you‚Äôll realize you can do more than you give yourself credit for. 

as for the walks, you can set timers too:‚Äô) try a 5 minute walk in the morning. or a walk around your block. it doesnt have to be long to start out.

0,"Maybe when your explaining how your BPD affects your behaviour, try explaining it the more specific terms/what those triggers are like ""I was thinking very black and white in the moment"", or ""I acted on impulse instead of thinking rationally"" or ""In this moment I felt X so I acted Y"" - perhaps moving away from saying it is your BPD in general and stating the specific behaviours will give your partners snd yourself a better understanding of what exactly your sorry for, or what exactly happened. You may be doing this already, but just a thought! But good on you for trying to recognise your triggers and correct your behaviour. I think it's quite common when you're recently diagnosed with BPD to attribute your behaviours to your diagnosis because you've only just been given a framework for understanding the motivations and causes behind your actions, and there isn't anything really wrong with that.",No-Radish-902,1bq8jmv

I reminded him that he goes outside on the balcony for a cigarette everytime we get in and I go find a place to sit down and that he kind of follows our other partners around so it's kind of hard just to sit beside him.. I also reminded him that last time we visited I asked him to scooch in and that the time we went over to play games I sat on the floor between his legs because everyone else is always in pain so I gave everyone else a spot on the couch. I tried to show that I am trying to include myself too since apparently I am quiet and don't try to be part of the group but that was me trying.

Probably makes it feel like a three against one battle rather than a conversation on an equal playing field between you and him. I don‚Äôt trust him. He‚Äôs overstepping greatly.

It is fair for him to ask you to make less jokes about him but not cool for him to demand you change the way you talk about yourself. He can say how he feels but he can‚Äôt make you do things. 

Anyway if I were you I‚Äôd tell him straight up that you will walk away if he tries to relay what he says others say/think about you (especially to support his own narrative) and I would also talk to the other partners individually and ask them if they have been talking to him behind your back and saying these things. Ask if they told him to communicate those things to you for him. And establish boundaries around that.

It‚Äôs not bad to talk about your BPD. It influences your behavior. I don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôve been apologizing for but it sounds like you‚Äôre only using BPD as part of an explanation and not as an excuse.",FreshwaterBiFish,1bq8jmv
4,"It seems really positive that despite you being told lots of judgements about yourself you also picked out some positives. Much better to have shades of gray about this!


The non-live in partners seem to be giving you difficulty in expressing yourself. Your live in partner seems to agree with the judgements made about you, although it's unclear because you've said he communicated them, but not if he felt them.¬†


I guess the main difficulty here is identifying what you want? If it's just to be left alone from these judgements, which might be reasonable, you can simply communicate ""I'm not interested in hearing that.""


If it's to persuade your partner to make you more comfortable at this other house - ie by sitting near you, then phrase it as a DEAR MAN.¬†




""Last time when we went to the other partner's house you went outside for a smoke, and when you came back you went to sit with your other partners. You've done this on multiple occasions, and recently you told me these partners are concerned we don't sit together enough.


I feel pretty upset/awkward/vulnerable (I don't know how you actually felt!) because it feels like this has become purely *my* responsibility.


I'd like you to take initiative and come sit by me when you come back from a smoke. (Or smoke beforehand or on the way, and just sit by me by when we're there!).""


Then if he tries to turn it on you, repeat the assertion - ""Next time we're there, I'd like you to stick with me"", and maybe follow it up with a reinforcement - ""It'd make me feel much more comfortable, and I do want to sit by you at these events"".

I was really guilty of this until I met a new coworker who does it incessantly and that reflection back at me gave me serious ick! i do not want to be that person, so it really helped me reflect on and curb that behaviour. 

I find verbalising my feelings, situations and behaviour helps me process and learn but it's not always possible, do you have access to regular therapy? Even a support group that doesn't specify the individuals 'labels' but focuses on healthy behaviours using CBT or DBT for example. 

Talking can really help us, even the recommended treatment where I'm from is 'talking therapy', maybe one or more of your partners would be willing to listen for an hour a week to your thoughts on certain events or situations so you can process without judgement.

I currently am waiting for my first counselling appointment I've had several therapists in my life the last one is the one who diagnosed my BPD, OCD and PTSD but she moved out of my country sadly.

Yeah I think I'm best at essentially verbalism that however I do like to text my disagreements and serious conversations because I have trouble remembering things and it makes it so I can go back and look at what I said and what others said so I can reflect and if I was in the wrong reflect or at least so I can find out how to do better..

Anyways we all ended up hanging out and deciding it would be nice to form a poly relationship but I had my concerns because the one I was in in the past wasn't a good experience which I communicated it was just a way for my partner to overstep my boundaries. I just feel really alone üòÖ I want to vent to partner D but he is best friends with the other girl in our polycule and I'm worried it'll just get back to everyone plus he isn't good with emotions and stuff (we all believe he's on the spectrum but undiagnosed so) I should also note that partner C has been my partner for 4 years now and has ADHD.,PsychoLittleKitten,1bq8jmv

2,"I continued the relationship with my ex after he tried to commit suicide. It was HELL. I developed severe anxiety after that and the trauma lasted for over two years. Total loss of trust in every way, he reacted very badly to therapy etc and was very cruel with everyone including me and his parents.

Honestly I was terrified, every day I was scared of how he would wake up and I avoided so many arguments to not trigger him. He ended up using this to manipulate me, cheated on me and then left me.

The relationship was really dead at the end but we were together for three years after the attempt. Not a lot of happy moments to be fair. I don‚Äôt think I would repeat it again.",diabolikal__,y2drbd
3,"Um‚Ä¶..well first of all, I‚Äôm so sorry for everything. I have bpd, and I don‚Äôt get it. Why would he not trust you after you tried to kill yourself??? As for your relationship, I feel you. This is almost exactly what happened to me. Only here, he left because my frequent attempts was wearing away at him. We ended up as friends and he is seeing someone else. It kills me but I just want him in my life so I don‚Äôt say anything. I also can‚Äôt have a relationship after him because I don‚Äôt want it to go up in smoke like this one. He has completely detached and I have not. I‚Äôm honestly miserable but idk if it can get better. 

Also y‚Äôall have a choice. He can either love and support you through your healing journey (and you will, promise. I used to think I could never get better but I did and it‚Äôs a miracle). Or he can detach and y‚Äôall can be friends. But he should trust you. Your not doing it to manipulate him. You doing it cause I don‚Äôt have a choice. You‚Äôre in pain, and you‚Äôre doing what is most rational to you. It‚Äôs not a matter of trust. It‚Äôs a matter of strength. If he loves you and is capable of being a rock in your storm, y‚Äôall will stay together. I‚Äôd he can‚Äôt, it won‚Äôt work out.

I have been trying my best to stop drinking too, I tell myself in those moments when I want a drink ‚Äúalcohol is not my friend‚Äù. Then I think of times I hurt my actual friends because the alcohol lowered my inhibitions. But be careful not to let your brain lie to you, you are not broken or damaged. You are human, just take accountability, make amends, respect boundaries, continue your process, and give yourself grace to trip up.

Lastly, please use a therapist who is willing to work with you using an evidence based practice. That will give you the structure that we all work best with, building that muscle memory we can tap into when in need. If you have health insurance, you can use the ZocDoc app to find a provider and make an appointment for as early as the next day in most cases.",dustyprose,1azzunu

And alcohol is such a curse. 90% of the time nothing bad happens and it serves as positive reinforcement that I don‚Äôt have a problem. But that 10% is so devastating to those around me (and myself), it‚Äôs not worth it and I hope I can keep that commitment.

0,"Hiya! Hypersexuality is not a trait of BPD, although poor impulse control and reckless behavior is. Sometimes this manifests as hypersexual behavior. However I would say most of us are just 'normal' hah.

That being said, have you looked into r/asexual ? I am asexual and what you described is just about how I feel. If I have a partner I love I can have fun for the sake of intimacy but it's not truly something I get pleasure by.

I think rather than being about BPD or ADHD, it sounds you might be asexual. I don't of course want to label you. Also asexuality is a veeeeery big umbrella! There are asexuals who are repulsed by sexual activities, there are some who love it.

The problem also might be hormonal, although I wouldn't say it's very common. But if you'd like, you can maybe visit a doctor and ask for a blood test for estrogen levels etc. EDIT: I didn't see you commented that hormonally you're normal, I assume then you have already taken a blood test. Oops! 

That being said, as I am asexual I do share a lot of that feeling of sadness. It's sad that I don't get to ever experience what other people do. The passion in my boyfriends eyes, the drive he has. I'd give almost anything to be able to reciprocate it. But alas, I am not really able to.",Melthiela,11ru04o
1,"This is just my experience with something similar. 

I felt like this before DBT treatment, and realized I ‚Äúnumbed out‚Äù as a direct consequence of my history as a survivor of childhood and adult sexual assault. For me, this was more a PTSD symptom rather than BPD related (except I never turned sex down because I don‚Äôt want to be abandoned) I got additional EMDR and ‚Äúprolonged exposure‚Äù therapy for PTSD. That helped a lot. Finally, I found a new partner (my now husband) who I trust to not hurt me, and clued him into my known triggers and how to notice and pull me out of a dissociative state when we‚Äôre trying to be intimate. Sometimes it‚Äôs paced breathing and ice on my forehead and sometimes it‚Äôs a mantra, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre safe. You‚Äôre whole. You‚Äôre home.‚Äù And sometimes it‚Äôs stopping and trying later. Sometimes it‚Äôs all of the above.

And especially not when I don‚Äôt have someone to mirror. For me, calling myself ‚Äúasexual‚Äù kind of normalised and cemented this issue, when it has in fact more to do with my chronic feeling of disconnectedness and emptiness than with my sexuality as such. Most people who identify with the label ‚Äúasexual‚Äù do in fact experience arousal and many even masturbate on a regular basis.

Also, some ace people have no libido. I have a very very low libido and I don't do things to myself. That's also normal :) 

I believe in the current DSM, asexuality is considered a disorder if an individual does not count themselves an asexual. I recommend seeking out a professional if this is the case. If you have not already. But do some soul searching I guess. I don't feel normal either, never have.

There are some medicine for [hypoactive sexual desire disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-sex-drive-in-women/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374561), but I'm not sure at all how effective those would be or if they even are used.

**Disclaimer: Unsolicited Advice Ahead**

Practice telling that to yourself. Practice forgiving yourself through mindful self-compassion in general. This is a powerful way to cope and opens the door to compounding improvement.

The three parts of self-compassion according to Kristen Neff, a noted author and authority on the subject itself:

1. Reframe things and your self-talk bit by bit so that you comfort rather than shame yourself, like a good friend would
2. Tap into your common humanity. Use cognitive empathy to imagine that elsewhere in the world people go through similar things. Note that this is NOT supposed to engender thoughts of feelings of shame in a ""think of starving children in the developing world"" sense.
3. Try to develop a practice of mindful, non-judgemental awareness of your emotions.

More and better detail from Neff's official site: https://self-compassion.org/the-three-elements-of-self-compassion-2/",MentalHealthAlt1,1333y2d
1,"Just a friendly reminder that googling disorders is not a good idea, most people will ""match the criteria"" simply due to some kind of placebo effect. BPD has alternative diagnosis' which can present very similar, for example autism spectrum disorder and ADHD. I am not at all discrediting you or your symptoms but I would encourage you to seek out a psychiatrist if you can afford it. It's good to know exactly _what_  you have, so it can be medicated right :)

And about the post well... I'd argue most of us know how you feel. At least I do. I was abusive when I was young. All you can do is to try and better yourself, but it's a slow process. You're doing all you can though, that makes you a good person still. Just controlled by your own emotions. It's okay. This is just one little phase in your life. 

I am keen on body language but I've never heard it to be to this extent, that you can't focus on what he's saying. This is why I'm thinking maybe there's something else in it as well? It must be very tiring for you...",Melthiela,1333y2d

0,Can you post your ethics approval for this from your institution?,Lifaux,p6toiq
1,"1. What age were you when you were diagnosed with BPD? 23, but from shadow searching I learned that I have always had BPD mannerisms.

2. What advice would you give to someone recently diagnosed with BPD? Do not look up what it is online. Find a GOOD Dialectical Behavioral Therapist or even get ahead of the DBT course manual by Marsha (can‚Äôt remember last name)

3. What symptoms of BPD are your most pronounced? Suicidal and homicidal intrusive thoughts but number one would def be self sabotaging 

4. How does BPD affect your everyday lifestyle?
It has been controlling my lifestyle so it‚Äôs not just effecting me.

5. Do you find it easier or harder to connect with other people who have BPD, compared to non BPD patients? It honestly depends on the day. Everyday I get along with BPD people but sometimes I can‚Äôt work well with others. Currently a struggling ‚Äúchameleon‚Äù as my therapist likes to say

6. What have these treatments affected your BPD? You never listed any treatment styles so you figure it out on your own

7. Do you think that you having an understanding of BPD makes it easier to live with? Lmao yes and no because the god complex is disgusting. I am a sexual assault survivor and I still haven‚Äôt worked on trauma related therapy. If you are in DBT you MUST finish that type of therapy before you start another (psychiatrist at a psych facility told me that.) 

8. How have you researched BPD since your diagnosis? Ihate you- don‚Äôt leave me. Sometimes I act crazy. How to lose your mind and create a new one. And the DBT course manual are all books I have been using and still use

9. How do you think BPD affects your core personality? Affect lmao. It CONTROLS, most of the time, my personality.

10. Is there anything else you would like to discuss about BPD? Find a good therapist who is DBT based and actually ENJOYS working with DBT patients. A lot of therapists will fire BPD patients because they don‚Äôt understand the extreme internal problems that we are faced with. Look for a good psychiatrist too, not just one trying to get money but one who knows how to work and properly handle BPD patients",Messy_brainnerd,p6toiq

Last week I surrendered all my cards to my parents. I have also been unemployed since the beginning of July because my homicidal and suicidal thoughts literally made me have visions and hear voices but therapist believes it‚Äôs because of all the medication changes.

I then practised eft, emdr and followed Dr Peter levin's videos which I recommend can give insight on panic anxiety trauma etc. It's basically somatic experiencing.

The person who wants to be with you will be with you, and you only, absent of you having to cry and beg them not to leave.

If he's not giving you reasons to think he is cheating, not being even secretive with his phone, you're saying he's present for you and the kids... (No, being defensive about it even if you calmed down it's a normal reaction about feeling ""controlled"" over something small) 

In this case I think you need to process the feelings (take your time, try to think about it in a realistic way, journal about it, talk to your partner calmly about it when you're both in a good headspace, tell him why it's important, etc...) and just let go of them. Don't ruin your family that you're happy with just for a small trigger of your brain. Cheating ""back"" won't hurt anyone but you, and your kids in case things go down...)

I still don't trust bees enough to hold them, but I can walk by knowing that every time I'm afraid one will sting me I know it probably won't.

The reality of the world is that cheaters are going to cheat.  You will find out about it someday and you will be sad move on with your life.   Or they are not cheating and you will move on with your life as well but together.

If you are really serious about seeing if he is cheating, save everyone the drama and hire a private investigator.  Otherwise, process the fear to calm it down so you can both work on having a good relationship.

Traumatic emotional dysregulation, especially when severe is not well understood by many, even a lot of therapists don't understand what severe traumatic responses of emotional dysregulation looks like and misdiagnose.

People with true cluster B personality disorders are not able to fully recover because they cannot let go of their false self- it is their chosen defense mechanism for life. There is a lack of core identity for life, and so the external validation seeking and exploiting of others never goes away or they cease to exist.

When self-sabotaging (mostly through ‚Äòtesting‚Äô or picking fights) I recognised it was wrong but couldn‚Äôt help it. Writing/journaling was the ONLY thing that worked for me. I removed myself from the situation, wrote and reflected (usually through tears and a breakdown):

1. Wise mind
2. How is this to do with trauma/self-identity. I can‚Äôt exist in normalcy, only chaotic, because I don‚Äôt know how else to defend myself/survive - self-compassion
3. Write down specific reasons why nothing he does will ever be ‚Äòenough‚Äô, it may give me momentarily satisfaction but not long-term goals and results.
4. Write every single thing I wanted to do to hurt him, and reversed the roles, the impact it would have on him and me - how quick would I be screaming abuse? I made him the bad guy because I had to to justify myself (like an abusive parent) - learn to take accountability for my actions.
5. Write down why I believe that giving him pain is going to soothe my pain, and the long-term impact on him - self-soothe.
6. Forgive myself, don‚Äôt spiral into self-shame, I don‚Äôt need to disappear and die, I hurt so much and never developed the coping skills. Break the cycle of abuse, he deserves better, I am stronger.
7. Be proud of myself, I‚Äôm taking steps, I‚Äôm taking steps, I‚Äôm taking steps. What can I do to build self-identity and feel less vulnerable to abandonment? - VITALS, work with psych
8. Make plans for after - ACCEPTS

I did this NEARLY EVERY SINGLE time, ‚Äòtraining‚Äô a different chain of thoughts in response to emotional triggers until it literally became natural to me - it was like slowly shedding all this hurt and pain and heaviness. To be clear, I still have the thoughts but they don‚Äôt overcome me and impact my actions (it used to be like a tsunami, but now are just small waves that wash by sometimes).

I really hope this helps, good luck on your journey and relationship, its so clear you‚Äôve come incredibly far just by reading your story

2,"Hey! I am queer, and didn't even realise it until COVID hit! I had just turned 23. 

Growing up, everyone always asked me if I was gay, and my answer was always ""I wish!"" - I also created a character, a sexy, cool girl who ""hated men"" but also craved their validation. I wasn't attractive unless men gave me attention. I would have sex with them and feel nothing. 

I have very little memories of my life, probably because I was in such a dissociated freeze state; my brain was working so hard to survive that anything beyond that was too much. 

I understand what you mean about watching people when they got changed, I obviously didn't leer, but I did find myself peeking, and later on in my teens, when my friends and I would get changed in front of each other without abandon, I would find myself in awe of their bodies. I convinced myself it was normal to find women beautiful, because they objectively are! 

Because I wasn't overly attracted to feminine women (bar a few slim exceptions), I would convince myself that I couldn't actually be gay. My friends used to come to me on nights out to kiss me and make their boyfriends jealous. It was always a point of pride for me, but I can't remember how I felt about it. I kept doing it, so probably pretty good lol. 

EDIT: I also remember going out the year before college to a club in a nearby city, and two masculine lesbian friends started ""playfully"" fighting each other over me. I remember being attracted to them (one more than the other), but then feeling so uncomfortable - even when we started kissing. Looking back on it, it was because they were so in control, which made me feel like I had ZERO control or choice. That's icky, whether you're attracted to someone or not. (Also, plot twist, I'm a top that definitely leans more dominant, so being treated like a dainty little girl being fought over by two dominant lesbians did NOTHING for me). That incident set me back another few years, because how could I be gay if I didn't enjoy it?

So it took me until COVID, when I was stuck at home and had no other option but to sit with myself and learn to entertain myself that I started to realise things (shout-out to Masc lesbian Tiktok, you're the real MVP). 

A few years later, I got diagnosed with ADHD and BPD whilst in my first long term queer relationship. They had come out as a lesbian at 13! So we definitely had different pasts, but they never questioned my sexuality, because **I** never questioned it. I hope you're at that place too!

0,"Hi! Sometimes I feel quite confused by my diagnosis too, but I have done quite a bit of research into BPD to gain a better understanding (YouTube, Books, Others experience, Mental health sites etc.) and that really helped me. If you wanted to briefly explain BPD like you have for your other diagnosis's, I'd say ""poor emotion regulation"" maybe. 

My partner specifically says ""this is your BPD talking"" as he is the one I am most comfortable with, so he witnesses my symptoms the most. To figure out if he's right, I have to look at what I've said or done that has made him say that. For example, if I'm saying he hates me and is going to leave, he's right that's my BPD talking. But if I am genuinely upset with something he has said or done, then that's not my BPD, although maybe my BPD makes me react more but my point is still valid. 

For the third one I cannot add any input, as I personally have not been medicated. Also, you are not crazy at all, don't worry",,t0v8u7

Typically, BPD and neurodivergencies are handled with Dialectic Behavioural Therapy, usually referred to as just DBT. 

I‚Äôm recently diagnosed as well and was signed up for a five week DBT intro course through the government healthcare here. 

I would suggest immediately asking and looking into local DBT programs. Having access to a social worker if possible will also help.

6,"If I were in your situation, I would start with investigating neurodivergence, specifically the way autism and ADHD present in women and girls, and see if either of those diagnoses explain any of your symptoms. The best way to do that is to see neurodivergent women describe their own experiences on TikTok. 

Those three conditions occur together alongside each other at suspiciously high rates. But autism and ADHD are much better researched than BPD, and there is much less social stigma attached, so it‚Äôs easier to get the help you‚Äôll need. 

Support for autism or treatment for ADHD won‚Äôt necessarily resolve the symptoms that led to your BPD diagnosis, but it will make it a hell of a lot easier for you to do the hard work to address what‚Äôs going on. (If you have either of these associated conditions).

ADHD in particular is affected by estrogen levels. You mention symptoms worsening with pregnancy ‚Äî maybe something to tell your doc to convince them to evaluate you.

0,"pretty common dynamic I think, just extra intensely amplified with bpd. I chase after instability and what doesn‚Äôt want me because I learned as a kid that I had to earn love and prove my worth.

3,"It's wonderful that you're trying therapy, even with your discomfort! It definitely isn't easy, so it's great that you're giving it a chance in spite of how you're feeling.

I agree with the user who says recovery is a constant process. I had a couple of years of therapy before my symptoms were well-managed, but if I have gaps in treatment it can be harder to maintain that. 

I don't think there were huge marks of progress. It was small things -- maybe there was a trigger in my life I didn't lose my shit over, or fewer bad days, or being able to do things I hadn't done before. I slowly edged into feeling okay. Eventually I had bigger milestones like going back to college and being able to work, but that was a long way into that process. It was a very gradual improvement. 

I think being in group and individual therapy helped me a lot. I don't talk a lot in therapy groups, but it gave me the sense of solidarity, knowing other people were going through what I was. If something in group was a big thing I wanted to dig into more, I could bring it up in an individual session.

I had a lot of luck with affirmations for distress tolerance when I was really upset. Things like ""This hurts now, but I can make it through this"" or ""I'm trying my best"" when I felt bad about my progress, or generally reminding myself that mistakes I made weren't the end of the world. Focusing on those over and over gave me *something* to focus on when my thoughts were racing, and I think they made me a lot kinder to myself, since my go-to was to internalize every bad thing in my life.

I also really like the ""opposite to emotion action"". There are so many times I didn't feel like doing things, especially when I was going through my divorce and things like that. The more I pushed myself to do therapy, to not push people out of my life, and to try things I was afraid of, the less I felt my mental illness was crippling me. I think I also felt more valuable as a person, too, because I became more productive and was able to see what I had to offer as a friend, a worker, a daughter, so on, which made it harder to feel that people would be better off without me or like I was a burden to the people I love.",torgoboi,jx84f2

Definitely agree that some self-care could serve you well. That could be anything from watching your fave movie, to a bubble bath, to taking a long drive, whatever makes you feel even a little relaxed. 

My best advice for DBT is to take from it what works for you, but not get stuck on whatever doesn't. I thought my first round of DBT would absolutely change my life - save me, really - and when it didn't meet that expectation I took it really hard. Don't get me wrong, DBT has so many helpful skills and tools, but it's also a lot of hard (inner) work that you may or may not find precisely applies to your needs. It's taken me quite a bit to learn to let those things rest on the back burner and see if they click at a different time.

1,"I have recently begun to explore the controversy of recovered memories because I was told recently that it is a controversial subject and now I understand why. 

That said, I experienced recovered memories of trauma through therapy, and soon thereafter, outside of therapy. My own queries to my parents validated many of my memories surrounding the trauma. Additionally, trauma researchers like Bessel van der Kolk, cite this phenomenon in their own research. 

My conclusion is that both people who deny it exists and insist it exists are right. There are false memories and real recovered memories but I would be suspect if a therapist suggested things that ""might have happened to you."" 

I don't know if there are any therapies out there designed just to recover memories because memories distort and lose resolution over time and the act of looking for them seems fraught with risk; though traumatic memories seem to be an exception to that according to Trauma researcher Bessel van der Kolk and other researchers.

In my case, there were no witnesses to my trauma but my parents and some internet research validated my memories surrounding the trauma. For instance the layout of the rooms, the kind of alcohol my grandmother drank, some of the plants we had in the back yard, that our neighbor had a mean dog, and other details.

1,"Marsha Linehan the inventor of DBT, who had BPD, wrote, ‚ÄúPeople with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.‚Äù

If you got the BPD (really I hope it's a misdiagnosis) you have a few goals:

* **Raising emotional resiliency.** This is basically learning how to uncouple emotions from reactions. Emotional resiliency only really seems possible if you develop some kind of ...
* **Life worth living.** Stuff you enjoy that is just yours that you can come back to, without splitting -- to stop splitting you need to ...
* **Learn what your boundaries should be.** A lot of emotional reactivity is/was due to our boundaries being exceeded. Developing boundaries is essential for developing a feeling of safety.

Splitting is seeing something as all-good or all-evil. It's a coping strategy used to simplify the world.

There are a few DBT workbooks. Finding a therapist that specializes in DBT is a good idea along with joining a DBT group. I have a daily meditation practice, it helps immensely with emotional resiliency.

Learning how to love myself has helped immensely. There is stuff on re-learning attachment that could probably help. There's a YouTube video I hand out like candy. [Imagine the Ideal Parent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2au4jtL0O4)

I have episodes. I can't ... not have episodes, not yet. In addition to BPD, I have C-PTSD, so if you have episodes, extend yourself the kindness to understand ... you can't undo this kind of personality disorder overnight. The typical time to resolve BPD is **ten years.** Be gentle with yourself.

There is a ton of material out there, a lot of LCSWs (Licensed Clinical Social Workers) have material on YouTube. That's a good help. I would *absolutely stay out* of most BPD spaces and avoid reading any materials for ""partners of those with BPD"", those sorts of things scarred me.",,lty49p

7,"If this is inappropriate, mods, feel free to remove the comment I‚Äôm about to make -

I have a suspicion that the diagnostics and title of BPD are going to undergo a huge overhaul in the next 10, 15 years. We‚Äôre already seeing a shift to EUPD (at least in the UK) but I think it‚Äôll go even further than that.

C-ptsd doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of a known thing over here and some consider it controversial (why? Who the f*ck knows). And there‚Äôs a huge overlap between c-ptsd and BPD. 

I think there are an enormous number of people who fulfil the diagnostics for BPD where the PD part isn‚Äôt so applicable. The rise in the acknowledgment of ‚Äúquiet BPD‚Äù. C-ptsd & ‚Äúquiet‚Äù BPD are almost indistinguishable.

BPD used to be considered incurable. We now know it isn‚Äôt. 

Most Personality Disorders are egosyntonic (someone who sees nothing wrong with their behaviour/it aligns with their worldview). That‚Äôs where the ‚Äúincurable‚Äù concept, I think, originated.

But with this sub and countless others I‚Äôve encountered online, all I see are people who suffer from moderate-severe emotional dysregulation. And I just don‚Äôt think the PD qualifier fits for many of us.

I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot for the last couple of years and I want to know how others feel about it.

0,"The last question: When I realized all my reactions just is my nervous system trying to save my life, not knowing it doesnt need to anymore because we are adult. It still believes I am a vulnerable child in danger, and thus I feel like it. That understanding helps me not get angry at myself, and in difficult situations talk to myself like i would to a child i love and want to teach how to handle this world. Because that child will never grow if you keep emotionally and physically abusing it, then the nervous system will keep creating adverse reactions (because they are actually not adverse; they are logical based on what you experience). But now it is myself that keeps the evil circle going if i keep treating myself like i was treated. So unconditional love is the answer here; but it doesnt mean you shall act on all your emotions, but be their parent. Love is not cute and mushy, it is strong, safe, caring, leading. It teaches you how to handle difficult things, dicipline, strength, within yourself being safe, so you dont have to fear external harm. Because nothing can truly harm you. All the reactions are on the basis of fear and self protection, and keeps you distant from connections and moments. Anger is also a fight response to something life threatening. And the nervous system needs to learn solwly that there is nothing to fear anymore, you are not a helpless child anymore. Life is difficult anyway, but if you have a strong and secure core (which i believe you HAVE, you just have to believe and trust in it), you dont have to fear that. 

Regarding the person you are married to .. I can only speak for what i would do .. but i would focus on getting to know the person for who they really are, becoming friends, creating openness and bonding and really dive into your relationship and what you need and like and love. Because , nobody really wants to be alone. Or at least, humans seek one another, we need one another, and that is not a sign of disease .. if you get to know the person really, and love what you learn, and you build yourselves to be a team and friends and allies, and pushes each other to become the best you can be (as in, how you need to be to feel fulfilled ..) , and be realistic with what you want out of life and each other .. i think that love and passion often seems to be a marker for true love which can fluctuate because of personal issues and blockages and mistrust between each other, and because one stops to get to know each other and be interested, and stop evolving, so the novelty and mystery is gone .. but if you become a team like i was thinking here, you will see constant growth and newness in the other person and yourself and have to get to know each other all the time. There is something about a choice too, about values, what makes you love a person, like if you have values based on the past, like the netvous system has memories of alcoholic parents, it will judge alcoholism as ¬´familiar¬ª and therefore ¬´safe¬ª even though it causes abuse. Because of confusion. So perhaps you wont find a non alcoholic person attractive because they lack that special ¬´feel¬ª of ¬´sameness¬ª or ¬´recognition¬ª. So things like that can cause you to feel a lack in a different person than what you grew up with .. and so what I believe is that when you heal your nervous system, the inner child, you will also change what feels safe and those inner values. Perhaps this person also really need to grow to become their best, in order for you to really love them. Or to trust your feelings. Id try to be serious about goals and development and see if you want the same things, and try seeking within that person and yourself after love. I believe one cant really love another until one loves one self, so before you do the latter you cant know if you two are compatible .. though i believe strongly in choices and teamwork.. well the strongest marker for incompatibility is that if the other person holds you back from healing and growing and becoming real. 

Nothing has the right to hurt you , love the parts of you that are hurt until they are loved conpletely though and then dont have to hurt anymore. Especially those parts that seem unlovablenand creates pain for you, they need the most love, they are most hurt..

Same goes for the other person .. but kind of different as one cant love another person FOR them. That is something that must be created inside one self for the nervous sytem to believe it. 

I suppose it could be useful to put into words one way or another what you feel you lack within yourself and also in your husband, to see what can be targeted and what might be made worse by the other .. what you feel you need, and if that should come from you or him. 

I wish you all the best, and that your life will be saturated with healing and goodness ..",Emergency-Virus4543,n7ixe6
1,"Every emotion that we feel is for a reason. Yes!!! Even with our BPD, our emotions are valid! I want to emphasize that fact. Our. Emotions. Are. Valid.

What goes haywire is our *reaction*.

I want to address the other issue first. I know exactly how you feel about your SO. I also had the same history of abusive relationships. Worst one was my parents. Now, even though I love my boyfriend so much, there are still days where I feel nothing.

I invite you to examine why you seek relationships. For me personally it was because my parents were not good (still pretty damn bad) at giving me any stable foundation during my formative years. This made me seek out relationship after relationship to fill that emotional hole.

I developed maladaptive coping patterns. For me, the next guy was my next hope. And so I lived on that high, that excitement, and then my BPD developed because along with that trauma just didn‚Äôt stop occurring for me for a while.

That‚Äôs the source of my feelings of emptiness - in a way I am an addict that‚Äôs missing my high. The high of that new, exciting person who will definitely take care of me and save me.

But in reality love isn‚Äôt just about the BIG FEELINGS and PASSION and EXPLOSIONS OF EXPRESSION. Our BPD sort of... sets us up to need this because of how our brain reacts to things. One minute we‚Äôre calm, the next we‚Äôre raging... of course then our brain would only be attuned to the big capital letter emotions versus the steadier, more stable and nuanced ones.

All of this being said... I will go back to my original point. All of our feelings are valid. We feel happy for a reason. We feel hurt for a reason. We feel numb for a reason. A lot of us have probably gone through a lot to end up where we are. And what‚Äôs worse is that the BPD tricks us into thinking our reactions and feelings come out of nowhere when in reality they‚Äôre most likely defense mechanisms after we‚Äôve been through trauma. The trick is how we teach our bodies to not react to events in our lives in a different way. We are no longer traumatized. We are on the road to healing. And as a caveat of course - I say this on the premise that this is a recovery sub. If you feel like this doesn‚Äôt apply, then there‚Äôs probably some other stuff you should work out. Recovery‚Äôs different for everyone and I don‚Äôt want to invalidate anybody‚Äôs feelings about their BPD.

For me personally, what has helped a lot has been DBT. DBT teaches you how to really treat yourself as if you were an actual, human being. If you haven‚Äôt done that therapy I urge you to do so. If you have, and you feel like it‚Äôs not effective, I would go back to your therapist and discuss why it may not be as effective as you‚Äôd like.

Our emotions are valid. The BPD makes them explosive because a lot of us have been through a lot of pain and this is just our bodies‚Äô natural reaction now. But DBT teaches us different ways to react and as I‚Äôve gone through it, I‚Äôve noticed a lot of really good positive changes.

There are days where I still feel empty but the stark difference is, I feel okay with it. I‚Äôm okay with how I feel, and that yes, it‚Äôll be different than how most people process their emotions. What happened to me wasn‚Äôt my fault. How my body tried to emotionally defend me had nothing to do with my intentions. I made some mistakes in the past because of my BPD, and I truly do feel bad about them. But truly, there‚Äôs nothing I can do, and that‚Äôs just how things are. And DBT teaches you how to tame the roller coaster of emotions that come with these thoughts.

I hope you‚Äôre able to get more therapy and discover why you‚Äôve been feeling the way you‚Äôve felt. It sounds like you‚Äôve been through lot. And I hope that what I‚Äôve shared here helps.",246689008778877,n7ixe6
2,"I can't tell you if you really love him. At the worst of my bpd I was definitly feeling that way, so empty that I felt like I didn't care about people close to me or I didn't know if I loved them even if I loved spending time with them. I just loved that they loved me. But after therapy the emptiness is like 45% gone and I know I love them. When you're always very happy or very sad and you either think you're the coolest person in the world or the worst, you don't really have time to think about the others.

Also for the second question; idk when but with therapy you can realise that it's both. Sometimes we cause shit with self-sabotage or with our reactions but sometimes people are mean too. You can just learn to control your reactions so you can stop putting yourself in bad situations bc of things you can't control.",,n7ixe6

0,"I'm not sure who is getting diagnosed here, but be careful googling mental health issues. There's a lot of garbage out there. Everyone is narsissistic, it's a scale. Some people are more than others. It's not a 'trait', it's more a normal part of personality.

That being said, we cannot diagnose you. You must seek a mental health professional for this. However, I do warn you that BPD is an incredibly complex disorder. Although anxiety and fear of abandonment is a key part, it's only one of numerous symptoms. For some people it's the center for their disorder, for others it's not so prevalent.

For example I'm not that prone to fear of abandonment. I believe it was the one criteria I didn't fill. Other parts of the diagnostic criteria are for example chronic emptiness, severe paranoia under stress (some, including myself experience micropsychosis), impulsiveness and reckless behavior like hazardous money spending, reckless driving, addictions to substances, unsafe sex etc.

 Of course there's the infamous stormy and unstable relationships and also what's known as black and white thinking aka splitting. One moment you think your spouse is an angel descended from heaven and is perfect, other moment she is a demon coming from hell and ruining your life, happiness and everything you hold dear. 

Typical characteristics are also different for people. Some people don't express their emotions and slowly build them up and explode. Some people (like me) are not capable of keeping emotions to myself and I randomly burst them out, pretty much instantly. This is in addition with of course having no control over yourself when feeling ANY kind of emotion whether it be happy or sad or angry. And also the return to baseline is LONG. Like it takes you a loooong time to cool down.

When I'm happy I buy way more than I can afford, I'm reckless, I don't think about consequences. When I'm sad I collapse into a big ball of sad. When I'm angry I destroy everything around me. No control.

Then there's the identity disturbances, not knowing who I am. Mirroring other people and becoming more and more like them. Losing sight of what it is you are. What do I like? Who am I ? What am I like? What do I want to be? The answers change a lot. I can't hold a job. I struggle studying. I switch relationships instantly. I change my style, my hair or aspects of myself on impulse.

Fear of abandonment and emotion control issues can be an issue for them selves. It doesn't mean you have a disorder. Go to a psychiatrist and find out. If this sounded at all familiar, then id definitely recommend it. But be aware that whenever you Google symptoms, you will be more likely to think you experience them.",Melthiela,11rj2x1
1,"I can only second this. It's very easy to find something on google and relate to it. Some things are also written in a way that they appeal to the reader and aren't explained the way they should. Psychology is very complex and even for professionals it's not easy to diagnose something.

The thing is that a lot of the symptoms are shared by other disorders too and to be able to make a diagnose it's also important that it matches with the right reasons of where that symptom is coming from.

Often the described behaviors are things that don't necessarily indicate a problem or that there is a disorder. They are often traits that happen to be part of how humans are and only when they become problematic or occur at an extreme, they would be consisdered a symptom. That's also why it's often easy to identify with them.
Two persons could have a personality trait that manifests the same for both of them, yet this could be just a normal personality trait for one of them and for the other person it could be a symptom because it's part of a problem.
This is obviously not applicable to every symptom.

It's always a good idea to get things checked out by a professional if you think there could be something wrong with you.",Jonne24,11rj2x1

If you aren't already doing DBT see if you can get into it, whether with your therapist or even start looking by yourself, becuase although it is not near a cure, it really does help alot of people.

There is also CBT, which although not always effective on bpd, can help depending on why you are treatment resistant. It may even help change your thoughts around the therapy itself.

It took years of dedicated therapy and several dedicated therapists to get me to the point where I will be discharged at the end of this year once I complete my emdr.

Ultimately, l think the ideal practice would be to make yourself your own fp (in the sense of looking to yourself for attention and fulfillment, not so much the splitting or general black and white thinking). 

Then again, six months into trying to be my own fp, I'm either still working on it or have made my cat my fp. Genuinely not sure. So take the above with that grain of salt. 

Wishing you lots of luck and positivity. Remember: you got this. How do I know? You've already made it this far.",kdew22,vkuyp1

0,"I have similar issues. Im 27 male. What i have realized during splitting is almost like a blackout experience. Its like someone else has taken over, blindfolded you, and put you in the passenger seat. It really sucks especially when someone says hey remember when you did this shitty thing and you honestly didnt remember but you kinda do, like a dream or nostalgic memory. In my experience and research i think this is the fight or flight response. Our brain takes over as we step out, in this moment our brain is trying to protect us from getting hurt, from feeling how we have felt in the past, and to survive to see another day. It doesnt matter how big or small is the reason you split. Your experience is valid. To stop this I believe you just have to not split in general, be mindful, take seconds, minutes, hours, or even days to react rather than acting on impulse and intense emotion. Hope that provided a bit of insight.",Remarkable-Diet2319,u2zdh3
1,"yeah it's like when other people choose fight or flight I'm just stuck on ""or"". for me, being single was the only real way to deal with this issue and not inflict it on other people. I'm sorry I don't have any real advice <3",throwawaybreaks,u2zdh3
2,"I actually only realised I did this and why it happened after I went through a difficult break up and was looking through a bunch of videos trying to help understand myself better. The reason it happens is because when you split, you dissociate and the person you are directing all that emotion towards is not who you are speaking to, or at least who you want to be saying all of that to in the first place.

Dissociation causes memory loss and so even though from your partners experience, she's having an argument with you - you are not arguing with her at all. It's almost like speaking through a window at whoever has triggered us but nothing they say will reach us because there's a massive disconnect.

Best advice is to either try not to get to that point in the first place, because both you and your partner can't win against that projection of past emotion to seek validation or to attempt to step back and ground yourself to communicate in a healthy way whilst minimising the likelihood you'll be triggered and spiral. Focusing on statements lile ""I think xyz and that makes me feel xyz"" instead of ""I feel xyz"" gives you the ability to be rational still. It's a horrible thing to realise you do but knowing it means you can learn to be better with it. Even telling your partner too that sometimes she does need to walk away to protect herself as otherwise you're both arguing in two completely seperate realties and it will only escalate. Look up about diffusion techniques in relationships and share them with her too so she knows it's not about her, even though it feels personal.

I think it worked for me so well because I'm highly suggestible and visual, so imagining the 'meeting room' with all my different selves fighting and eventually making up was a potent experience. 

I'd recommend doing the sessions on a day off, as I'd get so exhausted and raw emotionally that I'd need to curl up under a weighted blanket for the rest of the day.

‚Äî a sense of profound clarity. 

‚Äî a sense of urgency.

It is a reliable signal that my nervous system believes there is an imminent threat to my mind, body, or spirit. 

It is NOT a reliable signal that such a threat actually exists. 

If I even vaguely suspect I might be splitting, the most important thing is to get to a safe place, alone. Once removed from any possible trigger, I can do things that prompt my autonomous nervous system to bring me back to the present moment. 

My personal rule is never to make permanent, irreversible, or potentially hurtful choices within 3 days of a split.

2,"Also feel free to ignore this if it is not applicable, but it‚Äôs so common and really not talked about. 

We tend to assume we‚Äôre the problem. And often, we are. 

But. 

Folks with BPD often have a history of being narcissistically abused by family members. If there is someone in your past who considered you an extension of themselves, just there to meet their needs/maintain their emotional state, take a careful look at the boundaries you‚Äôve created in your new marriage. 

You may have unconsciously adopted some of those old, unhelpful boundaries now that you have a family relationship to this person. Getting married can also trigger fears of enmeshment for some people, which can lead to confusing and unclear behavior that may trigger your fears of abandonment. 

Or, he may be showing narcissistic traits. Having narcissistic traits isn‚Äôt the same as having NPD, and neither would mean that he is a bad or evil or unworthy person. 

But exposure to narcissistic traits IS a threat to you. It‚Äôs not safe. Crazy-making behavior like invalidation, future faking, and substitution of alternate realities are not compatible with stability and safety. 

If your new husband is saying things like ‚Äòthat didn‚Äôt happen‚Äô or ‚Äòyou‚Äôre overreacting‚Äô or ‚Äòthis wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if you could just let it go.‚Äô, that‚Äôs a sign that enmeshment is happening, your spirit is under threat (causing splitting) and you need to clean up your boundaries.",arithmetok,oabo8e

I had to create the change in my life to make it more worth living- it's a lot of work.

0,"Okay, let‚Äôs take a breath. A deep one. 

Your post looks frantic and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs how you mind feels right now. 

What I‚Äôm going to say will be harsh, but I think you need this. And it‚Äôs all said with love and understanding. /gen

Now, let‚Äôs break it down in bits. 

‚ÄúSomething happened recently where my friend told me I was being mean to her and I get I was being mean. I was very overstimulated and annoyed (I‚Äôm also diagnosed ADHD) at everyone so I think I started taking it out on her.‚Äù

Okay, that‚Äôs good! 

You acknowledged that you were being mean and acknowledged that despite feeling overstimulated, that was still wrong of you to take it out on her. 

Let‚Äôs keep going.

‚ÄúAnd then she went on to tell me that I‚Äôm never there for her and that I need serious help with my friendships because I hurt her and etc because I wouldn‚Äôt apologise to her when she told me that she was hurt. 

I just kept on trying to defend myself and not take accountability for what I did. And I love her a lot she‚Äôs a good friend of mine but I don‚Äôt think she understands what my issue is but I also don‚Äôt think it would make sense to use that as an excuse.‚Äù

Now right there, you say that you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think it would make sense to use that as an excuse‚Äù. 

There is no finding an excuse. You have said and acknowledged that you are not being a good friend to them. (ie. Being mean and won‚Äôt apologize)

She, as your friend, should try to understand your feelings and situation. 

***However***, you haven‚Äôt been doing the same. You are asking her to understand your POV without willing to even budge on doing it yourself, ***NATURALLY***. (Or in other words, you don‚Äôt have to stop splitting to apologize.)

‚ÄúShe also lives in the same area as I do so it‚Äôs kinda hard to avoid her, I just blocked her from social media because I don‚Äôt think I want to be friends with her at this current moment especially when I am annoyed and I don‚Äôt like being around her.‚Äù

Point blank, that was wrong of you to do. Even if you don‚Äôt see it in this way, you‚Äôre essentially saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mad at you so I‚Äôm going to pretend you don‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

What if someone else or specifically, your friend, did that to you? You would feel horrible. You would feel used. Because that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing. You will have them for emotional comfort then block them if you‚Äôre mad. 

That is **not** okay. And that is not what friends do to each other.

‚ÄúMy other friend is also mad at me because of this situation and it really sucks because she wasn‚Äôt involved in the first place but the friend I had a problem with went and told her about it and then I went on a tangent saying that they are sitting around and talking shit about me and they all hate me and don‚Äôt wanna be friends with me.‚Äù

Your other friend is mad for good reason. If you saw your friend was being treated bad by another mutual friend or even a stranger, you‚Äôd be upset. 

You are assuming they hate you. Criticism is not hate. Telling someone to take accountability is not hate. 

How you‚Äôre acting can definitely come off though as you hate **them**, not the other way around.

‚ÄúI just feel so alone and I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù

First, you need to take time to yourself to think. 

Write or type up a letter about how you feel. Allow yourself that.

Second, if you truly love your friends, you need to **unblock them**, **explain everything that you just told us**, and **APOLOGIZE**.

I‚Äôll be honest though OP, with everything you‚Äôre saying, do not expect things to go back to normal.

You aren‚Äôt owed forgiveness and you need to remember that.

I took the time to do this because I hear you, truly. You have an illness, just like all of us. 

You do not deserve to be alone and unloved because of it. 

But you need to do better. Not just for them, but for yourself.

You‚Äôre in my prayers OP. God speed.

Look up attachment styles instead. What most people think of as a ""FP"" is actually an insecure style of attachment relationship. Talk about it with a professional who specialized in personality/attachment disorders if you can. Internet BPD forums can be a great place to talk and vent but be wary.. the 'FP' culture of normalizing (and often even seeking) this style of relationship will make it harder to make any real progress with your recovery, if you end up getting drawn into it.

0,"You're speaking like you are very aware of your behaviors, where they come from, and why they're wrong. That is one of the biggest challenges when trying to unlearn negative learned behaviors and if you are as aware as you sound, you're already there. Now you gotta work, babe.

I don't know you or how your abuse manifests but if you are aware of it, and you know what you should do in its place, here's a harsh reality check that *everyone* with BP needs to hear: **you have no excuse to continue being abusive or engaging in maladaptive habits**.

Don't misunderstand me; setbacks are very real and are a reality of recovery of **any** kind. But I am not talking about setbacks, I am talking about consciously continuing the behavior that drove your loved ones away instead of being, you know, a nice person.

My stance of BPD as a whole and having BPD has changed over the years but the school of thought that I now subscribe to is that while it is overwhelmingly painful, it can be beatable if you put in the effort. When it comes down to it, most personality disorders stem from external sources, not necessarily internal ones. That being said, the true transformation begins when you let yourself change your patterns.

Use Opposite Action (replace the negative behaviors with positive ones).

Practice Distress Tolerance techniques when you're in a state like what you seem to be in now. 

Use Interpersonal Effectiveness skills on people you are able to make amends with (and **only** if they are receptive. **Do not ever** cross that boundary if they cannot. You will only hurt yourself and them if you do).

Weave Mindfulness exercises and activities into your daily routine to become more aware of yourself, and to become kinder to yourself.

Conversely, you could consider your environment to be the place to grow yourself. Ultimately, getting yourself out of the BP grip is a very personal thing and other people cannot do it for you, no matter the love and energy and good intent they send your way. The same could theoretically be said about the environment.

If your environment is constantly triggering you to act upon your urges, I would suggest focusing most on Distress Tolerance and Mindfulness. Basically make the place work for *you*, if that makes sense. Take the attitude towards yourself of ""I'm bigger than my brain, I get to be in charge"".

0,"You are not your BPD. Hear that loud and clear; your personality disorder (keyword personality) and you are completely separate entities. Your BPD is a complex network of trauma responses, high emotions, and the resulting defense mechanisms (eg. biting, in your case) are the result of trauma. Remember that this is not your fault. Remember that there's a glimmer of you in there, even when it feels like your BPD is completely out of control. You're still there, and you are a good person.

You're in therapy, so there's a good chance that you want help, and that you've dedicated significant time to it. I'm not dissing people with Narcissistic PD here, but how many narcissists do you think actually go to therapy?

Also, I see you say ""I thought I'd change."" Were you... making any changes yourself? I mean this as nicely as possible, because it comes from a place of relatability. I had this notion that, to recover, I didn't need to actively ""do"" anything- just go to therapy, and that was that. I'm ""better,"" and everyone's happy, right? Not really. You need to put your individual effort in, too. You need to take what you talk about in therapy and apply it to situations like this, whether that's in the moment or afterward. I'm saying ""need"" because you seem to want to recover, really bad. But it's not something you ""need"" to do- it's being respectful to yourself and your loved ones.

Has your therapist given you any ideas on how to handle yourself when you're triggered? Have you considered getting up and leaving the room (just an example, not saying it'll work for you) to calm down before you cause harm to somebody else? Reminder, it's totally okay if you haven't considered these things!!! We need plenty of reminders about our coping skills before we actually use them. I'm struggling with the same thing- I'm still learning how to regulate myself before I explode. My friends often need to tell me to calm down, and it's only then I even realize I was getting worked up.

Is your therapy DBT? If not, here's a brief summary - It is actually originally designed BY a person with BPD, FOR people with BPD. It gives you great ammo on how to deal with your emotions at different levels of intensity.

I'd get started here:
https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/

It's a free online course of DBT. There are plenty of work books available online that you can also use simultaneously to practise (recommended). The point in DBT is that the skills that it teaches you need to be actually practised over and over again until they become a habit. Like YEARS. It's a long process to replace all those unhealthy coping mechanisms and bad reactions. But it IS possible.

Find which skills work on YOU, which help YOU. Not everything will work on everyone. Find out ways to help yourself and practise them over - and over - and over.",Melthiela,1c0y9io

Beat the shit out of a pillow, clean furiously, even run laps around your house/apartment/whatever living situation you're in. Temperature can also shock me back to baseline- I love grabbing an ice cube and rubbing it on the back of my neck or throat. Even strong flavors can help, like eating a really sour candy or a spoonful of hot sauce.

It sounds a little insane LMAO, but forcing my body to experience overwhelming, and sometimes mildly unpleasant, sensations takes my brain out of the rumination stage, because my brain has that animal instinct to take care of something that makes me physically uncomfortable. ""Oh wow, this is really sour and painful, ouch, let me try to finish this candy before it destroys my mouth.... what was I so upset about ten minutes ago?"" It's not always magic, but for me personally, it's pretty foolproof. Plus, this is something that can be collaborative! Your friends or partner could start carrying around a little packet of sour candy, and if they notice you're getting really upset, you ask for it or they offer it to you.

2,"Remission is a weird term.. Not a fan of how the DSM treats BPD.

Anyways, BPD's symptoms are basically unhealthy coping mechanisms in response to an over active amygdala and an under represented frontal cortex in the decision making process. 

DBT is about training your brain to respond to emotions in a way that helps regulate them as fast as possible - preventing yourself from making decisions before assessing said emotions - and learning new coping mechanisms. 

You are young enough to where your brain is fairly malleable, you can ""remission"" bpd at any age with enough effort (and i will get shit for this, but especially with the help of small doses of tryptamines - which help your brain form new neural pathways by stimulating dendrite growth in every area of the brain, including areas you typically habituated to atrophy), but at your age it will take much less time than for an older person to see the same amount of benefit. 

My advice is, do not expect any miracles. It is a slow grind. You will not always see benefits in the short term, there will be steps backwards in the long run, but it really is about the effort you put in - it is like training your body, you need repitition and consistency for it to stick.

Your emotions will always be relatively strong compared to most people, so it will Feel like you are  not making progress at times when they cause you to act whatever way, but I guarantee you if you actually put work in it will help over time.

Mental health in general becoming an accepted topic of conversation in contemporary society is a recent development. Overcoming the stigma of BPD is unfortunately up to us. We have to do our best to recover, to be with people who see us for us instead of the diagnosis. Eventually that circle of people will expand with more exposure to mental health education.

I wish it was different. It makes me angry that it was up to me to break the cycle of abuse, it was up to me to parent myself, and now it's also now up to me to recover from BPD and deal with its stigma.

A lot of things are inherently so unfair for us. But if you think about it, if we keep going forward, if we keep working towards educating society about BPD and mental health in general, the world in the future will be better so other people with BPD won't have to suffer as much.

1,"You can absolutely have attachments. Avoiding that toxic dynamic is a mix of being aware of what goes on inside you and doing the work to keep yourself from falling into bad habits.

My therapist had me think about my patterns first. Was there something about the other person that triggered such a strong attachment? Maybe something in their personality draws out your trauma response; maybe you met the person in a time when you felt you couldn't survive on your own; maybe you were lonelier than usual and attached harder because of that. Then, what are *your* patterns? What sort of things do you react negatively to, and what things do you do or think that are unhealthy for you and the other person? 

&#x200B;

Once you know that, pay close attention to how you feel in relationships. If you notice yourself feeling too attached, take some time to spend with other people and talk to the person again once the intensity has waned. Set clear boundaries for yourself **early** in relationships. Those should be in place to keep you moving at a healthy pace and to keep yourself from doing whatever is an issue for you. My boundaries started out really strict (like you, I was reluctant to get close with *anyone* because of that fear) but with time I experimented to see what I could manage and used my healthy friendships as a basis for comparison, and I was able to be less rigid.",torgoboi,jkg7m7

6,"Thats one way to put it. I think mostly the first step for ME in mitigating these issues / symptoms was to make it a habit of trying to recognize thoughts as the potential issue.

While not 100% applicable to your question, I was taught the following concept:

Have I come to a conclusion about a thought I am having?

Is the thought based in reality, or is it part of a self conditioned black and white thinking?

Is the conclusion I have reached valid?

Do I need it to be validated?

Do I need to reach a conclusion at all?

&#x200B;

Recognizing our thoughts and giving ourselves time to live in the gray is a good way to provide room for ourselves to exist within relationships. It gives us pause to set boundaries upon our own expectations of others. Understanding that your emotional needs can exist within that same gray area without feeling like you are unanchored is not always as easy as it should be, but it lessens the possibility of setting up situations where a relationship causes you distress.

The TL;DR is. ""Try to find the gray area in relationships.  Do not put all of your emotional needs into one basket. Keep as many of them as you can in your basket. Wow, thats a lot of eggs.... Why do you have so many eggs?""

They are on your side, not against you.

So many people with BPD get misdiagnosed with bipolar because of cyclomania (rapid alterations between manic and depressive states = bipolar 2/undefined type of bipolar) being quite similar to mood swings, especially when patients try to explain mood swings to professionals.",,qh1lrq
1,I was taken off my mood stabilizers. I am being closely monitored.,heartlesschick1995,qh1lrq
2,"Ok. Well in case you have BPD your mood swings could become severe again, it would not hurt for you to look up DBT-skills/workbooks and reading up on BPD. It could help you better understand where your problems lie = in your perspective of yourself/others and understanding of ""what is normal behaviour"" (though who is ""normal"" anyways?).

Mood stabilizers are good to keep emotions in check but worsen your perception of what is ""normal"".
That is also why benzodiazepines are not recommended for treating BPD = they trigger impulsive behaviour after dulling out intense emotions.

I dunno. Sorry for bothering you, but I got anxiety of reading your post. As in I have shared your feelings for ""having to stand up for yourself"". I was misdiagnosed for almost 10 years with bipolar type 2 and finally after getting a really awesome and intelligent psychiatrist I got the diagnosis BPD (I tried splitting on him in the beginning though and that caught his attention).

Its fair to calmly and compassionately plainly spell out your personal boundries that you need to keep yourself at optimal mental health. So discussing that ypu need space sometimes to take care of yourself or that if things reach an unhealthy place, you need to step back. In my experience its much easier to drop painful emotions in someone else's lap, but that doesn't mean ypu have to carry them. A lot of people dont realize that they are having that much of an effect. Try to pick a calm time to discuss how to handle those times.",coyotebored83,jqje4o

I struggle with mental health issues, that give me severe anxiety/depression/negative and sometimes suicidal thought patterns. Was diagnosed BPD at one point. Have gotten a lot better over the years, but still have substantial problems that are really only visible to people who know me very well. My bf supports me, but he also lets me know when he has had enough and I need to find a way to deal with my emotions. Oddly enough, not being quite as dependent on him has forced me to learn to self-soothe. It's a pretty good arrangement. Just see if she lets you establish boundaries on that- let you know you love her, but you're tired. She might freak out at first, but if she's self-aware she'll start learning how to navigate her crises better. Sometimes just knowing someone is on your side is all a person needs.",,jqje4o
3,"The most important thing is that you set clear boundaries with her, and make sure she understands them. If you are feeling low and cannot help her, you need to tell her it is because you are feeling low. It is also helpful if you can help her find some go-to coping mechanisms and other people/emotional resources to go to when you can't help her, so she doesn't feel entirely abandoned when you tell her you can't step in. 

Finding good therapy for BPD is *hard.* Some people thrive in DBT, some in CBT, some in trauma processing talk therapy, some in all three. And even when you find a style you like, the wrong therapist can ruin treatment entirely for you. I've had my diagnosis for five years and only now am I really engaged in a therapy format I like with a therapist I like. And even once you find the ""right"" therapy and therapist, it's still *so* much hard work. All of this takes a *lot* of time, and as her partner you should expect that she'll want you to step in and support her through the tough stuff. 

Truthfully, if you're not willing to do that and be there - and that's okay, but it's important that you know that and are able to articulate that to her - you should leave. But do not leave her in the lurch, do not abandon her out of nowhere. Do what you can to help her set up supports and remind her that she has other people in her life who will get her through this, and be prepared to take some real space so that she can adjust herself before being close with you.

10,"I'd say it's pretty unrealistic. People with mental illness don't get to conveniently plan their lows around when it's convenient for other people.

Being realistic: with *any* mental illness, it takes time for patterns to change. Therapy is a huge help, but think of it this way: if you've been wired to think, act and feel a certain way, and you've built patterns over your entire life to deal with that, you can't just switch that off overnight. With BPD, you're dealing with years or decades of unhealthy behavior that needs gradually improved. 


Therapy starts with small changes. Here or in r/BPD, you can find posts celebrating what to you may seem like very insignificant things, but those are *essential* steps to the bigger process of healing. You cannot realistically expect someone who's breaking down every week to go from 50+ breakdowns a year to 2. I'm willing to bet that if you expressed that to your girlfriend, that pressure would just further trigger her shame and abandonment fear which could make it harder to heal. 

It's okay to set boundaries, but you need to be realistic. That could look like ""I care about you and want to be there for you, but I also need to focus on work and occasionally recharge. When that's the case, I need you to cope without me, either by calling a crisis line, visiting some friends, or finding a healthy distraction."" Then keep that boundary. That may be easier once she's in therapy.",torgoboi,jqje4o
11,"I had weekly meltdowns up until I would say three or four months ago. I found a therapist that I really trusted and my wife and I started couples therapy as well preemptively. In couples therapy we realized she had re traumatized me during the first year of our relationship by doing things that triggered me over and over again because it was what she needed to do for her own growth. She didn‚Äôt realize how badly she was hurting me until now over a year later. She didn‚Äôt understand that when I am reminded of those things I could literally relive everything again and my pain was fresh. Therapy allowed us to talk and come up with plans on how to de escalate me and what she can do to not trigger me. It‚Äôs helped immensely. 

How long have you been together? Is it possible you‚Äôre doing things that are triggering for (probably without you even realizing it or not thinking it‚Äôs a big deal)? What are her meltdowns about? 

My wife is my second ever favorite person. My first one broke my heart and unfortunately my wife did some of the same things he had done so my meltdowns centered around other women mostly. You need to get to the root of the meltdowns before they can get better. 

But yes expecting it only twice a year is unrealistic. My meltdowns are hands downs shitty for my wife but they‚Äôre even worse for me. Imagine literally living through painful moment after painful moment elevated to 100 in emotions with no ability to stop the flood of memories or pain. Believe me it sucks just as much if not worse for us. It‚Äôs a disorder. It‚Äôs like saying is it unrealistic to expect my gf with diabetes to only need insulin twice a year? Or is it unrealistic to expect my gf with cancer to only feel bad, throw up, etc twice a year. It‚Äôs not something we can control unless in therapy for a while because therapy won‚Äôt fix it, it jsut gives us tools to use but it doesn‚Äôt cure us so it‚Äôs not an overnight fix.

You‚Äôre waffling over staying or supporting from afar is something she has more than likely picked up on. BPD is marked by fear of abandonment and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre on the verge of in her eyes so it makes everything ten times worse.",Snopes504,jqje4o

2,"Hi! So I struggle with this same problem; I‚Äôve had a big fear of wanting to get better for a long time that I‚Äôve been battling, but it‚Äôs gotten a lot easier over the years and I had a big ‚Äúa-ha!‚Äù moment the other night when I realized one thing. 

So for me, I finally figured out that what it stems from is that I grew up in an environment where I wasn‚Äôt allowed to feel, wasn‚Äôt allowed to express hurt or anger so instead for the majority of my childhood I just kept it all inside. This compounded when my parents split and I became responsible for my three younger siblings, especially when we were at our dad‚Äôs, because he refused to take care of us and didn‚Äôt really love us the way a parent should. I basically had to take on the emotional role of a parent at the age of 10 after years of repressing my emotions already and that took a massive toll. Over time, all of that pent up anger and frustration and immense hurt built up and eventually it exploded. I started hurting and hurting and hurting and it felt like it would never stop. But at the same time, it felt good, because I was finally feeling all these things I‚Äôd held back over the years and, my GOD, it felt so good to recognize I did have pain and I was hurting and it felt so good to just let it all out. To just let myself be raw and open and real and not hold it back anymore. It was kind of like a volcanic eruption, in that it was caused by immense built up pressure below the surface and it relieved that pressure to let it come out finally, but it also destroyed the town below and the surrounding forests in the process. 

Eventually I got stuck in the catharsis of feeling that pain for so long that hurting was no longer cathartic but instead became comfortable; it became my safe place. I felt at home there and even kept myself there willingly and actively sabotaged myself when I started to leave that place and for a long time I wasn‚Äôt sure why. I always just attributed it to, ‚Äúit‚Äôs BPD and that‚Äôs why I feel this way‚Äù but never linked it to something deeper, so instead it always just felt like trying to fight the inevitable since I always thought it was something I just couldn‚Äôt help. It wasn‚Äôt until I realized that it was because I needed a place to feel my pain‚Äîand feared that I wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to feel hurt or anger anymore once I recovered‚Äîthat I understood this roadblock and what got me stuck there in the first place. And that provided me with a solution. So now I‚Äôm focusing as I go forward on not repressing either side of me, hurt or happy or any of the other vast aspects of my beautiful multiplicity, because I am a person and I am a lot of things and why limit my multi-dimensionality? Who I am is vast and diverse and it is limitless and I just don‚Äôt see any use anymore in confining myself to one facet when I can have the whole thing. And I‚Äôve found that I feel much better when I‚Äôve felt a feeling as much as I need to feel it, because then I can naturally transition to feeling something else. I have to make space to feel all my feelings. And to allow myself to hurt when I need to, but also to know when it‚Äôs time to move on. But that knowledge that even as I continue to get healthier I‚Äôll still be able to feel hurt and sad when I need to was really freeing because now it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of anymore. I just feel so free and very at peace.

Recovery doesn‚Äôt mean feeling happy all the time. It doesn‚Äôt mean always being in a place of peace and understanding. Most of it is uphill. I‚Äôve been in earnest intentional recovery for a few years now and I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm doing half of the time, and there are still lots of moments where I feel lost and scared and confused and afraid and I fall into old patterns before I realize what I‚Äôm doing and pick myself up again. It‚Äôs all part of human multiplicity. It‚Äôs the way things are.

But then there are also these moments when all the work I‚Äôve been putting in and all the things I‚Äôm thinking about all finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô, I come to a new understanding and awareness that I didn‚Äôt have before, and inside I just feel an immense peace and clarity. And it‚Äôs a beautiful feeling. I don‚Äôt feel that all the time, although as much as I still do fear leaving my old identity of suffering behind, I find myself more and more even on a subconscious level actually /wanting/ to feel good. Wanting to do things to feel good. Wanting to feel that peace and clarity and insight again. 

And even when things feel awful, I just make it through by knowing nothing can stay the same forever and instead the only way to make it through the turbulent ocean of BPD emotion is to just ride each wave as it comes. Nothing stays the same forever, and there is beauty in change. And just because I‚Äôm in recovery now doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt still feel hurt or anger or upset at what happened to me. It doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt still have a place to feel my pain. But it means I have room to feel more things now. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm going to living in a world of color and as harsh as it is sometimes, it‚Äôs beautiful getting to feel a whole range of things again. 

And besides, as you get further away from where you used to be and start to feel healthier, you‚Äôll start to remember yourself, too. Identity can be found in lots of things. It can be found in pain, true, but it can also be found in survival. In recovery. In healing. In choosing, no matter how many times you get knocked down, to continue to get up and keep going again. Identity can be found in strength. And hope. And love. And there‚Äôs a part of you buried underneath even all that, too‚Äîthe real you, the core you‚Äîthat I‚Äôd be willing to bet is still there underneath all that pain. The real you is still there underneath all that and has never left you. It may just take forging your way through until you find you again because that real core you is there, even now, waiting for you. You‚Äôll find it. 

So my suggestion honestly is just to keep going. The fact that you‚Äôre tired of being where you are is an important step, because it means you have some motivation and a reason to move forward. Recognizing you don‚Äôt want to be like this anymore is the first step and it‚Äôs a big one because it‚Äôs also the hardest. You won‚Äôt lose your fear of the unknown right away‚Äîyou‚Äôll continue to come head to head with it again and again as you continue forward, but it does get easier and there do come more and more moments in between where you‚Äôll find happiness and strength and peace and where you‚Äôll be so glad you decided to move forward. And those moments are worth fighting for. 

Lastly, the answer won‚Äôt come to you right away, it can take lots of time and soul searching and the realization can come about when you least expect it, but maybe ask yourself why you feel so afraid and what‚Äôs at the root of it (like how I realized for me that I was afraid to recover because I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt have space to feel my pain anymore). Coming to understand why and how you are the way you are can help a lot because it gives you a new, more compassionate understanding of yourself and helps you create a unique solution that will help you to battle that fear. It‚Äôs kind of like going on a quest and picking up hints and clues and different swords and things along the way and it‚Äôs hard a lot of the time, but sometimes you meet someone who gives you important words of wisdom or you discover a tool you didn‚Äôt know you needed and it makes the whole thing a lot easier. Wishing you lots of love and strength to you on your journey, and just keep moving forward. ‚ù§Ô∏è",quentincoldwater9,iqyqeb

0,"I think if you are going to be in therapy for a long time, you would need to have a good therapist-patient relationship. However, it is critical for a therapist to have objectivity, maintain boundaries, and leave their emotions/judgements away from the session. I would suggest looking at why her demeanor is affecting how you feel because a lot of us get triggered by not getting validation as it confirms our presumption that we will be abandoned. Also, some therapists have their own biases when it comes to our diagnosis due to the stigma and she could be projecting a little bit as well.

You‚Äôre right that I need to assess if our relationship is strong, I think she challenges me in a healthy, productive way (this might just be another hurdle that I need to jump) so I think a conversation is the right move. I suppose I should look over my interpersonal communication skills.",thisisme1202,10e21oy
2,"I think it is alright for a therapist to give examples from their life as a way to connect as long as they don‚Äôt use the session in a way to get validation from you. If your current therapist has had a lot of pwBPD then I am almost sure she has had clients feel the same way as you do. You seem very self aware so I think you will not have an issue. I have watched before a video for dr fox (he specializes in dbt and he is a psychologist)the title of the video was ‚Äúwhat everyone with bpd should know‚Äù he dives in deep about treatment and choosing the right therapist. Also , I did wanna mention that a lot of us like to have a favorite person that we can feel safe to confide in as that might be a factor that plays into it. Let her know how some sessions you leave feeling drained and worse than you have started the session, you can also discuss with her that sometimes she can push you past your point of discomfort due to  XYZ (mention examples).

0,"Speculating that someone has BPD is kind of dangerous. Symptoms overlap that could also be CPTSD, manic depression, bipolar disorder, or another type of personality disorder. It‚Äôs best to get a professional diagnosis from a specialist. But it is noble of you to be looking out your wife and that you don‚Äôt demonize her, it shows you really care. Just want to say as food for thought: just because you have a diagnosis doesn‚Äôt mean symptoms go away. Even with a diagnosis, her behaviors will be ongoing and depending on how long she‚Äôs been struggling with her issues, it can take years and years to recover from. It‚Äôs a long, difficult journey to recovery. It sounds like she has self awareness and it‚Äôs a good step that she wants therapy. Everyone has a different personality and BPD is a personality disorder, so the way things manifest can be pretty nuanced and difficult for each person to pinpoint (let alone change). But keep encouraging in her and believing in her, at the end of the day everybody wants to love and be loved. Support plays a huge role in the process of recovery for mental health issues in general.",post_verone,11o4c5u
1,"If she doesn't take accountability, then she will not recover, end of story.

This may not apply to everyone that suffers from BPD (or any mental illness to be honest), but the inability to take accountability comes from a place of shame. Even though your soon to be ex-wife is behaving horribly, I would bet that she does feel ashamed under all of that. But to be absolved of that shame means taking accountability - but instead she is sabotaging herself. Her trauma may make her feel like she is truly worthless and cannot change.

She will either keep fucking up until she is finally disgusted with how she lives her life and takes responsibility, or will spiral like this forever. Please don't feel responsible for this; take care of yourself. You have done the best you could.",smorton1996,11o4c5u

It's not your fault for wanting to believe in her and make things work, but sometimes some people do not want to change or be fixed. Sometimes they aren't able to be self aware, or they are and just don't care. Either way, it's up to her now to fix her issues on her own. You can try to support her and it's great you've been trying, but it sounds detrimental to keep going on if she's just unwilling to see how she's hurting you and your kids. You have children, so try to focus on getting them into a living situation that's more healthy and safe. They shouldn't grow up around adults who are fighting or having tensions, it will damage them if they see that stuff. She's threatened to kill you and has laid hands on you.

5,"BPD prognosis is actually very good, for those who want help, but your wife's behaviors are not due to BPD, or any other mental illness, even if she ends up officially diagnosed. They are due to her own choices. Instead of trying to rationalize or figure out the cause this behavior, it's really probably best to accept this is obviously who she is. I would never recommend staying with a cheater or abuser, no matter if they have a mental condition or not. 

>""She recognizes her traumatic background and that she has responses to those things. She wants therapy. She doesn't take any accountability for her  actions. ""  

In other words, she uses the fact she's had a history of trauma to manipulate you into believing cheating and other actions are due to trauma, not her own choices that she decided to make?! Plus, ""she wants therapy"" but refuses accountability. Yeah, it doesn't work that way, besides, therapy doesn't magically fix a person or make them suddenly have morals.",rescuelady111,11o4c5u

That was kind of what I had gathered. Just anxious about her choices when she gets down there. The fact she didn't argue with me at all about my demands for primary custody makes me wonder about her level of self awareness. But I don't know.

I took responsibility until the spiral started, until she hit me. Then I knew it couldn't be me. Not that I didn't have problems. But not to that level, not anything a normal couple couldn't work out. It's a shame though, she really was such a good person.",Hubers57,11o4c5u
8,"I hear you. Not my choice anymore anyways, she wanted the divorce after I told her my boundaries were no dating other people and, when she's ready, to go to therapy together. She said no to the first by saying when she was a baby she wasn't touched enough and could have died from lack of touch, so now she needs that to survive and doesn't trust me to do it, and no to the second because she had suggested therapy years back and I didn't want it then (a decision I regret immensely. But things seemed so fine)

I will say she has always been a great mother. I don't trust her anymore that that will stay that way though. She agreed to give me primary custody without arguing, so I guess that's the best I can get. I know what her mother did to her. I know now what it feels like to have her suck me into her emptiness and break me without her even realizing it. I'm terrified she will do that to our very young children. I'm hoping they may one day be a reason for her to realize she needs help. But it's all so uncertain.

I want to still be here if she ever can take accountability and want help. But I have to respect her wishes and choices now, I accept I can't control her. But I no longer have any hope that she can get there.

I would've thought our marriage was enough for her to just believe me when I told her something was wrong

But yea, I don't have the option to stick around for her anymore anyways. If I were the woman maybe it would be different. I don't know.

Of blaming everyone else, of love being some sort of emotional transaction where it's gone if conditions xyz aren't being met, of being terrified of being criticized by loved ones cause that means (verbatim from what she's told people) ""not agreeing with all my choices means you don't love me"". She's consciously aware and verbalized she's using sex and alcohol and whatever other hedonistic pleasure she can think of as a method of ""pain reduction"" for an emptiness she feels inside of her. And that she uses her own counseling clients (she's a therapist in a prison) as a way of receiving attention and 'adoration' (her word) which she feels she needs to survive. 

I dunno, yea she's manipulating me and gaslighting me and projecting her insecurities on me. But I honestly believe she thinks she is telling me the truth when she denies doing these things. She's been honest on everything else. She'll minimize and justify the more serious things, but she always told me the truth.

I'm not sure what is or isn't borderline in her behavior. If anything, of course. But I know there has to be something else at play. She had bpd tendencies for years, but she was stable.

It still hurt you though, and it will always escalate to more painful and violent things because that's how it goes sadly.

People making excuses for shitty behavior in partners, then blaming it on possible BPD is why there is such a horrendous amount of stigma. This makes it even harder for people with BPD to get help. I do feel like you've given her way too much credit here. No offense, but many guys in your situation end up on BPD hate groups eventually, some stay in a resentful, angry victim mentality for years, even though most of their exes aren't even officially diagnosed, they blame BPD.

17,"I appreciate that. After she hit me I woke up and started to see I was living in her emotional reality cause I was gaslit into believing it was normal reality. And I did a lot of hard insight into myself and worked on my issues, namely codependency and some emotional compartmentalization. But when she starts these arguments she still can make me feel like she's being so reasonable and that this is all my fault, even if I rationally know that's not true. It's just nice to be confirmed I'm not going crazy here. No need to apologize, she used to be quite close to her older sister who now I talk to a lot about these things. As my wife spiraled and made worse and worse choices and ultimately left, I was startled by her sister's anger and choice of words against her (piece of shit and such things). But I get where that comes from. My anger towards her was overall brief and passing. In the end I realized I really just pitied her. 

I'll give her this much, she was never dishonest. Well consciously dishonest. I've given her my boundaries I'd need if she changes her mind in the future. Until then I'll respect her wishes, even if she keeps trying to backtrack on the consequences (no we are not sharing a living arrangement like she wants dammit, you told me you didn't want me then I'll respect that and you don't get me. But you don't get to have it both ways)

As far as the bpd behaviors go, what really confirmed (as Much as is possible without a diagnosis) in my mind was how she talked about herself. She'd say she felt like a ghost and not a real person. That all she had inside was this emptiness that would never go away and make her miserable.

I'm not hard on myself, really, it's just hard being alone without the only person that made me believe I could be happy. She's 30 if that make any difference. I guess I'm not a doctor but it'd be quite a left hook if this was related to extreme early onset alzheimers. I'm not even sure how I could take that. 

The dv was good, in a way. My friends were telling me that our issues wasn't on me, primarily, that she was clearly going through something and putting that on me. I believed her up to that point though, that I was broken, too broken to even see what I needed to change to fix things. Her attacking me was good cause I realized that I was wrong.

All I got left is the practical stuff. I worked solo for 5 years to put her through masters. She got her career. I was supposed to get 3 years at home with the kids now. I was going to enjoy the first year with them and spend the next 2 getting my own masters. Now I'm stuck applying to jobs I'm under qualified for hoping I can get some entry level shit to at least have a career trajectory. I can't keep working dead end jobs that will never pay me enough and have no growth prospects with 4 small kids that are now in my primary custody. I'm grateful I'll get a good enough chunk of change to jump start a new life and get a down payment on a house once I start working, but I feel so damn stuck on how I'm going to do this if I can't get a decent job. I certainly don't want to take her offer of cohabitating after divorce. I don't know, I'm at my most broken point, I'm exhausted from everything she put me through, I spend 6 days and 5 nights a week alone with 4 small kids still for now, it's just hard doing all that and still trying to job hunt. From a cell phone since I guess the computer is hers and she took that. I just want to fall into someone's embrace and sleep for a week. There's just too much to deal with. I have to pretend to be okay for the kids most the time, and when I see her I have to pretend to be okay so I don't give her ammunition on her ""I don't know if I trust you with the kids"" bullshit that has no basis, I just have no relief past my newly invigorated addiction to tobacco and cheap beer, the latter of which I can't even indulge in as much as I want cause now I'm here alone in this house with kids so I can't get drunk in case shit comes up.

There's maybe catharsis there but less illumination, if that makes sense.

Anyone can be abusive or a shitty person. Or the opposite. Borderline only comes into it as the (potentially) specific framework for her mindset, which is what I want insight into.

With all your codependency and personal work, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of DARVO (deny, attack, reverse victim and offender). Your best bet is to slow the conversation down and remain focused on the main point. Stay grounded in your own reality. 

It‚Äôs nice that you‚Äôre not angry and that you do genuinely care. I have no experience with dating someone like me but I am dating an addict and I think at the end of the day, the approach is pretty similar. You can‚Äôt make them change or go back to who they once seemed to be. You just have to kind of watch in horror and frustration until they realize something needs to change on their end - but you need to step back and prioritize yourself at the end of the day. 

I think what‚Äôs a little scary about being with someone with BPD, especially undiagnosed and untreated, is that you sometimes can‚Äôt really be sure if something being said is manipulation or honesty. Before I figured out what was going on and got into therapy, I sometimes couldn‚Äôt even tell the difference myself. Was I telling this person something because I wanted a certain reaction out of it or did I genuinely mean it? Just be careful going forward, especially with regards to custody and parenting. 

Did she decide to leave and all of that when you set firm boundaries? Because that, to me, definitely is a BPD behavior. As well as the void lol. The void is definitely real.

21,"It's okay, I don't mind this since I reply to posts with what I hope is helpful, so venting is expected. 

It seems this experience has taught you some things  which is good. Right now it's painful, but maybe in a few years after stability and healing you can find a person who is actually right for you and your children, if that's something you'd want. 

Sadly not surprised that once she got her full ride to jumpstart her life this whole thing started. Maybe that's the real reason for her sudden behavioral change? Using people and discarding them is not typical of someone who has BPD unless they have traits of NPD or ASPD though. Also her taking all your things is awful, but typical behavior... I'm sorry this happened to you man. 

Are there any places in your area that help with DV or getting a stable place to stay away from her? Or someone to babysit or childcare? It sounds like you need a break, and being around her isn't good for you or your children. Also it would allow you time to deep dive into job search and go to interviews. 

Perhaps right now drinking or smoking feels good, but be careful to not let it develop into a habit. Especially the drinking. If you can, find other ways to vent your frustrations. Most dudes go to the gym or play videogames, but there's other healthy stuff out there. 

I used to have a dad who, because of his horrible life experiences and the pain he was in, was unable to stop using and drinking. It ultimately took him and we never really got a chance to know each other, yet he was the only adult who never laid a hand on me or did anything creepy. It still hurts me, but I don't blame him for not wanting to stay in this world. I just wish I could've said goodbye to him. 

I hope by telling this story, that at least if you do decide to partake, you don't let it consume you. No child wants to lose their parents too young. 

Also worst case scenario, if you're physically able, trades jobs pay really well and you can complete it within 6 months I think? Depending on what it is. It could be a temporary solution until you can do what you originally intended to do in school. Also hospitality jobs will hire literally anyone.",humanityswitch666,11o4c5u

23,"Thank you. She keeps telling me her emotional reality is objective because it is her experience. Which, I mean, is terrible philosophy just at face value for someone who has a decent knowledge on philosophy. But I couldn't break through that wall, I tried validating all of her emotions and feelings, even the ones that were actively causing her to hurt me, while not confirming any unwarranted blame placed on me, and calmly explaining my own perspective when I felt it wouldn't anger her. It's too bad, I did everything I could think of but ultimately she didn't want help or see the need for it.

The boundaries was... Ugh. A slow shit show that is still ongoing. But I don't think it's a coincidence that it was a matter of a couple weeks from when I realized she wasn't well, realized I had codependent behaviors and worked on those, and started setting boundaries that she decided to leave. Amazing how she suddenly had the self control to leave the house when she threatened to jump on me and beat me up and I said I wouldn't hit back but I would call the police. The more dramatic side is the relationship. Lots of phases I've probably forgotten half of them. Open relationship for her > open relationship for both of us > stay married but separate and split up the house and I'll bring people home > get divorced but share the house and you stay home with kids (I'm stay at home father) > you can work but we should save money with shared living arrangements > let's take turns at the same house with the kids (long term, not just in the interim) 

My boundary hasn't changed since the first one. No dating and therapy together to make this work. And when it came to divorce talk I told her that is fine if that's what you want, you can keep the house and what we built, I'm taking the kids primarily, and I'm leaving. You told me you don't want me, your actions tell me you don't want me, so you don't get me. This isn't what I wanted, but now my focus is on building my own life.

It drives her crazy. She keeps telling me we need to talk about it and then she'll just stop replying when I type some variation of the same thing I've already said 5 times. I'm not sure if she's trying to wear me down or she really thinks she's bringing up different things. I love the woman but I'm not sharing a house with her if she's my ex wife",Hubers57,11o4c5u
24,"Thanks.

Its hard to imagine my life with someone else. But I may get there. I'd still like to be here if she ever chooses to get better, but I recognize that's unrealistic and not my burden.

I don't think she was using me. Maybe I'm wrong and I defend her too much and see the past with rose tinted glasses. I don't know. Something shifted and her emotional reality got turbulent and then she stopped being able to distinguish her feelings from normal reality. I'm not sure, and I had those codependent behaviors that tend to accept fault unnecessarily, but she seems like an entirely different person right now.

We don't live together now. I told her to leave when she started dating. Her sister told me to not leave the house so it'd look better if it came to the courts,to make her leave and have me be the caregiver for the kids. After she moved us to divorce, I was surprised she agreed without a single bit of argument that I would get primary custody. Since then I leave 2 nights a week so she can see the kids. She otherwise sleeps at an acquaintances house.

My state has seemingly good daycare assistance programs to help pay for things. I just want a job offer before I delve too deeply into that stuff. I have been networking daycare options but decided to hold off going further until I actually need it. 

I agreed to give her the house and everything (within reason) in it. I can't stand to live in the ruins of the life we built together. She was fine with giving me the other assets, which are probably worth about the equity on the house, not including what's in it. I told her when it's legally final or if she's capable of giving me a promise I can trust ill leave the house. The kids and I can stay with my mother for the time being. Though that's a worse fate than staying in our house alone in many ways.

She keeps trying to make these deals to keep me around in some different form of living arrangement, long term. I've maintained my boundaries that I'm perfectly fine staying here 5 nights a week and leaving the other 2,  but after divorce and I start working my money isn't coming here. If she wants to pay her friend rent and the mortgage that's fine, but otherwise we'll go to my mom's. She can't afford rent on top of a mortgage anyways, much less after she has to start paying me child support and her student loans kick in. Despite my communication of these things, I'm not sure she realizes the impact I've made by day trading the stock market for years to force an extra 15 to 20 grand a year into our budget to get by. There's no way she can maintain any of this alone. But she always told me she didn't feel loved from acts of service so I guess we'll see where she can go with that. 

I appreciate your warnings with alcohol. I've been around that. My younger days I spent traveling and sleeping on the streets with hobos, and I took a few in when I was home for years at a time in those bachelor days. I've seen how debilitating that can be. Like I said, I can't get drunk. Or I have the self control not to so I can deal with baby stuff at night. The frequency I drink is certainly much higher, just not the amount I partake in. I don't know what else to do at night. The kids go to bed and I'm alone. Hopefully work can give me more structure.

I'm alone with the kids so I don't have much capacity to go to the gym. I have a membership but I haven't gone in months now since Im not going to get a babysitter so I can work out. I like video games. It'll probably be a distraction later. Right now even that seems like to much energy, I just don't have the drive at the end of the day. 

The cigarettes are a different matter. I was a social smoker. And I spent my 20s associating stress with smoking. Which was fine, I generally don't get stressed about much. But then I entered a state of near constant stress so I'm fairly sure I'm addicted now. Hoping a job can give me structure to start backing off there too, but I'm not even bothering to try to regulate my chain smoking right now. That's a problem for another time, I can't do this without my tobacco right now. Or I really don't want to at least.

Trade jobs are a route. I have a few different routes I can go. I wanted to get into finance stuff before, I'm hoping that will still work out somehow. I don't want to give up on my career plans if I can help it. But if that route seems helpless in the end without going back to school I'll find the quickest way to make as much money as I can even if it's not something I enjoy. I can't do this on 45k a year with 4 kids, well I could but, this part is somewhat selfish, I don't want to stay at my mother's for longer than I need to. The kids are my primary motivation, but I won't lie that I want to be doing well also just to be comfortable, and thrive without her. Best revenge is a life well lived or however that goes. Not that I want revenge. Just want to build my own life alone better than I built with her, if that's possible.

I appreciate your insight. Writing and reading about these things gives me insight, and also prevents me from compartmentalizing all these feelings in an effort to avoid them. Thank you.",Hubers57,11o4c5u

She told me she would consider coming back if I took 100% accountability from the beginning of our marriage  for our relationship dying. Her lack of trust in me or her remaining friends gently encouraging her to seek help just worries me. How can you get help and healing at that level of self absorption. I'm glad it is such a treatable thing, but my only other interaction is with never treated bpd, her mother. I'm terrified that that is my wife's fate.

 Borderlines are typically more vulnerable to abuse than they are abusive themselves.  Borderlines usually feel intense remorse for acting out, and are usually really hard on themselves, and apologize excessively and more often blame themselves for things, even when those things aren't their fault, just to avoid being abandoned.

Those would be the same boundaries I'd want if she does change her mind, plus moving forward very slowly.

0,"Hey! I‚Äôm a fellow woman with BPD and I want to start just by saying how amazing it is that you as her partner want to help and are willing to do what you can, despite whatever emotional turmoil you both are going through. More often than not I see people bashing their partners with BPD more than wanting to support and help. And I think that‚Äôs honestly a really great place to start. 

For me personally when I am having episodes where I feel like people hate me, reassurance is all I want and need. But like you said, when in episodes we can tend to be a bit reactive and- I like how you put it -‚Äúprickly‚Äù. And that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre deep in our head and feelings and it‚Äôs really hard to take us out of that space once we‚Äôre in it. Sometimes it can take an hour, or even a whole day. It‚Äôs hard to tell honestly. All I can really recommend for you to do is just continue what you‚Äôre already doing. 

Or if she‚Äôs a physical touch person, like me, you could maybe talk about whether a hug or cuddle might help her? I know for me when I‚Äôm panicking or becoming overwhelmed with my emotions I‚Äôll say I want to be left alone when really all I want is to be held. Words don‚Äôt comfort me, because to me words aren‚Äôt always true. People lie, people say what you want to hear, not what you need to hear. But the presence and safety I feel when my partner hugs me is UNMATCHED. Even if I resist at first, once he holds me, even during some of my most ridiculous baby tantrums, I‚Äôm usually able to take a breath and calm down. Because you can‚Äôt fake intimacy or physical touch. And it‚Äôs an obvious form of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here with you, you‚Äôre not alone‚Äù. And once I‚Äôm calmed down, then he‚Äôs able to talk to me about what just happened. And I‚Äôm able to more clearly and rationally look at my thoughts and behavior critically.

Thank you so much for your thoughts and advice, it's really helpful. She's very resistant to physical touch when she's in that headspace but your point about it being an intimacy you can't fake has me wondering whether there might be some other form of intimacy that gives her that same sense of comfort and safety.

2,"i have gone through something very similar in almost the same time frame, just at a younger age. this guy was my first love, we dated on and off for 4 years. he died december of last year. we had a horrible relationship that circled around cheating, manipulation, obsessiveness, and every toxic thing you could imagine. a lot of our relationship was spent through arguments, tears, yelling at one another, and through sexual acts. i thought this was the person i was going to end up with forever. we constantly went back to one another even through blocking one another and not speaking for weeks/months at a time. he had told me that he did love me, but that he loved someone more and that was the last time we had been together. we were unable to fight through it and it just was what it was. we both cheated on multiple partners with one another and it was a horrible cycle. but we did have passion and love for one another, it wasn‚Äôt just bad all the time, even though that was the bulk of it. in his last year of life, we were not on good terms. we had ended our communication with one another and our intoxicating friendship in july of 2021 and we continued a petty and hateful cycle with one another through the year. but we had moments here and there that were different. like us being in walmart at the same time, where when walking past him i happened to drop a container i was holding and it spilled all over the ground. he laughed at me and later a mutual friend told me that he said i looked good and that he missed me. i told him happy birthday in september and wished him a happy halloween in october, but it was brief and that was all there was too it. i wrote him a letter in december the first day of our christmas break that i intended on giving to him after we got back from the break. i wanted to know how he was doing and to rekindle our bond. he got hit by a semi truck in an accident coming home from a place that was an hour away, he did not make it and i never got that final chance of speaking to him and ending on a good note with him. i honestly don‚Äôt have any sort of help for this, but just in relating that you‚Äôre not alone in this experience. it definitely feels impossible and it‚Äôs one of those things that is so extremely hard to feel, all of the time. especially since you know the kind of relationship the both of you had and that despite everything, it was still so passionate and special to you. i know my own experience with this situation has been pure hell, but i do wish you the best of luck with this. i am in therapy and on medications and that helps. right now for myself, focusing on healing myself, working on cycles in my relationships that have gone on for far too long and are far too draining, working through my hobbies, helps. find time for yourself and go from there.",Fun_Sea_1109,y2ja7x

More people should distrust themselves. People seem to routinely overlook, ignore or deny their true motivations. I certainly do. It's wise to be skeptical; both rose-colored glasses and jaundiced eyes are the enemy. The problem arises (in my experience) when I let my self-distrust be controlled by my self-loathing, when I allow my self-distrust to become self-obsession, or when my self-distrust become kneejerk cynicism. I am know I am vulnerable to these limiting and destructive thought, and I let them become excuses for inaction and negativity. If you can use your self-distrust, it's good. If you let your self-distrust use you, then it's a problem.

I experience one other problem due to self-distrust: I frequently don't trust my own identity. Having an unstable identity and self-concept are par for the course for people with PDs, and examining them is a road to healing; letting my doubt feed my self-loathing isn't.

6,"I can relate to this. intrusive and suicidal thoughts are not something we choose to have - they often show up as a way to cope with what we are experiencing. For example, if I‚Äôm in extreme distress, thinking about self-harm or suicide can be a short-term way to reduce the pain I‚Äôm feeling. It can be comforting knowing I have a ‚Äúway out‚Äù.

What if instead of trying to push the intrusive/suicidal thoughts away, you accepted them? Accepting them does not mean that you act on the thoughts, it just means that you acknowledge that they are there.

When we try to push away distressing thoughts, they tend to come back in more intense ways. Instead we can approach these thoughts from a place of validation and self-compassion. It‚Äôs okay to have these thoughts, you are a human and this is your brain‚Äôs way of helping you cope. You can even thank your mind for trying to help you cope.

This may look like saying something to yourself like:
- ‚ÄúIt makes sense why I am experiencing these urges given that I am going through this‚Ä¶‚Äù
- Just because I am experiencing these thoughts, doesn‚Äôt mean that I need to act on it and I can do things to help myself e.g., distraction

For example, if someone close to me cancels our plans, anger is the emotion that will often come up for me. What's usually underneath that anger is a belief I hold about myself, such as ""No one really likes me"", ""I'm unloveable"". I formed this belief because of the experiences I had growing up. Once I was able to get to the root of things, it helped me realise that these were things I had internalised - they were not the real me. 

Through therapy and self-reflection, I was able to start challenging these beliefs and process (some of) the past to help me move towards healing. I have found that a lot of the things that would have really triggered me in the past don't as much anymore, and when I do get triggered, I have skills to cope.

Yes it is really hard for the partner. Another thing is that people with BPD sometimes can't stay in a relationship long-term (whether it is bc their partners cant handle them anymore or bc they can't change their mind on l if they like someone or not very fast).


My friend's mom had bpd (and probablt npd) and she'd change partners really fast, causing her to get attached to these men and then never see them again. Also, since she could decide very fast that someone was her FP, she would have questionable choices of partners or also would be so absorbed by her relationship that she would neglect her kids.

My friend was concerned that I would do something like this after I got separated from the father of my kids, partially because I started another serious relationship about a year after the separation. 

And in these moments, it is always important for me to ask myself, am I in the wrong here? I try to be very honest with myself, because sometimes I am unable to change my behavior, but I can almost always recognize my mistakes (which helps me eventually to fix them).

And I realised, first off that I do not have difficulty choosing my partners. Although I am not with the father of my kids anymore (he could not handle my mood swings anymore, other stuff), I could not have chosen a better guy to co-parent. He really is a good father. Also, I do not have trouble having long-term relationships. I was with my ex for 6 years and I have a few friends I have been friends with for 15+ years. Also, my current partner is very understanding. He understands his role as a step-father, is very committed and so am I. While he is not perfect, he is very emotionally mature and motivated to always improve. 

To me, that sounds like I have the recipe to success to be a good mom, but I am so motivated to keep improving.",26Anotherthrowaway26,cvqc5v

0,"Honestly, this is a process that took me a long time and required a lot of therapy, but I never got that feeling of not having an identity to go away. However, I did successfully shift the way I think about identity. I still have moments of intense dpdr sometimes, but I've come to thinking that people don't exist as a static snapshot like I was looking before and I have to consciously decide what kind of person I am and act like it, and then over time those actions really have given me a better sense of control. I think having to acknowledge a lot of trauma and process my emotions around it also made a huge difference, but that took years of therapy. A combination of EMDR and DBT has helped and treatment started doing a lot more for me after I sought out a trauma-informed therapist. I don't think there is a blanket solution for all of us OP, so i apologize if this isn't helpful to you but just know it IS possible to grow around this with time and work and just hang in there. I truly believe you will discover your own way to make progress with this.",psychedeliclibrarian,pdcsnk

I've replaced that with focusing more on my actions, what I want to do or try to do. But another thing that helped me a lot was doing some EMDR therapy to reprocess a memory that had fostered my ""I don't exist"" belief. It hasn't solved everything but it was very helpful for me and I think it's worth looking into if that's something you're interested in!",crestfallenTM,pdcsnk
4,"Thank you so much for your answer, that's actually really helpful!
For how long did you do EMDR? I never heard of it before, only had 1 session of a trauma focused therapy but my therapist's supervisor insisted that I don't need it (although it was a painful session, so I think I might go back to it)",hydraangea,pdcsnk

2,I found myself in relationships with people more sick than me in a very codependent situation. I always try to help them and take on too many of their problems until it all blows up. So I decided to be single for awhile and then that turned into 4 years and now I don‚Äôt want a relationship because I know what peace is. I decided to invest more in the friends and family that love me and that filled my need for emotional connection and companionship. If love comes a long then so be it but honestly at this point they would have to be better than my alone time which I cherish.,Godletmediesoon,y6ltyx

6,"Awesome! It‚Äôs intentionally pretty broad. The story is essentially that while mental health is being discussed more freely and socially, personality disorders are still stigmatized. I want to offer the perspective of people who actually live with BPD to juxtapose it against negative depictions of borderline people in popular literature/culture.

I hope to capture a range of experiences from the newly diagnosed, people dedicated to healing, those working to integrate trauma, family stories, personal accounts, and stories of attachment issues and romantic relationships. Any story would be appreciated",mashedfig,l5p6vq

0,"In my personal experience, I feel like venting and getting the proper feedback and support helps. I have no control over the way I act so when I‚Äôm feeling any type of emotion - it comes out that way and idk how to talk about it at the time ‚Äúlike an adult‚Äù. (I‚Äôm 38 btw) I just spew whatever I‚Äôm feeling not caring who I hurt as long as I get to express my emotions. Then when I come to I feel awful. I act now, think later. So when I‚Äôm able to evaluate how I felt in certain situations, I can talk about it and can admit I feel better. 

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve done anything wrong. How else do you know if you can vent to someone without testing the waters. Now you know your Fp doesn‚Äôt like when you do that so maybe try a different friend you can confide in until you can see your therapist. Or if you must express how you‚Äôre feeling to your Fp, try not to feel sorry for yourself. (Hard to do if you really do have bpd) You can only control yourself and you can‚Äôt control how others feel about you so if Fp doesn‚Äôt want to hear it, you can either respect that or find a new Fp that gets you better.

You‚Äôre putting negativity in their life and not even feeling better after doing so. If it was something you needed in order to feel better, I‚Äôd say find someone that can handle the topics you‚Äôre venting about.
