5,"Drugged and raped, told to get over it","I‚Äôm basically 23F, diagnosed with BPD for over 2 years now. Basically 3 years ago I was on holidays they last night I went out to a night club and then BOOM no memories. Was reported as a missing person in Spain, my mum was manic looking for me and then my first memory is being found a beach getting covered up and guided into a police car. 

I don‚Äôt remember the drive, I remember pulling up outside my resort...waiting at reception, then I remember my mum opening the door and I just come in and collapse on the bed and start crying like I‚Äôve never cried before.

I then try snap myself out off it as my 10 & 11 year old sisters are in the room, I take myself to the bathroom to clean up and I go for a pee. That‚Äôs when I notice I‚Äôm in pain down there, I call my mum threw and just break down feeling like a shell off a person with no idea what happened, did I consent, was a passed out facedown and someone decided to take advantage. I dread coming across myself on a porn site one day.

I spoke to my closets friends day this happened as I was a mess and just trying to make sense off everything. All I had to do was make it to 6am and I would be on a plane out of the country. I put it too the back off my head, just told myself it‚Äôs just another stupid drunken situation I‚Äôve got myself in. 

Now I didn‚Äôt think I was affected my this until recently, I have IBS and the past 3 years put me feeling sick and spewing every time I drink down to this, however this has now been ruled out and I was baffled. 

Then one day in the car I just realised omg I think it‚Äôs my trauma, I‚Äôm too scared to drink cause off what happened. I think off that day more than I‚Äôd like to admit to myself. 

I tried to speak with my partner about this, He told me I just need to get over..
he‚Äôs never good about talking about feelings, I wish he was but okay...my feelings are justified (I tell myself this and that I didn‚Äôt deserve to get raped pretty much most days over and over, cause I don‚Äôt really believe it) 
Okay I‚Äôll try talk to my mum, she can be a selfish person at times but she said that was the worst day off her life and she pictured taking me home in a coffin when I was missing. First time i try she just tell me to get over it (I tell myself maybe she doesn‚Äôt get how much this effects me). So I try to talk to my BF and Mum and second and try to explain how much it‚Äôs effecting me in so many different aspects off my life I‚Äôm told to get over it again.

When I was trying to drinking, whether that be 3 cans or 3 sips I feel I‚Äôll and spew. So I stop drinking at parties and decide if I feel up for it I‚Äôll drink...I‚Äôll still spew and have heart palpitations. So now I‚Äôve decided I don‚Äôt drink alcohol, when me and BF have friends up for drinks I still get nervous butterflies but it‚Äôs okay. I struggle with the fact, that‚Äôs I should have been more careful in a strange country, I know no one and I‚Äôm at the club alone. So many bad decisions I hate myself (I partially blame undiagnosed, Unmedicated me)

Sorry for the rant, people won‚Äôt even read all this just need this off my chest. 
But if you do, first thank you and second answer me this 

Do I need to get over it or am I justified being a little fucked up over what happened to me?",1601689651.0,False,14,5,Bubbly_Material9550,None,j47cr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/j47cr9/drugged_and_raped_told_to_get_over_it/
6,Just venting- rambling run on sentences- CW - mentions of ineffective behaviors and drugs,"I‚Äôm about to be one month without cigarettes after smoking for 10 years, I‚Äôm doing EMDR, and I recently stopped taking my seroquel because it was making me too tired. 

I‚Äôve been extremely emotional and moody since coming off of seroquel and I‚Äôm super sensitive because of EMDR. 

Since quitting cigarettes I feel like I‚Äôm smoking waaaaaay more weed because it gives me something to do. Plus I JUST got my MMJ card so I‚Äôm like binging on it all. 

I‚Äôm relying way too much on my partner to fill my boredom. 

I‚Äôm avoiding packing and I‚Äôm moving in two weeks. It‚Äôs stressing me out because I‚Äôve only moved from my bedroom at my parents to my dorms and then to this apartment. I have so much more stuff now and it‚Äôs overwhelming. 

 I can‚Äôt handle my money for shit and idk I won‚Äôt have any money to do anything fun for the next two months - my whole vacation (I‚Äôm working as close to 40 hours as I can but I‚Äôm a teacher so my summer job does not pay as much and I haven‚Äôt saved money because as mentioned before, I suck at money) - and it‚Äôs really bumming me out. And I‚Äôm just freaking out about being able to actually afford the place that I‚Äôm moving into. 

Plus the amount of therapy I do is really taking a toll on me. I‚Äôve been in DBT groups on and off for the past few years as well as individual dbt therapy. Now I‚Äôm doing EMDR and it‚Äôs draining. Especially the day after. So like 3 a appointments a week. It‚Äôs the worst. It‚Äôs so much harder than I expected. I‚Äôve only processed my first memory like two thirds of the way and i felt so emotional for the following 48 hours and it was supposed to be one of the ‚Äúless intense‚Äù ones. 

I‚Äôm just not having a good time. I‚Äôm really emotional and really bored and codependent. None of it feels good. I‚Äôm having trouble sitting through the discomfort of my life right now. I‚Äôm 25 so I guess it makes sense. It‚Äôs just growing pains. But I feel like everyone else can handle these things with ease and I struggle so much because of this stupid fucking disorder.",1656281295.0,False,2,1,null234567,None,vlfr41,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/vlfr41/just_venting_rambling_run_on_sentences_cw/

8,The Triad of My Transformation,"I am someone diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I am also someone in early recovery from drug addiction - 66 days, to be exact. I am ALSO someone facing an unplanned pregnancy....hence, the Triad. I realize that I'm fitting into a pretty specific demographic here, but I'm putting it out there to the Reddit world in hopes that maybe, just MAYBE, someone else out there is in similar shoes. I currently live in a recovery home full of drama and today is particularly challenging. Relapses and people being thrown out of the program are things that are making my stay here a little less peaceful than I'd like. Before I trashed my life with my drug abuse, I'd have gone to a friend to vent about all of this and more, but my BPD symptoms and the addiction both reached too ugly of places for my friends to handle. By the time I made it to recovery, I landed with myself - and my unborn baby - and basically no one else. I hope opening up here is safe. So far as I can tell, this doesn't breach any community rules.

17,need advice for my bpd daughter,"My daughter (16) has bpd. Recently diagnosed. Has had an ""on and off"" boyfriend for 2 years. She talks suicide when they argue or break up. She cuts herself. She has never attempted suicide. Boyfriend caught her talking to other boys and being sexual with at least one. Obviously, he's upset. He broke up with her today. I only know this because boyfriend called and told me. He told me she sent him a suicide note this evening. He also said she threatened to ""shoot up the school"". (No guns in our home, so I don't know how she'd get access to one). She smokes Marijuana joints and carts (illegal in our state) so she gets them illegally.

She shoplifts. She's failing all her classes. Right now she's barricaded in her room. She says she's fine and to leave her alone.

18,I'm terrified my partner is cheating,"I've been diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this but maybe someone has some insight or tips on how to handle this, my first instinct was always to ""cheat back"" once I've felt threatened.",1696423146.0,False,2,7,SilverGirl-,None,16zm5er,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16zm5er/im_terrified_my_partner_is_cheating/

i‚Äôm a female, 19 
my parents are pretty good people, they definitely love me, and there‚Äôs no way i‚Äôd be where i am today if not for their efforts. i‚Äôve also put them through a lot of shit (repeated drug abuse, nearly failing out of school, getting in lots of terrible situations, genuinely screaming that i want to die, yk.. crazy people shit) and they‚Äôve dealt with and loved me through it all. yet for some reason i don‚Äôt feel an attachment to these people like i should. sure we disagree on some things like most all parent child relationships but fundamentally i should be closer with them. but for some reason i cannot fucking stand the thought of even hugging them most of the time. i also have no idea how to talk to these people. it‚Äôs honestly easier to talk to strangers. i feel awful because i know how much they‚Äôve done for me but for some reason there‚Äôs a buried resentment of some kind towards them. 

i have a terrible track record when it comes to relationships of any kind, in fact i couldn‚Äôt name any one person in my life at this moment that‚Äôs been around for more than a year. but the relationship with my parents is supposed to be one of the longest and most meaningful ones i have, and i desperately want to understand what‚Äôs wrong and how i can improve my relationship with them

21,he doesn't want anymore children..,"Me and someone I've liked for such a long time have been waiting on eachother until we could try and and make things work. Because he has been in the process of getting full custody of his 3 kids over the last 2 years because the mother is truly awful and she just leaves her kids anywere and does drugs. 

He also lives in a different state. The next state over. So things have taken time to come to the point we're we could finally meet face to face. Finally he is here. It's like a dream come true. And he has finally gotten full custody of all his kids. 


But the problem is now, since getting full custody and a house near were his kids grandparents live etc. Is that he does not want anymore kids .. he told me he did. But after taking on full care as a single dad, he just can't deal with it. His mental health is suffering because of it. Quite alot. He has no help or support system and his family his not very supportive. His very stern on never wanting anther one ever again. But I am 32 and I have no kids and I don't have the best fertility... I'm stern on having atleast one child of my own. 


I'm just really upset. It's not just that, but I'd have to move to were he is, which is a very very small town. Theres not much there at all. There are alot of people on drugs in that area, orthough it is by the sea and nice, it has nothing for me there. He doesn't want to move his kids away from their family or school. Which is fair. 


It hurts so bad. We have both been crying every single night since he has been here when we have brought this up in order to try and find a way around this but we can't. And we both end up in tears. I've never met anyone in my intire life that I have loved like this before... Even from the very beginning we would spend 6 hours on the phone every night. Even when he had nothing and was living in his car meant the world to me and idk what it is but the chemistry is to intense to deny for both of us. We make love and it's like nothing I've ever experienced in my life. We both end up crying during. But in a good way. And life always leads us back to eachother even when we have lost contact in the past. 


I hate this. I can't stop crying. I may never find someone like this again in my life. I've never met someone like this so I debut I will again.

28,Anyone else think they have schizophrenia aswell as BPD?,"Schizophrenia runs quite heavily in my family. My dad had it, my grandfather had it extremely badly (ended his life because of it), my uncle also has it, and pretty much everyone on my dad's side and Abit on my mums side too. 

I definitely have had a lot of psychosis especially since I dabbled in mushrooms. Then my psychosis never went away ever again. But every psychiatrist I see in the public system doesn't seem to know much about it and just thinks it's part of my BPD. I hear voices and see animals and people and colors and full blown hallunations we're im not even here anymore. No one listens though and antipsychotics don't help for me. Whenever I experience trumua I just end up in a psychotic break again. Otherwise I'm fine and I learnt to live with it. But it appears that unless I get a experienced psychiatrist in schizophrenia, in which I can't afford, they will keep saying it's my BPD. But I've never had these symptoms before except for when I dabbled in mushrooms 6 years ago and I was never the same again. Which happens when genetic schizophrenia is laying doorment and you use drugs. They said that if I'm aware that I have schizophrenia then I can't have it. And I know that's incorrect for a fact. They told me ""it will go away in a few months"" but it's been 6 years and now they are just saying it's my BPD. Anyone else think this does not sound like my bpd?

31,What should I do to get a wake up call? What was yours?,"I am 30 and my life has gradually deteriorated over the past few years. Now I live in nigh-total isolation, my friends don't think about me and I don't have meaningful relationships. I am always bored and I don't feel any love towards myself or anyone else. I'm reaching the point where I feel it's not worth continuing my life anymore.

I've been trying therapies and therapists, but somehow they don't work. Perhaps I'm expecting too much, I don't know.

I never did drugs, but I read recounts about heroine users. It seems that once they have experienced the sensation of perfect happiness and they come back to everyday life, nothing makes them happy anymore. Well, this is basically how I feel. I have been resentful and undecided in my youth and I always wanted to be more energetic, more cool, more social, to live life to its fullest but I got depressed and resentful ahead of time and missed all my opportunities. I failed to develop the winners' attitude and lost my enthusiasm that I once had. My adolescent years feel like I have been sleeping. It still feels like that.

I have decided several times not to give up and change, but somehow nothing changes. My family perhaps offers me a too comfortable and safe option. I have never lived among my peers, people of the same age. Honestly, I don't really want to face with who I am now. It feels like I can still undo it, but I know I can not at this point. I've grown and I am too old now to make up for my missed late teens. I am unequipped to start my own life.

32,Social anxiety tips?,"Hi, I have struggled with BPD for most of my life. I have also had interlinked difficulties with intense social anxiety/general anxiety. At points it is extremely difficult to leave my house or talk to anyone at all, other than my partner who I live with. 

Recently my social anxiety has become really bad again, partly because of spending way less time outside (pandemic/lockdown etc), and partly cuz of other factors. 

I can't take the bus anymore without having sudden intense panic attacks. I also have to talk to people on the phone for my work, and have had difficulties with that. Yesterday I had to reschedule a call because I just couldn't overcome my anxiety enough to get on the phone. 

What are your tips for overcoming this anxiety? It makes me feel really awful about myself and it's making my everyday life very difficult.

I don't like therapy at all because of this social anxiety, I always feel so uncomfortable in front of a therapist. I'm already on medication (cymbalta), and I don't think I can take benzos (I'm a drug addict).

Edit: tried to take a long trip outside today, transferred buses, was in public for a while, etc. All went great! Then an aggressive, leery dude mumbled to me about my genitals and followed me swiftly for many blocks. I was terrified he was going to attack me because that was his vibe, and it's happened to me before where some random guy tried to murder me out of nowhere.

33,Does anyone see BPD/Bipolar as one massive cyclical entity? (Trigger Warning),"Im new to the sub reddit, relatively new to reddit and definitely not a massive one for writing (especially about such personal topics). I just kinda needed to get this out i think and i do wonder if people feel the same, or is it just me. The road of self discovery i suppose (with the help of you lovely people).

Bit of background; Male, just turned 30, have had 'problems since age of 11', addict, mum has Bipolar etc, I'm on valium, codeine & pregabalin each day. Got wrongly diagnosed at 23 w/ Mixed Personality Disorder w/ Narcissistic Tendencies (wtf) , 'corrected' at 25 to BPD, sort of 'corrected' again at 27/28 BPD/Bipolar.

To the fucking point... Over the last few years, id say from 27 to 30, every year seemed to be like one big cyclical event, repeating itself but speeding up and getting harder and harder. Careless, worthless, suicidal, isolated, so much more self destruction. I've always had those thoughts since the age of 13, i think they started. But when you get used to them, they are always there. When you're happy, socialising, walking, trying to sleep, depressed, MANIC. My cycle feels like it speeds up every year, the thoughts can become like an entity that takes over. It plans, puts pieces in place, thinks for you about the ramifications, enabler, instigator. The only thing i can liken it to is when you are not of sound mind through some sort of intoxicant, but more like a disassociated state. It's like i have two me's. And i'm a believer of the ego driven self and the true inner self. But this is like a split of ego as it's still ego driven but when i get into a self destructive cycle it is raging till it ends badly.

So just this year:

* I overdosed on Heroin in a blacked out state after drinking two bottles of shitty wine in half hour (oh yeah my Dad was there for half of it, watched me prep my gear). I would really give a shit about that, entity didn't give a shit
* I made an attempt on my life.
* I ended up in hospital in Portugal with 7 stitches in my head because of some bullshit Hostel
* Recently nearly got hospitalised because i was semi conscious on a park bench 5 minutes away from my house after consuming a lot of different things and then decided i was gonna drink Buckfast for the first time cos i knew a garage sold it in my city. Downed a bottle in 5 minutes, remember buying the second bottle and then just snapshots. Till police and medical found me on the bench, persuaded them to do one basically (but got a lift home lol)

So this is one as well, and its weighing down on me, crushing me. I've been a recovering addict for quite a while and then very recently i started getting back into the tricks of the trade on the internet - then comes out the addict again. So this week addict mode is engaged, fully. Stayed up all night before a ACT group meeting id been waiting a year for, i was actually fine but fucked up thing is i find me to be more like me the day after i've had no sleep, even without any drugs. It's kinda like i lose my inhibitions when i'm over tired. Any way i should get to the fucking point - Addict mode engaged, also just hit Manic stage as well (not good combo). Yesterday i lterally spent 12-14 hours on my laptop looking for drugs, researching about drugs, trying to find out if Noootropics would help me. Was so frustrated because i just wanted something NOW! Late, late hours are bad for me. Around 3am finally decided to try a new marketplace, end up buying half g of Crystal Meth & half g of H, next day delivery. (I've only told one person that). I've never done crystal meth and i the heroin, well i haven't done that since a week after my overdose (for obvious reasons). When i woke up the next day i just had this feeling of dread, a blanket of 'what have i done!?'. And i'm not stupid,i know i don't have to do them, i could throw them away - but i know i wont. They will turn up tomorrow and i will be taken over by this fucking thing that just wants to destroy. It sounds like i have no will power and this is what i mean by the circle it seems with every year that passes my will power decreases and this entity gains it. So this thing that is still me he has my fucking will power, destructive will power. And when the other part of me is down to like 30% left its not a fair fight. I cant blame it on something else becaue it is me, its not separate it just feels that way. They are still my actions and i am accountable for them. I just worry because with every year it gets harder and harder.... And believe me i try to change, i try to engage with anything that is available (when i can). I know baby steps and all that and i was actually doing well for ages and then your head or life just changes the context and you are back there again. It's got to the point where i feel like i just want to let it take over. Im tired. Really fucking tired. Of all the bullshit in the world and the ignorance of people that can't see the bigger picture. I know to change the world you start one person at a time and that begins with your self.... But all of this i understand, but i can't seem keep consistency, or any sort of routine. I can't engage in any of my hobbies anymore, i haven't worked in 6/7 years, a lot of the time i cant leave the house, my phone is a massive trigger and because of that ive lost a lot of loved ones... I've said it a few times recently, i feel like a waste of air. Theres so much more but im just having a self pitiful rant at a screen atm lol...

I just needed to write it down, get it out. I haven't told bits of this stuff to anyone, and the rest is definitely not common knowledge. For some reason id rather it be here, rather than anyone else know  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Summary: I'm trying but every year gets harder, cycles seem to speed up and last for longer, self destruction goes up stupid amounts, and i get magnetised into more fucked up situations... And it get pretty much unbearable. I don't know if to post this... I'm not really looking for responses. I know a lot of it would be you're a fucking idiot for giving in to the drugs, (that aren't even here yet). But i know i will. And i except people may not understand, i dont fucking understand... I know im an addict, but its not for the effect of the drug, its for self destruction... Thats the condition in me, buried so deep, like its weaved into me and impossible to separate

34,Passed the Bar Exam Today,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can‚Äôt do because you‚Äôre borderline.

I‚Äôve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family‚Äôs home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers‚Äô mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn‚Äôt even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as ‚Äúa danger to the public.‚Äù Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn‚Äôt a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it‚Äôs an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don‚Äôt deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can‚Äôt do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

35,Finally sober but now I'm worried about my emotions. Tips?,"(Pwbpd)
I've abused kratom for four years. I was a very high dose user majority of the time (50gpd/+). Im almost at two weeks now. 
Kratom, if you don't know, is an opiate. Im not saying I've been numb this whole time, as I've had outbursts. Kratom made my emotions worse, I think, in a lot of ways. Also made some of it easier, as I was able to block a lot out, too- especially in the later years. 
I'm starting to panic that I'll have issues with my emotions. I'm worried sick at the moment due to random bursts of anxiety that are both related to lack of the drug, but also due to actual stressful shit. 
What were the tools that y'all used to help with anxious thinking? What were your favorites to use whilst being in a predicament that brings you insurmountable stress? 
I've done a shitton of research, reading, learning, chit chatting with others and im so fucking worried right now that I cant recall a single thing. 
We haven't seen my stepdaughter in about two weeks and she's going to be here this week. It's always stressful to be with SO and SD for reasons that are too long to explain, too tiring, and it doesn't matter right now.

37,Is she a bad friend or is this just my BPD and I‚Äôm splitting?,"Is she a bad friend or is this just my BPD and I‚Äôm splitting?

Okay so I‚Äôve had this friend off and on for like 11 years. We have had a lot of falling outs and the last one we had lasted for almost six years. My twin sister who has an array of mental health issues as well as mental deficits stemming from being exposed to drugs as an infant, and also a pretty bad heroin addiction, was letting this friend use her food stamp card in exchange for cash. I explained to her at the time that I really wished she wouldn‚Äôt ask her to use it because I knew that my sister was just going to end up using the money for drugs. My friend told me that I was overreacting and that my sister is a grown woman who can make her own decisions. I dropped it but it always bothered me deep down. Fast forward a few months and my sister tells me that my friend asked her if she could use her social security number to get a phone, in exchange for 50 dollars. And it turns out this friend and her boyfriend used my sisters social security number to buy and sell ten iPhones. Basically she scammed her, and my sister now owed thousands of dollars to different phone companies. Her credit is still suffering because of it. When I approached her about it she again told me that my sister is a grown adult who knew what she was doing. I explained to her she didn‚Äôt know what she was doing because of her mental health and active addiction. I told her that she was a bad person and that I didn‚Äôt want to be friends with someone like that. We didn‚Äôt speak for like I said almost six years.

About a year ago I messaged her on Facebook and she ended up apologizing and we became close friends again very fast. She comes to me with all of her personal problems and I always listen to her without judgment and I always try to make her feel like she has a safe space to vent to me. I have other support systems so I really don‚Äôt call her that often when I‚Äôm triggered and very upset, at least I thought I didn‚Äôt, but this past weekend I got into a really bad fight with my boyfriend and I called her very upset. I explained to her what was going on and she rolled her eyes and I could tell she was pretty annoyed. She said ‚Äúyou need to calm down‚Äù. I could feel myself get super angry and I blurted out ‚Äúdont tell me To calm down it pisses me off! This isn‚Äôt like when you and your boyfriend get into it, there‚Äôs a child involved!‚Äù She hung up on me and the next day texted me: ‚Äúyou always have some slick shit to say about me not having a child, and you know I want one!‚Äù I tried to explain to her the emotions behind why I said that, aplogized for making her feel that way and reminded her that I have bpd. She said I‚Äôm using it as an excuse and that she rolled her eyes at me because I make my life out to be harder than it actually is. And that I only get upset when I don‚Äôt get my way and that I sit around all day not trying to do better. And that she‚Äôs never been a bad friend. I told her there were times when she has been a bad friend and listed some of them for her, ending with what she did to my sister and that was only the tip of the iceberg. She again told me that my sister was a grown woman and that she didn‚Äôt make her give her her social security number. Which makes me think she was never really sorry about it in the first place. 

I was thinking about apologizing today again because I really didn‚Äôt mean any harm in saying I have a child. But another part of me genuinely hates her.

39,Is weed a medicine for my emptiness or a crutch?,"When I realized I had BPD, it came as a relief to be able to give a name to the subtle wrong feeling I've always lived with: emptiness. Not quite depression, not quite anger. An absence of contentment and in it's place uncomfortable uncertainty. Waking up and my first thought of the day being ""did I do something wrong yesterday?"" 

I don't always feel this way. Sometimes, when things are going really well or I receive praise or have sex or good luck I feel all the good feelings. I enjoy these times but I no longer trust the feelings. They are a great natural high, probably the best high, and like all highs they don't last.

But I can bring the good feelings back anytime I want, with weed. Take me at my emptiest: give me some bad news on a day when I am already full of emptiness and I'll be a despondent mess, unable to smile, seeking isolation, crying and wanting to be asleep. I smoke some weed and voila, I'm back baby, all grins, improvised songs, making bids for the attention of my loved ones, giving back rubs, eventually falling into deep untroubled sleep in my bed, relaxed, comfortable as I've ever been.

""Why are you such a pothead"" I've been asked many times over the years and I've never known how to answer. Dunno, I like to get high I guess? ""Can you even go a day without your weed?"" ""Why do you have to be high all the time?"" These assholes questions throw shade, imply a weakness, a lack of self control, a tendency for escapism. I'm not weak, and I have decent self control. But yes, I do like to escape the goddamn emptiness because I want to live rather than cry.

The assholes have a point though. Weed has side effects that make it unsuitable for use all the time. If I use it during the day I become less productive and too inwardly focused, less interested in other people, happy but dumb. 

I have a busy life, a family and a job, volunteer work, home renos to do, appointments to get to, and I can't be dumb during the day when all my responsibilities need tending to. So years ago I settled on the routine of waiting until the evening to indulge. Although I may have felt emptiness during the busy day, I could always look forward to collapsing into comfort for an hour or two before a delicious sleep. 

It's not a perfect system because I still need to endure the emptiness throughout the day. And there are still side effects from the weed, like hazy memory, and difficulty waking up at 5:30am when I like to go to the gym.

And I also wonder if my regular weed use contributes to the emotional disregulation I feel as a person with BPD. Weed has been part of my life for so long, I can't clearly remember what I'm like without it.

So there are more than enough reasons to quit weed, at least for awhile. And I have tried to do this, many many times, and yet I keep coming back to it. 

The last time I took a break from weed was a few years back. The break was about three months long. I was proud of myself for being able to put it down and I even started to wonder why I used to do it every day. I felt a sense of freedom from having to go through the same rituals every day. 

The evenings were hard. I found myself craving some kind of special treat and ended up drinking alcohol more often. I found the best way to cope with evening emptiness was to throw myself into creative projects. As long as my hands were busy I was usually distracted from the emptiness until bedtime. I had to keep moving. I was more productive. I had a harder time sitting still.

Maybe one day some a pharmaceutical company will make a drug that contains the parts of weed that combat emptiness, without the side effects.

I‚Äôve been doing good for so long. I was helped by my counselor and psychiatrist to wean off my meds, discharged from counseling a few years ago, and really thought I had my mental health under control and in check for the first time in a long time. 

All it takes is a short lived series of events and I‚Äôm already fearing another hospitalization. The impulsive spending, the increasing urge to self harm, isolating myself, extreme mood swings for the first time though including fits of rage, and panic attacks are back and have taken on new symptoms there too. Feelings of emptiness, dissociating, and dysphoria. I‚Äôm grasping at anything that will make me feel like it‚Äôs worth it to be alive. My drinking is getting out of control again and I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll spiral into drugs again too. 

My marriage is (more likely than not) ending, and I‚Äôll be left alone again. I feel like a waste and burden to everyone around me, and it really feels like everyone would be better off if I was gone. I‚Äôm really struggling to use my coping/DBT skills but I don‚Äôt feel connected or able to share these feelings in my relationship, with people loosely associated as friends, and I‚Äôm afraid my counselor will want to admit me which right now, I can‚Äôt afford as that would result in homelessness too.",1609860305.0,False,13,3,redwolfshoes,None,kr0gzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kr0gzu/episodestrugglingventing/
42,No where else to turn,"I‚Äôve had to leave FB because of this situation. Mostly venting,  but also open to advice/resources. 

My husband and I are separated right now. We got married too soon, and I let my feelings get the best of me when he love bombed me. 

I‚Äôve had to leave most social media, and he doesn‚Äôt know I have a Reddit account, so this feels safe. I know he has one but I don‚Äôt know his name here so I can‚Äôt find him and can really focus on...I guess me at this point. 

I‚Äôve been doing really well up until recently, and I‚Äôm still using all my coping mechanisms but all the same BPD feelings are rushing back and I feel like it‚Äôs snowballing quickly. The splitting, rapid mood cycling, feelings of emptiness, fear, irrational thoughts and impulsivity. 

I‚Äôm just lost and don‚Äôt know what to do. 

We agreed to use our time apart to find a solution for our marriage, but he drew money from the atm (we share an account) and I can‚Äôt imagine what you need cash for that a card can‚Äôt purchase other than drugs. It seems like he‚Äôs using this time to party and get high rather than actually working on our marriage. 

I have a plan in place, and am physically safe, but man I‚Äôm just....lost. 

Neither of us have insurance and money is tight but I‚Äôm pursuing low cost or without insurance counseling options both for myself and us as a couple.

44,Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please üôè (tweet for reference),"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",1707169567.0,False,6,0,tabasco_kat,None,1ajskqw,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg
45,I‚Äôm so tired.,"Tired of everything. Tired of having to take breaths to keep myself living. I‚Äôm tired of living, forcing myself to get out of bed when I wake up at 12 or 1PM so that the depression doesn‚Äôt turn into a series of tangled and knotted thoughts of anxiety and self-hatred. 

I don‚Äôt know who I am, and that stresses me out. I‚Äôve only 
Lever been what I thought other people wanted. I used to pride myself on being entertaining and a social chameleon at the very least, but I‚Äôm scared that it came from some sort of weird obsessive need for others to validate me. I‚Äôve been on the borderline of a religious psychosis. I know this is a ‚ÄúBPD‚Äù sub, but I‚Äôve got a slew of trauma and a mother with undiagnosed but apparent BPD. Everyone in my extended family hates her, yet the comparisons are always there, and for good reason. I‚Äôm a 19 y/o male, but I‚Äôm still scared of becoming just like her.

I‚Äôve struggled with dependency on alcohol, thc, and pornography starting from 12 years old. I finally decided to quit everything because I‚Äôm just ready to really get better, but it‚Äôs such a hard weird and confusing process. I feel like I cant really be helped. My only hope is moving out from my grandparents place this august, but even then I haven‚Äôt been taking care of anything I‚Äôm supposed to. 

I can‚Äôt hold down a job, I‚Äôm admittedly immature and narcissistic a lot. I have really bad problems with lashing out at others. I lost my best friend last week because she told me she ‚Äúliked me better on drugs‚Äù. It was a joke I‚Äôm sure, but on top of her continuing to pretty much ignore me, I got the message that she hated me now. I cussed her out, said almost every terrible thing I could to her (I can think of more now), and continued to cut off every other person from my small town because I realized as a gay man, I was completely neglecting who I really felt I was fall ‚Äò22 semester of college, before I dropped out because I was never focused on my schoolwork and just completely neglected every responsibility of mine. That‚Äôs also when I ‚Äúdated‚Äù someone for the first time, only for him to cut it off after two months because I made a little gift basket for him when he got sick, and only then for me to find out that he moved on right afterwards.

I‚Äôm so tired of my fucked up early life experiences having absolute control over my shitty fucked up life. My last suicide attempt was in March, because on the second date with a guy, I asked him what he graduated from high school that May. 

No one understands me. I hate everything, everyone and this whole world. I can‚Äôt look anywhere, even at myself without seeing nothing but shit. I know I need to challenge all of this or whatever, but I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to. My therapist of two years apparently doesn‚Äôt know how to help someone with BPD. I got my diagnosis in March, and we haven‚Äôt done much of anything since. She gave me a workbook, so that‚Äôs something, but I feel like there‚Äôs no hope. I don‚Äôt know where to start. I thought that by understanding my mind and condition fully, that I‚Äôd just be able to get over this but I can‚Äôt. And I don‚Äôt know if I ever will. It‚Äôs so easy to just find a permanent solution to what seems like a permanent problem, especially since I hurt everyone when I get the slightest whim of emotion.",1687551119.0,False,5,2,Houseof1000horses,None,14h8fwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14h8fwq/im_so_tired/
46,A lesson in splitting and honoring your needs,"Hey guys so I learned a big lesson this week on BPD and on speaking my own boundaries.

Long story short my parents died about 5 months ago and it sent me into the worst regression of my symptoms I have ever had.

I‚Äôve spent the past five months clinging to my bf like a leech and having crisis after crisis over tiny things like him seeing friends or turning over in bed wrong (he‚Äôs rejecting me in his sleep?!? Spoiler: he wasn‚Äôt. He was sleeping)

Long story short - things have gotten better slowly over the past few months. I‚Äôve gone from being constantly terrified to being mostly regulated. However - he had a few big trips coming up at the end of the summer that were giant triggers for me.

I spent the past month preparing for his trip with my therapist and it was going pretty smoothly! I wasn‚Äôt jealous, I was even able to relax and have fun on my own. Was having lots of bad thoughts come up but was dealing with them well without needing any outside help, and he was staying in more contact than usual knowing that this was a big challenge for me.

While on his trip he brought up that he wanted to do some psychedelics on the last night of his trip and I got triggered SO hard upon even hearing about it. (Parents were terrible addicts who abused me under the influence). 

What ended up happening is I kind of felt guilted to let him do it even though I was extremely uncomfortable with it. I felt really guilty from being so clingy the past few months and from having a major meltdown/splitting episode when he was at a party in early July. I felt like I HAD to agree otherwise I was terrible and controlling. He also mentioned he had abstained multiple times over the past several months because I was in such a state of arousal, he knew it wouldn‚Äôt go over well. This just added to my guilt and shame.

He ended up doing it and guess what happened? I had a meltdown and split the hardest I ever have.

And now that we are through it I realized that it just shouldn‚Äôt have happened. 

Because even though I cried and cried about it and talked to him and my therapist about it, I was still extremely uncomfortable the day of. But we pushed through and it went really fucking badly.

And the thing is: I‚Äôm not against drug use. I know that my normal self had handled it fine in the past, but right now I‚Äôm extra sensitive. But instead of honoring my needs, and just telling him: hey, I‚Äôm not ready for this right now, I can‚Äôt handle it well right now - I instead felt the episode coming on and cried and cried and felt terrified but let him do it anyway. What happened next makes sense: the emotions built up and exploded on him after a few hours.

And I think the lesson here is: I should have just said ‚Äòno‚Äô. 

But instead of noticing my symptoms and how triggered I was - I let the shame of my past actions and the fear of abandonment control me (he won‚Äôt love me if I say no). 

But looking back - I deserve someone who will understand that I‚Äôm not ready. And at the end of they day, I‚Äôm the only person who can know my own boundaries. Tbh - if I had just said straight up: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for this right now, I‚Äôm not stopping you forever, I just need some time‚Äù, I think he would have been really understanding and accommodating.

If he had just waited, and I spent a few weeks talking to my therapist and him about it - he probably would have been able to go back to doing his usual usage without a giant problem. But instead he was impatient, and I was shaming myself for my feelings - and it led to something really bad.

I think we can let the shame of our BPD control us. Thinking: ‚ÄòI should be better than this. I should be able to control this.‚Äô

But what if instead we view it through the lens of self love and acceptance of our BPD? 

‚ÄúThis is really difficult for me, and knowing how I am and how I react to triggers, I‚Äôll probably have an episode if this continues.‚Äù

I think maybe working together with your partner, realizing that you‚Äôre a work in progress, and giving yourself TIME to learn how to cope healthily before exposure is the way to go if you can swing it. It‚Äôs ok to need time to adjust and to take time to heal and prepare for big triggers. Don‚Äôt shame yourself and jump in, because you‚Äôll both end up feeling worse than if you had just waited. Speaking your boundaries will protect your relationship!

If you‚Äôre building a house together, and you really want to put up a roof, you need to build the walls first, instead of just throwing up a roof without proper support. Because then you‚Äôre left with the mess and expense of a broken roof to deal with, instead of just doing it right the first time.",1691170421.0,False,8,1,Astrnougat,None,15i6e7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15i6e7x/a_lesson_in_splitting_and_honoring_your_needs/
47,I need help Understanding this.,"What i've found out about myself has scared tf out of me. I just found out why I act the way I act, and it almost made me slip into insanity.  So let me start by saying this: I now know there is and was nothing wrong with me, but this is still a massive fucking problem.

I used to abuse tf out of hallucinogens like dxm, lsd, ket etc. I thought I could change who I was fundamentally because I was foolish. I didn't like myself at the time, but I had no idea why. This all changed for me when I had the most traumatic acid and mushroom trip that would change everything I knew about myself. Long story short: I have a monster inside me. (I wont get into details, but I know who I am now.)

After this trip, I went straight into denial, pretending this hungry monster with an insatiable appetite wasn't inside of me. I did everything I could to run away from my demon, but with every effort I made to push him down, it only gave him time to grow stronger and smarter. I thought I had control, but I never really did. 

When he was pushed down by my own mental faculties, he started to use those against me to start questioning my own reality because, in a way, I was trying to run away from it. He was gaslighting me...

I started looking for meaning through the most mundane things, but little did I know this meaning I was looking at was pointing at my face laughing. Why was it laughing, I didn't know. My psychotic ass thought it was everyone else persecuting me, but it was me the entire time: in an effort to hide my true nature from myself.

This got really bad because, I thought people at work where trying mock me, belittle me, but they were all putting a genuine effort for me to feel like I fit in, but the monster found ways to sabotage their efforts, gaslighting my reality once more, telling me all my feelings had a deeper meaning behind them. They didn't üòë.

Now, I am coming to terms what my psychosis actually meant. It was just a projection of my own psyche against the world in an effort to tell me: ""take a hard fucking look in the mirror.

I'm still traumatized by all of this. I threw away all of my drugs and paraphanelia. I don't want to enable this monster. I just want to love him, help him see the good in himself because, his/my parents denied him the love and attention he craved, so he acts out in hoping that our parents will see the monster they've created, but they never did. But I do, and I know he's hurting which makes me pity him, but if I ever see him try to use me ever again, best believe I will put my foot down and tell him this is not ok.",1636828837.0,False,10,6,GenuineMeHopefully,None,qt7cdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/qt7cdg/i_need_help_understanding_this/

49,"To the BPD who is addicted to shoplifting, read this","Hey, that used to be me too.

Once I realized I could get away stealing one or two things, I started pushing my limits. Once I stole one of those $70 Instax cameras. Another time I stole a $100 desk. I even started to calculate how much I would steal by collecting the price tags and creating a spreadsheet. I‚Äôm talking thousands of dollars. Every single store I went to, I would steal something. It was second nature at that point. I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about it. My thought was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no question that I can get away with this.‚Äù

For the most part, it was food. Quality food I normally wouldn‚Äôt buy because of the price tag, and things like non-generic vitamins and shampoo, soaps, etc. Essentials like those. But that wouldn‚Äôt stop me from going to the mall, taking a bunch of things into the dressing room of a store that doesn‚Äôt count items, cutting the security tags off of a few and shoving them into another bag, then putting the rest into the rack so one one could really tell. This went on for a couple years.

Shoplifting culture in America, especially among teens and young adults, has been so normalized. I would tell someone their top is cute and they‚Äôd go ‚ÄúThanks! I lifted it :)‚Äù because this was something everyone was so comfortable doing that they could tell someone about and it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. This made it feel like, since this is so normal, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. I‚Äôm not breaking the law. I‚Äôm immune since everyone else does it too. I can‚Äôt tell you why I did this so much. I empathize with you. But I want to let you know that nothing, and I mean nothing, hits harder than when you‚Äôre caught.

I got caught stealing groceries from a Walmart in the middle of a BPD/manic episode. It was bad. I was glad I was only groceries, and only about $48, and not something stupid and frivolous like makeup from Ulta or clothes from the mall. But even though it was less than $50, they have a 100% prosecute policy.

I had finished my usual routine at the self checkout, then as I was pushing my cart and leaving, some plain clothes people approached me and told them to follow them to the back. As I followed them to the ‚ÄúEmployees Only Area‚Äù, I felt my vision going white and my whole body was shaking. I knew I had been caught. They took my cart away to count the items and check the receipt (they had printed their own copy from the machine I just used) and another lady took me to the loss prevention room. Let me tell you, there was no worse feeling than them showing me footage of myself stealing. I thought I was so slick. I thought no one was watching. I thought the cameras couldn‚Äôt see me. I thought I could get away with it. Nope. I was forced to watch myself go to different aisles placing items out of sight, then at the self checkout. It was mortifying. I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. They asked to scan my ID, then told me they called the police and they‚Äôre on their way to file a report. Luckily I wasn‚Äôt brought down to the station, but I still had to sign everything. They also gave me a sheet of paper that said to ‚ÄúWrite out the incident/what you did‚Äù and sign and date at the bottom of the page.

The nightmare didn‚Äôt end. After that, I was hospitalized because my combined BPD/manic episode was spiraling me out. But to make matters worse, I had to go into court. Public defender and everything. Hundreds of dollars of court fees too. And the disappointment on my parents‚Äô faces. I was lucky I got my case deferred. But then I was put on probation for a year. I also had to do an online ‚ÄúSTOPlifting‚Äù course, was banned from Walmart, had to get drug tested once a month, and had community service hours.

Even though I wasn‚Äôt convicted, I was still charged, and still am part of the court system. This meant that whenever I had applied to a job that does a background check on me (even things like Uber and Instacart) and they see I got a Class 1 Misdemeanor shoplifting charge, I don‚Äôt get hired. I‚Äôve had places I really wanted to work at reject me because of this background check. This happened over two years ago and my probation has since ended, BUT this record still gets pulled up when I have a check run on me.

Nothing, and I mean nothing, was worth this. No amount of money saved, gratification won, or feeling of a ‚Äúrush‚Äù, was worth having to relive the feeling of getting caught, watching footage of myself stealing, telling my parents I was arrested and had to go to court, be on probation for a year, and have a semi-permanent record (until I can figure out how to get it expunged).

I‚Äôm telling you this as one BPD person to another, it‚Äôs not too late to stop. I wish someone told me to stop sooner, and not just a righteous cop-loving person, but someone who actually understands me and knows what this feels like. Whenever I see anyone talking about shoplifting, I feel like I have to share what happened to me so that no one else has to go through this either.

I know the appeal shoplifting has as someone with BPD. There‚Äôs a rush, you get something good out of it, you feel invincible, you feel like you‚Äôre always going to get away with it. Until you don‚Äôt, and you end up reliving this nightmare every day for a year. This post is for those who know they have a problem but haven‚Äôt been able to stop yet, and if only one person decides this is the sign to stop, I will be happy for you.

The person I want to be and the person that I was and the person I am all sit inside of my body. They each have different dreams, personalities, fears, insecurities. I am none of them and all of them. I am nothing and everything. I don‚Äôt know who I am. I am lost. And I‚Äôll admit that. The way other people see me, the way they feel about me, the way they treat me and the way they don‚Äôt is something I obsess over. I have an urgency to gain the acceptance and love of others. I have a frequency to prove I can gain it. So I can love myself. I set limits on my own self love contingent on the love I receive from others. This is because I have a deeply routed fear of being abandoned. Being forgotten. Being replaced. Watching energy shift. Watching people grow out of me. Fall out of love with me. Out of friendship with me. I would do anything to reverse this fear. To be self sufficient and self loving. I often attract careless people. I often attract intentionally harmful people. I often attract specifically harmful people. I am sensitive to others. I am hurt easily. I attach easily. I detach easily. It is painful. It is exhausting. It is harmful. I have spent the last two years running from hard truths. My life has changed forever. I am incapable of returning to the way I felt and the way I saw the world before these events. I tried to heal on my own. I made a mess. I trusted everyone I knew. It was a mistake. I shared my deepest painful secret with my closest friends. It was a mistake. I confused friendship for therapy and I thought my transparency with my trauma would grant me some kind of rain check on life. Life kept moving. I did not. I lost myself entirely. I could not look myself in the eyes. My relationships with people I loved very deeply changed. My relationship with simple things like food and sleep changed. I could feel myself going crazy. Misdiagnosed. Drugged. Lost. And losing it. I became dependent on things. People. Drugs. Alcohol. Spending money. I thought if I could just stay manic. I could stay sane. I could be happy. The more I would open up, the heavier I would feel. I started to feel lonely. I became complacent. I started praying that God himself would wipe my existence from this earth. I prayed that I could run very away and become a new person. I still pray for this. I had a very hard year. Mental illness is not a small thing. I am the captain of a very large ship and I do not know the first thing about the sea. I‚Äôve never driven a boat. The water is aggressive. I have several diagnoses and several pending. I have not been transparent with many people about my experiences with mental health. I think it‚Äôs because I care so deeply to be accepted by others and it is defining me. Taking me from my truths. I have had to remove people from my life. I have had to fully detach myself to grasp at what peace would feel like in my head. I am consumed by the idea and the fear that the people I love the deepest will eventually leave me. That they hate me. That they have never loved me. So I fulfill this and prove my fear correct by detaching. By running. When I see that no one has chased me, it is now not peace I feel from knowing I was right all along. It is my fight or flight. It is overwhelming anxiety. It is insecurity that now my deepest darkest painful secrets are now public record. That whatever hate I feared before is amplified. I often attract people with a specific trait. People who know everyone‚Äôs business, tell everyone‚Äôs business to everyone, talk horribly about the people that love them. Make others believe they would never do this to them because they are somehow immune. Lack empathy. Create a chaotic and mutually symbiotic environment that is in no way beneficial to either party. Create abusive cycles in which they with hold their love and support. This invents a competitive Olympic codependent gymnastics where I reinforce their ego and lack of empathy by falling to my knees and discarding whatever healthy pride I have preserved in order to service them. I remember being moments away from killing myself but instead responding to a text about a hookup crisis. My pain was never valid. My family member passed away. I was devastated. The day of the funeral I was having an anxiety attack because I needed to be of service to someone. The clock had started. I was afraid if I didn‚Äôt reach out and prove my service, they would have no reason to comfort me while i grieved. I was afraid I would altogether lose them. I have been so afraid of losing people that I have gripped on to them. Gone out of my way to check on them. Take care of them. Listen to them. I became a service industry. Still unhealed. Exhausted. People I had made permanent places for in my life had been revealing their true colors to me. I found out one of my friends had developed a deep routed hate for me during this transitional and life altering period in my life. Saying terrible things about me to others and plotting their exit. This person ghosted me. Can I blame them? I am suffering from the residuals of deeply routed sexual traumas. The PTSD infiltrates my brain in many forms. I also suffer from borderline personality disorder. Body dysmorphia. Disordered eating. Major depression. Anxiety. Panic Disorder. ADHD. I fight myself daily to accomplish any goals. Sometimes I‚Äôm lucky if I brush my teeth. My exhaustion is defeating. I have dreams. Big dreams. Sometimes I think maybe I should kill myself before I have to live to see them never come true. I compare myself to everyone I see on the internet. I have low self esteem. I have a college degree. I cannot hold a job. I cannot find a job to hold. Everything feels like it was all for nothing. But still I have hope. Despite spending all of my energy on the worry of what others think of me. I have hope. I have friends. I have family. I am not hopeless. Not anymore. But I am lost. And I feel like a victim to my own life. I‚Äôm trying to take control of the way I feel and push myself into the wings I‚Äôm expecting to grow in. I am being to forceful. Too impatient. I am harming myself. Stunting my growth. Haulting my healing. People want explanations from me. I don‚Äôt have one to give. I am in pain. I am suffering from my own mind. I am trapped inside my body. I am trying to find my way out. I am trying to find my peace. Pray for me. Please someone pray for me. Tell me my feelings are valid. Tell me to stop blaming myself for the things I can‚Äôt change. Give me a shortcut to healing. Show me a cheat sheet. Hand me the blueprint. This came with no instructions. I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm trying to keep my momentum. I‚Äôm trying to push myself farther but not harder. The added stress will only make me shut down and turn off. I am in need of kind words and encouragement. I am in desperate need of love.",1604740418.0,False,8,2,sadbutveryhotbutsad,None,jpnslz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/jpnslz/the_victim_in_me/
51,My FP just ended our friendship,"I feel numb and then I feel everything. 

&#x200B;

For context, my FP and I met when we were both in very serious relationships. We had amazing chemistry and were both very aware of it. I wasn't getting sexual validation in mine and I think it was his attention that suddenly made me lock him in to Favorite Person status. I have spent two years chasing his approval and having my feelings drug through the mud in the process. We started messing around early in the friendship and at a particularly rocky part of his own romantic relationship, we slept together. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months, he is no longer in his relationship and is dating again. We've kept it pretty kosher, but his dating someone new who's been getting his attention was sending me into spiral after spiral. I kept brining up situations to my therapist, trying to have some outside perspective to tell if I was being abandoned or if I was making it up. In a lot of cases I was making it up - there was no real evidence - but in the past 2 weeks some significant things happened. Most notably, I found out that he had planned a trip with our mutual friends and I was the only one excluded. Weirdly, he followed up my concern by asking if he thought we could ever be platonic friends...which, I felt like we were currently doing just fine. He switched the subject back to the trip - his first excuse for not inviting me was ""it was last minute"" then ""I thought you'd be busy.""  My therapist helped confirmed to me that, yes, this was him being shitty and I had the right to tell him so. 

&#x200B;

Today, I met him for coffee and we both hashed it out. He truly didn't invite me because of the new girl he's dating and how shameful he feels when I'm around. He knows he cheated with me AND he knows how used I've felt about it (he's apologized about that a lot). And honestly? I get that. It makes SO MUCH sense. I told him he should've told me from the beginning. It would've saved me a lot of hard emotional times wondering what I did wrong that NO ONE invited me. He said he was scared to tell me, but that he just doesn't think he can be my good friend. He's worried he's going to grow resentful of me. His radical honesty put me more at peace than I have been in ages. It gave me a feeling of sanity - here I was thinking that I was having an intense BPD-fueled freakout, but there an actual withdrawal. I didn't make it up!

&#x200B;

We ended things fine - I barely teared up. I understood where he was coming from and my therapy combined with a renewed effort in my current relationship was making a huge difference. 

&#x200B;

I'm certain a HUGE emotional fallout is chillin' right around the corner for me, but right now I feel kinda...free? We're amiable, we still have mutual friends, but now I get to focus on my healthy relationships. I feel like I have a lot of headspace. I've been making this list to ""get to know myself"" and I've been brutally honest about shit I've lied to myself about when I built the personality for this FP, so I feel like this change happened at a lucky time, where I feel a little more at home in my skin than I have for the past 3 years. 

&#x200B;

It's going to be really hard not turning to him with every piece of news about my life - sending him songs - snapping him cute dogs - all that shit. But, I'm just going to try to hold myself the fuck together and start redirecting those things to other people who care about me. Ya know, as soon as I figure out who that is, exactly.",1559845083.0,False,24,3,bythe_slice,None,bxk10j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/bxk10j/my_fp_just_ended_our_friendship/
52,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,10,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/
53,How to find your sense of self with BPD,"As a daughter of someone who has severe BPD, and someone with moderate BPD, i have done a lot of reflection and implemented grand changes in my life that have brought me to this point of self-awareness. I have realized that if you are someone with a personality disorder or any mental illness in fact, it is best to cut out any stimulating substances, coffee included to find your real sense of self. I have been drinking since I was 15, (I am now 22) and I have been deliberately and perpetually drunk for almost every weekend of my life since I was 18. When I turned 19, I was drunk 3-4 days a week while still enrolled in full time university, holding two jobs. I would also regularly smoke cigarettes and weed  drink coffee since 15. I also began dabbling in hard drugs between 20-22 years old, cocaine being my preferred choice. I never realized how much alcohol was a part of my life and something that I depended on, even if I was still very highly functioning. I was so stubborn, I thought I wasn't impressionable at all. The thing is, nobody tells you in your youth you should stop drinking, especially those you surround yourself with. It has become so normalized to ingest toxins for ""fun"" that people don't even develop a proper personality or know who they truly are because they are consistently taking substances that drive them farther away from reality. These substances also rewire our brain and make us think and do things our sober self wouldn't say. But we don't know that because we aren't ever truly sober. Our brain is constantly being attacked by substances, media, LED lights, and information overload. We keep ingesting them and think it is a part of our personality, thinking there is something so severely wrong with us, when really we have accumulated years of stress (high cortisol levels) in our minds, bodies and veins.

One thing I realized is that I am a completely different person without alcohol, because without it I am truly an introvert. Many people know me to be confident, outgoing and a social butterfly, fearless and free of anyone's judgement. Although this is true, I genuinely don't care what anyone thinks, I did realize (after therapy, moving out, being physically active and cutting back on substances) that I am truly introverted rather than extroverted. I would always wonder why I am so drained after a party, a social interaction, or after many meetings or conversations with people I never cared about. Now that I go to parties with people my age, everyone is concerned with drinking and smoking and listening to most conversations as someone who is sober or is hyperaware of the social, philosophical and psychological state of themselves and the party, it is genuinely a very uninteresting and nerve wrecking and anxiety inducing experience. Alcohol really does bind people and create a mutual sense of ""we're all fucked together"", making is easier for people to tolerate each other. I realized how much I don't have in common with anyone my age. I realize how much I would rather be at home reading or going on a hike or just being in my own company, rather than being around people who I may never see again, or hope I never do. Alcohol makes us do things we wouldn't or are normally too scared to do. I have many so many friends and connections and experiences just from being DRUNK. Not because of my interests or desires or ambitions.I am not saying these experiences were useless or a waste of time, or haven't taught me anything. I had a lot of fun and have learned a great deal just from being in these situations. But they aren't permanent, they never last and they aren't as fulfilling as they are when you're drunk. 

When you're perpetually drunk, you do a lot of things you don't care about and you don't know why. I drove myself into such a deep depression that I don't have words or feelings to express how lost I was, or still am in this ocean of nothingness. However, things only get better once you increase your self-awareness. Some people have an inclination do that, others never get there. But this can also be a curse because I have also thunk myself into a very neurotic, delusional, dissociative and hallucinogenic state while being so self-aware of this condition. All you can do is get yourself to a point of being so self-aware that realizing that ingesting any toxin in an attempt to numb or kill something inside you means you truly don't love yourself. But beware, self-awareness can also drive us to such a paralyzing state of apathy that it becomes difficult to show anyone your true self.  Everything is a double-edged sword.

If you have BPD, or are just emotionally disregulated, or are just a human bean in the 21st century, please take this post as a sign to cut back on everything that overstimulates your brain because this is the only way you can find your true self, and what you do after that determines your true character.",1620004928.0,False,23,6,PsychologicalLog4022,None,n3kqcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/n3kqcy/how_to_find_your_sense_of_self_with_bpd/
54,Ex fianc√© of a woman with borderline personality disorder.,"I struggle with how to preface this, so I'll keep it short. I get messages like this all day, most days of the year. For the past two years. Please help. 

You don't even know what pain and suffering are Andy. There's no possible way you could ever feel what it's like. You haven't the slightest clue mr. Snotsdale preppy boy prick dicksucker niggerbitchfucker;;;; wah wah ur mommy died almost exactly 1 year ago and what? And what Andy and what??? Nothing that's what. You don't actually give a shit about it or that she died or what she probably struggled with and all that crap that goes along with being a mentally ill misunderstood drug addicted woman that is abandoned by men she fair to say devoted her life too. And her kids too. Like you Andy. And ur a fuckhead. You just ended up being a stuck up snob pompous self-centered prickfucker , hey haha, just like your dad? Yeah cool. Congrats. 

I may not have gotten to meet your mother but I sure as hell can confidently say that from all of what you told me about her that last year of her life, well damn, she was broken into oblivion , into dust, kinda like the dust you people actually literally turned her into by cremating her. Wow. Yeah I said that. 

But no, you don't really understand any of what it's like that whole pain and suffering thing and you just go ""wah wah mommy's dead I haven't faced those facts yet wah wah"" because you want people to feel <<bad>> for you and you want to pretend like you are so dark and depressed and wah wah wah. Cool but REAL people with REAL PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS THAT DISABLE THEM FROM ALL OF NORMAL LIFE can see right directly thru ALLLLLLL of your bullshit Andy. 

You ain't fooling the real ""sick ones"", not us, nope. But haha ain't nobody of yourr stuckup snotsdale kind is ever going to listen to what we ""the others"" ""the unimportant"" ""the dismissable"" the fucking <<underground ones>> have to say.  Cuz we the underground folk are ""crazies"" and a ""blemish to your superior high society"" ...  PSH. Fuck you and fuck your truce.

None of you know anything real or significant or pain or suffering or struggle from the soul, that in tune perception of ""I am alive yet I am dying each and every single day, each minute, each second and I watch those who think they're living it up..Merely lie to themselves because they too are dying each and every day as I am.."". 

You don't know anything Andy. You got brainwashed by your stuck-up prick society phonies and you are up all the garbage they flashed in front of you. You used to have a clever spark to you though, I saw it in those journal entries of yours from when you articulated onto paper your thoughts and true feelings about Arizona, Scottsdale, and all the friends and people you worked for..... Funny but very sad and disgraceful fact now is that you had forgotten all of your true self within a very short amount of time once returning to this disgusting desert land. *****You, Andy, forgot what it meant to be aliveee...... And with that amnesia you proceeded to shovel biblical dirtbag fakeness and arrogant ""laws"" onto the already-made-meek&shallow graves of ones like myself, ones like me who entered a forsaken land only with the sole purpose to keep the proximal connective power strong of one soul split between two bodies: you and I. God's will. 


Do whatever Andy. You're wrong though. Call me a psycho, call me crazy, call me or haha don't call me bc u neverrrr call me anymore. Whatever. I'm right. You're wrong. All of them on ""your side"" are wrong, they're blind deaf and dumb.

Good luck finding yourself when all you continue doing is living a lie and running from the truth. Yeah I'm sure you'll get super far and feel so accomplished once that whole journey of bullshit nothing ends for you, oh wait no it won't because you CANNOT attain a state of NIRVANA without first experiencing the stages of SUFFERING.

55,I fear I'm doomed to never be the father I was meant to be.,"How can I actually believe I'll be an amazing dad someday like I want and visualise so desperately. I always wanted to be the fun adventurous goofy golden retriever like dad. My partner wants me to throw in a mix of my rancher man, assertive, calm grounded and sometimes stern side which I also totally see as my dynamic. I see this so clearly and I want it so bad with her I think I could strive to be a perfect dad without leaving my character or struggling at all. 

Before I met my partner and healed significantly my fear was my splitting and rage. I couldn't control it I would always fear I was a loaded gun and would not be able to regulate my emotions and accidentally release it on my kids. I'm not ready quite yet of course I need some more years of consistency. But at this point I'm fully confident I will be able to heal enough to never EVER repeat my cycle of abuse. But now I fear something different and in a way much much worse. 

My partner recently asked me something along the lines of what would be my reaction if I got news my mum died. She's constantly on the brink of death and spiralling so that wasn't too odd a question especially since I was dodging another call. To my discomfort and disappointment I realised I wouldn't shed a tear over it. I told her that after giving it some proper thought, and I can exactly imagine the scenario I can literally put myself there. Imagine the text coming in from my sister. Hearing she took it too far. Considering details like she's in Australia and the news would come delayed. And I know I wouldn't feel that level of devestation. Sadness for sure, heavy sadness. She's been alone for so long. Yearning for her lost children, dead brother, and drinking herself into oblivion. And that's a depressing thought I would feel a lot of guilt. But in a fucked way I was over all more sad about all the stories she was yet to tell me that I was curious about. Backstory on her, my father, them together, my childhood, my ancestors etc. Less about the actual loss of her as a mother or even a person in my life. 

Then Maddie asked about my dad. My dad recently has had a major shift of character and has come through for the first time in my life as a shadow of 20% of an actual father. Once again I thought I would feel particularly sad because of his character arc and the level of genuine love and care he's shown for me recently. And it would hurt a lot. Especially sting because of that but... Ultimately my biggest fear and thought would be losing what little financial security he offered. And the major opportunity in the future of taking over his company after getting my MBA and working under him for some years like we've set up. 

Maddie is never like this at all, but she rolled her eyes at me annoyed and said I sounded like an edgy teenager and I wasn't considering this clearly. She didn't believe me. But I'm not in the slightest worked up about them and I'm pretty damn good at picturing these things completely realistically. 

There's a reason though. I mean I'm not a complete monster. The problem is she wouldn't even feel like a mother dying to me. Someone who I love and care for sure. I would be deeply sad, but I wouldnt feel the anguish of losing a mother. I never even got a mother figure. My mum was an alcoholic who for the short period of time I lived with her I had to mother, provide and clean up after myself. My father isn't much better he left me to an actual psychopath of a step mum for my entire childhood while he was away on his business trips, well aware of a significant portion of what she was doing to me. And when he was home he was explosively abusive. (It wasn't torture but it fucked me up mentally with my own emotional regulation) They will never be able to be my parents in my head I could never internalise that even if I wanted to. They never became that figure in my life or even showed me what that could look like from the start.

I realised the absolute lack of desire or understanding of a parental figure a while ago when my sister was sobbing to me as a teenager telling me all she wanted was a mother figure. And I remember comforting her but thinking in my head that was downright stupid. Absolutely no empathy for that feeling myself, I had no desire or longing for a mother figure or father for that matter. My sister has much much better memory than me of early on in our lives. She was also in general treated much better so it makes sense that pain and longing was established for her.


The thing is I don't think my partner Maddie can extend me that empathy for my detachment because despite her parents horrible neglect and abuse of her, even surpassing mine (and mine is bat shit insane levels) especially her father jesus fucking christ. She still loves his ass. She still insists on seeing him, keeping an (admittedly very distant and ghosty) relationship with him. She still has forgiven and sees her mother truly as her mother, and a good one at that. The bar is in hell. I think her mother deserves to be forgiven for being a heroin abusing drug dealing addict because of her situation and trauma sure. But jesus christ her dad, he did absolutely unthinkable things to her. And he didn't even have the trauma to back it up. Even if according to her he stopped abusing meth and calmed the fuck down recently... 

Though hardly even really fucking true since she's worried about me repeatedly meeting him because he may get abusive or aggressive with her and of course I would defend her. And apparently her dad may try to start a fight with my ass if I set boundaries with him. (Just from the scenario of me warning him assertively and calmly that I'll take her back home and he won't see her for a while if he doesn't quit it and stabilise) He's 6'4 and over 30 but he's literally an emotionally stunted baby. Also if he hurt her I wouldn't be worried about fucking losing at all but the fact she has to worry about that says enough. This is turning into a completely off topic side vent my point is she is an incredibly forgiving person even for her bpd jealous bf of a dad. Her mum had a turn around so fair enough ig. And even though she had to parent her baby brother for her mother from a very young age, I think she was able to establish and connect with her at some point earlier on. It helps she has an incredibly good memory of her early childhood especially considering her trauma level. Maybe it's all rooted in that. I'd have to give it more thought why she is like this and what I lack. Other than her insane amount of emotional intelligence maturity and empathy of course. Maybe not so much with her attachment to her parents lol.

And she seems like despite all her shit she's made to be an amazing mother. She's so mature and calm and prepared and affectionate and intelligent and understanding ugh the list goes on. She's fucking set. I mean she's swamped on the kid side of tiktok and is far far down the path of studying psychology surrounding childhood development and parenting. She's very confident and has already set out very clearly how our kids will be properly supported and parented by us. I mean theres rules lol and I can't argue them she knows what she's talking about. We must undo our generational trauma and set them up for complete success. 

But I'm still nervous. So nervous. Especially after giving thought to and realising that revelation about my true feelings towards my parents and why. How can I be the dream dad I envision for myself when I never even had a glimpse of the real thing my entire life. There's no foundation not even subconscious. Never had any idea of what a parental figure even really was. She can help lead me a little and I have the passion and dedication to do this right but god I feel like in a deeper way to my core and maybe even developed character over time I'm just fucked in this regard. 

But I keep imagining myself in those golden retriever, goofy, adventurous, assertive rancher dad scenarios and I do truly think that's just me and I could nail it naturally (assuming I'm fully healthy which I wouldn't dare have children unless that was done for years first) 

Doesn't matter. Fucked inherently or not I'll try my absolute hardest and bring all the love, support and healthiness to my children that I was never given. 

I'm so awkward around kids too I get scared of them that doesn't help things. I gotta go practice with them a lot before.

Fostering puppies didn't do enough unfortunately to set me up here either. Maybe in regards to dealing with constant wet diarrhoea...",1681031130.0,False,8,3,traumatisedtransman,None,12ge26l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/12ge26l/i_fear_im_doomed_to_never_be_the_father_i_was/
56,"Looking for any advice about support in the UK, please help","So sorry for this being so long but I've got a lot to ask and get off my chest. For about a year I've known of BPD and from the start I've felt the symptoms explained really well the problems I'd had through childhood and teen years. I've never been good at identifying my feelings (some types of thought feel hard to reach, like theres a push back and everything gets more jumbled when i try) so it felt really validating. But I can't help worrying that I've always just wanted to feel special and now I'm assuming I have symptoms of a real disorder as an excuse for being a pathetic lazy person. As a result, I've avoided seeing a GP until now because I didn't know what I'd do if they didn't then validate me. But i got a couple counseling sessions from uni last summer (they can't diagnose). They helped me to realise how hurtful my parents attitudes had been (growing up lots of ""you're selfish/ungreatful"" ""you're lazy"" ""you're manipulative/spoiled"", "" why can't you be more like X"" ""or else"" ""don't say you're afraid of me or I'll...!"" recently I get "" you're na√Øve "") and that I drag myself down with self hate and that with my mam being suicidal for most of my childhood I felt like my needs weren't being met and I always had to prove my love to her or she'd die. For about a day after the sessions I was floating on a warm pillow of self love that helped motivate me. But it dissolved away, my GF broke up with me and I couldn't stand being around my parents back home for the summer (they pressured me to get a summer job, I didn't feel like I could handle it but couldn't refuse or I'm just taking their money). So I very suddenly moved back down to uni and isolated myself. This year has been a shit show. Impulsive drug taking has gone up, I go through patches of day drinking and feeling nothing and boredom to feeling so sad and isolated (life feels like a realistic film) to having narcissistic waves of mania, mainly when on a substance. I regularly can't stand to look at my reflection when I'm alone (looks like someone else scary looking back) and I do stupid shit like taking drinks from strangers in clubs fully aware that I'm probably being spiked or going to random music venues in areas of the city that I don't know with my weedguy. I haven't been able to keep up with uni, putting all work off until it was late and I'd have to take a 10% hit to any grade I got on them. I don't care. With about a day left to finish my dissertation I had nothing started and broke down. My mam picked me up the next day, that was last Monday and I now can't graduate with honors (as if I give a shit). Since then I've been having mood swings out the wazoo, apprehensive about doing anything and getting these sessions where my hate and distrust for my parents (who are loving and hurtful but not malicious) gets overwhelming. But its more like, I get angry at the world and everything is bad and then I feed my relationships through this hate machine and the only things I can remember about my family are the negatives (delusions as a child that my parents were plotting to murder me/read my thoughts, strangers were plotting to murder me, etc). Then I snap out of it, like when you splash a bath it gets crazy but quickly settles down and goes flat. After these episodes I can't remember what it felt like, I just know it was bad. For the past year having suspected BPD, I often check in on this sub but dont post and almost self medicate with the advice here and online which often helps (trying to remind myself that the average me doesn't agree with the extreme views and given some time I'll go back to baseline). I don't have a sense of identity past my name, body and memories which is maybe all we have but I feel so hollow most of the time. The part that resonated the most with me though is splitting which I think I've observed happening over and over during my life (I never knew why I suddenly hated people or stopped and started loving partners) and even this year I've gone from idolising a uni colleague for her prowess to hating her for her judmentality just because she rightly pointed out that I have been underperforming as a group. However she did confront me in front of the whole group which was the trigger that made me no longer trust her, now she's an outsider, probably working against me and I can only remember the events previous to the trigger that support this, not all the impressive and likeable memories of her. Anyway, I finally decided enough was enough and got an appointment at my GP, thinking that I could get some kind of mental health referral to a professional who could diagnose me (or worst case say I'm faking it but at least give some closure).  I told her everything here and more, including the fact I was sexually experimenting as a child with other children (when I was~4-6 yr old) which up until recently I thought was all consensual until I remembered a very old fuzzy memory of dodgy stuff with some older relatives of the kids my age. I told her how my suicidal thoughts have gone from intrusive at Christmas, to a consideration of a way out, to being afraid of the platform edge, to now knowing how I'd do it. I thought it was going well and she tried to reasure me that my delusions of her invalidating me would be unfounded, until we got to the end and she asked if I'd tried church, I was taken aback and said no, that its not my thing. She said ""that's a shame, not many young people in this area are willing to give it a go but it can be a good place to talk and find God"". Then she asked what I hoped to get out of this. I said I didn't understand the mental health service but I hoped I could get a diagnosis as I didn't feel general talking therapy worked and I'd like to have a target/explanation of why I feel these things. I was told she can't diagnose as a non specialist and when I asked if I could then see a specialist she just said no. So I asked what was wrong, to which I got "" well something deep is obviously wrong and it looks  you've got some depression in there too"". She also said that 'we' avoid giving diagnosises because there can be stigma, but in my experience here in the UK there is more stigma towards the undiagnosed as rhey seem less valid. Then she gave me a number to a public over the phone therapy service (Talking Change) and a website with general mental health self help leaflets. She also said back to me that I was clearly coping, a low suicide risk and that my family relationships were obvious still functional. I didn't know what to say so I just quietly left and got so angry on my bike ride home I didn't even feel going uphill. I feel let down, I'm no further in regards to improving and I have no more resources than what I was already using falsely to self medicate. In fact, I've now exhausted my last hope. I don't know where to go next and I feel so alone despite once again having a support network that claims to love me, so I'm posting here to ask for advice in the UK, what the process is, what I should think. I dunno. Please just help.",1558708792.0,False,6,4,Throwawaysawayohhek,None,bshpx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/bshpx4/looking_for_any_advice_about_support_in_the_uk/
57,I'm sorry if this isn't allowed but LSD completely cures my BPD,"I do LSD maybe 3-4 times a year. Each time I use it I feel completely cured of my BPD for the next 3 months or so. Free of all symptoms, negative thinking, self hatred, etc. Has anyone else had this experience? I wish more clinical trials could be performed because I truly think psychedelics are the optical treatment for personality disorders because they assist in BREAKING the negative though patterns that make us spiral into BPD episodes.",1631553821.0,False,61,65,ArachWitch,None,pnk1fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/pnk1fn/im_sorry_if_this_isnt_allowed_but_lsd_completely/
