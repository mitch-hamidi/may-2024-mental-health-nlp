Medication focused specifically on noradrenaline and dopamine. eg. the prescribing limit for a snri (in UK) =375mg daily. A change to 675mg was transformative for noradrenaline & dopamine and cognitive decline. Above that the gains are minimal. Addition of Wellbutrin to this was another gamechanger.

Take my opinion as an informed one to motivate you into committing to watch this video right the way through through. Screen yourself for ADHD to settle the internal debate if nothing else. If you pass this screening, go seek a diagnosis. You do not need to do any additional brainstorming or researching on the subject beyond those two steps.

Jail in and of itself - also not great. In Jail your whole schedule including whether you can eat, go outside or sleep is dictated by someone else. Same with who you room with. Guess where the toilet is. 

Long story short: CBT is a decent option, whether it helps or not is up to you, but it won‚Äôt hurt. It teaches you a lot about how to manage yourself without telling you what to think or do.

> The link possible between anticholinergic medication use and cognitive decline/dementia has been noted in weaker observational studies. Although there is no strong evidence from randomized controlled trials to suggest that these medications should be avoided, clinical guidelines suggest that a consideration be made to decrease the use of these medications if safe to do so and the use of these medications be carefully considered to reduce any possible adverse effects including cognitive decline.

**Conclusion:¬†Non-amnestic mild cognitive deficits are consistently induced by first-generation antihistamines** and tricyclic antidepressants, while benzodiazepines provoke combined amnestic and non-amnestic impairments.

The higher mental capacity would allow you to understand more about reality which would possibly lead to more mental illnesses however it also means a higher potentiality in the expression of life.

Social anxiety is also an old friend. Therapy had helped me a lot with this, but during the pandemic, I lost that day-after-day contact with my coworkers, and because of this I feel I've lost most of my progress. I often get tongue-tied too.

Keep doing therapy no matter how painful some sessions will be, it's the best specialized help you can get. If you feel you need extra help to make progress, consider visiting a doctor to get some medication, like an antidepressant.

I didn't know this until I'd developed FND which is a conversion disorder as an inability to cope with mental emotions. It caused physical symptoms such as dissociative seizures, temporary paralysis, weakness in the body etc. It also affected my speech, hearing and sight which then affected my ability to basically do anything at all. Cognitive abilities being weakened or changed doesn't happen for everyone with mental illness but with people that have cluster b disorders or dissociative disorders it is wayyy more likely to affect it.

It really made me feel more shitty about myself, because many of my interpretations kept being called into question. It made me feel less sane when I'd have a problem and the professional I'm talking to doesn't seem to be understanding it or taking it seriously. Makes me feel like I'm being silly or childish. It's like anytime I get into a situation wherein I should resent someone I'm steered toward it not being justified. Even if I complained about this very issue I'm pretty sure it would be called into question. Now whenever I get into conflicts with people I'm always super skeptical of my own assessment and give everyone the utmost benefit of the doubt and try to see things from their position. It's actually led to me further enabling some abusive behaviors in some cases. Not overall entirely good. I'm honestly not even sure how healthy it's been because there are some cases in which I think I'm very justified in being resentful but lacking self esteem and continually calling everything into question never lets me settle on that conclusion. It's like even if some people are legitimate victims, thinking of yourself as a victim isn't healthy. I really don't like the idea of having to trick myself though, or artificially gearing my reactions to always be neutral or positive. I guess there just isn't much utility in resenting people, even if it's valid.

7,"the person conducting CBT is never judging.  the purpose is to observe the old thought patterns and then attempt to recreate newer, more positive thoughts that you can make into your new habitual reality.  being less attached to your old mindsets is key.  if you feel belittled or judged, that would most likely be your own ego feeling defensive because your current reality and way of thinking is being challenged.",itsYourLifeCoach,eg4dk2
8,"Maybe it's because I have only been in therapy for a few months but so far the focus of my therapy sessions has only been on thinking about  perspectives. After I read a little about DBT, I am interested in learning more about it. I feel like I have already, on my own, have been able to identify my negative thoughts and how they have been harming me. Now, I need to figure out how to cope with my triggers. Thanks for your opinion!",ashsci,eg4dk2
9,I am getting the same vibes from CBT as well. I like my therapist and know that its not what she is trying to do but I just feel like she is explaining things to me that I already know. I already have tried telling her that I already consistently challenge my negative thought processes and that it doesn't help me cope/manage them. I think I need to just try a different type Therapy.,ashsci,eg4dk2
10,"I have tried explaining to her that I already challenge my negative thoughts consistently before starting therapy and have found no relief. Which she told me that it you have to fake it before you make it. You have to think positively enough and eventually you'll believe it. Next time I see her, I am going to explain more directly that this method of therapy isn't working for me and see where that goes.",ashsci,eg4dk2
11,Exactly! I am so glad that their are other people who feel this way too. I dont need someone questioning my perspective and explaining how it could be inaccurate. I want to find ways to let go of the negative thoughts and move on. Sometimes that can be difficult for me despite already knowing they are inaccurate.,ashsci,eg4dk2
12,I am glad it is working for you. I am just finding CPT frustrating when I am challenging my negative thoughts related to social interactions. I already know that other people might be thinking differently compared to how I perceive them but that doesnt help. I can see how it can be helpful for you though,ashsci,eg4dk2
13,I think I am experiencing something similar. My anxiety was triggered through trauma and just trying to create a more positive mindset is not going to fix the unresolved issues of the past. Thank you for sharing!,ashsci,eg4dk2
14,I am an open minded person and  challenge my beliefs and thoughts constantly. I look at things from many different perspectives. I just get fixated on negative thoughts sometimes. Which us why I feel like I need to try something that targets closer to the root problem. I like my therapist and know her intentions are good. I just dont need someone to give me different ways of thinking about something. I need to find coping strategies to deal with why I have these negative thoughts.,ashsci,eg4dk2
15,It sounds like you have given this method a try and explained why it is not working.  I am sorry it fell upon deaf ears. Any good therapist will either try a new strategy or refer you to someone else.,1968agoodyear,eg4dk2
16,"Slogans like ""fake it before you make it"" are....  AA kind of stuff.    And I'm in the same boat, I already have done this little trick.  It works in some instances. In others, it does not work. When it comes to deep-seated emotional responses, other methods are required, hope things are well with you here in 2022.  I appreciate old Reddit posts that are still open, because they still matter :)",,eg4dk2
17,"I really don't find people telling me my thoughts are invalid to be helpful. When I try to empathize with other people, calling their reactions into question is rarely ever a first resort. I usually try to actually see things from their perspective, why they would be sad/hurt etc. first, then maybe examine possible errors in their reactions later. I don't understand if doing the opposite is a practiced strategy or a matter of the subject being counter intuitive to them, like not realizing how what they're doing is hurtful.",BillysGotAGun,eg4dk2
18,negative thoughts are almost always rooted in fear/survival belief systems.  what do you think they could be from?,itsYourLifeCoach,eg4dk2
19,I am going to try and stick with her a little longer and and see if we can try something different. Thank you for reminding me CBT isn't for everyone. I was starting think nothing will help.,ashsci,eg4dk2
20,"Hey, I'm sorry you're going through a similar situation. I actually did continue CBT for about another year until I lost my insurance. It did actually end up helping with the anxiety. I focus constantly challenging my negative thoughts with positive(/at times neutral) ones and eventually I grew new neural pathways I guess. 
However, I believe I was misdiagnosed with general anxiety disorder. I dont blame the therapist because I didn't let her truly know about everything going on and was more open about my anxiety. This is probably why only my anxiety issues got better.  I truly hate slogans like ""fake it until you make it"" too because it can sound dismissive. I'm glad my post was helpful. Best wishes to you.",ashsci,eg4dk2
21,CBT is well practiced form of Therapy but it can feel like you thoughts are being minimized for someone who already challenges their perspective. I can see how that might be helpful for some people to be reminded about other perspectives and of the positive side of things but I am starting to think that it's not for me.,ashsci,eg4dk2
22,That is what is most difficult for me to figure out. I am not very in touch with my emotions and cant always figure out why I feel anxious or why I am thinking negatively.,ashsci,eg4dk2
23,"I'd stick with it, even if it sucks and makes you feel like you're being invalidated. The times it messed me up most was when really bad things happened, and my therapist didn't empathize with me first or recognize the legitimacy in how I was feeling. I still can't tell if it was purposeful or she was just clueless.",BillysGotAGun,eg4dk2
24,have you ever sat in a regular meditation practice?  they are great for sifting through the mind to find sources,itsYourLifeCoach,eg4dk2
25,"I think I am going to stick with it for a few more months. I like my therapist, she tries to emphasize with me but at times it just seems all she is doing is finding different ways to look at a situation.",ashsci,eg4dk2
26,I like to do guided meditations through an app on my phone. I have found ot to be very helpful in bring me back to the present and in calming me down. Not sure what you mean by sictinh through the mind to find to find sources though.,ashsci,eg4dk2

1,"How do you know you won't enjoy those things if you haven't tried them? It sounds like you got more pleasure from the obsession about doing things than the things themselves. Maybe you liked the adrenaline rush these things gave you, rather than just getting the pleasure from doing and enjoying them. 

You could try playing different games that are less intense. You could try doing different workouts at the gym, like conditioning, or if there are other classes at the gym like pilates or yoga, you could try them. You could try a dance class for exercise, or indoor rock climbing, or Nordic walking, or something else where you're concentrating on the fun and achievement you get out of it, rather than the rush.

There are also different kinds of volunteering. If you only went into volunteering to find a close friend or romantic partner, you were probably doing it for the wrong reasons, and people pick up on that. Most people who volunteer aren't doing it because they're hoping to find a partner. Friendship, yes, but the thing they're volunteering for usually is their main reason.

Close friendships and maybe romantic relationships might be a consequence of volunteering, but they're not usually the main feature. You could try again, with a view to volunteering because you want to help people, the environment, or animals, instead of treating it as a dating opportunity or friendship group.

You're assuming you won't like anything that's been suggested on these lists, but you have no way of knowing if you're not willing to try any of them. CBT might help you with that.

It could help you shift your thinking slightly, so that instead of being certain you won't enjoy a thing you've never tried, or won't enjoy variations of things you used to do, you might instead start thinking of trying some new things to see if you like them, or try doing past activities in different ways so that you don't get obsessed and start chasing the rush.

I would give the CBT another go. It's not as if you have anything to lose, and you may gain new insights and perspectives that you hadn't considered before.",Fearless-Golf-8496,zn2c3w
2,"Sometimes you just need to try things out.

1. Nothing wrong with gaming, but I think in the CBT sense, it would be cutting back on it or taking breaks more often.
2. & 3. Maybe you would like less extreme fitness that is more about doing an activity than just exercising? Something like hiking or joining a local sports team?

4.   What was the issue in being unable to make closer friends their? Maybe it's time to try   
again but in a different way.

5. What kind of toys? There's also all sorts of toys meant for older people like drones. If not   
toys, then what sort of enjoyment did toys bring, and is there a way to do that as an   
adult? If you can capture that imagination maybe you could be good at writing or comics.",Lengthofawhile,zn2c3w
3,"Happiness stems from aligning your actions with what you truly value. Clarify your values, then engage in behaviors that draw you closer to objectives that reflect what you truly value. Just being physically active is enough to release endorphins, but knowing what you value and taking action to move towards who you want to be is in and of itself altogether another reward. Life is a continuous cycle of ups and downs. I like to clarify my values in writing when I hit a low, and apply self-correction to the systematic behaviors that are moving me away from those values. It takes self-compassion for someone to accept themselves for all their imperfections, but after showing compassion to ourselves, we can extend it to others.",ComprehensiveTurn151,zn2c3w
4,"Gaming  
  
If you're doing it too much, use a timer. Play for as long as you like, but you have to stop when the timer goes off. You can go to something nice, like a funny video or good music. Then do it with slightly shorter time. See how short you can go.  
  
Exercise  
  
An investment of a little exercise is the start of an upward cognitive-behavioral spiral. Makes positive thoughts easier, leads to more exercise, and so on.  
  
The baby steps principle works will all kinds of things you don't feel like doing. Start with very little exercise and add to that gradually day by day. Just don't make yourself sick of it with too much.

5,"Problem with past activities is, for example the gym, I had a very serious goal that I was extremely focused on. Most people who go to the gym hate it when a workout is hard or when their muscles hurt alot, but I loved it back then. I loved the pain during a workout, and I loved the pain and weakness after a workout. The more pain I had, the better it felt. I was completely obsessed with this because I associated that physical pain with progress towards my goal. Where most people say ""oh no I have to do heavy leg exercise now"" I couldnt wait to do the painful exercise. I loved it being unable to walk normally after an exercise.

You see I no longer have the goal. I don't wanna be a top athlete anymore. I kind of hate sports now. So if I try and workout again, I will not enjoy the pain anymore because any pain I will get now will not be associated with progress towards a serious goal. If I workout alot now and it hurts, it will only be 'progress towards nothing' because yes it will build muscle, but building muscle is not my goal, so instead of progress towards a goal its more like progress towards nothing. And recently I have been trying out slight amounts of working and nope, I did NOT like the pain. I am finally a normal human who hates the pain.

And thats with most of my past activities. I lost interest in most activities because my goals changed and because of some realizations that have made me permanently lose interest in those activities. I think of my past activities more like learning moments.",catboy519,zn2c3w
6,"3. I did volunteer work with animals and while I love animals, my main reason was actually the hope of meeting people to develop deep meaningful connections with. I was very lonely at that time and today my social skills are still terrible. I was there a year and it was always disappointing how hard or often impossible it was to turn a colleague into a friend

The work itself is a good reason too, but its not enough to compensate the time and physical energy the work cost me",catboy519,zn2c3w
7,"That's fair enough. There are still many completely new things to try that don't have to be associated with your past activities, but you have to experience that shift in thinking first so that you're not writing off any or all new activity.  This is why going back to CBT would be useful. And you can take what you've learned into the sessions.",Fearless-Golf-8496,zn2c3w

It gets frustrating over time to be so alone in real life. Besides that I made alot of friends in online communities but I really lack a social life in real life.",catboy519,zn2c3w

1,"Maybe you don't need it because you need something else. 

A therapist explained to me that she might suggest things, but when following up next week, if I felt like a failure because it didn't work to say so. Because a single intervention didn't work did not mean no intervention would work, it was just the wrong thing for me. She was following up to see if it would work so she could suggest something else.

Maybe you need a therapist that has compassion instead of burnout. Maybe you need a different kind of therapy altogether - trauma doesn't respond well enough to CBT every time, some folks need EMDR which is a little CBT and a LOT of somatic work, which can ferret out the response of the body to trauma instead of just re-traumatizing you.

Sometimes therapists aren't meaning to be, but are traumatizing in how they approach the work. It's routine for them to say the things, sometimes they aren't doing their own therapy work and it shows, which doesn't make it a good excuse - they're just not quite where they should be to help you. I know a lot of people get really invested in the ""truth"" they learn, and think it will fix everything. But just because they have a hammer doesn't make everything a nail. I know there are lots and lots of other ways to do therapy that help people. I hope you don't let those therapists keep you from finding them.",SociallyAwkardTurtle,smwq98

Can I just ask you, why do you want those superpowers? Would that make you more happy? You know, people suffering from depression tend to focus a lot more on negative memories than positive memories. Imagine having a superpower like impeccable memory when you're depressed. Being able to perfectly recall every possible failure and stupid thing you've done as if it happened yesterday. Maybe to a depressed person losing some memories is a superpower.

Autism is just a diagnosis. You're still you. You can live a fulfilling life, also as a person diagnosed with autism. What would make you more happy in life? I bet if you genuinely search within yourself, the answer to that question does not involve having impeccable memory.

Doctor said all those brain exercise apps might help, haven‚Äôt tried it yet. Keep writing, journaling. Be patient with yourself. Being hard on yourself only makes you feel worse which in turn just aggravates negative thoughts and deepens the cycle.

I wish I had the answer for you but I don‚Äôt. All I can say is we‚Äôre in this together you‚Äôre not the only one. Also you do not sound ‚Äúlow IQ‚Äù. Start by treating yourself like you would treat a friend telling you they are feeling like this.

If you‚Äôll humor me here... When something doesn‚Äôt work, you miss another date or call out, think of it not as a failure, but as a discovery... A discovery of what didn‚Äôt work. I have a thousand ways I know don‚Äôt, but those one or two or three things that do help are worth the trial and error. It does take a lot energy and it‚Äôs okay to take breaks. Progress is not a straight line. It‚Äôs a zig-zag that climbs over time. There are setbacks, and that is okay. 

Your writing demonstrates an ability to express yourself fluently. Depression does turn down the knobs on certain parts of the brain, but I‚Äôd say what you wrote IS a feature of high functioning. That‚Äôs not to say the thoughts and emotions you‚Äôre experiencing are invalid. What you‚Äôre going through is very real and it‚Äôs tough, but depression and anxiety are really good liars. They can make us believe limiting things, and warp our reality into something we feel we‚Äôre stuck in. Negative memories and associations come to the forefront as ‚Äúproof‚Äù that the depressive thoughts are real. But the past isn‚Äôt proof of what comes in the future. 

I don‚Äôt have all the answers.. I struggle to get through work and do my best to avoid absenteeism. But I come out short a lot of times. I‚Äôm writing this on my break at work to distract myself from having a panic attack. Annnnndd. I‚Äôm five minutes late to being backüòÖ

Felice Jacka is head of the Food and Mood Center at Deakin University in Australia and president of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry. Her book Brain Changer separates what is known from the study of nutrition from speculation and myth. It presents findings from research about how food affects mental abilities, mood, and a variety of illnesses including anxiety, depression, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer's, and the decline of mental abilities in older people. What's more, it shows that good food costs less. Dr. Jacka and other researchers have confirmed something that has been suspected for a long time - that old-fashioned eating, diets with whole foods instead of highly processed foods, what's sometimes called the ""Mediterranean diet,"" makes depressions less likely. The best professionals for nutrition interventions, says Jacka, are clinical dietitians and nutritionists. Nutrition is very complicated, and a paragraph here cannot do this book justice.

0,"Rowsof, yes, black-white thinking is one of the primitive ego defenses we all rely on for survival, primarily in childhood. We also use it to escape sudden danger, however, throughout adulthood. The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our brains are hard-wired to immediately shift to B-W thinking. This occur throughout our lives. For example, when you are walking in a crosswalk and suddenly look up to see a truck bearing down on you, your mind instantly is capable of thinking only ""jump left"" or ""jump right.""

Although B-W thinking has survival value in emergencies, it produces disastrous results when used to evaluate friends, loved ones, and other people. Nearly all of us learn this by early adolescence. Hence, before we graduate high school, we already know that, whenever we experience intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window.  We realize that those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. And this is why, whenever we are very infatuated, we try to wait two years before buying the rings. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings far more frequently than other people.

Like a young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able to handle strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate). This means he has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. He thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of his conscious mind. 

With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Mommy while she's bringing out the toys but, in only ten seconds, will flip to hating Mommy when she takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Mommy. Rather, it means that his conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.

Similarly, a pwBPD will categorize everyone close to him as ""all good"" (i.e., ""white"" or ""with me"") or ""all bad"" (i.e., ""black"" or ""against me""). And he will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just ten seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action. Moreover, a few days or weeks later, he may flip back just as quickly.

This B-W thinking also will be evident in his frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS...."" Because his close friends eventually will be ""split black"" and pushed away, it is unusual for a pwBPD to have any really close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though he might have many casual friends.

To be clear, this use of B-W thinking to categorize people as ""all good"" or ""all bad"" is not limited to pwBPD. As noted above, we all tend to slip into B-W thinking whenever we are angry or frightened. This is nowhere more apparent than when it occurs in an entire country filled with millions of frightened people who are going through a depression and thus facing starvation. When this occurred in Germany, for example, people were so frightened that a sociopathic leader was able to convince most of them that they were ""all good"" but that 6 million of their own countrymen were ""all bad"" and should be killed.",Up-Town,fa6yon

1,"this can be really tough to go through. i have bpd, and i often worry that my girlfriend secretly hates me, and only tells me they love me because they feel obligated to. no matter how false that is, and how easily they disprove it when i worry, it's still a worry i have, you know?

just saying i relate to you is all.

if you have bpd, or suspect you may, this could be a symptom of that. but i can't diagnose, so do with that what you will.

my advice? communicate about it with him, if you can. tell him clearly and directly when you feel safe, tell him how you truly feel. even if you say ""i know it sounds illogical, i know i sound dumb,"" etc, communication is key in relationships. it may be hard, but i think it's a better approach than keeping him oblivious to your worries. likely, he just wants to love you and help you, if you ever get hurt or feel bad. reassure him that he doesn't need to do a lot either, just that he needs to really show you he loves you, and that he doesn't wanna cheat on you, y'know?

hope that makes sense. best of luck. :(",,wqhlvc

This obviously scares me, but I haven't looked into it much. I'm 28, started experiencing clear auditory hallucinations at about 22, and was diagnosed at 26... Anyway, I have definitely experienced very similar things to what you mention in your blog post. I think I've had more cognitive difficulties during times of stress and depression. I think my problems with concentration and memory are much better on antipsychotics.

0,"Hi there! I'm a practicing neuropsychologist and I thought I might be able to help a little. 

So, short answer to your main question, yes: depression does affect your cognitive ability to some extent. Feelings of mental sluggishness and poor recall are particularly common. There are various reasons for this including neurochemical explanations and fatigue. Expending emotional energy is physically draining and dealing with depression takes a big toll. It's hard work for your mind and body so you compensate by diverting attention away from less pressing matters. This is perfectly normal and getting treatment for depression and allowing yourself lots of time for rest and self-care will do wonders. Also, if you're not feeling as funny or witty as before this could be that you're actually not in the mood to be funny (nor do you have to be) and/or you may be slightly more self-critical at the moment due to your mood. These things are also perfectly normal when depressed, but being aware of and addressing that is helpful! 

Regarding your question on permanence, there is some evidence for temporary atrophy of neurological structures involved in cognitive ability but, unless particularly severe, it is generally not permanent and nothing to worry about. That's not to say it isn't distressing! It can be. But you're not at any real risk of becoming dumb as a plank, to use a technical term, so try not to be too hard on yourself until you recover, if you can help it!

Hopefully that helps! Any follow-up questions just let me know :)",pacmatt27,6dg3kg
1,"Hello,

yes, several mental health problems have an effect on cognitive ability. Treatment should help, especially if it addresses any problems you have with sleep.

2,I know exactly what you mean. When I'm depressed it's like I can feel my synapses firing slooooooowly.... And I no longer even feel qualified nor have the desire to do the job I'm normally good at. I feel like I need to run and go home and hide until my brain levels back out. Being opiate dependant doesn't help because my attempts to lower my dose naturally increases my likeliness of getting in a depressed funk which makes work nearly impossible and strengthens my desire to just take more drugs to fix my head. It's torture.,trEeWalkerE6663,6dg3kg
3,Describe what you mean by not being able to think properly. Do you feel brain fogged like your thoughts are cloudy and distant from your head? Do you find it a struggle to think and feel kind of blank?,AlienedDawg,6dg3kg
4,"Hello,

As everyone has mentioned yes: it does affect you cognitive abilities. Think of it like this,  your brain has all the extensions like a roots of a tree. When you are depressed, they shrink your abilities cognitively ex: sleep, energy, memory. When your doing well and not depressed the roots retain themselves and regenerate its abilities helping you to process everything efficiently. When you not depressed your brain does like a reboot. You might want to seeing a provider to talk about options for an antidepressant or you can try taking more vitamin D at least 5000, get better sleep or exercise. When I was depressed, I could not follow conversations, sleep, or remember anything and I like to think a detailed memory. I have sense I was younger. Then the depression settled in and simple things became very difficult. Hope that helps. ",FILIPANESE,6dg3kg

Another question, when I'm not ""feeling witty or funny"" am I aware that I'm not feeling it, I mean can I try and force the feeling to be funny?

9,"So I'd probably say it's less about whether you can force that feeling and more about whether you need to. You feel low. You're not a toy for others to get fun from. If you feel like poop, feel like poop. When you feel better you'll be as funny as you always were. ",pacmatt27,6dg3kg
10,"Hey, sorry it took so long to get back to you! Busy busy. I don't actually have any to hand which would be useful, I'd have to do a lit search for it and I don't really have the time at the moment. Suffice it to say that recovery is key. If you're depressed then getting treatment for that will really help. Your cognitive ability should return to normal as your mood does. If you're still noticing some sluggishness then, generally, keeping yourself cognitively stimulated will help repair that naturally. However, don't push that until your mood has improved, as it will only drain you more and hinder your recovery.

I'm not sure if that's what you meant? If you wanted specifics about actually recovering from depression itself then I'd be happy to answer any questions you have there.",pacmatt27,6dg3kg
11,"There's no solution for me besides opiates which I'm ""trying"" to get away from. Plus, these end up making the problem so much fucking worse when you inevitably try to quit using them. The days when heroin or suboxone are not available I've had to just deal, usually in 1 of two possible ways. 

1) I tell my team I'm sorry but I don't feel very good and I go home. I lay down and read or watch tv and just hide from the world and don't feel at all guilty about it because sometimes you mentally need this. 

2) I'm stuck at work and I know I'm just as smart as I usually am, my brain is just not firing on all cylinders so I do my job but I realize I'm just gonna take my time and do it at my own slow pace today I probably won't get as much done but at least I'm fighting through the day. Usually I have all the steps in my head for what I'm doing and I remember them but on these days it feels like my thoughts dissipate into thin air one after the other and I can't focus or remember exactly what I'm doing so I have found that it helps to write down all the steps of what I'm doing. That takes the load of of my brain to remember and I can just follow my notes. My brain seems very jealous of its processing power on these days as if it's trying to heal and doesn't want to keep stupid work stuff in memory.

6,"That makes complete sense and I completely understand what you mean. But failure is important, during times of failure are when we have the most to learn.

We‚Äôre all humans, we all make mistakes, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. But if you go blind in your rage and depression, you‚Äôre not taking the time to learn from your mistakes, creating a self fulfilling prophecy.

You lose one girl, and you WILL find another at some point, it‚Äôs bound to happen, you just gotta put the work in.

Realistically this means you are opening up to yourself in your own mind- through the creation of this extra person that‚Äôs there or not depending on how you see it

It gives you that ability to talk to yourself more open

Naturally as people our brains will defend themselves from our fears, but by opening up to God or even talking to people that have passed in your life it allows you to be open with yourself because you are talking to them not yourself

They won‚Äôt judge you, give it a go

I often go to my grandmothers grave and just talk and talk as if I am sat with her, and it helps me get out what I can‚Äôt admit to myself.. 

I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as completely insane

But I was tortured my entire childhood, treated like a prisoner beaten and destroyed.. my older brother commit suicide and so did many many of my friends

Through it all I found opening up to another entity whatever it may be really is just me opening up to myself without my mind defending itself

There needs to be better reforms to our education system to compensate for the lack of genuine learning going on during this time. 

I also know what those depressed periods are like, I have them too. They‚Äôre likely a mix of mood swings and probably some good old clinical depression.

We‚Äôre all struggling, literally nearly everyone our age is.

Do what makes you happy and helps you relax. When you‚Äôre in a good mood or have a little more motivation then usual, do your best and get done what you can. You will have plenty of time in the rest of the year and the rest of high school to pull things up. So, don‚Äôt slack, but don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it.

Also, I totally think you should go on medication - a different medication. Most people don‚Äôt have a good experience with their first medication and need to try a different one.

However my behavior is never so extreme that its out of character. Its just bad days and good days, i cant seem to find any pattern or a major difference in manic to depresssive. It seems like all those feelings can all happen in a days time. Often extreme anger and impatience most often with myself or the horrible things in the world precedes my hysterical crying and thoughts of being dead. Wishing i would stop existing so i never had to feel this way or wishing i were a different person entirely who doesnt experience any of this. I dont know.

4,"I think it‚Äôs super unlikely that a med you take will make things worse permanently. It‚Äôs possible you‚Äôll have side effects, but those should go away once you stop the meds. It‚Äôs MUCH more likely that your depression will progress and that you would get to a point where you aren‚Äôt in a place to contact a doctor and get meds. That can be very hard to do - even impossible - as depression worsens. That being said, don‚Äôt go on Xanex. That can be addictive and shouldn‚Äôt be given for extended periods of time but doctors often prescribe it for ongoing use. 

In bipolar disorder, the manic periods have to be distinct from the way you are most of the time and last at least four days at a stretch. So you should be acting markedly different for at least four days and then go back to the way you usually are. If they don‚Äôt last that long, then it‚Äôs not bipolar but we could look at cyclothymic disorder.",MegSaysHey,rsz31s

0,"From my experience (I've done several months of 1-1 CBT but was taken off it, and I've since completed a six week group CBT program), CBT is about recognising that your mood affects your thoughts, your thoughts affect your behaviour, your behaviour affects your surroundings and your surroundings affect your mood; basically it aims to help you realise what effects YOU negatively at each stage of the cycle and consider ways to change the inputs and cut the feedback loops or even steer yourself into a more positive direction entirely. That said, I could grasp the theory and work through all the courses easily enough, but actually catching myself once I'm in the worsening freefall hasn't been something I've managed too well so far, although it has given me extra stuff to feel guilty about afterwards!

That said, if you do, with our without help, identify some of your unhealthy beliefs, there are self-help books available for just about everything (including many workbooks). If you can't see a counselor, books are probably your next best bet.

There are also videos and apps designed to help.

Have you ever done thought records? These can help you identify what beliefs might need to be changed. If not, I would google ""CBT thought record,"" for help getting started. There are apps and books for this, too.

I spent about 3 years doing therapy once or twice per week. I've completed two day treatment programs and spent time in an AODA treatment facility. I've been hospitalized 5 times in the last two and a half years. I'm still far from where I'd like to be, but I am doing so, so much better than I was before I started. It works if you work it.

We did a pilot study on UpLift where we saw a 50% drop in mood in users after completing it in one month. We plan to do more studies in the future.

UpLift isn‚Äôt free, but it‚Äôs affordable in comparison to many other apps and you can get the first session and first tool for free.

1,"I've felt that way in the past. I still deal with the consequences but I feel less pain and more understanding.  I've had an abusive childhood where I was bullied by my entire family.  But to be honest bullying is abuse, plain and simple. It's emotional,  mental and possibly physical abuse by a stranger or peer. It took me years to get help and in the end it took a choice between killing myself or to get help. I chose the latter but it took years past that to get to the point where I am now . What helps me now is that I psychoanalyze myself and try to understand why I feel this way etc. I found ways to cope. I managed to overcome my distrust of councilors and found a good one that I clicked with. But as it is with medication you might have to go through some to get someone that clicks with you. You might have to let your feelings known at the first session and you may have to tell them at times that you feel like they are dismissing your feelings and they are human and make mistakes. Instead of saying that you were bullied say it like it is. You were mentally and emotionally abused etc by your friends/peers and are still suffering from the consequences.  But hey this is just my experience,  and  what worked for me might not work for you.  But you got to try. Try and become a happier you, one that tries and tries again to live a happier and healthier you. Sometimes you have to find out that something that doesn't work for you to strive and find that something that does. It will be hard but I have faith in you! If you ever need to talk  you can dm me.

3,"7months ago, I was starting to get addicted to a game called League of Legends, and I wasted a lot of time on it trying to play as focused and disciplined as I could, all while ignoring my studies and my health etc...
Then came my exams, my class was ahead of me by a whole semester and I only had about 20days to prepare for it all, and it was really tough since the course I follow is a pretty hard course.
So I started ignoring sleep and wellbeing, and I began prepping for it all while binge-eating bad unhealthy food.

This led to me losing a lot of weight and I got really sick afterwards, after recovering, I think I started going very easy on myself too, stopped going out with friends and sat home for endless weeks doing nothing of my days.

After the next semester started, thats when I noticed all of these problems, I think I also messed up my sleep schedule so I somehow cant wake up now unless I sleep for 10~12 hours straight which is extremely unhealthy...

I feel bad posting about a thing like this... After reading all the other posts from other people, it feels like they are going through so much more and they are having such a hard time coping with worse problems than I am.
I hope I am not being invasive in this reddit.

6,"It‚Äôs actually really good to reach out and ask for support or advice. There is always someone that has it worse but that does not mean that you are not allowed to be open and ask for support.

I mean if you compare your situation to LoL, you probably started by pretty being bad at first but gradually got better at it. You don‚Äôt need to be an expert to play but probably also enjoy it as a beginner as well. That‚Äôs about the same as dealing with personal issues, you struggle and don‚Äôt know what to do but eventually you learn to get better at it. Comparing yourself to others is not something that will lead to any progress but feel like you have to feel bad because you are on a different level than them. I just realized how that comparison is so cheesy but i hope it kinda made sense? Hahah. 

It‚Äôs okay to feel a little lost and insecure, i think it means that you do want to work on feeling good again and creating a future that makes you get excited again. Effort is worth more than just results. Focus more on the trying part to improve things bc thatis also a good way to grow confidence again.",FUUFERINO,ni7qdq
7,"Your reply is wholesome and makes me feel so at ease :).
While I do agree that that comparison was kinda cheesy (haha), when I think about it now, perhaps comparing yourself to others is just useless, we're not the same person after all, we have not lived through the same environment, haven't been through the same experiences, dont have the same genes etc...
When I think about it now, its pretty unfair to compare two persons in general, because depending on what you are comparing exactly, it can be like comparing a fish and a monkey by their ability to climb a tree (I dont know if Im making much sense), but you can see the obvious unfairness in this comparison.

I also like how you talked about how effort is worth more than just results, perhaps I might be hard on myself just because i dont see results...

3,"About a year ago I made a post in my diary that said something about feeling like a fraud that this one person wanted to hang out with me because it seemed like they thought too highly of me, and that was so disconnected from what I know about myself. 

I don't remember this person at all, or this happening at all. When I read that a few months ago I was so shocked that I had no memory of this happening. I usually remember ""positive"" things like this -- people liking me, but this just felt like it didn't happen at all. It almost makes me wonder if I lied for some reason, but that wouldn't make sense because my diary is private, no one is reading it and I don't tend to look back on it, and I've never lied to myself basically while writing one, so I have no clue why I'd doctor a thing like that. It had to have happened, I just don't remember.

Aside from that I've experienced something similar while reading back old things I've written. I can't remember ""this person"", and I almost feel like a different person, not in the sense that I've grown or anything but actually just feeling like a separate entity from whoever past me was, that's frozen in time through writing. A lot of the times I can't remember writing those things either.

*HOWEVER*, if SAD is the result of and bound up in having been invalidated, insulted, rejected, disclaimed, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, victimized, demonized, persecuted, [scapegoated]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=scapegoating+in+families), and/or otherwise abused by others in early life, one may have been so thoroughly [in-struct-ed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=social%20constructionism), [programmed]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mind+programming), [conditioned](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=operant+classical+conditioning), [socialized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=socialization+psychology) and/or [normalized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=normalization+social+psychology) to [feedback loops](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=psychological+feedback+loop) of thoughts and emotions that their brains will not be unwired from SAD by the CBTs. My clinical experience has shown me that this is *very* often the case in SAD in people over the age of about 25, as opposed to most who are in their teens or early 20s. 

Most people who came to SAD via the route described above will need some combination of [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), and/or [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy) for symptom management; and [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [HBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), [SEPt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) and/or [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html) for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the psychological trauma.

0,"3 hours is quite a short course for CBT, was that through an IAPT provider? 

I'm not a psychologist so by no means an expert, but from what I understand, I'm afraid the idea of CBT isn't really to have someone to talk to 1:1 about your problems. Rather it's more a brief course to teach you to recognise and challenge unhelpful behaviour and thinking patterns, and instead to give you coping strategies that you can then continue to utilise after the course has finished. So from that point of view I guess your experience is quite common.

Mindfulness skills help you Center in the moment. Like focusing on the texture, shape, color of your pencil. You use your senses to focus all your attention on one thing and notice every detail of it. If your chewing gum noticing how it feels in your mouth, its texture and the sensation of you chewing it.

1,"Most therapeutic success depends on the relationship between therapist and client. Usually the more senior a therapist becomes, the less they stick to their trained modalities and ""wing it"". 

What can also help is look at how the therapist trained: for some therapists / certifications, group therapy is sufficient, while others went through an individual therapy. That can make a huge difference and either one can have certain skills that resonate more with you! 

Personally, I'm a big fan of psycho-dynamic psychotherapy (""deep talk focusing on acceptance"", so to say ;)), IFS (great for getting a better handle on your emotional system), and Hakomi (great for grounding yourself and playfully getting to know your inner world, in the process unhooking things that hurt).

10,"I‚Äôm lucky enough to live in a big city and have the NHS, so I‚Äôve been able to access a lot of different types of therapy for free. I‚Äôll give you a run down of how I‚Äôve found them.

For context, I have depression, anorexia and suspected ptsd (in the process of getting a diagnosis). 

CBT - did not work at all for me as I felt it was just telling me my thoughts were irrational, which I already knew lol. 

DBT - was okay, and I did this in a group setting which I enjoyed because of the community feel and feeling less alone, but I never actually remembered to use the skills and ultimately, I was quite overwhelmed by all the acronyms. 

Psychodynamic/exploratory therapy - this was by far the best therapy I‚Äôve done. It allowed me to really bring whatever I wanted to each session, and having so many sessions (16) allowed my therapist to get to know me and make observations that I‚Äôd never thought about before. It helped me understand myself and delve deeper into how my childhood has impacted me now. I think I work better with a less structured approach. 

Compassion focused therapy - I like meditation and like to visualise and imagine things, so I found this really relaxing (because a lot of it is to do with visualisation and imagining scenarios). If you don‚Äôt enjoy picturing things though, this will most likely not be helpful. 

Drama therapy - out of my comfort zone but really enjoyed, helped me express myself and liked the group aspect. 

Art therapy - I‚Äôve always been creative so I loved this. Finding meaning in my artwork and having others comment on it was really healing. 

MANTRA - this is for eating disorders so may not be relevant for you, but I didn‚Äôt find this helpful as it‚Äôs very focused on identity and my ed isn‚Äôt a very big part of my identity.

I‚Äôm about to start SSCM and trauma processing therapy so can maybe update when I know more :))

I really hope this helps and let me know if you have any questions!! I hope you find the therapy that‚Äôs best for you. A lot of the time, it‚Äôs more about the therapist and less about the therapy, so also keep that in mind if you think something isn‚Äôt working.ü©∑",Substantial_Court235,1bobwqy

21,"Sure, here is how the AI helped me rewrite a particular paragraph in my ""autobiography"" (I took out a few sentences that were too personal too share)  

----  
For our next exercise, let's address another pattern in your narrative: the struggle with ambition and the pursuit of success, particularly how it's affected by external validation and self-doubt. Here's a passage that encapsulates these themes:

""I worked hard, but didn‚Äôt have the lifestyle I wanted. I couldn‚Äôt get a proper apartment because I didn‚Äôt have a real job contract and just worked for peanuts for my own company. I kept living in one temporary room after another. \[...\] I felt like a complete failure. My failure at work and financially meant that I felt as a failure.""

**Issues in this paragraph:**

1. **Self-Worth Tied to Success and Material Achievements:** Your sense of self-worth seems heavily tied to career success and the ability to maintain a certain lifestyle, which contributes to feelings of failure when those aren't achieved.
2. **Impact of External Validation on Self-Image:** The passage suggests that external markers of success (job, apartment, sexual performance) significantly impact your self-image and mental health.
3. **Negative Self-Talk:** Describing yourself as a ""complete failure"" is a form of negative self-talk that can exacerbate feelings of depression and inadequacy.

**Task:** Try to rewrite this passage by focusing on what you learned from these challenges and how they contributed to your understanding of success and self-worth. Consider how overcoming or addressing these difficulties has helped you grow personally and professionally.

22,"I understand more now and can relate. I‚Äôve been doing psychodynamic therapy for 5 years now and my therapist and I do get to explore the inner depths of my thoughts. During that time I also got into Reiki (energy healing) and also elected to do ketamine from my psychiatrist. 

From my experience the ketamine really helped, after the first treatment I remember walking through the grocery store smiling and feeling actually happy and laughing again for the first time in a very long time. What I did not like about my ketamine treatments was I didn‚Äôt have a therapist who could help me integrate what came up during the trip. I also didn‚Äôt like that I had to commit to going twice a week for 3weeks then once for 5weeks, after my third session I started getting really nauseous and would throw up every time coming down. With that said I feel like ketamine was able to do what ssri/snri claim to be able to do overnight. For me it felt like my brain wasn‚Äôt stuck in a loop and I hade options again whether neural pathways were opened or not, I believed they were and could feel it. However not being able to integrate my sessions actually left me feeling more isolated and the sickness left me with a grateful feeling but never want to do that again.  

Reiki was wonderful for me and I really learned to start paying attention to my body and took on a more mindful lifestyle. I ended up becoming a master level and then my teacher was angry at me because I would never take on clients and commit full time. She ended up dismissing me because of her frustration and then she died from illness she had been hiding shortly after. I still miss her everyday.  

My therapist who has been through it all with me is able to have those conversations because of the relationship we have developed over time. It‚Äôs been lots of ups and downs and I feel I‚Äôve grown the most during those sessions and it‚Äôs a place where I feel supported to be my curious self.  I guess I‚Äôm sharing all of this because it seems like you are at a similar crossroads in your healing journey and want you to know you‚Äôre not alone. 

I know there are psychologists who do care and will take the time to explore with you and I encourage you to keep searching as you deserve to feel supported. I also know that process can be daunting when we already aren‚Äôt feeling well. If you connect with your therapist and feel it‚Äôs still surface level, tell them. I have found being direct with my therapist even if I think it‚Äôs embarrassing or awkward has allowed me to really learn the most about myself and allowed an actual relationship to develop.",prime777time,1bobwqy

I have had a therapist in the past who did CBT with me but had zero benefits from it and found my condition got worse.

I was afraid of aphasia or a brain tumour. My anxiety peaked about this for weeks before I stumbled upon this thread on a mental health forum on hyperawareness produced by anxiety. I found lots of people there experienced the same thing. That calmed me down and my cognitive issues gradually dissappeared.

(However, in a way it can be true, regarding the fact you can do so much with a phone, it can be either good distraction or bad influence)

Also, in my experience (from my own) parents who emotionally neglected their kids don't do that on purpose, but from lack of knowledge or have issues themselves.
Self-reflection is not a skill many people have, certainly not parents who didn't raise their kids well. I'm not a professional, so I can't tell how and whether this is changeable and if they are even going to recognize and acknowledge it.

From my personal experience, it took years before my mom acknowledged some choices in the past weren't the best. That's at least something. 
However, that's only so much gonna make a change. I had to learn to think for myself, and not with everything I did hearing my mother's criticism.
I'm still in that process, but I'm now learning to make my own decisions and be happy about it regardless of her response.

So, I think, you need to focus on what helps you, and not putting energy in trying to change your parents.

You can't access and utilise therapy if you are too low or too angry. Therapy does not solve issues straight away. In fact many end up getting frustrated by just how little progress you seem to make. Therapy teaches you how to live with your thoughts, see your problems and how to be present and solve issues but it can take a long time to see progress. No phones are not the only issue in life, yet they do cause less communication and bonding between people and create unrealistic expectations of life. They also are a genuine waste of time as well sometimes that probably stops many accomplishing real goals in life which is also something that gives genuine happiness. Replacing long term goals with short term happiness is not really a way to improve your depression. In the meantime, I recommend trying mindfulness and therapeutic activities such as writing or art with no other stimuli.

&#x200B;

>*That's because they have the time to learn to deal with their feelings instead of browsing through the feed.*

its your job as a parent to teach them how to identify and there emotions. If you dont teach kids healthy coping skills they are going to anything that makes then self feel better. They have time to browse the feeds rather then deal with there feelings because some parents are to wrapped up in there own lives to deal with the emotional needs of there child. Some parents punish children for expressing emotions or for having ""out bursts"" which causes them to become withdrawn and rely heavily on distractions. 

&#x200B;

>*That's a hard fact. They did fail you, however, by giving you a phone and internet access without teaching you the risks.*

ITS NOT A FACT. 

They did fail the op, by not paying attention to their needs and blaming the OP for being on the cellphone/internet. Of course not taking any responsibility for there possible neglect and emotional abuse. 

>*But you are right, playing the blaming game won't solve anything. They should sell the phone and cut the internet and leave you with ample time to deal with your own self.*

The OP is right, Playing the blame game wont solve anything. But you are very very wrong, you should look into Authoritarian Parenting. You cant teach a kid to have self discipline if you dont allow then to learn from mistakes. Your kids will hide shit from you if you are controlling and extreme, like not come to you when something very bad happens for fear of punishment...  You dont think a teen wont get a phone and hide it from you.

I feel this way, because of this and this, what can 'I' do to not feel like this again(if it's a negative feeling), why do I feel this way? etc. You need to create a feedback loop in which you think about how you feel and decide if it's productive to feel like this or not. Identify which parts of 'the reasons your feeling this' depend on you and which depends on others, then you decide :

1. Whether you can change a thing or two 'on your part' to make things better
2. Whether the things that don't depend on you will grow bigger with time if you don't address them with the people that have a say in your life.

This one can get tricky, because it depends if those people can be negotiated with and if your an adult or not, if your not than you do 'damage control' and wait until you can move out on your own.

2. giving yourself a break and forgiving yourself if you do things that you then regret doing
3. treating yourself to small pleasures like, a piece of chocolate, a sweet etc.

I realize your parents never thought you this. I am not **your** parent, but I am **a** parent. There, it's been said, now you can't say : 'no one has ever told me that before'.",,il87r1
48,"It's not whether social media or the internet are bad in themselves, it's the fact that you spend time on them instead of learning how to deal with your own emotions. It's a distraction from the things that matter. 

Dealing with emotions isn't about being constantly happy, it's about experiencing every emotion and knowing how to handle it. Your parents or anyone for that matter can't teach you how to deal with them, **you** have to do the work, others can only give you hints.

If you feel like you will hurt yourself if you unplug and face your emotions, you gotta tell it to someone, but you still have to face those feelings.",,il87r1

>"" Helping kids manage their emotions begins by validating those emotions and providing an environment in which they feel safe to express them. ""

Validating emotions, yes, but it's the kid that has to validate it, not the parent. People need to be independent, that includes emotional independence. No one should be dependent on someone else for validation of any kind. That's a bad route you're going into.

We all live in different homes, you can't expect someone else to create that environment for you. His parents failed to create it, that we know, so OP has to create it.",,il87r1

53,"Subconscious feelings of inadequacy about your life, the lack of face to face human interaction, typing your thoughts and feelings to others through a screen removes all filters. Basic social skills are now almost non existent in younger generations and it allows kids growing up with social media to build a deluded view of the world, blocking out anything they disagree with and having their views supported by others without any contradiction, which is not healthy or realistic. Dont get me wrong, social media is a perfect outlet for your creativity and self-expression, it allows you to communicate with friends around the world. There are plenty of positives, the list could go on for ever, but when you begin to spend 3-4 hours a day looking down at your phone (which is more common than people think without even realising it) the negatives quickly begin to outweigh the positives. Especially in younger children. Constant reminders and notifications doesnt give your mind a break, it leads to depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation, not to mention toxic self-absorption.  I could keep going but its already taken me 17 days to type all of this *lol*. Do some research yourself, the scientific data is pretty easy to find. I think youll be surprised. The reason its so harmful is because it does the damage beneath the surface without you knowing it, and by the time you realise you have an issue its already too late. Look at whats happening in the world right now, nearly all of it can be traced back to inceased popularity of social media. It hasnt even been around long enough to study the long term effects.",SaucyAsdaKaren,il87r1

I had those suicidal feelings a lot more when I was a teen and tbh even now I feel hey at least there is always a way out with it. But I think that is you just not having the chance to build up any skills to cope with stress. Its why I suggested mindfulness. Only one thing l learnt I still use which is the breathing but that one thing has improved my life a bit. I think the only way of kind of learning new skills is just trying all sorts of things. I did find having an action plan really helpful. You kind of right down all the things you start doing when you notice you are low.
