You take them and get side effects and that depends on each person. You stop them and you get withdrawals, depends on the person. Dosage is different for everyone. They usually keep upping the dosage until they see signs of improvement. This is why it is important to be your own advocate.",16Gem,1bcwdfg

Mirtazapine made me fly into a rage over the smallest things, which is totally unlike me, and also made me intensely hungry. I decided to stop taking it when I woke up in the kitchen eating food directly out of the fridge. It was my first time ever sleepwalking and the compulsive need to keep eating - even when asleep -¬†was scary. The solution for me was to speak to my doctor and change to a different medication, which worked a lot better. I still have some complicated feelings about taking meds, but ultimately they've been the most consistent way to keep me from feeling depressed and help me¬†function. I live in a country where these medications are free, so I don't think they're a money-making scam or trying to keep you sick. Actually, I've found the opposite: therapy and lifestyle changes are expensive and complex, and often¬†doctors don't have the time or resources to prescribe anything more complex than meds. If I were you I would probably try a different medication before throwing in the towel, but I understand if you don't want to because your experience so far has been so negative.

1,"It de0ends on the drugs you're referring to maybe? I'd say anti psychotics are less open to abuse than antidepressants, at least here in the UK, simply because of prescribing practices. 

Depression and anxiety meds are far more common. I don't know how you judge if everyone who has them needs them though? 

I think they probably are over prescribed, when people have normal bouts of sadness and difficult times. This, IMHO has definitely been pathologised to a degree. 

There doesn't appear to be strict guidelines on the prescribing of them from what I can gather, with the definition of depression encompassing normal reactions to difficult circumstances. 

I'm confident that I need them, and they made an incredible difference to me, but then probably everyone who takes them says that? 

I suppose verifiable improvements need to be seen to justify whether they are needed or not. 

By questioning their legitimacy do you mean the effectiveness of the medication?",lupussucksbutiwin,17dcdsz
2,"Well, I think a lot of people need them because our modern society is not really healthy for us.

3,"Medications can definitely be beneficial for many people. I personally have noticed great improvement in my quality of life since starting lithium for bipolar and Vyvanse for ADHD, and I know many others who have benefited from antidepressants or antipsychotics. 

However, just look at the state of the world right now. Its stressful, uncertain, hostile, degrading, and exploitative, and these things are showing no signs of improving. To feel sad, hopeless, anxious, stressed, tired, etc. in such an environment is a NORMAL REACTION. I think that a lot of people are falsely attributing these feelings to mental illness when in reality they're a normal reaction to the current circumstances.  

Peoples awareness of the EXISTENCE of mental illness has certainly increased a lot in the past decade, however their actual understanding of it has not kept pace. A mental illness is a state of mind that negatively impacts quality of life, and most importantly IS NOT A RESPONSE TO CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. Someone who is sad for a few months after their mother passes away does not have depression, they're just experiencing normal emotions (albeit unpleasant ones). Someone getting nervous before a final exam that will make or break their grade does not mean they have anxiety. Some people do legitimately have mental illness resulting from physiological traits. But everyone has basic needs (food, shelter, rest, social connection, community, hobbies/free time, entertainment, etc.), and when these needs are not being met, its difficult to determine if someone actually has mental illness or if they are just responding naturally to their circumstances.",Ashamed_Ad9771,17dcdsz

5,"I have found medications helpful. For a long time I didn't want to take them, doubted if they would help or if I had depression. Eventually I tried, and they got me going when nothing else could, and I realized what my depression really is and feels like (vs feeling normal).

I think medications are just one part of it though. They can help get someone to a better place, but in my case, there were a ton of things I needed to work on (on my own, or via therapy, and via other methods of support). The meds gave me the opportunity to work on those.

""Need"" can be both subjective and objective. If you are in bed and don't have enough power in you to get yourself going, I'd argue that's a need. Once you are feeling better, the use of medication vs other support systems is up to what you and your doctors think is the right fit for your goals in life.

Are some people relying on them when they should be diversifying their care? In some cases, yes - I was one of those people. The meds were working and I got complacent with addressing other issues, but I eventually realized that and started doing the other work that was needed to grow and help myself in other areas.",rocketsunrise,17dcdsz

Personally, I'm all for natural solutions as much as possible, especially when it comes to issues that often are just the symptoms of deeper roots that need to be addressed, processed, and healed - rather than bandaid solutions that just keep symptoms away, but leave the roots unaddressed and unattended.

When I do, as prescribed, they are heavily suppressed, making them much more bearable and easier to fight off.

14,"I believe in them, I remember vividly my thoughts and feelings that led to my repeated hospitalizations. And then when I got on the right medicine, it all went away. Now bear in mind, it still didn't ""solve"" my life, but it made it much more manageable. I stayed on the same medicine for a while until I met my current therapist, who suggested some other medicine changes with discussion of my psychiatrist. I thought that the medicine was doing all it can, but some swaps improved my mood and sleep even more. 

I was on some antispychotics for sleep, that lowered libido as well. However, I didn't realize it was that medicine causing it until we replaced it with a different one.

I know that medicine isn't always a cure all, but I truly believe in its strengths and know others who have had very successful reactions like I did. Keep in mind that roughly a third of patients on antidepressants will have strong positive reactions, a third will have minor positive reactions, and a third will have close to none.

Be that as it may, meds have been beneficial for people and some mental illness need them more than the others. Furthermore, not everyone need to be on meds for a long time.

20,"Some people I meet with varying degrees of mental illness, mild or extreme - sometimes forget meds are only half of the battle.

Meds can help. I‚Äôve personally never taken them, I‚Äôve learned what actions/thoughts provoke certain feelings in my mental state and I can avoid it. However my friends who are medicated never hesitate to tell me how although they may have some negative effects, they also have their positives. 

I personally feel like meds shouldn‚Äôt be a first solution. More so a last resort. There are plenty of normal remedies to try before medication. Do you exercise regularly? Do you make a physical effort to improve (not just thinking about getting better but taking real action to improve your state)? Have you gotten therapy? Do you practice positive self talk ?

Also, taking my meds regularly, and not testing positive for street drugs OR alcohol opened a door. 

Complying with my psy's advice and med instructions gave me 'I told you so rights'.  I was doing my part. The psychiatrist was trying too but striking out. So she did something about it.

Well, I think that's best disregarded when it comes to judging whether you need them. I mean, I suppose I'm lucky, because my symptoms were so severe that the change after the antidepressants was so obvious, I couldn't deny it. If they were milder symp4oms to begin with, I guess that's where the ambiguity would have kicked in. I was constantly crying, unable to leave the house, and unable to take care of myself. Also, depression is strong in our family. So when I started them, the change was drastic, and I didn't need to think about whether I needed them or not.

It was not easy..but my life is better because of the choices I made for myself.  

If nothing traumatic happened to you during childhood, then you inherited this from one or both of your parents. Either one suffered some kind of traumatic event, never really knowing how to deal or cope with it. They raised you based on those feelings and emotions. You can't know better.
Therefore, you may think it is neurological damage. To heal yourself, you might need to understand their traumas.

If you are too young, or your life is not stable, maybe facing these fears might not be the right time for you. This is a copying mechanism, so you can feel in a sense safe.  It is helping you.

It takes courage, research , studies, and knowledge and wants to learn about yourself, your fears, and life. Most people are not willing to look into that. Also, not looking into some sort of spiritual wisdom and understanding is going to make one feel empty, always needing to fill that void with something or someone.
 Therefore, meds can help you suppress and stuff it all back down.

If one chooses the path of self-healing it is important to cut some people off. Only people who understand and could support you should be in your life in this path of healing if one chooses to do so. Better alone than in bad company while you are healing.

There is only one way yo become the best version of yourself, and eventually have the life you so desire ,though.  That's by integrating all parts of you. Even the parts that make you feel scared. Once you face your fears, they have no power over you. 
Then, you can use that extra energy focusing on what you want and on your dreams. Not focusing on controlling and watching out for everything that could be a potential threat, being emotionally drained,  insecure, unstable, impulsive, etc.

I don't expect you to agree with me. You need to do for yourself what you think is best for you. That's all that really matters.",chauane,17dcdsz

49,"Yes, it‚Äôs super interesting!! I‚Äôm going into uni next year to study neuroscience, biochemistry and molecular biology so I can hopefully make a difference and inject some truth into an industry that seems to see green over actually helping people. 

While I agree that everyone has mental differences 1. I think most of them still allow for us to operate cohesively within society and 2. There is still a minority of people who experience these differences to a degree where they can‚Äôt properly integrate/operate within society, thus I still think that mental illness is a valid term. I just think the rates of diagnosis of these mental illnesses compared to the proportion of people that actually suffer from them in any meaningful capacity outside of the ordinary deviance from the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù, is ridiculously blown out of proportion. The mental health industry is a joke, yet people would rather pay for expensive prescriptions and live in a delusion that their well-being is completely out of their control, than actually realise that most of their experiences is within the normal range of the human experience, that they actually can take basic, ordinary steps to profoundly improve their quality of life.

51,"My mother was sexually assaulted by her brother and abused by my father, that much I know. She didn't tell me about the sexual assault though. I learned about by going through her things she had from therapy. She did tell me about my father's abuse. I assume I witnessed it as a toddler as well. My mother sought treatment as a child and teenager, I had therapy and was on anti depressants. I chose to stop taking them as a young adult after I left her care. As a adult I had an epiphany and realized there's something wrong with me as I had made some very poor choices who h were exacerbating my poor mental health and mood, so I made the personal choice to seek medical treatment. Under basic Canadian coverage, I can receive a small list of medications.  
  
I am doing my best to take my medication as prescribed and  I fought to get myself out of an abusive relationship, which the negative environment and oppression made my life a living hell.I made a very poor mistake and fell for a romance scam and lost $2,500, which pushed me to the point of seriously considering suicide because I felt I couldn't recover from that situation. Thankfully I met my fiance and he saved me and things are slowly recovering. I have sought therapy but it not covered by ODSP and requires I pay out of pocket. However we got ourselves into a poor financial situation but we are going to work together to fix it. I've been seeking part time employment bit my poor sleep, untreated sleep disorder, is a big deterrent. Once he has health insurance from his job I'm going to get treatment for it so I can hopefully start working again. I had to leave me work program due to missed work because of oversleeping.

I do agree with you and I hope we can both help to change the future. For many people as well,  I think it's a matter of coping and also never learning how.  Your nervous system holds on to trauma, your brain develops patterns, and who teaches us how to handle emotions,  meditate,  fall into who we are as a person? Not school but our parents,  who themselves learned emotional coping through their parents,  and so forth.  Even adults well into mid-life can't actually identify what their emotions are or the feelings themselves tied into them so they go through life creating self destructive patterns that stem from their past, and it becomes a negative cycle. I can't even imagine the destruction caused in the individual level through generations that have led us to such a disturbed society today.

55,"Thank you for sharing. I appreciate you being open. It is not easy to talk about these issues.  You are a very strong person. Even though you made some mistakes, you really learned from them. You will be much more in tune than others because of your mistakes. Don't judge yourself. If you realize how you were feeling when you fell for that romance,  you will see that you were getting signs that that romance was not real. You had weird feelings and pressure. Try to remember that feeling.  That's your intuition telling something is off. Next time you feel that you can trust that.
I will write some of my past, then a few things that helped me heal. Feel free to totally ignore what doesn't resonate with you.  Do what feels best for you always  you know yourself better. If medicine can help with your stability,  go for it and at the same time help yourself some other ways. I will give you feel examples. You do not need to wait that maybe some day you get treatment.  But definitely go for it when you are able. I do believe you can change. I believe you are wise more than you can yet understand. 

My past:
I have experienced my biological mother being abused by my biological father as well. Hitting her, some sort of sexual abuse. I don't remember clearly more like a movie scene. But I know these to be true. She also has tried to run away with me and my little brothers. My father found her and I guess took her back.

They gave us away to my adoptive parents (when i was around 5-6yrs). My adoptive parents were my aunt and my biological father's brother. They had 3 kids and their own, 2 of them hit, bullied, and laughed daily for many years at me and one of my brother who was adopted by this uncle as well. My 2 other younger brothers went to my biological father's sisters. 
My adoptive father didn't like me because he was jealous, and he was very mean, I guess, not knowing how to deal with me and my brother. He would be very extreme and hit us over anything.  My adoptive mother had to stop being nice or loving to me, so my uncle wouldn't be so jealous. Except for their oldest kid, they were all continuously name calling us, would hit and give some punishment for things we did, as all little kids do. After while you are just walking on eggshells,trying not to make any noise, not to be too happy, to show emotions, and not really trust anyone with anything.
My adoptive parents would always say that if we did anything stupid, they would send us back to our biological parents. When I lost my virginity I was almost 18, my adoptive mother hated me, said I was not her daughter anymore, was hitting me everyday and treating me bad  and was treating me like the made of the house  until I moved out few months later to Finland. 
It was not easy to feel safe or like home. I had a severe abandonment fear. 
Plus,all the very intense BPD issues. I didn't even know I had them because i didn't know any of this when I was younger. I was lucky that my first man, who i was married with and is the father of my kid, was so understanding and so helpful. Maybe the fact that we were married didn't show the huge fear of abandonment that I had. All the other issues we kind of tackle together. Although I still had them, I was slowly learning to manage my emotions.
After we broke up, i was alone in Finland. When I went to a more serious relationship, but I was not married, I realized how strong the fear of abandonment was. It was insane.
The bandonment fear became more intense with the years to the point I couldn't work. I became paranoid.  But I knew that only I could do the work to heal. No medicine can heal that. 

So, I do truly understand you. It is not easy. But I can tell you a few things that were very helpful to me. 

I read and study a lot. About emotions and human beings. I started to read some self-development and spiritual books. Because I wanted to change. I didn't want to feel so powerless and insecure. 
I read in a book called ""Where there Is Light"" by Paramahansa Yogananda that you can change everything about yourself,  your moods, your personality, and even your looks. That nothing was set on stones. I really believed that. That was the start of my path.
After that, I wanted to learn everything that I could so I could be a better human being. I wanted to be an example for my kid. So he doesn't have to go through anything that I went through at my own home. I wanted him to have a healthy, loving mother. Who understands what unconditional love means.

Then, I starred reading neuroscience, metaphysics, more spirituality(not religion), and more self-development.  I came to an understanding that we can really create our lives with our focus. 
If our focus is scattered due to fear, you can create anything good. Actually, I did create many bad things, too, when I was scared and unfocused.

To be focused, you n33d to let go of negative emotions and beliefs. To let go of negative beliefs and emotions, you need yo acknowledge what your negative beliefs. You need to make peace with them and know they are not yours. These beliefs did keep you safe.  They were good to you and are good as long as you need them. When you want a better life, then you need to understand that you have beliefs holding you back. If they are holding you back, it is because you don't need them anymore.
You let them go by feeling your feelings. Being with your feelings then letting it go.",chauane,17dcdsz
56,"Amazing! I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll both do great things, god knows the industry needs more rational people üòÜ. This stuff makes me geek out so hard, your comments on how we learn to process our emotions‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so excited to study next year oh my god!!!!",anaivor,17dcdsz
57,"Omg, I can relate so much. I have severe fear of abandonment. For 20 years, I only had my mother as the one person I could rely on, but I was afraid of her because of the abuse. She didn't teach me enough to be self-reliant because she didn't want me to leave. I blamed myself for her death because she was living alone and I had grown distant to her. She was living alone and in a wheelchair because of an accident she had injured her spine. She was home alone and had a heart attack. I guess she'd been there for a few days, and the neighbors called the police because of the smell. I was notified by the police.",,17dcdsz
58,"Continuing...

What to do:

 I would recommend the book ""Letting go: The pathway to surrender"" by David Hawkins MD, PhD physician/psychiatrist.   There is pdf file if you can't now by the book. Watch some YouTube videos.

Then I would recommend that you learn some form of spirituality.  You are a deeper and very wise person. You didn't went through what you went through by accident. But you need to know yourself better. We are physical and spiritual.  Matter and energy. When we dont combine both we feel lost, specially people who are more deep and emotional. Starts from whatever makes sense to you. Chakra healing, male and female energy,  healing mental spiritual blocks, reiki, meditation,  prayer, healing past traumas. These are just few examples of what you can research. But you should feel inclined to them.  Should feel curious.  So go wherever your curiosity takes you.  Here are few names too Eckhart Tolle, Joe Dispenza, Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, Neville Goddard,Abraham hicks etc..

These things you need to do how you feel and what speaks to you.
Very important:
Other thing you will need yo learn is how to reprogram your mind. This is so crucial.  Because you have many old beliefs, from what you saw, what you felt and what was told to you in your childhood.  
You need to change them. Research on how to reprogram your brain. This is neuroscience.  But many other areas talk about this. Like for example ""changing your personal story"","" How to change The story you tell yourself"". If you search for that you will find that that is teaching how to reprogram your brain. 

Then my last recommendation is to stay out of social media for a while and heal. Rest.  Sleep as much as you can. Be kind to yourself  learn to love yourself unconditionally,  research about it. Never judge your past or yourself. You are learning. 
You are not your past. Do some self-care routines. Meditate at least 15 a day or maybe some deep breath work. Get some guided meditation they are easy and relaxing ,it will also sharpen your intuition. Or some deep breathing technique videos.
Have only people who understand what you went through and how you feel at the moment. No one else needs to be there.

Don't give up. It is not easy  but it is fulfilling.  You will discover more of yourself and become the person you really want to be. Actually the person you already are deep within.
Believe in yourself.  It will not be a straight line. It will go up and down. But you can make it. 
You deserve the best things in life. You can create a great life for yourself.  
Do follow your own intuition,  what calls your attention.  Rest when you need. I wish you the very best ü©µ 
Feel free to talk to me if you feel like.",chauane,17dcdsz
59,"Thank you for sharing üôèYou had to be so strongü´Ç. It is not easy to be a little child and be helpless. That little child carried you through.  Be thankful for who you were. Be proud of how strong you had to be and how strong you are.

You did the best  you could with what you knew.You were so scared and still had to push forward. You couldn't have done any better than what you did, even if now you think you should have done better. You couldn't.  It is not your fault. 
 She couldn't teach you any better either. She didn't know any better. im sure she was scared as well. I feel for her, too. I know it was not easy for her either.
. 
I think you are an example of strength.  You need to learn about self-love, self-worth, and how to build these things. No one taught you. So, you are having to learn and teach yourself.  It is our responsibility to learn since no one really taught us.

Study about it, what a healthy relationship looks like. What self-love is. Where does true self-worth and value come from?
It's not from what you have,from who you have/spend time with or from what you do. If that was the case, most people would feel very valuable and unconditionally love themselves , yet the truth is that most people only love themselves ""if"" they have the job that pays for cars,the trips,  the house, the things they need, so they can show what they have to others who don't really care about them, or if they have the relationship that looks good, or the looks or whatever that looks good on the outside so others can see..or or or ""ifs"" .

While deep down inside, they always need and are always filling in voids, which will always be unfilled , with unfufilling things. That's where addiction starts.. 

If you want to heal, start with being proficient in how to reprogram your mind.. You don't have to wait on no one for their kindness or treatment.  You have to choose yourself first, be there for you , and care for your needs. That's the start of self-love.
Research on it. Here are some links i very fast checked:
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communications-matter/202004/how-reprogram-your-brain-excellence
https://www.lifehack.org/817171/reprogramming-the-subconscious-mind
https://youtu.be/ij7cQ3E-6PQ?si=0ievpmtCBbniGIwF
https://youtu.be/mhzeAOOgiDM?si=MDyC1ZsxHk4ACVHS

Do more if what you love. Whatever that may be. And as much as you can. Ask yourself every day, ""What can I do for myself today that will make me feel taken care of? That will make me feel good."" 
Rest a lot! 
Do some self-care routines. Try being more in nature. It will naturally ground you. You need to center yourself. Fear makes you scattered,  unfocused. 
Practice some form of mindfulness: belly breathing,  meditation, painting, arts,cleaning,listening to music, anything that gets you present in the moment. Try to be present for what you are doing.
For example, when cleaning, be very present, really watch what you are doing. Keep Practicing.
These moments of being present will add up. These will open up space to create. To consciously create more of the life you want, creating more of the personality that you want for yourself. And literally becoming more creative overall.
Not more being the result of the past and living in fear/reaction mod.

Follow your curiosity on what you need to learn and do more of what you feel like doing. This way, your intuition will become very strong. 
Give yourself time. Learning is a process.  You need to continuously keep learning something that you are learning for the first time. Your brain needs repetition to learn anything new. To create new neural pathways. That's the reprogramming.

1,"I'm not against psychiatrists, but the fact is that the professionals who specialize in helping people with acute disorders such as panic disorder and major depression are the *clinical psychologists*.

The Psychology Today online feature Find a Therapist tells you about psychologists in your area. You probably won't need a referral, although there may be long waiting lists. 

ADHD expert and author Dr. Russell Barkley has a number of YouTube videos. You can  check Barkley‚Äôs impressive credentials at his Wikipedia article. The Adult ADHD Toolkit by Tony Rostane (co-author) - a CBT approach. Also, advocacy and support groups such as CHADD can be helpful. A relationship between ADHD and insomnia has been found, and treatment with the supplement melatonin has been shown to help.

Psychiatric Times has an article about a brief version of DBT called DBT Skills Training. It has been shown to help with ADHD.

Relaxation with the traditional Asian methods can help with ADHD. Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a 3-part program of mind-body methods - slow breathing, meditation, and slow body movement such as tai chi exercise, which you can learn with one or two beginner‚Äôs videos on YouTube. Incorporate these into your daily life. Be aware of changes in mood and respond mindfully, aware of your breathing. 

Mindfulness apps like Headspace and Calm are very popular. The most popular is Headspace, which has a free Intro you can use over and over. Mindful Life Project is very good and it's free.

People are often frustrated with meditation. Here‚Äôs a simple meditation for beginners. The video tells  you about Brown and Gerbarg‚Äôs breathing exercise -

Age 36 - Bipolar unspecified

Age 29 - Bipolar 1, ADHD - combined type, anxiett
Age 28 - Bipolar 2

Age 19 - Borderline Personality Disorder
Age 14 - disparity between cognitive development and emotional development leading to depressive symptoms but no mental ones
Age 13 - Depression/Anxiety


The following suggestions have been made but for a variety of reasons have not been officially added to the file.  They were usually from consulting psychs and situations like that:
Schizoaffective, Cyclothymia, OCD, obsessive compulsive personality disorder, FASD, agoraphobia, and a couple of others that I can't remember right now.



So I am not sure what I should believe.  I know I never met the criteria for BPD.  Family and friends all doubt the Bipolar dx, but no one doubts the ADHD one.  We were able to figure out that FASD wasn't a concern at all.  Ocd-personality disorder is the most ludicrous of all if you met me.  


Plus, even if we just looked at the Bipolar diagnosis from age 26 on, I have had the following treatment plans suggested (all included psychoeducation, some therapy and, of course, lifestyle adjustments):

- Medication daily
- Medication if I felt I needed it
- ECT with medication
- Ketamine with ongoing meds
- TMS with ongoing meds
- Antipsychotic but only ""as needed"" which was up to me
- Medication daily, including one that is only approved for treatment resistant schizophrenia

- Effexor


To be fair, he had multiple other Psychiatrists come in to consult on treatment, but they all said ECT was my only option.  At least my psychiatrist was willing to respect my refusal to do that.  

But because so, so many Psychiatrists have said I don't need any meds or I only need to take them ""as needed"", I wonder if my psychiatrist is just being too kind by prescribing medication.

Its been a long time though, but there's a chance the buspirone I was taking was intentionally prescribed to be a high dosage for the sake of the short term problem I was having.  I don't think that's normal for someone who's intending to be on it for a long time.

I've been on Sertraline for many years though, and that's an anti-depressant but is also used for anxiety, and that has no ""feel"" to it.  It takes a few weeks to kick in, but you just feel normal but with less anxiety.  It's so subtle that the only times I know it's working are when I miss meds too much and end up feeling the crash from them and being reminded how I am when not on them.

33,I‚Äôve been taking beta blockers 40mg once per day for a couple of weeks and it has been fantastic.

34,I‚Äôm taking 5mg abilify 3 times a day and it helps me sleep better and reduce the trembling and chest pain. I still have slight anxiety but I just started so hopefully it gets better. I would suggest talking to a psychiatrist and see if meds are an option,freakinfifaat,1cnpjh5
35,"I've taken propranolol for panic attacks.   As a beta blocker, it didn't reduce my anxiety but did make a major difference in how my body physically responded to it.    Like--I still thought the anxious thoughts but they didn't affect me, my heart rate slowed and didn't pound out of my chest, I didn't hyperventilate, and I could function.   When I took them for panic attacks, I'd become super sleepy (the result of all that adrenaline building up and finally being able to relax, I assume) but if it was anxiety on a lower level, it didn't.

  
I've had prescriptions for valium and similar, and LOVED the feeling so much I was afraid to take them more than a few times.    Just a completely relaxed state, no worries, no anxiety.   VERY helpful, but I knew that I'd soon be taking them for that feeling, not for anxiety, so I didn't take more than a few.

  
While I would love to feel that way all the time, I've seen far too many people who are so addicted they need more and the anxiety upon stopping is more than I'd ever want to experience.    This decision as to whether they are right for you is a personal choice, though.   

  
I'm currently on duloxetine, which was originally prescribed so that I wouldn't have to add a 3rd med to my antidepressants in order to control my anxiety.  It helps a lot (though it took me months to really see how effective it was).  It doesn't produce the euphoria I get with benzos, but usually keeps my anxiety to a level that is fairly manageable.   Circumstances change though, so at times I've begun to feel more anxiety again.    I do hope I don't need to change to another medication.",LouisePoet,1cnpjh5

1,"Any decent psychiatrist should take you seriously if you're honestly expressing that the meds you're taking aren't seeming to help much. It's normal and common for meds to peter out after awhile and not work as well as they once did, and asking to try either increasing the dosage or moving on to something else is a perfectly reasonable ask.

It's also possible that there are other antidepressants, or similar meds, which could work for you without also making you feel emotionally empty. So, it's also totally reasonable to ask to try a new medication in this case, too.

All you need to do is say exactly what you've said here. You don't feel like the Adderall is working well anymore, and the Lexapro is making you feel empty and numb. If this particular psychiatrist dismisses you and refuses to try making any changes, then it might be worth simply trying to find a new one.",moonknuckles,10jur2p

The real work is comes from the person themselves with life changes, therapy, keeping good relationships and changing or leaving bad ones, processing and healing from trauma, sleep schedule, meaningful activity, pursuing dreams and aspirations, processing and recovering from social anxiety, etc.  Meds don't do any of that for a person.

So what I see as a mental health advocate is a very scary thing in the world where people are led to believe that meds will automatically cure their suffering.  And they don't work that way.

>choosing medication being made to look like a regrettable choice.

I've found the opposite to be just as common. It's my right to refuse medication when offered. Medication isnt a complete solution on it's own, but is beneficial alongside therapy. If I want therapy on it's own without the help of medication, then I shouldn't be made to feel like I'm being criticised for exercising my right.

It's irritating how some mental health services try and throw medication at a problem and treat therapy like more of an after thought. (Though to be fair, a lot of services are understaffed with long waiting lists.)",BlackCat550,jxv2tx

I would recommend contacting a university teaching hospital or a reputable hospital that has a good residency program, you'll get better treatment there.

I take a cocktail of agents (they decided I was bi-polar II -  Just lows no mania).  I feel flat a lot of time, BUT if I go off meds I have a rush of symptoms within 4-5 days depression and anxiety. Having been hospitalized 5 or 6 times, I don't mess with my meds.

Duloxetine treats depression and balances serotonin and norepinephrine which is a good thing for depression and it‚Äôs suggested to try it for 6 months before switching.

Besides, how on earth would I bring MDMA to a hospital and then decide to take it?'

111,"I‚Äôm not the person you replied to, but I don‚Äôt like MDMA either. I have sensory processing issues and the uncomfortable things tend to be heightened on it. I get overwhelmed if around too many others and when it‚Äôs kicking in that turns into me becoming nauseous and I can‚Äôt get the feeling to end without being able to go to a quiet space. Usually I can enjoy it after the nausea ends, but it‚Äôs hard to get that to end. It just doesnt feel good to me. Plus I already take stimulant meds for adhd and autism, so it‚Äôs not a good mix.

Also, I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs the only time you feel like you‚Äôve been happy. Taking it can make it harder to find that feeling, especially because it‚Äôs not currently in any prescription drugs that can be monitored. It depletes your serotonin levels and makes depression symptoms worse all for a couple of hours of feeling good. It‚Äôs artificial, short lived happiness. If a prescription is put out that uses it, or a similar chemical build that would be different, but that‚Äôs because it wouldn‚Äôt be a drug for you to get high.

It might even be similar to opiates which make it harder and harder for your body to produce the chemicals/hormones to feel things until it just doesn‚Äôt anymore. I hope you don‚Äôt roll often, but please be careful. Depression fucking sucks, it really does, I feel really fucking low most of the time too and have definitely done my fair share of drugs. It feels worse in the end. The high is fleeting and the consequences stick around for a lot longer. It‚Äôs just not a safe one to use, especially often. If you haven‚Äôt already, at least start taking 5-HTP afterwards to help replenish serotonin levels. It‚Äôs a vitamin, so you can get it at the store or off Amazon.

I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs hard to feel happy, I really hope you‚Äôre able to find a safe way to help with that. It‚Äôs hard, I know that. I have trouble with taking meds for depression/anxiety (they either make it worse or make me feel sick personally, but that‚Äôs just me, it‚Äôs different for everyone), so I understand how easy it can be to turn to something else to help.

1,Sounds like you dont need ADHD meds also that shit. actually harms brain development.,JustAMech,rfwtkm
2,"Ritalin is Methylphenidate which is a stimulant. Some more known stimulants are caffeine and cocaine. Adderall is Amphetamine. I'd say that Methylphenidate and Amphetamine are somehow in the middle between caffeine and cocaine. They're also 'smart drugs'.

Stimulants have one general purpose - stimulate you. That means higher heart rate, lower need to sleep. In ADHD patients, stimulants are actually meant to do the opposite. It's a weird thing but that's how they work. They're meant to bring you down to a.. state where you can manage your thoughts without being hyperactive. Now, in high doses, the hyperactivity comes back.

Seems like Ritalin was not enough but Adderall was too much for you, which is understandable since Adderall is stronger. I don't know any middle ground, but you can ask your doctor if you can get back on Ritalin and maybe turn up your dosage. This would be likely to achieve that middle ground you want.

I don't understand what you meant by placebos though. Mind detailing more on it?",,rfwtkm
3,"I'm fairly new to trying it ADHD medication myself. I'll say that learning certain behavior habits can help in general and if you want there is a very helpful YouTube channel called howtoadhd. You should check it out. 

In regards to medication there are non stimulant medication, and it sounds like that might be a better choice for you. The one I tried was called name brand strattera or generic term Atomoxetine. I personally had a negative reaction to this, that is not common. So I can't say how well it could have worked. I also have combined ADHD and stimulants work better for me. The strattera is also not a controlled drug so it's much less hassle to get.

Best of luck, and try and do what you can to create behavioral changes, so that if you ever don't have your meds you won't feel crippled.",reijinferno,rfwtkm
4,"I have tried ""regular"" generic methylphenidate (way back when adhd in adults wasn't recognized in Germany so I had to pay out of pocket). That usually lasted 3hs, sometimes 4hs. It definitely helped but since I was paying out of pocket I did try and kinda save them. So my medication adherence wasn't too good. 

Then eventually I took Medadate (at least Wiki says that's what it's called in the US, over here in Germany it's called Medikinet. It's just an other methylphenidate) which then was covered by health insurance because it was finally accepted/recognized that also adults have ad(h)d. Medadate for adults was just available as retard capsules. This helped a lot better because it was extended release and I didn't have to pay out of pocket. However it did only work for 6-8hrs.

Then I started taking Ritalin Adult (also retard capsules). Was basically the same as Medadate. Perhaps a bit better, but not much. Also worked for 6-8hrs.

Roughly 2 years ago I started taking Vyvanse (Elvanse in Germany). Personally, I think it is A LOT better than methylphenidate. Vyvanse is not methylphenidate. It is Lisdexamfetamin. I always described it being like getting punched in the face when the methylphenidate started to kick in. Vyvanse is a hell of a lot smoother. It takes up to 2hrs to reach its peak and lasts up to 14hrs. Which is great! However it also means you absolutely have to take it really early in the morning otherwise it won't have kicked in by the time you need it (like for work or school) and you'll have a hard time falling asleep in the evening. But I do recommend it.

I have only taken Adderall once (it hasn't been released over here in Germany - I only tried it because I met an American who had it). I did *like* it. But obviously one capsule isn't enough to have an opinion on it.

Anyhoo. Sorry for the long comment. I hope it helps a bit.",witchdoctorhazel,rfwtkm

Barbituates and sedatives, on the other hand, can make you feel different (valium, xanax, etc.). They work differently than antidepressants and they are fast acting and short-term.

I can actually address the things making me anxious so I can process them without just reacting emotionally. And to answer your main question, I don't care...but it's not indifference.

if possible i'd go with a short acting med, like xanax, ativan, or valium. that way u know how it'll make u feel immediately, and ur brain reverts back to normal the next day. the only issue is those are the ones people tend to abuse so its harder to get them prescribed now. its unlikely a psych would even give them to u without first trialing antidepressants, unless they are for short term use like a fear of flying etc",Secure_Wing_2414,1cmbiww

art, music, sport, exercise, etc, are all activities that you can put your energy into and still be productive.

8,"Yes. Everyone is different and there is no method out there that works universally.

What worked for me is as follows:

1) Remove yourself from the stimuli. If you can't until later, white knuckle through it.  
2) Find a quite place, TURN YOUR PHONE OFF OR PUT ON SILENT, and self-reflect.

3) Ask yourself a series of questions: What is wrong? (what is making me feel this way, what is the situation) Why am I emotionally invested to this? or by extension, Why does this matter so much to me? Be mindful and analytical about it. Sometimes it helps to think of it with other common experiences instead of you directly in the situation that's causing your anxiety.

4) Then you ask yourself the most important questions of all: Is it worth it? For me, I apply the situation and think out the worst end it could come too, in my case, committing suicide. This can be hard for a lot of people, but really put yourself in that scenario. If you're like me and suicide is your one solve all (I hope you're not like me). So for context, I play out my funeral in my head. I imagine people that were close to me and care about me and the great amount of pain it would cause them. I think of people that may depend on me and how it could impact them. I think of my mother specifically, and as painful as this all is, Its enough to snap me out of a dark place every time. Deep breathing helps while you're doing this because its not fun and your heartrate will elevate even if you're not going to the extreme I do. 

I just want you to understand a few things. Feeling emotion is normal, acting out based on emotion is problematic. The healthcare world at large wants you to be medicated, and nearly all medications available are experimental and not tested or designed for use past months to a year. Don't consent to a lifetime of being medicated over being anxious or depressed for a period of time. Its normal, shit happens, that's life. Meds will hurt you 10x over in the long run and make a mountain of a mole hill. Whatever is messing with you or your mental, face it head on. Everyone has the inner strength to overcome any obstacle if they so choose. 

I believe in you and all of us. Hope this helps.",obscureproducer4725,1ctxwl4

2,"You really need to take some time and look up the story of Linda Bishop and what happened to her.  This is one good example of what happens when someone loses their rational understanding of the world when they stop taking their medication.  Its a sad sad tragedy.

Some types of mental illness make it so that a person is no longer capable of making rational choices.  They can become a danger to not only themselves, but others as well.  

As an example, I had an uncle who suffered from schizophrenia and other disorders.  When he lived with us my dad was very involved in his care, assuring he took is medication and didn't drink excessively and so on.  When he moved out and moved in with an Aunt, she didn't monitor him at all, and he stopped taking his medication and started drinking heavily.

One day he showed up at our house while I was away at camp and my mom was out for the evening... thank goodness we weren't there.  He was absolutely out of control and insisting that my mother and I were possessed by demons and he had to kill us to set us free and save my dad.  By the time the police got there, he had physically attacked my dad trying to force his way into the apartment where my two younger sisters were, and nearly put him in the hospital.

I do believe that there are some instances where people are being overmedicated, or unnecessarily medicated.  For example I have ADHD, have had it all my life and only got diagnosed at 50.  I tried medication but reacted very negatively to it, and chose to stop taking it and instead manage things in other ways.  

That being said though, as soon as someone's mental illness puts themselves or others in danger, I think that forced medication and if need be, hospitalization should be standard.",menellinde,1930tdu

My brother is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. When he's on his meds (long-acting injectables administered once a month by a doctor) he is able to work, live independently, gets along with family, takes care of his physical health, etc. 

Every time he is allowed control over his own meds though (daily, self-administered pills) he decides he no longer needs them, goes unmedicated, and promptly relapses into a state of paranoid delusions and acute psychosis. He loses jobs, stops eating or sleeping, lives in squalor, and lashes out aggressively at everyone, including cops (which is obviously dangerous to him and others).

6,"I have to agree with you. Medications have replaced real interventions such as therapy, community resources, financial support, education and training, and many other things that can really help people to reclaim their lives. 

In some cases, medications need to be used for the safety of a patient or others. That is a different story. 

However, there are so many people who reach out for help only to be gaslit, misdiagnosed, and inappropriately medicated for no benefit other than to practically tranquilise them, thus eliminating the ‚Äúrisk‚Äù of harm in the eyes of the medical system. These medications have significant side effects that negatively impact a person‚Äôs quality of life, independence, and function, thus defeating the entire purpose of them asking for help in the first place.

Or even just if the person is suffering immensely, ie. people with active episodes of psychosis who think that they've murdered someone (for example, my great-aunt) - they're suffering a great deal, and antipsychotic meds help. They might not be able to make a conscious, informed choice from how debilitating the illness gets, or from the very nature of the illness, but it's still for their own good.

What I am also for, though, is strict supervision of these cases.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, but also, therapeutic supervision is absolutely mandatory and routinely performed in psychiatric facilities (at least in my country), since the root causes of the illness need to be treated via therapy even if meds help stabilise the patient and prevents a part of the suffering.",throwawaypistacchio,1930tdu

2,"Prozac is a very good medication for your doctor to start with. While almost all SSRIs share particular side effects, prozac is one of the safest if you are unable to take it consistently or need to stop taking it sooner rather than later.

I recommend not fretting over possible side effects. If they happen, they happen, and you can be given a different medication. Most of the side effects are either ""damn, medication does have effects"" side effects (dizziness, vomiting), which usually have to do with the digestive system being affected by many of the things the brain is. Or ""well, it works, but it's not supposed to work *like that*"", such as increased suicidality or hypomania.

Yes, SSRIs work. I take escitalopram (lexapro) which helps with both my depression and anxiety. It doesn't fix them, but does make them much more manageable.

A word of warning: I don't really see it listed that often, but SSRIs can give migraines while you're working up to your dose (and if you miss one!). Have a headache reliever handy, because while the symptom isn't guaranteed it can put you out of commission for the whole day if it happens.",,ylexqg

0,"Typically, it is better to get your doctor's opinion or to ween off of said medication. Quitting cold turkey can have many different side affects depending on what you are taking and how long.

1,"I mean, yes? But it is not recommended. Why do you want to quit? If it's about side effects or you feel it isn't working, talk to your doctor. If it's about money, there are programs to help. It also depends on the medication, most you need to be weaned off of slowly to avoid withdrawal. A bit more info about the particular medication and reason would help. But I would recommend talking to your doctor about any concerns.

I take some antidepressants and felt one wasn't working until I had a shortage and didn't have it for a bit, then realises just how much it was doing. Another I didn't take because of side effects but after a couple months of consistent use the side effects aren't as bad. So maybe there is a way around your concerns.",Lalunei2,1cm6wvj

9,"No problem. I guess the biggest thing for me has been really trying to view the medication as a tool rather than the solution. It provided just enough of a boost to actually start doing stuff again. Therapy helps a ton. But really trying to be in the world has made the biggest difference. 

Largely because I find it difficult to think or feel my way into doing things differently. Instead, just sort of taking the plunge even when I‚Äôd prefer to stay home and isolate has really helped me move forward. And it‚Äôs become this positive feedback loop.

Finding a local meditation group helped a lot. I would go two days a week and having that group setting made it easier to settle into the practice. And it made it a lot easier to start doing it on the days when I didn‚Äôt go the group. It really has been the biggest change. 

It helped me see just how much I was suffering, because just sitting there and watching my breathing was just so uncomfortable.

2,"It depends. There are standards in the world for certain rates of return. You talk about fitting in with society but there are costs to not doing so. Most obviously, there are professional costs: Regardless of disability or circumstance, if someone persistently doesn't hit targets after reasonable accommodations are made, I'll fire them - and if I don't do so eventually the company will demand that I do so. Like you can talk a staff member six months of leeway, but if you're with someone for years, it's either them or you *and* them.

How long are you going to let people, who are ignorant of the cost that they're paying by choosing otherwise, make a choice that we can all see is likely to be to their detriment? Do you let them just completely fail school? Where do you draw the line here? Because they are paying a cost that they are ignorant of as a child - and it's all well and good to say that what they're are is beautiful, and that's true, but that won't cut it when they're 25.

People are *part* of society. Unless you intend to go off and live in the woods somewhere, and good luck with that, you're invested in fitting in to some degree.

It is not as cut and dry a solution as you make it out to be. You're - in effect - just saying 'Stuff it! Buyer beware!' But your buyer is a child.

I am not saying that the solution the other way is simple either, and that the girl in the video should necessarily be medicated. I am asking what you feel should be the line here though. At what point do you say that someone is causing themselves a harm that they are ignorant of, to their likely detriment in a future they lack the experience and foresight to understand? At what point do you say that you have a responsibility to them, even if in the moment the solution is not what they might have chosen for themselves? Because 'never' isn't an answer unless you're prepared to see some of them on the streets.

4,"There are MANY avenues for people on this earth and especially in America.  You probably make MUCH more money than me.  But I survive.  My life is not centered around my career with a company.  I probably wouldn‚Äôt want to work for a company just because it pays me more.  I believe I am very intelligent, but I value this precious experience of life as something somewhat rare if not supernatural, and I likely have different values than you on what matter most, although certainly we have commonalities, we equally likely have differences.

Sure, I might make more money if I conform.  But I am proud to be unique in my beliefs and experiences.  They may cost me some luxuries that you may afford, but I assure you it works both ways.  You sound like the kind of person that would be familiar with the term ‚Äúopportunity costs‚Äù

Now what you seem to be describing about people being able to fit in or go live in the woods is a little messed up.  That is not my perception of what many mentally ill people are doomed to.  They often have invaluable qualities, if you would get to know them.  But sure, you might not always be able to look at them as dollar signs, as it appears you do.

There is much, MUCH more to a persons character than their ability to make money.  Sure, there is a certain level of work people need to be able to do, a lot of the time.  But this is exactly my point.  Maybe this girl wouldn‚Äôt fit into your structured job for a reason, maybe she was (either made, or adapted) to be different for a reason.  

My entire point is this.  You should not assume she has no value anywhere in this world but in the woods because you do not see the value in her.  She has value the way she is, regardless of your assumption that she has none without your stamp of approval",Scuztin,mbsour

I think forcefully medicating a non violent mentally ill person is absolutely immoral.

Medication has taken me nowhere but downhill.  When I started olanzapine after a schizophrenia diagnosis, I was in school at NC State university pursuing quantum physics and mathematics, with the honest intention of winning a Nobel prize so that I could tell scientists that someone that believes in God could also love science.

I was the fastest kid in my PE class, the only person to run a sub 6:00 mile and my physique was incredible, my interest in girls was very high, I was social, still different, but I cared about life and people.

Olanzapine destroyed my metabolism.  I instantly gained over 30 lbs.  I CRAVE sugar and unhealthy foods and began drinking about 9 cups of coffee a day and started using tobacco.

Why?  Because the dopamine that my brain produces naturally was being starved.  My healthy brain used to be satisfied, and now it was starved of mood enhancing drugs and I became dependent on other substances such as copious amounts of unhealthy food.

I could go on for a while.  But basically bro, my life has gone to shit.

If you are you‚Äôre a genius",Scuztin,mbsour
9,"And this is why I say 'It depends' rather than 'drugs are the solution to everything.' And that you're invested in fitting in 'to some degree.' By way of example, you're comparing a situation where by the sound of it you were fitting in quite well - 'I was in school at NC State university pursuing quantum physics and mathematics' - and using that as a basis to question the value of fitting in.

Is there more to a person than the money they make? Sure. Money is however the most obvious proxy for social fit - for how well you get by in society - and part of the responsibility of parents is to set kids up to have a decent shot to do that. Like what are the big functional items as an adult? Do you have a job, are you safe and secure in your living situation, do you have friends outside of work, do you have any long-term emotionally intimate relationships, do you have interests that you pursue? I'm not saying those are the only items but I am saying that if you're missing more than one of those you're probably not very happy.

This stuff matters, I've spoken with people who've been long-term unemployed and it's no picnic. You want to talk about suffering there's a woman I'm friends with who hasn't worked in fifteen years, and has pretty severe ADHD. \[snip - her condition has had a bad functional impact that I think better of sharing directly.\] That's a grim life. Like by her own words that's not something she wants. And I mean we're friends, so Puzzle and her went and got her a diagnosis and medication and she's doing much better now. But maybe if her parents had got her help earlier, rather than Puzzle and her having to go get her a diagnosis, she could have been spared that. And they should have. The schools should have, her parents should have. She was owed something she didn't get. She was failed by people who should have been looking out for her when she was too young to look out for herself.

And that's the flipside of saying don't medicate children. There's harm either way. And I'd agree with you that medication is over-used. That's the kicker here. Like... I don't think our positions are *that* far apart. But there has to be some standard before someone's life is completely screwed up where you're going to say, 'Okay, this is obviously hurting you and is going to go poorly in the long term. There are medical options and we're your parents and responsible for you, we'd like you to take these.'

And maybe you put some safeguards in there, I don't know - like maybe you have a mandatory review with the doctor at six months and if the kid says no at that point it stops. That seems reasonable to me. But the answer can't be that you just leave people to get into adulthood and... have these experiences of misery and pain, sometime for a significant portion of their lives, because their parents and the schools didn't care enough to say 'You're a kid, and we love you, but you've got no idea what the real world looks like - and this stuff is actually going to matter when you leave here. You are setting yourself up for pain that you're ignorant of and that limits your ability to meaningfully consent.'",,mbsour
10,"Well, okay, there might be something in that if we talk about what we mean by forcefully medicating. Like I think we'd both agree that if you've got to strap a kid down that's probably wrong in any but the most extreme cases. If the kid's referred to a doctor and the doctor prescribes them something, and the parents are like 'No, we really want you to take this' - ? Forceful to your way of thinking? Like that seems a lot more reasonable to me.",,mbsour

12,"I was using that example from college to show you the stark difference in person I became after being on powerful drugs every day of my life.  I was motivated. I was happy. I had purpose.

Dopamine is necessary to a healthy brain.  My doctors determined I had too much dopamine, and serotonin.  They snipped it basically.  

I am in the worst shape of my life.  I haven‚Äôt worked in a LONG time.  I am depressed.  I have low self esteem. My brain has evolved to have the levels of dopamine and serotonin that it does for a reason.  They are necessary for my mind to be healthy.  I am naturally very happy.  And now I am unnaturally (via medication) very unhappy.  And I never graduated college.  I had an A+ in calc 1, an A+ in calc 2, an A- in calc 3, and an A+ in differential equations.  I corrected my teachers mistake on a test so that it was properly a 105 and not a 100.  I corrected my TA grading of a test so that I got an A and not a B.  Well, I looked at the teacher and he acknowledged that I was right and then I left basically without asking my grade changed after he basically winked at me because the TA didn‚Äôt understand the logic, because we both knew it didn‚Äôt matter as much as embarrassing the TA, or something like that.

I‚Äôm not a dummy but I lost all desire to pursue mathematics which I find so interesting sometimes.  And like I said, I never graduated college.

My doctor prescribed me an anti depressant to combat the depression. Drugs to cure drugs.  It‚Äôs a dangerous game.

I switched medications when I was dating the love of my life because if one medication isnt the right fit, obviously it must be that there is another drug that will work! (It couldn‚Äôt be that drugs are unnatural to our complex minds and similarly very unhealthy...Sarcasm.) My personality changed.  I began to yell very very loudly at her. I have never yelled or been angry in my entire life.  I lost an amazing girl I could have easily loved happily for the rest of my life.

On a similar note.  Unnatural medications, which if you aren‚Äôt familiar with how they work, they mimic naturally synthesized neurotransmitters such as serotonin.  They are engineered to - analogously - fit locks in our brains to enable pathways of electricity to flow and stimulate certain parts of the brain.  Some things in nature do this well - psilocybin mimics serotonin, and so forth.  I have never tried shrooms, but I would venture to guess they are nature‚Äôs anti depressants.  I would be much more open to trying something like that in a dire situation.  Occasionally.  But every day of your life.... 

As for your friend that has severe ADHD, I don‚Äôt know her situation well.  There are people that simply need to be cared for their entire lives.  Maybe there are other factors. I would want to talk to more mentally ill people and dig.  But I think some people just want a quick fix to a difficult solution.  There is this idea that medication drugs are similar to like a course of antibiotics, because they are both labeled medicines.  

Maybe I jumped the gun on a blanket statement that no drugs should be forced to kids, and maybe I didn‚Äôt.  I have a lot of personal history with the mental health system and I feel so jaded by what I feel is heavy injustice specifically to me.  

I just hate to be treated this way, and I hate to see it done to other people.  

Few doctors have ever taken the drugs they prescribe.  I doubt they would.

My mom told me once, the meds aren‚Äôt so bad look I‚Äôll take one. I said go for it. Please do. She took a small dose of the drug - the one that made me blow up at my ex girlfriend, and guess what happened.  It was the most angry I have ever seen her in years. 

I don‚Äôt disagree that some people need help.  But maybe that comes in the form of friendship, compassion, understanding of differences, attention.  Things unfortunately not everyone in this world are ready to give.",Scuztin,mbsour

Most side effects when starting SSRIs are self-limiting, e.g., transient nausea when starting or increasing dose. However, sexual dysfunction tends to persist while taking the medication. Sexual dysfunction is generally considered to be fully reversible. However, there are reports of long-term post-SSRI sexual dysfunction. It is rare enough that many clinicians doubt its existence, and there is not enough data do even determine its frequency.

Buspirone is also often added to serotonin-based antidepressants to mitigate sexual dysfunction. So, it could be possible.

You take the thought and present evidence pro and against, like in court, and try to make a conclusion as objectively as you can (will that bridge that has been there for, let's say, years fall when you pass under it? Glance at the pillars that are supporting it or up at it if you can see it. There isn't any cracks. How likely is it that a bridge could actually fall without something external causing it?)

All this, will impact negatively on your wellbeing, performance, and functioning as a human in all aspects of life. I understand you completely, because this is how i felt, and thats what happened. you have no idea how much i regret quitting my drugs, this happened many years ago. 

However, my doctor told me, you will be without medication, no medication at all, but you will be under surveillance, time after time i should pay a visit to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. That time hasn‚Äôt come yet, but i know people and friends who don‚Äôt take meds any-longer. For that time to come you got to cooperate with your doctor and follow his advice with fanaticism! 

By the way my first psychiatric who unfortunately for me was too old and he passed away, for this reason i had to find a new one, who turned out to be an irresponsible bitch, and she told me to quit. The first doctor became furious if he found out you had delayed taking the drug less than 10 minutes! 

Because he knew, after a week those ten minutes will become an hour, and that hour could be 3-4 hours in time maybe, such drugs you need to take them on time, you know that, until one moment you may decide to quit! If you miss one day, you will go back on your medications for a few months, if you quit you will experience withdrawal symptoms, and the drug, as i told you, will lose its effect. 

Make sure you never remain without drugs not even for a single day!!!  Taking drugs its not the end of the world, it will be if you need such drugs, and you don‚Äôt take them, or if you are taking psychiatric drugs and decide to quit all by yourself!",Limp-Comfortable-828,173hosx

1,I think ashwaganda a herbal supplement acts on GABA receptors. I managed to quit weed and video games for awhile by taking it. I then got dependent to it but if you can really discipline yourself with it it‚Äôs a great herb. Studies have shown it can help depression/anxiety and also boosts cognitive function. Do your own research though if you decide to use any.,yeahidkbro1,w435g0
2,Ketogenic diet increases GABA receptors in the brains. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs effective for epilepsy.,tinyblackberry-,w435g0
3,"i heard a lot of good things about ashwagandha actually especially since i have a pretty severe hormone imbalance i was planning to get it either way, i didnt know it was good for gaba receptors! thanks! does it have any bad side effects though? couldnt be worse than the antipsychotics they keep prescribing me so i dont mind ""addiction"" to be honest",iierro,w435g0
4,"I haven‚Äôt taken any anti psychotics or any meds so I can‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs worse or not. What I experienced after taking 300mg twice a day (one dose in the am, other in the pm) for a few weeks is Id sometimes get unusually irritated or be downright uncaring and even somewhat depressed when it wore off. What I‚Äôd recommend is not taking whenever you‚Äôre doing something you enjoy. If you‚Äôre playing a video game or going out with friends don‚Äôt take it. Take it on days you have high stress (especially if you have an anxiety disorder) as it‚Äôll lower the cortisol level and up the dopamine. I also noticed when I was taking it I sort of had that cloudy feeling some people describe when taking antidepressants. The intensity of everything diminishes and you feel almost like your walking around with this uncomfortable pillowy feeling if you‚Äôre taking it too many days in a row or too much. I remember the first time I took I had this great peaceful feeling I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to replicate unless I took something else.",yeahidkbro1,w435g0
5,"i'm not planning to take it all the time, probably only when i feel really bad along with whatever benzos im prescribed. what dose are you taking now?",iierro,w435g0
6,I stopped taking it because I felt like it numbed the intensity of things and I also built a tolerance. It‚Äôs a great supplement you just have to use it correctly. I have substance use issues so it‚Äôs hard for me to stay disciplined with it. I‚Äôd recommend 300-600mg on a day you need to take it honestly. 300mg during the morning or afternoon if you‚Äôre doing something stressful and 300mg at night if you‚Äôre doing something stressful.,yeahidkbro1,w435g0
0,"Switching up the med regimen given that what you were on isn‚Äôt working seems reasonable. You certainly had room to go up on the Sertraline, but you are also in a lot of serotonergic meds so perhaps they kept you at 50mg?

Mirtazapine can help with sleep for some people. It does, however, cause weight gain. You usually see it used in inpatient settings. 

The 2 big things that stand out to me are what are your behaviors around sleep. This would be things like exercise/activity, bedtime routine, and substance use. 

The other would be are you seeing a therapist for the anxiety/mood issues? Meds cannot fix everything.",justhanginhere,1b4489m
1,"Med mgmt can be a rollercoaster sometimes. Gene cite testing can sometimes be helpful if you haven't done so already. Based on your DNA and other biological factors, it can provide more clarity on what meds would be more suitable for you. Usually that can reduce the switching between meds a lot of the time.",IntrovertGal1102,1b4489m
2,"I think the idea with the new regime is to clean out the excess drugs that are serotonergic and make Mirtazapine my primary all-in-one pill to combat anxiety, sleep, non-appetite, and depression. I‚Äôm just nervous about all the chemical changes my mind and body are going through during the transition. 

I am seeing a therapist weekly, as well as trying to eat better and exercise more but it‚Äôs been hard when I have zero appetite. Forcing myself to eat at least two meals a day.",OxyRottin,1b4489m

4,"Keep in mind that I‚Äôm no expert, just another person struggling through life who has a 20 year history of dealing with depression, among other things. 

First diagnosis was at 16, before I was introduced to any substances. It was very severe depression. The medication I was put on really helped. Unfortunately most psychiatrists like to keep patients on medications, and I stayed on for 8 years. Eventually it stopped working and it was a god-awful experience trying to stop because I was on so long. Some medications are easier to stop than others. Before taking any, I highly suggest you do your own research on antidepressants, especially one you are considering taking. At 16 I blindly trusted my doctor. Big mistake.

They are not, IMO a permanent solution for depression, that comes through lifestyle changes and therapy. Exercise really, really helps me. Medications have been useful for a jump start, when my battery was depleted. It got me to a point where therapy and new habits were possible.",Commercial_Brain806,12hkdvg
5,"First off speak to your GP.  They will be able to get you on the the right course of treatment that they think is going to be best for you.  Medications like SSRIs, SNRI, TCA etc do different things for different people and while every medication I've been on has been a nightmare for my pal they've changed his life massively for the better.

I journal/bullet journal do ""stress doodles"" and excersise take walks and stuff. 
Journalling has even helpful for organising and motivating my self for staying on top of the house stuff and work. 
Meds don't fix everything but they can take the edge off for sure. It's not a quick fix either it takes time.",roxe_ink,12hkdvg
9,"Yes- even without therapy I  feel so much better with medication. I  have been on different antidepressants for over 24 years. The hard part is that once you are on them it can feel impossible to stop taking them- some you need to taper off of slowly for months. No need to feel any shame in taking medication, seems like everyone I know takes something for either anxiety or depression.",Letsnotoverthinkthis,12hkdvg

11,"Yes, medication helps. However, I think finding the right medication is the key. I used to take SSRIs(Prozac) but it didnt quite work on me. I felt less depressed, but I just felt less emotions in general haha.",Gold_Low_5348,12hkdvg
12,"I smoke meth.  Alot of people think it's bad and demonize it and it's users.  All my life I've hid my use of it, due to the stigma it carries.  Felt like a loser and fool but continued using because truth be told, if I hadn't I'd probably hung myself by now.

Never had a family.  Only a very narcissistic, alcoholic mother who split me from both sides of the family as a baby and took off.  Gave me a childhood straight out of hell without stability, full of poverty and loss and privation.  Fucked bums off the street right in the same room I slept in, when a rooming house was all she could afford before going completely homeless.

  None of her relationships lasted very long.  One guy after the next became just another of a long line of different men my ""mother"" trooped in and out of my life.  As soon as I began to look up to one as a father figure, he was already gone because no-one could tolerate her behavior and treatment.  Finally at last she abandoned me at 14 to the freezing streets of Milwaukee in the dead of winter.  She was staying in a homeless shelter and when I came she wouldn't even acknowledge I was her son or even come to the door.  So they wouldnt let me in.  That night I spent my last 50 cents to take a bus out to the outskirts of town just to stay warm.  When the driver told me it was the end of his route and end of busses for the night I got off and went walking around trying office building doors to see if any were open so I could sneak in.  I found one, went inside a men's room, closed and locked a stall door and laid down next to a toilet.  Last time i ever spoke or seen her.

That doesn't go on to say anything about the endless traumas I went through trying to stay alive as a kid in the streets.  Back then, there weren't all these safe haven places for homeless youth there are now.  The cops only looked at you as a truancy and nuisance so you avoided them at all costs.  Maybe explains just a little part of the reason why I self medicate.

I don't seek sympathy and I hate pity.  I only post this here because it's under the cloak of anonymity.  I've never sought counseling and treatment though I probably should.  But I do have one wish.  That all the armchair drugwarriors out there could take just a moment out to reflect why so many people have turned to drugs to numb the inner pain they live with everyday.  Maybe some compassion and understanding would go a long way towards helping them heal.",Wonderful-Ad-6070,12hkdvg

The other acronyms are different types of anti-depressants and are widely known for their success.

I would say to reach out if you can and you don't have to try to start a relationship but maybe just say you always thought she was sweet and just ask how life after high-school is going. You can just be a friendly guy from high-school being nice and you guys could be friends if she's still in a relationship. If she's excited to hear from you maybe it'll lead somewhere and if not you'll get the closure and know for sure she's not interested and that might help you to move on and find other girls more interesting again. Also, you wouldn't ruin someone's life by dating them. The whole point of dating is to just get to know somebody better to see if they'd be a good long term fit. Sometimes you aren't immediately attracted to someone but then they turn out to be super funny and like all of the same things as you and you can just talk for hours without getting bored. Sometimes you have to just step outside of your comfort zone and see what happens. It's nice to just get to know people and you'll usually know after a day or two if they are worth seeing again or not. Just be honest and when you know you dont see a future with a person, tell them. The sooner you can let them down once you're sure things aren't going anywhere, the better. You're young and probably have no idea what you really want. I'm 34 and I just now feel like I understand what I want.

8,"Sounds like you‚Äôre struggling with the stigma around mental-related medication. Sure, some assholes might have negative associations with it, but who gives a fuck what they think? 

There are people who need medications related to the brain just as much/in the same way that there are people who need medications for their thyroids or diabetes (random examples). 

If you‚Äôd benefit from these, then maybe they‚Äôre worth a try. Has a doctor recommended them? 

I assume the (street?) drugs that your bio parents took led them to stealing/violence, which likely led to (initial/further) issues and brain imbalances requiring doctor-prescribed medication to be remedied. I don‚Äôt think that this is similar to your case at all from your description. 

In the end it‚Äôs your decision whether or not to take medication for anxiety. There are definitely plenty of celebrities on medication (plenty on street drugs too, so I wouldn‚Äôt look to celebs as role models). 

If I were you, I‚Äôd go on YouTube and look for stories on the stigma people feel or don‚Äôt feel from taking medication. My guess is that many will say that there benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and they‚Äôve learned that the stigma around medication is a harmful and inaccurate stereotype. People are more accepting than you think, especially with the growing importance placed on mental health/therapy. Taking medication is not as uncommon as you may think, likely a good number of people around you are on medication and you wouldn‚Äôt have a clue. 

My sister is on antidepressants and she‚Äôs going to get her masters degree in a science field. She ignored her symptoms for a long time and was still high functioning (able to double major in college) but they led to several disorders that were addressed and remediated with medication.

16,"I struggled with this myself.

I am Schizoaffective Bipolar 1 and struggled with severe paranoia, social anxiety (they can read my thoughts, they think I'm bad etc), social withdraw, self-isolation, fantastical thoughts and grandiosity.

I had my first episode when I was a Junior in college after being put on an SSRI. My brain was in the stars, I was full blown manic for three weeks. Many delusions blossomed during this time. My latent Bipolar disposition was triggered.

First time I was hospitalized they put me on lithium. I began to obsess on what was *me* and who was me *on meds.* Am I more me, or less me? Am I dulling down my (delusional I know) thoughts of grandiosity which I *so believe are real?* I am so special they just don't understand me.

I was on and off meds for years. Last time I tried to ween myself off, five months later I quit my 6 figure paying job, moved across the country with zero plan, convinced I was on a mission. Two weeks after getting there I crashed into a depression so low I stayed in an AirBnb for an entire week, in the dark, sobbing and realizing how sick I am. I am not ok. *I need medication for the rest of my life.*

Why can't I see what I am doing? Am I ever making the right decision? I fuck up so bad really believing I am doing the right thing.

Anyway I started back on the meds and *couldn't wait to take them every day.* I still struggle with intrusive thoughts and fleeting memory patterns. But I'm aware of them and choose to ignore them.

Meds aren't for everyone. But they are for me, and I am so eternally grateful to them. I accept I need meds, though I resented and hated the idea for so long. I also resent being called crazy. People don't realize how much suffering and regret and remorse is associated with severe mental illness. Once the person comes out of it enough to see the damage they've caused. I suppose I am the crazy woman your family is referring to. I may require life long care, but that doesn't make me less of a person.

For people who think being on meds is a weakness, to them I would say:  


 *I am is a talented, smart, sensitive, compassionate and capable person. I have many hobbies and plans for the future. I can survive and improve my life. I enjoy helping people tremendously. I do want meaningful, loving relationships. I have accomplished a lot to be where I am today, against all odds. I am proud of myself. And I forgive myself my mistakes.*

The brave step for anyone suffering is to realize there is a problem, and meds are the most responsible path *for people who need them.* They're committed to changing their life for the better, and to have a better impact on those who love them. 

As others have mentioned, perhaps talk therapy is a good place to start. It's a way to discuss your fears around meds in a safe space with someone who can work with you to find *your* path in your mental health journey.",Fast-Classroom-1837,181ep5a
17,"It's good to feel your emotions - it helps in processing those emotions and dealing with what happened. The problem is when those emotions don't subside or are unreasonable and then start interfering with your daily life. That's the difference between healthy expression of emotion and unhealthy emotions.

I have generalized anxiety disorder and depression. For me, my anxiety makes it difficult for me to go about my day. I don't just feel anxiety when it makes sense - when I'm going for a job interview or giving a presentation - it's all the time. Every social interaction is an opportunity for my anxiety to flare up. I worry excessively about what people must think of me. The same can be true of my depression - it's not just when I'm at a funeral or fail in some way - it's all the time.

3,"This is pretty misleading because it gives people the idea that their problems will magically disappear if they take medication. It doesn't work like that. Medication may or may not work at all, it also may have terrible side-effects or it may not. It is always worth trying but as a way to help get you out of the rut you're stuck in, not as some kind of life-style that you want to adopt because you think mental-illness is cool.

Some people take medication for years and get nowhere, some people who don't take medication but try therapy manage to improve their life considerably. It all depends on the individual and misleading people like this is only going to make their choice much more confusing and more difficult to make. Your experience is only one of many, many experiences and a lot of them will have *very* different results to yours.

Some things really do require medication to overcome or at least manage but depression does not. With depression, medication is just a nudge in the right direction. It doesn't solve or change any of the things that cause your depression, it just takes the edge off it which is quite helpful if you're finding it hard to change things for the better because it is less painful to do so. It also gives you a feeling that you're doing something positive so you can then go on and feel okay with doing other positive things and therefore improve your mental-health.

I've tried several different anti-depressants and honestly, some of them made me a *lot* worse and I had to come off them immediately. None of them really worked in the way you describe here, if I'm totally honest, it was the therapy that helped me and any ethical doctor will advise you to go that route rather than lining the pockets of capitalist pig-dog pharmaceutical types.",SomeFuckingWords,7z643i

A combination of mood stabilisers/anti-depressants and therapy simultaneously is universally the most effective way of treating depression or anxiety and similar conditions. Just follow doctors instructions by easing yourself on/off them, and don't mess around with not taking them for days or taking other drugs that may interact with your particular type of medication (if in doubt, google it)
Most SSRIs and the like make things worse for about a week before they have a positive effect; prepare for this and don't let it put you off. Don't let the long lists of side effects put you off either; you will not experience the majority of them.
Make sure you give doctors/therapists detailed descriptions of how the drugs are effecting you, as there is a whole range of meds to try.

It makes me emotionally and mentally stable though. I don't get depressed as much and feel like I'm more like myself than before I got on medication. I thought that the sadness I felt was the real me. I didn't want to feel some fake happiness and lose the real me.

There's not always an obvious cause to someone's depression. Some people have depression due to a negative event or something bad happening in their life.

1,I didn't have anxiety about going on meds. My first month I had some night sweats... like especially in the first week. My psychosis still made me hear some voices in the first weeks. And I felt just odd. But I could also feel my anxiety and depression disappearing rapidly. I also was sleeping better and my dreams weren't so bad anymore. For me it was all worth it. I'm on 10 mg Lexapro and 1 mg risperidone.  Your med dosage may change over the months and years...or you may change medications to find the right thing.,Accomplished_Run_825,oy0uq4
2,"I wasn't anxious about starting, because when I started I was so depressed I really didn't care. I felt like I needed them. When I did start taking them I almost felt relief. 

The first week I was thirsty. Like REALLY thirsty all the time. It also made my sleep a bit messed up and I had to settle into a sleep routine again but after a couple of weeks everything settled down. This did repeat a little every time I went up a strength of medication but it became must less noticeable.

On the the top tier of my medication now and it has helped my anxiety IMMENSELY and my depression a lot. I still get depressed, but I feel like the medication is a support that stops me from actually falling fully into it. 

I hope medication helps you out and does something positive for you. You may feel up and down for a few weeks until it settles but give it some time if you can. Loads of luck. I'm happy to answer any questions you have :)",gloomwood,oy0uq4
3,"About your therapy, think about what you learned. If there's one or two ideas that make sense to you, remember them and use them.  
  
The people most likely to benefit from these drugs are those who suffer from very bad depressions.   
  
A prescription from a psychiatrist is not the same as one from a GP. Those people are experts on mental health and the treatments for it. They know how to respond when people complain of side effects.  
  
One thing to consider is short-term versus long-term use. Some experts say these drugs are not the best way to avoid relapse.  
  
Another thing to consider is that professionals often recommend self-help methods to go along with their therapy. Behavioral methods are often very helpful.  
  
Being active is therapeutic in more ways than one. It gives you confidence. It stimulates your nervous system and makes your brain work.  
   
Taking things in baby steps - very important. This is the key to motivation and motivation is the key to recovery.  
   
Just 20 min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much.  
   
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Reading - start by previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
   
You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun. If you're not getting any enjoyment out of things, here's something that people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as your favorite music or movie. If there's just one movie you like, watch it once or twice. Then, find movies that are like it in some way - with similar story or the same actor. Keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety.  
   
If you're thinking about professional help, treatment usually begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  
  
If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.

4,"I honestly do not remember my first month on my first medication. I've gone through many medication changes and I have had anxiety (still do) sometimes relating to it. 

The first thing you do if you feel a medication isn't working is to tell your therapist/person whose prescribing you it. I have made the mistake many times of not taking my medication because I was convinced it didn't work which lead me to multiple behavioral hospital stays. I get nervous when a medication ""stops working"" or when I am off it due to not having refills or whatever, I get scared I'll do something to hurt myself or emotionally effect the people around me.


Basically, try your best to take the medication as prescribed. If you miss a day, take it whenever you possibly can. Missing even one day made me go back to how I felt before or worse. 

Ask questions about the medication you're put on or research it. Tell the therapist your concerns. Once you're on it, tell them  any negative symptoms you have or if it isn't working for you so both of you can figure out what to do next. 

Sometimes people get misdiagnosed and usually taking medication helps to realize that. My psychiatrist intialy thought I had depression, now I'm diagnosed with bipolar. 

Communication is key here. Staying quiet about negative symptoms or the medication being in affective or making you worse will definitely not help in the long run.

Hope everything goes well :)",DecafLachesism,oy0uq4
0,"Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't shoot their husbands, they just don't. - Elle woods. 


But yeah jokes aside, my psychiatrist recommended mobilizing and physical activities to improve anxiety and depression. In a way it helps because i have seen improvements even with just daily brisk walk. It‚Äôs worth the try. If its improving your condition, why not right. 

Good luck with the MRI and hormone blood tests! I am curious with the result! Hope you‚Äôre feeling better!",Classic-Flatworm-431,1bvnrdt
1,"Of all the basic lifestyle factors, the one with the best evidence is exercise. One thing it does is help the brain to make use of glucose, the sugar in our blood. 

If you say that it has helped you more than medication, maybe you're right about that. But medication is a really complicated subject, and different people have different experiences.",RWPossum,1bvnrdt
2,I have horrible anxiety and depression and exercise works pretty well for me too. It gets to the point where I have to sit in my car for up to 30 min before I can get myself to go into the gym but after 10-15 min of exercise (especially cardio) I feel noticeably better. Getting into a routine of going to the gym helps me sustain the benefits for longer and it eventually got easier to go into the gym. I‚Äôve found that going on runs and walks outside helps even more. Being outside is another good way to help,ForwardGrape2328,1bvnrdt

0,"I've tried xanax.  That was about as effective as popping a Tic-Tac.

Trazadone (it's an anti-depressant) is supposed to be good for sleep and anxiety, but I've trialed it twice (for sleep) and it didn't do it.

I take Relora (otc herbal).  Jury is out if it does anything but I take it anyway.

Benadryl works.  Kinda.

Weed works well.  There's a sweet spot for me where I feel perfectly normal but the anxiety goes away. 

Thing is, if your psychiatrist isn't listening to you, then find another one.

I feel for you.  My anxiety had no pattern and didn't happen as a result of my conscious thoughts.  It just happened.",Imightbeyomama,1cesd8x
1,"I also suffer from severe anxiety and panic episodes. Depending on life events it can fluctuate any given day. It got to the point I couldn't even drive far or on a highway without freaking out. When I started dating last year I knew I had to start looking into other medication or at least try one. I tried lexapro which my friends and family take for anxiety and panic attacks and it actually had no side affects and I can go into stores and my anxiety isn't totally gone but definitely a good 70 to 80% better. I would put that on the short list to look into. Before that I tried zoloft and had very severe mood swings and emotions were all over the places even after getting off of it I had lasting effects for almost 3 years. As someone who avoided trying a new medication for so long because of side affects I can definitely say it was worth it to finally go for it and find something that helped. It got to the point I could only do so much myself in terms of dealing with the anxiety day to day without medication and kind of hit that wall where I needed to look for something to help. Try a different psychiatrist and inquire about lexapro. 

So far the worse I have heard from my family and friends on it is headaches, but no one else had side effects and it's non addictive.",MediocreAd8293,1cesd8x
0,"Honestly, around 10 years ago my doctor told me I should start taking Anxiety/Depression medication. I had been diagnosed with Anxiety when I was around 10 and then at 19 he wanted me to take meds for Depression as well. He never actually said the words ‚Äúyou are diagnosed with depression‚Äù or ‚Äúyou have depression‚Äù but usually when a doctor prescribes you with a medication, that is sort of the diagnosis. They don‚Äôt always say the actual words.

And I get that you‚Äôre scared to take the medication. I didn‚Äôt want to take medication either because it made me think I was crazy. After a month I was getting a check up to see how I was doing and I told my doctor I wanted off (since again I thought only ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù people took meds). The doctor told me he could already see a positive difference in me. I wasn‚Äôt as shy as I used to be and I spoke for myself. My mom who was also there told me that she hadn‚Äôt seen me in such a good mood in a few years and that I should stick with it a little while longer to see. After thinking on it I did realize that I was feeling better so I stuck with it.

Feeling like the medication will change how your mind works is a valid reason to be scared. But also, some people need that type of medication to function better. You might not even realize how hard life is for you until you take a medication that makes things easier. You can always quit them if they actually don‚Äôt work but you should give them a good two months. Also never stop a medication on your own. A lot of meds give you a withdrawal if you stop them quickly so ask your doctor or the pharmacist before you stop. 

I just recently started a new sleeping pill (that is also prescribed as an anti-depressant) and it is working but I‚Äôve been getting a lot more headaches than usual‚Ä¶ but that can just be my body getting used to a new medication. I have to give my body time to adjust and if it does great! If it doesn‚Äôt I will speak to my doctor and get new ones.

If you have any questions please don‚Äôt be afraid to ask!",vero_6321,1bs21fz
1,Also I forgot to mention.. I‚Äôve been having a really hard time with my insomnia lately (old medication wasn‚Äôt working anymore) and when I started this new one I felt like I took a party drug after a few good days of sleep. I almost cried thinking ‚ÄúIs this what normal people feel like? Do people actually have this much energy?‚Äù. My sleep was so bad for so long that I was literally just fighting with all my energy to get through the day but now my energy levels are slowly coming back up since I‚Äôm actually sleeping. You don‚Äôt always see that your life is hard until you get help (from someone or medication) and then you see hard your life really was.,vero_6321,1bs21fz

1,"Many people benefit from medication, but not everybody. One reason why it's important to know about the other things that can help - therapy, stress management, and healthy lifestyle - is that even when a drug helps, it may suddenly stop helping.

Maybe you can get a good referral from your doctor.

A lot of things can help, mostly things that are surprisingly easy.

People in various countries say that they can often find the books I mention in my comments with Amazon, Kindle, or Google Books.

I know that getting professional help can be hard. I'll say more about that.

When we're depressed, motivation for our chores and self-care can be very helpful. It gives us confidence. Activity, especially physical activity, is a kind of therapy. That's not all there is to getting over depression, but it can be very important.

Practical advice for motivation - VERY important -

The lockdown has changed the therapy situation. You may want to look at online therapy and self-help. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.

Some places have free therapy. A doctor or social worker may be able to help you with a search for therapy.

If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Steve Ilardi's book (""a splendid book""). He's the therapist and researcher who headed the Univ of Kansas lifestyle-depression project.

Relaxation eases the symptoms of depression.

The easiest way to calm down is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently through the nose, 6 seconds each.

A good habit - respond to moments of stress by breathing slowly.

It's very likely that whichever doctor you go to to get your meds refilled will know how/where you can report them.
What they are doing is dangerous, unethical and probably illegal in some way (I live in Germany, and something like this would cost the doctor their medical licence for sure here, not sure about other countries though).

Either way, report it and look for another doctor ASAP, this is not something to mess around with.

I work in a doctors office, and there are certain medications that cannot be refilled without an appointment. As far as I know Effexor is not one of them, unless laws are different where you are (I‚Äôm in California). 

I also saw a comment that the person who answered the phone told you you were discharged. They cannot just do that, a manager would reach out to you and you would receive a letter telling you why and they would be obligated to refill your meds one last time and take part in your care from 30 days of discharge. I will say, the only time I‚Äôve had a doctor discharge someone on the spot is if they were yelling and cussing at us and being threatening, either verbally or physically. Even then the doctor made that choice and the manager reached out and sent a letter same day. 

Also, doctors don‚Äôt keep track of when each persons med is due (that would be thousands of people TBH), and they may not have known your appointment was rescheduled unless their assistant were to tell them 1) med is due, please refill and 2) patient rescheduled.

My advice. 

Call a different psychiatrist right now. Explain what's going on and you need to see someone. At their office you can authorize them call your psychiatrist to confirm you're on effexor.

If she has a valid reason, like she doesn't like the shift in certain ways in showing up, then maybe alternative medication could be prescribed to better fit your needs. If she can't support you because you take medication, I'd personally put my foot down or jump ship.

1,"Extra background, sorry for length here,
I have been struggling with my mental health on and off since i was 13, I am now 30 and its been extreme at times and told myself i need to get help so many times. I went to drs about 5 years ago and got put on a waiting list for weeks, i had to respond to the registration letter by a certain date but was in the middle of an episode? so missed it and i was took off the list. I have normal periods between but always comes back and in different ways and intensities over the years.

I am going to admit the thought of going for help at this stage is really frightening for me, i have been studying mental health and psychology since i had a computer with google in the teens trying to figure out what was happening as hadn‚Äôt been taught about mental health before that. Its a MASSIVE passion for me because i deal with it and think a lot of the official stuff they teach on it is still very misunderstood. (I ended up quitting one course due to my mh, a small example of how it has effected my life) 
I‚Äôm currently at open uni doing year 2 of a 6 year degree i really want to go for my goals and dont want to have to keep struggling trying to stop it effecting my life!
Ive tried to open up to few  family/friends over the years (a lot have been diagnosed with depression and on anti depressant medication) so they see it as the same as what they are dealing with and have had comments like  ‚Äúeveryone struggles‚Äù and so many other similar things when i have tried to open up. (I have had bouts of depression over the years but thats not in the top 5 of the main issues )There is some stigma with some people close to me about disorders because of misunderstandings and me unable to find the right words to explain it to someone who doesn‚Äôt deal with it and mostly see it from media stereotypes etc. 
I am considering going to try get an appointment with dr soon, i know i fit criteria for a diagnosis but a lot of the disorders cross over each other so im unsure which one they would decide it was. I cant really find anywhere with real peoples experiences thats why I‚Äôm askingüòå Thank you everyone any answers are appreciated üíï",IcyRockette,113osjg
2,"Depression. 
Told my doctor I meet the criteria for diagnosis and he just said: OK, your diagnosed with depression.
(I do have sufficient medical background for diagnostics, I am just not allowed legally to make diagnoses, as I'm not a doctor myself)


First medication tried was Mirtazapine (tetracyclic).

Allowed me to sleep for at least a few hours every night.
No other effects.


3 months later my doc and I decided to combine it with Venlafaxin(SNRI).

 No effects at all.


Another 3 months later we changed Venlafaxin for Escitaloprame(SSRI)

Had a little positive effect on my general mental state.
Killed my Libido
Made me unable to feel any emotions


Since it had at least a small effect, we decided to stay with it for a bit longer, but after 8 months decided the effect wasn't sufficient, so we stopped all medication for a month, and started Moclobemid(MAO-Inhibitor)

Until now it it didn't show any effects, but I'm still on a relatively small dose.",some1_kill_me_pls,113osjg

- I shake my legs a lot unnoticably. When I do notice it its normally my parents pointing it out

6,"I have always been on different medications due to being a premature baby, but in mental health, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( Trichotillomania and Trichophagia ), around the ages of 10-11, and was given Zoloft, which had negative side effects on me like depression and suicidal thoughts and since my therapist at the time was a horrible therapist and would mostly talk about herself and prescribe medications, and since I was a very shy kid I never told anyone until I had a suicide attempt. I was switched from Zoloft to Lexapro which in still on to this day. At times I don't know if it's helping or if am I just making it up until I go and ween myself off which usually comes with emotional outbursts and suicide attempts. I have emotional episodes daily and constant thoughts of my death and zoning out still but with the medication, I can function through the day without my emotions getting the best of me. With my recent suicide attempts and hospitalizations, I was given a new anxiety medication Buspar which has helped me feel calm but it still doesn't make the emotional instability I feel go away. I was also given the diagnosis with ""Bipolar-like symptoms "" after a bad meltdown and was put involuntarily, in an inpatient hospital. I was given a mood stabilized which made me feel more numb and angry than usual and I was hearing whispering so stopped cold turkey. So far Lexapro and Buspar have helped more than anything but I do need to seek therapy again. For me, therapy has never been consistent due to financial issues and poverty. So hopefully I can go back again to get help.",sociallyawakward4996,113osjg

9,"I think you definitely describe the reality for most people with mental health issues. 
Of course there is stigma and especially older generations are more unaware of mental health.
However, the decision to get professional help is entirely yours. And bear in mind, you may not be diagnosed officially or need long term support. You just recognise that there is a recurrence of symptoms and you need to deal with that.
Explaining that to loved ones can be hard. My approach was to describe it in detail first. Many people argued that I still manage as I was productive, social and quite successful. So, it can't be that bad. And when I started saying that it's masking and I struggle inside or even more, when brutally explaining that lack of help will push me deeper, people accepted it despite their views.

I have thought alot about some of the older generations views on MH and stigma etc I had thought of a theory that because of the things the older generation/their parents went through (eg world wars/ full nations in trauma from loved ones being sent to war and coming back different people or losing loved ones and had very little support for mental health) that maybe have had an effect on their views/attitudes towards thats been passed down by generations or something.

0,"You technically can, since 16 is the age of medical emancipation, but I don't see why meds are not worth a try? Psychotic disorders need to be medicated to prevent positive symptoms and episodes, and if sleep hygiene hasn't helped, it's likely that your insomnia won't go away without meds. Same thing with ADHD: the symptoms come from a chemical imbalance and a neurologically different system, and meds are what helps you keep them in check. As for depression, meds stabilise your mood enough that the depression can be treated professionally, and unless it's a chronic sort of thing, by the end of therapy they'll gradually take you off meds.

Personally I struggle with ADHD, depression, and insomnia too, and I'd rather be on meds and happier than be off them and constantly fighting to stay alive, not being able to help my restlessness and inattention, and having a shit sleep every night. Meds help me function normally. It's kind of our insuline.",throwawaypistacchio,197i29m

56,"In my experience, meds have been the best thing for me when used in tandem with therapy. 

It depends on your individual body, your mental health diagnosis, what meds are available, etc. and it can take a long time for your body to adjust to the drug. Drugs may not work out for everyone, but that doesn't mean they won't for you. If one treatment doesn't work for you, that doesn't mean an alternative won't work. Many of them do have side effects that aren't favorable, but most drugs will have that regardless of what the med is. Some medicines also only work when a secondary treatment is applied (ie a med that requires you to eat a certain way or exercise or therapy, or whathaveyou). Even non-mental health drugs have that. Your doctor or pharmacist can walk you through the process too. 

It's about finding the one where the benefit outweighs the negative. Sometimes what your body responds to changes over time, too. My antidepressant causes me to be exhausted, but I will take having a hard time waking up in the morning over the brain fog, not sleeping at all, rumination, suicidality, not caring to eat, lethargy, lack of interest or motivation, headaches, poor hygiene, etc.. My antidepressant also has a long list of other side effects that I had no idea whether I would get, some that could even worsen symptoms. I also have the highest permitted dose for it bc of the severity and longevity of my depression (over half my life at this point lol). Mine also didn't respond at all or responded negatively to other meds. 

Try it out. Try it in tandem with your current treatments. You may even find that therapy works better after going on them. (Or, you can also see about finding another therapist; sometimes it's not you, it's them. It could also be the type of therapy. I'm personally a fan of CBT). Give your body time to adjust to the meds. Pay attention to any changes. It may even be helpful to journal what you notice so you can show your doctor during follow up appointments. Mental health meds are not always as immediate or exact as something like Tylenol that will kick in an hour, and certain severe disorders that require stronger or more specific medications may merit a lifetime commitment. This isn't a bad thing. A need is simply being met to improve the quality of life.  

Another thing: if/when you start feeling better, don't come off them until you speak with your doctor. The fact that your symptoms have been reduced is a sign it's working. It is not a sign that you've been cured. I think a lot of people who complain may not fully understand what exactly the med is supposed to do, or set an expectation for them based on their experiences with somatic meds. Neosporin is used to prevent bacterial infections that would delay healing of a skin wound. You'll see the direct result in the speed at which the wound heals. Mental health is not the same. It takes paying attention. 

Lastly, if you're nervous about trying meds, that's okay. It's normal. It's change. It's commitment. You may experience things in ways you never expected, or have never experienced at all. That's okay too. And, if ultimately they don't work out for you, you're not obligated to continue that treatment. It's awesome that you're considering this. It's strength to recognize when you need support, and strength to ask for that support. You're not alone in your journey. 

Good luck!!",Ram-brose,1cq56rq

> You just can‚Äôt ethically diagnose someone without having multiple sessions over a length of time.

Is that what psychiatrists are supposed to do? The couple of different psychiatrists I went to just kind of guessed my diagnosis at the end of the first 15 minute conversation and chose random medications for me to try.

If someone has a bad day, they might just need to vent and get unbiased advice. It doesn‚Äôt mean they need to be prescribed anything. Whereas somebody coming in every week saying that they can‚Äôt get out of bed most days could probably benefit from meds. 

I don‚Äôt want to villainize psychiatrists. The world is having a pretty big mental health crisis right now and the doctor to patient ratio is way off. I don‚Äôt blame them for just pushing meds out as a way to quickly find solutions. Plus big pharma thrives on convincing people that they need to be medicated in order to function. 

I‚Äôve gone to multiple psychiatrists and said ‚ÄúI get addicted easily and have a history of suicide attempts‚Äù just to be prescribed a highly addictive med that‚Äôs easy to OD on.

The main thing about dealing with mental health via the internet is that you have to be able to take everything objectively.

I also function at a level that many people would consider satisfactory. I work part time and earn 50k a year, save money, keep my house clean, shower daily etc etc. 

Some people do use depression as an excuse to avoid responsibilities, abuse people around them,  mooch financially off people, and generally be lazy. If people have the option not to do something, many won't. I have had someone who was very lazy sponge off me (ex husband) in the name of depression. Yet I was diagnosed with major depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, OCD, psychosomatic symptoms plus real health issues and I still worked and took care of basic responsibilities. Despite having been in inpatient psychiatric units, nearly dying, etc etc. So because some people use it as an excuse to be lazy, that's where some of the stigma comes from. 

Depression may be an illness, just like my thyroid disease or vertigo I have. But there is still choice - to get up, shower, work, whatever. It's a choice. Depression and various other health issues make that hard, trust me I know. But depression diagnosis should not be viewed as an automatic get out of jail free card where you can ditch all responsibilities and not have anyone pissed off at you or criticizing your lack of discipline. 

Depression for me tends to be a very deep sadness where I cry every day and I can't see the point in anything. It's not an absence of feelings for me, I'm more of a wreck, crying and feeling I'm having a nervous breakdown and will suffocate. It's different to my anxiety in that it feels like sadness and grief and not panicky. I have mininal energy and struggle with all tasks including getting out of bed. I use alcohol to cope. I can't control my thoughts or feelings, but I  can control my actions. I am imperfect but on tge outside, my life does not look stereotypically like a severely depressed person, which is part of why professionals don't/won't help me. Despite my history of not leaving the house for 5 years or living in a psych unit, they feel that because I go to work then I must be okay but I am not okay. You get punished in a way for being high functioning with depression, then have to put up with others claiming depressed people can't do anything or have responsibilities. So people with depression may feel hard done by that people judge them for checking out. But I've checked out completely and also been high functioning.. and I can tell you that people actually do have more compassion for the checked out types than someone who's living a ""normal life"" but drinks 500ml of liquor a day or cries non stop.

They don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to think about how they would kill themselves everyday. They don‚Äôt know the self-hatred. Or the constant existential nihilism that arises whenever something has to be done. They don‚Äôt know; how drug overdoses feel, how the throbbing pressure in your face feels as you tied a noose around your neck, how the coarse sting of bleach feels in the throat and how it leaves you with acid reflux for your whole life, or how you have to plan out your outfit to hide scars rather than how it looks.  Ik some people mean well and try to spread awareness but that in itself is ignorance. Telling people they need to talk to someone like they believe that the person has the ability to do so. And no for some people nothing helps. Nothing. No amount of counselling or medication will ever distract them from the fact that their life up until this point has been so painful that they have no hope for the future of it. People can go round preaching about how they were once depressed and how one day their brain just snapped out of it, maybe because of medication or because they found someone they loved. But really they‚Äôve just bought into the delusion that their whole life isn‚Äôt really meaningless. For some of us we can only drown our pain in materialistic possessions and in our love for others for so long. The fact is love isn‚Äôt real it‚Äôs an ideal. It‚Äôs lust or desire in disguise. Everyone masks it as some irrational power but it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs completely rational and we are just too afraid to admit it because if we do we‚Äôd all realise there‚Äôs nothing for us here. So yeah I‚Äôm 18 and depressed, and have anxiety, PTSD, drug induced psychosis, and also an unbreakable psychological addiction to drugs. Ik exactly why I have depression and it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôve had terrible life experiences, although those probably made it worse, it‚Äôs because I inherited it genetically from two severely depressed parents. It‚Äôs in my brain and I can‚Äôt escape it. I can‚Äôt have it conditioned out of me it‚Äôs basic brain chemistry serotonin, dopamine. Medication could‚Äôve helped though. If only I wasn‚Äôt self medicating years before. Taking ecstasy, weed. Benzos, opiates, alcohol regularly, fuck I even huff fucking deodorant when my supply is dry just because drugs are literally all I have left now. Now my brains even more fucked up and it‚Äôs probably likely I‚Äôve lost in some capacity the ability to feel joy. I have no sex drive, no aspirations, nothing I‚Äôm just living my last days in a frenzy of excess. Distracting myself with material items and drugs I can‚Äôt even afford. I‚Äôve burnt through thousands of ¬£s in the last few months and I don‚Äôt even pay for anything because I live with my parents. I don‚Äôt have a job and I just scrape together what money I can earn from selling drugs to afford drugs. I‚Äôm living my last few days/ weeks and I only have to wait now until the right time. I have a plan. And I‚Äôm slowly coming to terms with the pain of death from my other attempts so my fear is declining.

67,"**Major depressive disorder**

Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal, while others nearly always have symptoms present.

I‚Äôve been through years of therapy CBT along with a whole list of SSRIs and other antidepressants.

83,"Please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm downplaying your pain or anything, I‚Äôm just spitballing here. Professional ketamine treatments are a lot different than using street ketamine, the dosing for therapeutic benefits is very specific and the way it is administered is partially why it is effective. But that may not be the route for you if you‚Äôve done a lot of recreational K. 

Honestly if there isn‚Äôt anything else that can be done why not try ECT...if it doesn‚Äôt work then you can resume with planning. The worst side effect is memory loss, which in your case might not be the worst thing...it might help you forget some of the pain. It literally changes how your brain is wired...please look it up/think about it. TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) is similar in that it is said to change the brain as well but uses magnets instead and it a much less invasive process.

For me CBT never did much...it frustrated me at times even...it was like they wanted me just to change my thinking and be like ‚ÄúOh! Okay, it‚Äôs not so bad!‚Äù. Have you tried DBT...there are free online courses and exercises you can find pretty easily. Here‚Äôs an overview of what it entails. [DBT ](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/dbt-dialectical-behavior-therapy/) It focuses on accepting the reality of your situation and thoughts and how to cope with them, rather than how to change your thoughts...which I found way better and more realistic. 

I used to be addicted to opiates and a mix of other substances, particularly alcohol. I got on a Suboxone program which let me quit with no withdrawal or post-acute withdrawal. I wasn‚Äôt functioning when I wasn‚Äôt self medicating and Suboxone keeps me level, fills my opiate receptors so I don‚Äôt crave them and has naloxone in it so I know if I were to try to get high off another opiate or take too much of it I would get sick. There have been studies done that show that Suboxone could be used successfully to treat the symptoms of treatment resistant depression. [Low dose Suboxone for treatment resistant depression and suicidal behaviour ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121503/#!po=17.5532) [Suboxone off-label use for treatment resistant depression ](http://blumsrewarddeficiencysyndrome.com/ets/articles/v1n1/jrdsas-021-george-kamajian.pdf) 

Have you been ‚Äútested‚Äù for other mental health disorders? Bipolar? Borderline Personality disorder? [Borderline personality disorder symptoms](https://www.psycom.net/depression.central.borderline.html) [Bipolar symptoms ](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-disorder-signs-and-symptoms.htm/) I was misdiagnosed and was recently diagnosed with Bipolar. I hate that it‚Äôs a lifelong illness and the stigma attached to it...but it‚Äôs treated different than depression and the antidepressants I was given had been making my symptoms worse. If antidepressants haven‚Äôt worked for you...again, mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics. Hell CBD oil has worked wonders for a family member with severe depression. 

As for life being repetitive once you get older...I‚Äôm not challenging you, I just want you to know that I was severely suicidal during my teenage years and felt like the rest of my life couldn‚Äôt hold anything much more exciting than what I‚Äôve already done. But here are some of the things I‚Äôve found that have given me hope. Travel...have you traveled? Everywhere? Even if you don‚Äôt think you like travelling there is something amazingly fulfilling about even just getting in a car and driving...anywhere. Somewhere beautiful preferably. If you feel like you‚Äôve experience everything, try going somewhere you wouldn‚Äôt think of...Indonesia, Egypt, Alaska, Iceland. My goal is Tonga...you can swim with motherfucking humpback whales. that‚Äôs too much, try somewhere local. If you are in or near Canada, British Columbia is amazing...beautiful and interesting, you can go and sleep in your car, camp or stay somewhere fancy. Victoria Island, Vancouver, Tofino, Whistler. You can see Orca whales there too! [BC beauty ](https://www.hellobc.com) Banff and Jasper in  Albert are amazing [Banff things to do](https://www.banfflakelouise.com/things-to-do) You can rent ski equipment (have you gone skiing or snowboarding?) or sit by a waterfall, hike in the mountains. 

The top one on my ‚Äúto do‚Äù list is volunteering with Helpx...because travel can be too expensive sometimes. With this all you have to pay for is getting there usually. Basically you choose anywhere in the world you‚Äôd like to visit and they have listings for work in exchange for board and meals. So you could go to Bali, or Canada, or somewhere close to home...stay somewhere for free in exchange for doing some sort of work. Often the jobs are super interesting if you click on any of the travel links, this is the one to click. [Travel and experience your destination for super cheap](https://www.helpx.net/hostlist.asp?host_region=987&network=9) 

Do you like music? Have you seen all of your favourite musicians live? It‚Äôs worth it in my opinion, I‚Äôve gotten to see a few of mine. 

Sometimes when you feel like there is absolutely no point in living, helping someone else can give you meaning. Maybe you‚Äôd like to someday help teenagers get the help they need? That doesn‚Äôt mean going to university for years to get a degree, it could be volunteering with an organization that helps underprivileged youth. If you like animals it could be fostering dogs/cats that would otherwise be put down. It could be volunteering/working at a senior home. Maybe if you try one of the treatments you haven‚Äôt tried yet you might get to a better place mentally and physically you could go to school for addictions counselling, or study psychology to help other people that need it desperately. Suicide and crisis hotlines need volunteers. When I feel like I can‚Äôt life for myself I try to live for someone else. Whether it be my parents, or people I don‚Äôt know that need help. 

From the sounds of your post there‚Äôs one major thing you haven‚Äôt experienced that is worth waiting to...and that‚Äôs waking up without a hangover or in withdrawal and having hope. I‚Äôve had it a few times and it‚Äôs fucking worth it. To stand outside on a sunny day, feel the warmth on your face and feel calm inside. I know it feels impossible now. But right now you seem to have convinced yourself there is no hope or helping you. If you give yourself one more chance, and put everything you have into doing everything you can...then at least after everything you can say you exhausted all of your options. I know it‚Äôs exhausting. I know what it‚Äôs like to have a dysfunctional family, how it feels to wake up and have the first thing that crosses your mind be ‚Äúhow can I get high, what do I have, I need it now‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think I would ever get past that. It took me until I was 25 to and I‚Äôm only 26. 

Again, please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm dismissing your pain. It is valid. Im so sorry you are going through this. There can be hope, but you have to allow yourself to think there is hope. üíï

86,"Thing is I‚Äôm not physically addicted to a single substance. I‚Äôm mentally addicted to not being sober. I‚Äôve done so many different drugs because I get bored quickly and my tolerance builds up to fast for it to be cost effective. Whenever I do anything the first thing I think is, I wish I was high rn. Whenever I go out to a restaurant, I‚Äôll smoke weed cos it‚Äôs better. Whenever I party, I‚Äôll drink till I drop and then pop pingerz or do blow till I wake back up. I‚Äôve tried separating myself from drugs and it‚Äôs all I think about. Even when I try to quit I‚Äôll end up drinking the smoking because everything is just better. In my experience there‚Äôs literally a drug for every occasion. In my GCSE art exams I did ecstasy. If I‚Äôm doing a presentation for class I‚Äôll take like half a xan and a couple shots then maybe also take ecstasy to perk up my energy levels. I can feel my body dying and I‚Äôm only 18. I get headaches nearly everyday even when I‚Äôve been sober for a week I‚Äôll get mild stomach cramps all the time. Mentally I feel like I‚Äôve done as much damage as you can possibly do from drugs. My serotonin is long gone from multiple week long binges of ecstasy. I have HPPD from whatever idek probably 2cb. I have psychosis from chronic abuse of weed and stimulants. Luckily I‚Äôm scared of heroin and shit cos I‚Äôve watched too many documentaries but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I haven‚Äôt considered it. There‚Äôs just no point whatever I do I‚Äôll never be satisfied. Yeah I‚Äôve travelled but I can‚Äôt do that anymore because I‚Äôll just get bored from not being able to get high. Plus because of my PTSD and anxiety I don‚Äôt feel safe anywhere but in my room. I get anxiety when my parents speak to me so leaving the house makes me feel sick on a daily basis unless I smoke weed. I have even started carrying knives and stuff because I‚Äôm afraid for my life when I leave the house. So not only am I paranoid of normal people but I‚Äôm paranoid of teachers and police. I don‚Äôt trust a single person not even my girlfriend. I was convinced that my best friend was trying to steal from me and I was convinced my other friend was trying to manipulate me and control my mind. I can‚Äôt handle shit anymore. There‚Äôs honestly no alternative. My doctor might prescribe diazepam for my anxiety and I‚Äôll just abuse that until I run out and I‚Äôll be back to where I was in a couple days. There‚Äôs honestly no hope for me anymore. Whatever I do everything will continue to get worse. I‚Äôm slowly losing everything I‚Äôve ever loved. 5 members of my family have died in the last four years. My family is barely scraping through financially. I‚Äôve been kicked out of 3 high schools and now I‚Äôm in college and I‚Äôm about to be kicked out again. I‚Äôve got no friends because I don‚Äôt trust anyone. My dad doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about me. My mums too depressed in herself to even recognise that fact that I‚Äôm slowly killing myself. I regularly go months without speaking to my brother because I have no relationship with any of my family anymore because they sent me of to boarding school at a young age where I was beaten up, bullied and abused all the time for three years. Honestly there‚Äôs one person in the whole world that gives a fuck about me and that‚Äôs my girlfriend but I don‚Äôt really love her like that anymore but I‚Äôm just scared to break up with her because her Dad just died a month ago and I want to be there for her but the stress of keeping up a relationship that I don‚Äôt even think I want to be in for nearly a year is making me go insane. I don‚Äôt even know what I want anymore I just need it all to stop and the only things that have ever worked were drugs and now they‚Äôre making everything worse. My only life aspiration is to become famous and rich so I can do more drugs and buy pointless shit but I know that won‚Äôt happen and even if it does I‚Äôm still gonna kill myself anyway because really there‚Äôs no point in life. I‚Äôm not special I‚Äôll never have an impact on anyone‚Äôs life for the better. I‚Äôm so unmotivated to do anything and whenever something bad happens the first thing I think is ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter anyway cos I can just kill myself‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried to get better I really have. I quit drugs for like six months but I was still depressed. If I‚Äôm like this now at the age of 18 imagine the state I‚Äôll be in, in a couple years. I‚Äôll be homeless and then I‚Äôll just kill myself. I may as well just end it now. Weird thing is I don‚Äôt even feel sad anymore. I used to. But now I have realised that the only real option I have is to kill myself. At least then I get to choose how much pain I go through.

0,"So, not related to the question but I don't think your nail is infected. The matrix was probably damaged and that can take time to grow back normally, or it may never grow back normally. It happens. The fungal infection can happen from anything, physical damage and fungal infections can happen together but they're different things. 

That being said, medical neglect is talking about a sustained pattern of refusing to give your kids the medical care that is required for their wellbeing and, well, health. This would be like failing to take your child to regular checkups, refusing to get medications for them, not taking your child to the doctor for a serious injury. 

I'm... not sure this counts as actual medical neglect. She wasn't wrong when she told you it just has to grow out. A dermatologist would've told you the same thing. You can't really do anything for a damaged matrix. The fact you have nail fungus is a separate issue. But nail fungus doesn't put your health at risk. Its a cosmetic issue and it sounds like she might just be uninformed about how to treat it. Fungus can't really be treated OTC. So maybe bring this up to her and tell her seeing a doctor is the best course of action because it'll take about a year until healthy new nails grow in and this is only after you kill the fungus. All it takes is a prescription. 

But yeah, my vote is on no.. this is not medical neglect. Parents sometimes don't make the best decision when it comes to things like this but I don't think this rises to the severity of neglect. I say that as someone who grew up with a mom who refused to take me to the hospital in a potentially life-endangering situation too. 

You absolutely can still be pissed. I probably would be. But even if she took you to the doctor right away, they'd tell you the same thing. Just gotta wait, sometimes these things happen and it sucks.",Similar-Hold-3646,18flwzc
1,Thank you for this. I had no idea there was a difference between just physical damage and a fungal infection.

I thought it was a fungal infection, asked my derm and turns out, I just kept damaging the nail matrix by wearing god awful shoes. It happens :/ feet help us stand, they're supposed to be at least a little ugly lol

I would personally consider refusal to get your child adequate mental health treatment as medical neglect however. My mom just did a mixture of both.

If you're old enough to take yourself, I highly recommend finding a cosmetic and medical dermatologist so they can look at your problem. If there is a fungus issue its as simple as a topical prescription or even laser they can do in office. If its not, I'm sure they can recommend treatments. There are actually a ton of nail-specific issues with full blown names. I'm positive you'll be able to get it all worked out",Similar-Hold-3646,18flwzc

0,"I understand your concern about long-term use of the drug.

It's very important for you to talk about this with your doctor. If you decide to stop using the drug, the doctor can advise you about the best way to quit, and this is very important. Quitting too quickly can have a very bad result.

I'll mention a few things about anxiety treatments. It may be that something here is unfamiliar to you.

Slow breathing works in the sense that it affects the parts of our systems that make us feel nervous, but the feeling of security we get from it comes and goes.

One way to get more from breath work is the habit of responding to moments of stress by breathing slowly. Another way is using the slow breathing rate to deal with thoughts that bother us. I'll say more about that.

Although self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.

In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.

When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.

One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.

Don't make mountains out of molehills.

Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.

The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.

Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

Many people say that mindfulness is helpful. Awareness of changes in your stress level during the day prompts you to use coping methods like slow breathing. 

Mindfulness apps like Headspace are very popular. Headspace has a free Intro you can use over and over. Mindful Life Project is easy to use and free.",RWPossum,18zeugv

I will say that what you're describing sounds very much like what depression does to you.  I didn't take any medication until I was 23, and even then it was for a short time and I didn't start again until about 3 years so when I was 34 -- all this to say I would not imagine that I have experienced effects from long term medication use, but I have experienced exactly what you're describing as I have aged.

Given your history of ADHD, anxiety, and the recent highly stressful period, it's plausible that this could be a stress-related manifestation. However, your family history and personal mental health context suggest it would be wise to seek a professional opinion to better understand what's happening. A psychiatrist, given their medical background, might be the most comprehensive starting point. They can assess the situation from both a neurological and psychological perspective, considering your ADHD medication and how it interplays with your symptoms.

ADHD expert and author Dr. Russell Barkley has a number of YouTube videos. You can  check Barkley‚Äôs impressive credentials at his Wikipedia article. The Adult ADHD Toolkit by Tony Rostane (co-author) - a CBT approach. Also, advocacy and support groups such as CHADD can be helpful. A relationship between ADHD and insomnia has been found, and treatment with the supplement melatonin has been shown to help.

Psychiatric Times has an article about a brief version of DBT called DBT Skills Training. It has been shown to help with ADHD.

Relaxation with the traditional Asian methods can help with ADHD. Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a 3-part program of mind-body methods - slow breathing, meditation, and slow body movement such as tai chi exercise, which you can learn with one or two beginner‚Äôs videos on YouTube. Incorporate these into your daily life. Be aware of changes in mood and respond mindfully, aware of your breathing. 

Mindfulness apps like Headspace and Calm are very popular. The most popular is Headspace, which has a free Intro you can use over and over. Mindful Life Project is very good and it's free.

People are often frustrated with meditation. Here‚Äôs a simple meditation for beginners. The video tells  you about Brown and Gerbarg‚Äôs breathing exercise -

0,"You are a sensitive person. Medication will never address the roots of the reasons why you got to the point of depression. 
You went through many emotions before you got to depression.  But you have never stop to listen. And to try to understand. 

When we feel depressed it actually means that we are compressing. We are going within. Because we figure out that the answers that we have been asking have not been answered  out there. We intuitively know that the answers are not out there. 

You are searching for yourself and for the meaning that you give to your life. Life has no meaning. We give to it whatever meaning we want to. If you are thriving, then you have found a meaning that serves you. 

I feel like you need to research on a more spiritual level. It is not religious. It is about researching on deeper matters.

You are going within. Don't give this time a negative meaning. It is part of life. You just have never really addressed this, maybe because most people do think that being depressed is a negative thing. 
So now you condemn yourself because you are not what you ""supposed "" to be.

We are always growing,  evolving, and becoming more. We will always see things we dont like. That way, we can at least know what we do like.

You are comparing yourself to other people.  But most people are lying, running away from their feelings and popping pills to numb their emotions. 

Our emotions are our guiding system. If you wouldn't feel that the fire burns and it feels bad, you would always burn yourself. 

Same things about our emotions.  I think you could benefit a lot from the book ""Letting Go"" by David Hawkins.  Try also Julien Himself, on youtube. You may want to give a try to Dr. Joe Dispenza and Dr. Gabor Mat√©. Both you can find on youtube.  Research on neuroscience if it interests you. Research about your reticular activating system, RAS. If you want a more spiritual path, research about energy healing, energy blockages, energy centers etc..see where this will take you.
There are many ways, many paths. Start with whatever resonantes with you. 
You can heal yourself.  I have done it. I am a very sensitive person, too. I have been through hard times, too. 

Still, I have learned to understand myself and heal myself by myself. 
I wish you well.",chauane,16pw38n

7,"I‚Äôm no doctor but I do have experience with depression. I‚Äôve tried many medications over the years for what I‚Äôve always been told was depression. I tried Lexapro, Paxil, Wellbutrin, and I‚Äôm sure others I don‚Äôt remember. None of them made me feel ‚Äúgood‚Äù . They numbed me emotionally and made me extremely fatigued. I was told as a teen that I was a totally different person on one of them, but not in a good way. Finally in my mid 30‚Äôs I found something that worked for me. Effexor was the one medication that I finally felt like myself on. It takes time to find what is right for you, but the end result is worth the effort to find what works. Imagine coming out of the fog, beginning to breathe deeply and become interested in things and smile again. I noticed mine was finally working when I started to become more creative again and it was becoming easier to get out of bed each day. 

Sometimes life, the people in our lives and some circumstances and major events will put us in a dark place temporarily. Sometimes we don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre depressed. The latter definitely requires medication IMO. The former requires courage to change your circumstances. 

I am bad about medicating myself to deal with anxiety caused by people in my life that I should be sending down the road kicking rocks. I am a very soft, sensitive person which is a magnet for narcissists. Make sure you surround yourself with loving, encouraging people and not overly critical, belittling, narcissistic assholes who are secretly enjoying watching you suffer. 

‚ÄúBefore you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure you are not, in fact, surrounded by assholes.‚Äù - Sigmund Freud

When I moved out at 18yrs and realized how the world was, I couldn't believe there was a god somewhere, almighty,  but still the world was the way it was kids dying of hunger,wars, abused etc..

I didn't want to believe anything.  I didn't want to hear or wanted anyone talking to me about this kind of stuff. I became an atheist.  But I have never stopped searching. I think that's a similar thing happening to you.

All that I wanted to give you was ideas so you see for yourself where it leads you. You can find what resonates with you. As long as it doesn't make perfect sense,  and as long as it doesn't fit well, you didn't find the truth.  Your truth.  There are many sides of truth. We can only see from our singular perspective. We transcend our own limitations when we can see that other people's sides of the truth can be valid, can teach us something, and can be beneficial. 


The truth is never out there. Not religious or any other kind of teaching will give you the truth. 
It is within you. I honestly feel that if you believe the truth is out there, it is based on fear, and if you are honest with yourself, that fear based truth doesn't truly resonates from within ..so it is can't be the truth. 
The truth will make perfect sense, and you will feel it inside of you like you have always known that. You won't believe it because you are afraid of what might happen to you if you don't. 
Most people believe what they believe out of fear of something else.

It is good that you feel the way you feel. That you don't just take whatever is said to heart and make yourself blind without questioning . Keep on searching, though.  Try the book  ""Letting Go"", it's perfect because it is exactly not religious or spiritual.  
You can find it in pdf. This will help you understand your emotions.  I think it is so important to understand our emotions and know how to deal with ourselves.  It is a favor for the world when we learn to take care of ourselves.  We are making a difference when we heal ourselves. 
Julien Himself  talks a lot of similar things. Gabor Mat√© is a physician.  Joe Dispenza is a scientist.  These are just for your emotional well-being.  I believe you can be truly happy without outside sources or medicine.

None of my relationships have ever been the same afterward though. You come to realize that your so called friends no longer like you when you start setting boundaries.

1,"It's highly unlikely you would be. Like, wildly unlikely, at least in the US. No state allows it for past harm, so even if a doctor wildly overreacted and tried to pull something the psych ward staff would send someone with old scars home. 

I'll say that I recently went to get an injury that I went a little too far with checked out and the doctor was great about it. Asked me to follow up for physical healing, confirmed I see a therapist and that they're aware, and moved on. My therapist, meanwhile, doesn't even really try to stop me with SH (offers to help me stop, but doesn't force the issue) and usually won't even push me to go voluntary for active SI since I'll safety plan.

I'll go further and say that my sister has been deeply psychotic for 6 months with little ability cognitively to meet her own basic needs, blown her entire life up, often confused, and getting in legal trouble and they can't do more than a 24 hour hold for assessing with her.

All that to say, it's gotten a LOT harder in recent times to involuntarily commit someone (varying state to state) and the line is an incredibly far distance from where you are at.

I have some suggestions for memory, but first I want to mention something that relates to substance abuse and mood disorders. Relaxation is good for anxiety. It eases the symptoms of depression. It makes it easier for us to deal with thoughts that bother us.  
  
A Yale medical journal says that the best things for avoiding relapse from addiction are relaxation with traditional Asian methods and cognitive therapy.  
  
The Asian method with the best evidence is slow breathing. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

Always focus on adding more instead of restricting. If sugar is a coping tool, give yourself grace if you rely on it as you increase your healthy food

0,"I got put on SSRI's when I was 14 or 15 and it made such a big difference for me. I definitely dealt with side-effects like dry-mouth and dizziness, but they went away after the first two weeks (which is what is supposed to happen). Only long-term side effect i had was that I would overheat very easily in the sun/was very prone to dehydration. 

If we were to put mood on a scale from -10 (exhausted/actively suicidal) to 10 (energetic/content) id say that in my depressed state I'd wake up everyday at around a -8. I'd barely have enough energy to walk my dog and get ready for the day, I always felt down, and my suicidal thoughts would be teetering between passive and active. It was unspeakably difficult for me to get what I needed from mental health treatments, social connections, and routines, because I'd started every single day with a fairly extreme bias towards suicide and had to put in a lot of work just to get closer to feeling neutral. It felt like all my days were pre-determined to be bad unless I put in extraordinary amounts of effort to push it to maybe a 0 before the day ended. With SSRI's I'd wake up everyday at a 0. The day was truly in my own hands and any effort I would put in to making my day more positive had an almost immediate result on my mood. Treatments started working a lot better because I was finally In a headspace where I had the energy and outlook to do the work, I was able to consistently have days in the 6-10 range (with the right routines and thought processes), and I felt much more comfortable in social situations. I had tried many medications beforehand, but the ssri I eventually landed on is what I have to believe antidepressants are supposed to feel like. It didnt keep my in a perpetual good mood or make me feel consistently happy or anything, but It's ability to make each day start at a 0 was life-changing for me. 

 Unfortunately at 20 I had to go off of them as they had stopped working for me, but that was expected since brains change so much between 14 and 20. They definitely changed my life for the better though, and I probably wouldn't be here today without SSRI'S.

Hope that helps!",PrimordialRoomba,17wa0jp

1,"Unfortunately, that can be one of the side effects in Wellbutrin. So you probably find yourself stuck in between ""effective dose but bad side effects"" and ""no major side effects but dose is not as effective as I'd like.""

Question- what else are you doing to address your mental health besides taking the Wellbutrin? Taking a medication for something like PTSD/anxiety/depression can be helpful in taking the edge off, so to speak, but it will not make the underlying concerns that spark those symptoms go away.

Perhaps while you are working with your doctor to figure out an appropriate dosage, I would take a look at some other things you can do to help with the symptoms. That might be coping skills, proper diet and exercise, adequate sleep, etc. That can also include seeing a counselor or attending a support group. Stuff like that.

I would follow what your doctor recommended and schedule a follow-up appointment with them to address your concerns about the Wellbutrin dosage. Perhaps they may be able to recommend an alternative dosage or perhaps a different anti-depressant that you may be able to tolerate better.

0,"BPD/EUPD shouldn't be considered a catch-all for anyone with toxic behaviours. It's a diagnosis with specific criteria and people who have it may well have been through dreadful trauma. Sadly this perception of the term can create a lot of stigma that can cause people some serious problems. I know a few who've been treated really badly so I think it's important to flag this. 

The kind of toxic behaviours you're describing might be part of wider mental health issues, but they could also be cultural (i.e. these people are just louder or more comfortable with arguments than you are) or caused by environmental factors you're not seeing (such as severe stress at work, affairs you haven't been told about etc). Where they are part of mental health issues you would need quite a lot of context to pinpoint what diagnosis would be most appropriate. What you're describing could be part of a PD (not just BPD but ASPD or NPD for example), but you might also see it if someone was experiencing psychosis or some anxiety based illnesses. You might also want to consider overlap with neurodivergence and the overload that can come from that. 

Personality disorders are relatively common - I've just had a quick Google and it looks like about 8-11% of the population worldwide is likely to have a PD. For comparison, rates for Schizophrenia are under 1%. A rate of around 1 in 10 people means that you will almost certainly know some people with PDs, but they won't all present like this. If you're meeting lots of people like this my guess is some of it will be other things, not just mental illness. 

Lastly, people can have elements of a mental illness without meeting the criteria for a full diagnosis, particularly if they have family members with an illness. You might be seeing people who've just learnt really bad behaviours for relationships but are otherwise fine. 

Mostly likely it's a mix of all of the above. Clinical definitions would depend on the individual. 

I hope that helps!",SiskinLanding,17chc03

2,"Sertraline numbed my skin physically after taking it for only 6 days last week. I was scared so I stopped it, along with the bupropion that I was also taking. The reason I was prescribed antidepressants was to get me to have real feelings, not to make me numb or shut down my nervous system.

I always know what emotions I'm having, what I'm thinking about that's putting me in a mood, but I hardly ever have a physical feeling unless it's from expressing an emotion by crying or laughing, then I feel my body doing that. Also when I was taking paroxetine (Paxil) in some past years, I seemed to lose even some of the little idea I had of when I was having uncomfortable emotions, so nothing was bothering me. That wasn't good for social interaction because I could just go and do any stupid thing I thought I wanted to do without feeling much, while sometimes I was actually getting a mood that other people could see but I couldn't feel myself.

If you want a sleep aid and a medication that's calming, it would probably be a good idea to try melatonin, because melatonin is supposed to produced by the body anyway to make you sleepy. So if you're not getting sleepy, maybe it's because your body doesn't have enough. It's possible to be groggy in the morning if you take more than one gram of melatonin, because that's a high dose, but many melatonin supplements are in high doses like that.
