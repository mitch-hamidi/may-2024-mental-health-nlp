0,"I would recommend giving it a try. I was gifted a DBT workbook and had little context as to how to use it so I think it’s great that you’re looking into it more. It is helpful to have some help working through the concepts. You can find videos on line that introduce you to some of the key concepts and skills. However, if available near you and affordable for you, try a group therapy or class on DBT skills. Perhaps an IOP program that is part time or has other offerings is an option. I also recommend seeing a therapist that uses DBT in treatment. I went to a DBT therapist through a university hospital and we solely focused on skill building and I got so much more out of it.",Gerianne19321932,1c0byzw

1,"What parts of mindfulness are you struggling with? For me, the idea of meditating made me want to jump out of my skin and scream. Buuuut, grounding exercices really helped in a panic, and stretching was a good way of getting to the present by just being in the moment with my body and mind.",swild89,12dfbmw
2,"First, I want to say that DBT is backed by solid evidence. It was better than the other treatment for BPD in 8 studies (source - book by Roemer and Orsillo).  
  
One way to look at mindfulness is that it's just awareness. Some people make this look like it's more complicated than it really is.  
  
Just being careful in what you do is a kind of mindfulness. The teachers will sometimes tell people to do some common household task like washing and drying the dishes, paying careful attention to the feelings in your hands and the sound of the water. You can look up ""grounding exercises"" and find other things like that.  
  
Maybe if you talk about this with your therapist you can get some good advice about this.  
  
Another thing is that DBT has very useful methods for coping in a moment of crisis, when you think you might hurt yourself. Above all, know those methods. It's very simple things like paced breathing and simple distractions, whatever changes your mood like your favorite music or a funny video.  
  
DBT paced breathing   
  
  
This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.",RWPossum,12dfbmw

4,"Specifically wise mind right now and the breathing exercises. Just trying to become one with your body i guess. Meditation isn’t for me either. I’m fine with observing and describing what I’m seeing or feeling, but it doesn’t click with me somehow. Bc how is that going to help me get out of my mind, since my mind is then running with all these thoughts that may upset me, you know? What kind of grounding exercises did you do? Bc I don’t think we’ve covered that yet.",psychobreathless,12dfbmw
5,"Grounding is getting you back to the present here and now moment, works when you’re too in your head or feeling disconnected (like when dissociating or panicking). it can be sometimes as simple as a cold shower/splash of water on the face. There’s the 54321 technique (https://www.choosingtherapy.com/54321-method/). 

Wise mind is a tough concept, don’t be too hard on yourself with wrapping your head around that one, that’s time and practice with your therapist analyzing tough situations and getting a grasp on how to apply it

There’s also the subreddit r/dbtselfhelp that’s got people also struggling if you’re ever interested:)",swild89,12dfbmw

DBT was created for those with BPD but is now being used for people with different diagnoses and symptoms.

""The available research suggests that DBT skills training is a critical component and mechanism of action in DBT and can be effective as a stand-alone or adjunctive intervention for a variety of conditions. The strongest evidence exists for brief DBT skills training as a stand-alone intervention for binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa. In addition, moderate evidence exists for the efficacy of brief DBT skills training as an adjunctive intervention to antidepressant medication for individuals with MDD, as well as a stand-alone intervention for ADHD. Two trials have shown promising results for DBT skills training for borderline personality disorder, but the findings require replication because of the notable differences between trials in treatment length, the use of adjunctive treatment components, and the severity of illness.""",RWPossum,18mxz8z

Honestly, I hate the group format. I struggle with that, and get very on edge for the 2 hours I'm in group, but even my dislike for that has been helpful because its forcing me to get comfortable with things I don't like, or radical acceptance, if you will.

I try and have as many as I can, for I also find, and I can obviously only speak for myself, that not all of the tools work in all of the situations.  By having a lot of them, I can quickly switch between them until I find a helpful one.

I'm not perfect at it.  Not by any means.  It takes practice.  And I can still, and sometimes do, fly off the handle and stomp around and act like a two year old.  This happens far less often than it used to, however, and when it DOES happen, I find I can use my DBT skills to re-center faster.  No, I'm not perfect at it, by any means- but I'm getting better, which, to be honest, in some ways, simply makes my heart soar.  Those around me don't get it; they say thing like ""yskoty's finally growing up,"" and ""what do you want, a medal?""

Radical Acceptance - Marsha Linehan and also Tara Brach

Gratitude Flow - is very very similar to Tonglen meditation

and the concept of being ""squeezed"" and dealing with the unbearableness comes from Trungpa Rinpoche, which Pema Chodron credits her master with.

I'm all for people doing their own edit of things in a way that might speak to a more diverse audience, but damn put a visual footnote or something in there.

I've been in therapy for the past 17 years, working with DBT and CBT for at least the past 15. I've done literally every worksheet in the book, yet the concept of Radical Acceptance never quite landed until I heard it broken down by Phil Stutz in his Netflix doc, and I think that's the point of *Stutz,* to offer people a new perspective and tools for dealing with day-to-day life.

I absolutely appreciate the sentiment of defending the founder of DBT from being plagiarized by a white man. However, 1. the basic idea of Radical Acceptance is inherently Buddhist (which I think Linehan would readily admit as a practitioner of Zen Buddhism — plus, if we're giving attributions, Carl Rogers also contributed) 2. DBT as a whole is already third-wave CBT, and 3. Stutz's ideas aren't completely ""original,"" (e.g. I don't think ""the Shadow"" or ""Grateful Flow"" are fabrications of Stutz's, nor do I think he's so arrogant as to believe any of them came to him out of thin air).

My point is that nothing comes from nothing and that this film wasn't made by Stutz in order to promote himself or his ideas. Jonah Hill says he made the movie in order to share tools that helped him with the general public, which I think he succeeded in doing.",Serious-Yam6730,yxb95c

Most psychotherapies inevitably have some overlap and ""cherry pick"" whether intentionally or not.  I saw common threads e.g. - reversal of desire was comparable to Linehan's Opposite to Emotion and ACT with taking committed action.    There were also some elements that were novel to me.  There's some wonderful alchemy of readiness and coming upon an approach that resonates with each person - I enjoyed the documentary and plan to watch it again.",KfromCanada,yxb95c

Agee with this point. I found the repackaging of many of these Buddhist (among other) concepts to be refreshing. In my opinion, putting it all together in such simplistic terms and in one holistic package makes it all very accessible and actionable.

I also have to point out: the Active Love tool has lots of parallels with Metta/Loving Kindness. The way Stutz describes the tool, both in the documentary and in his book, reminded me of a Loving Kindness meditation in Jack Kornfield’s “No Time Like the Present.” 

The way I see it, Jack, Tara, (etc.) have all repackaged eastern ideas and added additional concepts to make them more accessible to the west. Stutz’s unique way of doing it with the tools + therapy is just another way to get through to people who are struggling. And it seems pretty effective to me. 

I have to admit, after years of psychotherapy (with a Jung + Buddhist slant) meditation, doing my own personal reading about psychology and Buddhism, and having a Catholic upbringing (some of which I’m recovering from)… I was taking lots of notes.

In a true DBT model, skills group should be hyper focused on teaching DBT skills via the DBT modules and be highly structured. Personal sharing should be limited (that’s for individual therapy) and focused on the skill at hand.

1,"I'm not officially diagnosed but recently I've had a strong suspicion that I'm autistic after many years of confusion about what my 'deal' is. I've been seeing my therapist for a few years whose main modality is DBT, so it's woven into our sessions and I also attended one of her DBT skills groups. For me, it helped tremendously to resist black and white thinking, have clear frameworks for conflict resolution and self assertion, self soothing and emotion regulation, building a life worth living, and recognizing that two (or more) conflicting ideas can be true at the same time. There are many more good things DBT covers, but those spring to mind. 

Even though we had no idea I might be autistic, just sensitive with anger management problems (lol), looking back now, learning those skills straight up changed my life. Personally I think they're super applicable to the challenges that autistic people deal with.

What are your thoughts on DBT? Are you thinking about joining a skills group? I'm curious about what accommodations for autism might look like and what comes to mind when you think of that.",rubykins,t88osc

Most times I would come home and just cry for ages because it was heavy shit and non-stop content so you could really understand it. We had homework tasks so each week we reflected on the previous week’s learnings and that helped retain a lot of information.

I’m a very passive person but I felt like some of the skills they taught were just a band aid at the time and didn’t really deal with the issue.

When I finished the program, I struggled to remember to use the skills and when I did it felt clunky and forced. But like the skill you’ll learn, mastery, it’s about practicing in small amounts.

I can honestly say that I use the skills every day, not all but majority across various situations and they come naturally. It’s not usually until later that I’m like ‘oh I didn’t cry about that’.

1,"It sounds like you’re taking every step you can to address your daughter’s safety and well-being. Keep in mind that Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) may be exhausting for her at first, so make the best use of the Family Therapy and Parent Group sessions to raise any questions or concerns.

You may also want to speak with her psychiatrist and therapist to discuss her self harm and IOP admission if you haven’t done so already. Continuation of care will help make her transition into and out of IOP smoother. It will also help with follow up care as needed.

Regarding when to start IOP, I’d recommend sooner rather than later, especially if she has recently self harmed. Breaking self harm habits is a difficult process, and not being aware of healthier coping techniques increases the chances of relapse.

Best wishes, and I’m glad you’re supporting your daughter’s recovery as a family.",DontBrainMyDamage,t24w0j
2,"Healthcare professional with a few thoughts:

- Is the IOP for teenagers only or also includes adults? I might have some general concerns if it's the latter. 

- How frequent is/was the self-harm? 1x ever versus 1x every month versus 1x/day is quite important. Has it stopped since starting Lexapro and/or receiving more direct care for it? Just reduced? Staying the same? If it's already reducing while doing regular outpatient, it might make sense to stay the course compared to the risk of missing school, socialization, etc. 

- DBT is helpful when emotional dysregualtion is the root cause of behaviors such as self-harm. DBT skills can still help everybody but if there are other more salient root causes of her self harm and suicidality, it might not be the best fit, especially given the cost of not attending school and missing out on something fun like a vacation, which can be great for one's and 'life worth living goals' which DBT is ultimately aiming to help people realize. 

- Even if not DBT focused, family therapy if everybody (especially your daughter) is on board can be really fantastic. Family dynamics, how your daughter feels like she fits into the system, and parent training can be super valuable.",randomlygeneratedadv,t24w0j
3,"The only problem that I am seeing with it, is that she will be going into a program but without a clear diagnosis. Self harm and suicidal thoughts usually comes from a serious mental illness such as ptsd, borderline disorder, bipolar disorder…. If you do not find the source of the behavior, the program might not be helpful at all. My sister is borderline disorder, she was sent to 2 different programs when she was a teen and they never worked. As soon as she would be out of there, and therapist stopped seeing her, the behaviors came right back and it hurt her for a long time. She only got her borderline disorder diagnosis in her late 20’s but she feels like she ruined her 20’s since borderline disorder is all about self sabotage in a way. She is adhd and borderline now, medicated and followed for the right disorders and now she stopped cutting for real and she isn’t suicidal anymore and she isn’t feeling a void deep inside of her that she feels forced to fill all the time. Those are all symptoms of it and now they are handled. Adhd loves to co-exist with other disorders. I’m adhd bipolar, mom is adhd bipolar, dad is adhd with emotional dependency issues, my best friend, he’s adhd with general anxiety disorder and that’s a mess. It’s my opinion that if she is cutting and having suicidal thoughts, it’s not just adhd.  Once you find the source, those programs can be absolutely vital to remission, but without the source of the issue, it’s really just throwing stuff at a wall until something sticks and that something could be anything.",,t24w0j

There may be unintentional things within the family environment/dynamics that can be negatively impacting your kids (all environments have these) but they may be more 'sensitive', which can contribute to self-harm and other difficulties. 

One possible option is that if things are more stable now for your daughter to consider IOP in the summer. If she is genuinely feeling better (and her healthcare providers agree), getting back into her routine and feeling like she can participate more in school/socially can do wonders for shaping the expectation that one can struggle with mental health, get help, and actively work towards being better (rather than needing to interrupt life for care). 

But sometimes life does need to be interrupted even with heavy costs in order to work towards recovery. 

Again this is just food for thought and Internet advice is worth infinitely less than actual professional recommendations from clinicians who are working with her and hopefully have an accurate and balanced view of her care. Good luck!",randomlygeneratedadv,t24w0j

1,"I haven't done group DBT, but my therapist gave me a DBT workbook which we work on together. DBT is essentially learning skills to help you cope with intense emotions, negative thinking, unhealthy coping mechanisms etc. The basic idea is that you're striving for something called ""wise mind."" Wise mind is when you're listening to both your logical and emotional sides and making balanced decisions/regulating your emotions, instead of being purely logical or purely emotional. The specific skills covered in this workbook are mindfulness, interpersonal skills, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance. All of which I've found to be very very helpful!! 

So basically it's not all about coping skills, but that is a MAJOR part of it because in order to unpack whatever issues you're dealing with, you have to have a certain level of emotional regulation and distress tolerance, especially when it comes to trauma. If you don't have the skills to regulate your emotions, oftentimes talking about your past traumas can retraumatize you instead of being a healing experience. So DBT can definitely help you unpack your issues and move forward. I wish you the best!",uneedamultipass,c51ljs

I know it sucks how expensive DBT/ therapy in general can be but you can always ask for a super bill to send to your insurance if you have a PPO, and it can be partially covered. 

I’m sorry I can’t be more help. I was lucky that I’m young enough for my parents to cover the therapy for me, but we did a lot a research to find the best place. 

If you find a place/person you like, I recommend asking if you can come see the facility/location of meetings and ask for a quick sit down chat with the therapists that will be teaching the program. This definitely gave me the information I needed to make a fully informed decision!!

0,"I recently got back from a residential program that I feel made incredible changes for me. Every residential is different, but at mine, these were some of the rules. 

Clothing: anything as long as it doesn’t have drug/alcohol/ed related stuff on it. Most people wore sweats and leggings. All about comfort!
Journals/Art Stuff/iPad drawing: journals are allowed, and they encourage you to limit that, just because it could lead to written rumination. But it’s still your choice. Art stuff is allowed. On the unit you can do lots of arts and crafts. Stuff like paint would have to only be used in the art room and they have plenty there already. I know people have brought crafts like origami, cross stitch/embroidery, diamond painting, coloring books, knitting/crochet, drawing and more. It’s funny you mention the iPad because I recently got into drawing on that and asked to bring it. I talked to my therapist there and explained I wanted my iPad just for drawing. They were able to block the other apps like iMessages. I was able to have it any time which was awesome. 

We have DBT and CBT groups every week day. I learned so much. 

Not going to lie, the food wasn’t great. They had a menu every week you can check and request a sandwich or salad instead. Otherwise I had cereal for other meals. Overall, it was okay to deal with. They do have a dietitian who people talk to if they are SUPER picky, vegan, allergies or ed. They would be able to get other meals planned out. 

No bed bugs. 
You can definitely get enough sleep. 

No specific toiletries, but you can’t have anything that has alcohol in the first 3 ingredients. Many conditioners do. You are able to check them out right before your shower and then return it. Other toiletries can be kept in your room. You are only allowed electric razors. One of the staff has to watch you shave at first until they know you can be safe. Many of the girls waited to shave until then. We weren’t judging if others were a bit hairy lol 

We were allowed to have our phones in the evening until bed. And on weekends we had some time during the day. They block all social media and your camera. They also have iPads that you can use to FaceTime or Skype people back home

This facility was all the way across the country for me and it was worth it. 

All facilities are different, so I don’t know what their rules are.

It’s worth it even though i know it’s scary. I had so much anxiety about going and it was okay. The work was tough, but that’s what we need to get better. I didn’t find it traumatizing at all, just tough but manageable.",OrdinaryPatience,i9cu3y

1,"Sure, there are ways to treat your anxiety with little to no work. Its extremely expensive, time consuming, doesn't work long term, will make you worse in the long run if it doesn't kill you, will damage your cognitive function for the rest of your life, will stop your emotional growth, and all in all will just make your symptoms worse. Oh, and its illegal in most places. So, you probably don't want to take that route.

There are no easy fixes for mental health. Its something you have to fight actively and consistently. And while you can grow out of symptoms eventually, thats usually done by doing extensive DBT or CBT. Its not easy, but its 100% worth it.

I've been actively working on my mental health for the last 6 years, and I'm finally starting to feel somewhat normal. I can't explain how good it feels to have a panic attack start to come on and you avoid it by using coping skills you've learned. But no one can do that for you. People can show you tools and how to use them, but nobody can use them for you.

Try out the DBT. Find the will to get through it. Force yourself. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. The alternatives aren't pretty",hydropillz,ihw8m1

Yeah, exercise is a weak point of mine as well. Starting something new won't be easy, but it will be worth it. When I started getting treatment I didn't want to either.

Once I started getting treatment I realized that I had symptoms for ten years prior. I wish I had someone to encourage me to go sooner.

9,"Sorry for the late reply, it has been a day.

So, throughout the past few years I have done a combination of medications, CBT, NA, and most recently, peer support.

So medication you already get, you're on some. It helps, but not enough on its own to make a giant difference.

CBT has been the biggest game changer for me. It taught me how to analyze my negative thoughts, realize why I had panic attacks, and how to avoid those negative or anxious thoughts. Basically, its a way to train your mind to be less... everything? I dunno. Saying it gets rid of negative thoughts isn't really true. It doesn't turn you into a shiney happy person, but it does make it easier to deal with whatever is in your mind that you don't want there. It is kinda like kung fu for thoughts.

NA (narcotics anonymous) helped me get clean. A few years back, my dad died and I started using drugs because I didn't want to deal with my emotions. NA just gave me the tools to stay sober.

Peer support is my job. Basically, I'm someone that has gone through mental health treatment as well as drug recovery. I wander around the clinic, give people advice if they need it, talk people through things if their therapist isn't around, etc. Basically, I'm there so the councilors can point and go, ""See? That's what recovery looks like. It is possible. Don't lose hope."" The reason I include this in my treatment history is because helping people on a regular basis has helped me stay stable and get through really rough patches.

Like I said to you before, it won't be easy, but it will be worth it. And, if you ever need help, someone to talk to, advice, motivation, or someone to just complain to, you can always DM me.",hydropillz,ihw8m1

&#x200B;

I've done some CBT on my own with the book ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns and other online do-it-yourself type resources. I think it's incredibly helpful and really helped me look at my thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in a different light. 

&#x200B;

I highly recommend it. ",soflogator,amxsk3
1,I work at a child and adolescent psychiatric hospital and a lot of our adolescents seem to like DBT a lot more than some of our other groups. ,brina96,amxsk3
2,"DBT is proven to be very effective, especially with specific diagnoses. The concepts are logical, and honestly do work, but it all requires work.

&#x200B;

The way I think about it is that CBT is focused around self-awareness most of the time, and that it tries to unravel all the mental and emotional tangles we inherit from our experiences. DBT has an extra step in it, because there are many of us who struggle to get enough control to even be able to think about the tangles at all, let alone try to tackle the immense displeasure of untangling them. It's not an easy answer, but it is an effective answer. It also requires a lot of work, but it does indeed work. For instance, disorders which deal with high emotional variability (like Borderline Personality Disorder - which I have) benefit greatly from DBT, and through it, many report improvements so drastic that they eventually no longer meet criteria for their diagnosis - which is as close to a cure as they come.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Yes, it works for a lot of people in fairly diverse circumstances, but it does require work and consistency to implement. ",shuttyt,amxsk3

1,"That’s a hard decision isn’t it. Pros and cons for both. I found DBT helpful and was able to do it outpatient. Mine was an intensive compressed course and I learned great skills for managing intense emotions. There are skills while in the middle of intense emotions and skills when things arent as intense so you can get a better handle on emotions. Great skills. Is there an option to attend DBT therapy support groups if you can’t get DBT outside therapy?

For me, good mental health comes first because I can’t do much without good mental health. And sounds like both options are for doing this. Wish I could tell you which one to choose.

I’m not sure how much time will be spent learning DBT skills in your program. I spent about 4 hours a day learning skills and also some time with a DBT therapist one on one. It was around a couple months. I went home in the afternoons but it was hard for me to work at the same time after experiencing all my feelings and using my brain power to learn everything. So I took a leave of absence from my job. 

If you do the inpatient DBT one, maybe think of it more as a retreat to learn how to heal rather than the locked up aspect. Time devoted to yourself. Like a meditation retreat. And if you do the outside therapy choice, factor in that you’ll be processing emotions and that can take energy to do. I don’t know how intense your job training is and how flexible it is with your therapy appointments. 

And I understand not wanting to be away from your boyfriend. Do they allow you to use video yo talk to your boyfriend and friends? There are also people you may meet that can help support you. I found fellow patients very helpful in giving me someone to talk to that understood what I was going through and that helped me a lot. 

And I understand wanting to get better. And it is hard isn’t it to judge what state you are in. 

Wish I could help you further. I don’t know how nice the inpatient place is. Some are better than others. And I don’t know the type of outside therapy you would be getting and whether youve had that that experience before and if it helped you. 

There is a pro con list for your mind and a pro con list for your gut feelings. And a pro con list on how it could help in the long run and not just short term. And I don’t know what your financial situation is. I’m in the US, so it’s different. But I believe debt for self improvement is good debt. Like getting an education or investing in job or life skills. 

Sorry you’ve been struggling for awhile. I hope either decision gives you relief. And if it doesn’t , that you can have the opportunity to try the other choice or a new choice.",modular-displacement,rx9bg7
0,"I just started a new subreddit too so I can empathize with the excitement you must been feeling about this. I'm a little confused though - can you explain why it's ""radically open""?",responsitamer,5bnm69
1,"Sure! I think it's basically that rather than trying to encourage control, the therapy encourages relinquishing control. Rather than stopping behaviors, it's largely an allowance of behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and emotions (with the recognition that it's still a good idea to act ""wisely"" and not, say, punch someone in the face just because you feel like it). I guess one could call this opening. It's also about being open to feedback, taking things in, considering, self-inquiry, etc. The contrast with BPD/ DBT is that folks with a BPD diagnosis are noticeable-- they scream, cry, fight, etc-- it's much more dramatic. These are people that can pass because they work their jobs, they are successful because they can complete tasks, yet they're, I guess, not happy/ connected (*cries/ barfs/ runs away/ comes back*). The therapeutic work is doing opening (while staying safe-- in fact my impression is the work is largely to get oneself into a state of feeling safe, then live one's life) and it's intended for closed or closed-off people-- those that have been isolating, etc. Hope that made sense, let me know.",RODBTmod,5bnm69

0,"Whatever you do, do not turn going to therapy into an ultimatum. Therapy will not work if he is not a willing participant and it will probably just lead to more resentment and there’s a chance he would lie about it for the financial support. He needs to realize he needs help and seek it out on his own and not be pressured into it. Focus on what you can do for him rather than what he should do for himself. I think researching BPD and how to deal with it (as a loved one) is a great place to start - just remember that it manifests differently for everyone so don’t make assumptions about him based on what you read. 

People will often calm down if they just feel heard and validated in some way. Just listen to him when he’s upset, don’t criticize or offer advice or mention BPD. Find some way to sympathize and just treat him like a regular human being, not like someone who’s sick or broken, even if you think he’s being kind of nuts!

My sister was diagnosed with BPD as well and was financially dependent on my parents, often isolating herself in her room most of the time. One thing that would really cheer her up was bringing her little treats (especially homemade meals and baked goods) or inviting her to do things with me, even if I think she’ll say no - little things that let her know that I care about her. Mentioning happy childhood memories or old inside jokes helped too. When I spend time with her I just try to keep it light and talk about mundane/silly things or watch TV/movies - something low key that won’t lead to more emotional topics. If I can sense her mood shift then I back off immediately and try to change the subject or activity. She tried DBT and it helped her a LOT but she wasn’t really happy until she finally moved out of my parents house and started a life of her own. Getting a job and being more independent in general seemed to help her a lot as well, but she did that on her own when she felt ready.

Just be patient, try to understand things from his perspective and let him live his life and make his own mistakes until he makes peace with his diagnosis and treatment. He’s an adult and he probably knows what he has to do at this point, it just takes time, especially with someone that has recently been diagnosed with a personality disorder.

1,"That's such wonderful advice, thank you! my only concern is that he'll be too stubborn to ever consider dbt. I'll not bring it up again. I suppose pushing the books and worksheets is a bit condescending. we often used to watch jeopardy together.. The other day i asked him to watch with me and he replied with, ""after my nap"". We never did watch Jeopardy after his nap nor did he care to explain or apologize. from what i understand, holding someone responsible for their actions is a way for us to help someone treat BPD, but i also don't want to make him feel guilty. i guess i should just move past that and not worry about it.",jeswanders,bazpri
2,"oh another thing, sorry. if he asks for us to write him a check, how are we supposed to respond to that?",jeswanders,bazpri
3,"No problem! He might be too stubborn to try it for a long time, it's true, but he's an adult (even if he seems immature or unstable) so the most you can do is gently suggest it, be there for him and do your best to not allow his disorder to interfere with your own life. Although it can be very effective, DBT isn't the only thing that can help him on his road to recovery anyway and many people prefer to discover what works for them on their own.

Asking him to watch Jeopardy with you is a great idea, even if it didn't end up happening. You can (and should) hold him ""responsible"" for things without making him feel guilty - a lot of it just comes down to word play.  Just say how his actions affected you without pointing any fingers or being overly negative. In that situation, you could say something like ""Hey I was bummed out when we didn't end up watching Jeopardy together, I miss doing that with you, maybe we can do it some other time?"" in a lighthearted way. He's probably pretty depressed and socially isolating himself so don't take it personally. Keep asking him, even if he doesn't hang out he'll remember that you offered and hopefully appreciate that.

As for your other comment, I'm not sure. I'm hesitant to give specific advice since I don't know your brother and that's a potentially explosive subject. Hopefully you already know that it isn't a good thing to enable him financially and that you should turn down that request. If he genuinely needs the support, your parents could offer to pay for specific bills/purchases directly so they at least know where their money's going. I would say try to be firm, unemotional, and logical about your reasoning without pointing fingers or mentioning his mental health. It's a perfectly reasonable request for your parents to refuse, BPD and gambling aside. Brace yourself for a blowup though and no matter what he does don't give in - that only reinforces his negative behavior. Don't feed any manipulative and aggressive behavior. Things might get pretty dramatic as he adjusts to the idea of being more independent but it will get better with time.

I'm just a stranger on reddit speaking from my own experience though so take all this with a grain of salt. Hopefully the literature you ordered will shed some more light on this than I did!",spoopyspoons,bazpri

",ryanpsych,31ljld
9,"> , not a psychiatrist. 

You're confused about what I'm criticizing.  I'll start by explaining the very basics.  

First you need to know what psychiatry is.  Psychiatry is imagining ""mental illnesses"" & pretending they are real illnesses, when really such are  just labels for alleged behaviors/feelings, not real physical illnesses:

- > ""Mental disorders don't really live ‘out there’ waiting to be explained. *They are constructs we have made up* - and often not very compelling ones.""    

  -- [Allen Frances, DSM-IV chief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Frances) in *“DSM in Philosophyland: Curiouser and Curiouser”* in AAP&P Bulletin vol 17, No 2 of 2010   

- > “DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, *not any objective laboratory measure.*”    

-- Thomas Insel (Director of the NIMH) @ [psychologytoday.com](http://psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201305/the-nimh-withdraws-support-dsm-5)      

ie, the psychiatric pseudo-science (pretending in ""mental illness"") includes:

- pretending the drugs are ""medicine"" 

- calling things ""therapy"" as if there was an illness, when there is not.


Basically:

- It's fine if someone provides a service to help people with a mental condition.

- But to pretend people's thoughts/feelings/etc are a ""mental infection/illness"" that needs ""treatment"" is pseudo-science & quackery.

Btw, it does not matter what the quack calls themselves.  They could call themselves a shaman, psychologist, etc.  If they're pretending there's ""mental illnesses"" that's psychiatric quackery.

",anticapitalist,31ljld
10,"
I brought up that distinction because you commented on a piece on a psychologist who developed a psychotherapy intervention with a rant on psychiatry and medications. 

So what would you call it? You seem to have a very negative view of the mental healthcare profession, but what would you put in it's place?

For those who suffer from emotional issues-regardless of whether one chooses to label it- what would you suggest? For those who are psychotic- what would you suggest? 

True, many mental illnesses do not yet have reliable biomarkers that can aid in diagnosis, but then again so too did many (if not most) physical illnesses until the past several decades. Did they only become illnesses once we determined their physical etiology? 

While I am not comfortable labeling every form of psychological or emotional distress an ""illness"" at the same time illness or not many people are in need of mental healthcare. ",ryanpsych,31ljld
11,"> a rant on psychiatry 

Again, the topic is psychiatry, such as pretending people's thoughts/feelings are ""mind illnesses"" & ""treating"" them.

> many mental illnesses do not yet have reliable biomarkers 

Again, [there is *no* ""mental illness"" which is ""diagnosed"" by any biomarkers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/31ljld/marsha_linehans_inventor_of_dbt_struggle_with/cq4i47v)  

 - ""Psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests.""

-- [Allen Frances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Frances)

---

But more importantly, it's not even possible to prove a ""mental illness"" is real with a biomarker:

Even if some behaviors/feelings are linked to something physical, that *does not prove the behaviors/feelings are an illness.*

**Example:**

- If people linked a ""good"" thing (happiness, etc) to an alleged gene/etc  no one would say it's an illness.   

Which brings us to the heart of the matter: declaring things ""mental illness"" is making a moral judgement about which behaviors/feelings are good or bad.

And that (moral subjective opinion) is out of the realm of science.  Thus science will *never* be able to prove theories about ""mental illness.""

Lots of people say (roughly) ""Someday scientists will prove this.""  They fail to understand what science is.

> those who suffer from emotional issues

Drugs can help, but there is no reason to pretend people are ""medicating an illness.""

>  For those who are psychotic-

There's no such thing.  ie, what counts as ""psychotic"" is just a subjective opinion.  

For those who believe in actual science the entire psychiatric class is viewed as psychotic, delusional, dangerous, parasitic, etc.

As for people with strange opinions, who *want* drugs, that's fine.  If people voluntarily want to choose buying drugs from the manufacturer, that is a better solution.

> mental healthcare 

There is no such thing.

1,"I'll write more (specific details) here for anyone who cares to read:

I *kinda* agree with the premise of ""changing thoughts""—I'm no longer the timid person I used to be after all that bullying, and as I said, grew out of OCD (*and I did both of these without therapy or medication, although it probably cost me about decade of my life*).

*That said*, the premise of CBT is still largely rubbish — though, yes, I CAN deal with people now, I'm still deeply, instinctively anxious in their presence, and most of my inner monologue feels so idiosyncratic that trying to ""express myself"" inevitably feels like a performance. It's debilitating and has cost me many opportunities where I would have *dearly* liked to succeed.

""Overthinking"" has been and probably always will be a problem. Therapy hasn't helped: the people writing the materials seemingly describe what they *imagine* it's like, in line with their hypothesis that excessive fear comes from ""distorted thoughts"", specifically, ""catastrophising"": I would say want I really want to say, but ""*oh my God what will people think! they'll hate me!*""

—yeeaaaaah, NO. Not that simple.

This is a big problem with how they label things, I reckon: I assume (optimistically) it's meant as a useful device for patients who have never thought in this way before to start to look at themselves, but in practice it's become a way for barely-qualified, overpaid idiots to tell their unfortunate patients what they're thinking and why they're suffering, while having no real insight on the matter AT ALL.

*****

And again, it's a pretty shallow effect! It is an essential element of becoming well, I agree — the patient has to overcome some habitual hurdles and be willing to change — but my word by itself it's *shite*. It is fucking *shite*. We were given a handout in my DBT classes citing a study claiming how enormously effective it was, and when it looked it up at home ...yes, a large percentage of patients had ""improved"", but that improvement was considered relative to their former history of regular ER visits and self-destructive behaviour: following DBT, they did those things... less. ""Significant""? OK, technically YES, but it's not a very high bar. Other studies I've noted (this was not advertised in our hand-out) mentioned that patients after treatment had overall psycho-social functioning: *poor, well below average*.

Like, c'mon. You could interpret that to mean that the biggest effect of DBT is that it makes people feel more *guilty* about going to the ER and causing trouble, and that would be equally valid.

But they chose to mislead. They chose to highlight ""scientifically-proven effectiveness"" while being deliberately coy about what that means.

3,"Well, to be fair, I tried to put that out front: I don't identify with ...why... it does what it does, and my reflections (e.g. the AA comparison) are my best attempt to put that into context, while also (admittedly) venting some of frustration that I've had to learn DBT language just to talk effectively to a lot of health professionals.

(e.g.: I used to say ""controlling emotion"", but they'd frequently interrupt to say, ""*you can't control emotions!*"" ...so I've switched to saying, ""regulate emotions"", and now they're OK with it—I was talking about exactly the same thing!, I just wasn't familiar with the word ""regulate"" in that context in my early days of therapy. Frankly, I do not find such pedantry to be helpful, even though I AM VERY MUCH a word nerd)

We had to chant ""*wise mind*"". Why? Is there really some secret, deep truth in that Venn (or Euler?) diagram that I should be meditating upon it? It was frustrating.

This is what I mean when I say it's ""hard to relate to""—unless it already speaks to you on some level, the whole thing seems senseless and arbitrary.

That's fine if it DOES work; what I resent is the particular assumption (on the part of many people) that it JUST IS, that there's some deeper Universal truth in there.",almostambidextrous,apmv5f
5,"And just for a moment... can we talk about ""skills""?

In any other context, if somebody offered to sell you a ""skill"" and provided little more than a forced acrostic with some vague explanation of its meaning, you'd take them to court.

I think that DBT (and other therapy) ""skills"" are just as much dodgy marketing. Let's be honest here: they're really just generic rules: not *the worst*, but not great, and yes, if you follow them for awhile, depending where you're coming from, you may find that you've gotten better at dealing with people or whatever, but that's just *practice* happening—real ""skill"" isn't something you get from a half-assed mnemonic, and real people aren't that predictable.

Selling them as ""skills"", IMO, is dishonest... and in America, at least, they most certainly are SOLD.

I always found it weird that so much of DBT that I attended —without America, even— was so much based on Marsha Linehan herself, like, actually mentioning *her*, how *she* overcame [BPD, in my case, but other people have told me that it was bipolar disorder or even schizophrenia], listening to her tapes, hearing her thoughts, and talking about her books... um, I'm not her? so why should that even be relevant? ...I dunno, there must be a line in the training manual or something: you *don't* generalise DBT. It's a story about how this SPECIFIC process and these SPECIFIC beliefs ended up with this one woman feeling truly well and fancy, with a PhD to boot.

I find it all very suspect. Maybe I'm just old school, but I feel like a proper scientist (i.e. NOT a flaky self-help guru) would have approached their invention a bit differently.",almostambidextrous,apmv5f

- maybe for some reason you can't see the hoop, and spend a year blinding throwing a ball into the air (*you don't learn the relevant skill, as objectives are poorly set up*).

The mindfulness aspect is widely used outside of DBT, the distress tolerance aspect is often used for treating anxiety disorders and phobias, and the accepting, non-judgemental, wise-mind aspect can be powerful for anyone as it encourages practicising self-compassion and, I found, made a very good counterpart to CBT for me.",claireauriga,3egszw

2,"My local health authority in the UK started using DBT about 10 years ago and they soon discovered that much of it could be applied to other mental health issues such as chronic depression, anxiety, bipolar, and I happen to personally know at least one schizophrenic who completed the course. In the last few years, the crisis team and therapeutic day service have used an eight week condensed model as a way of supporting those who would normally end up in hospital for weeks at a time. Now they may spend a few days in hospital, if at all. I did the full DBT course in 2008-9 and been through the short courses twice as a top up when I've been really low in 2010 and 2013.

The workbooks can be useful for establishing behaviour patterns and triggers, and you can adapt them to your situations. A lot of the DBT stuff has its roots in Eastern philosophy and Buddhism. Mindfulness (a key component of DBT) is currently the new poster child for mental health and is intended for everyday use. The internet has a lot of resources relating to DBT as well.

It's not simply turning up to therapy. That won't do it. It's really working on implementing the skills and strategies in your life and reflecting on when they go well and dont go well.

It takes a long time but change is definitely possible.

Remember that these skills are skills that everyone needs to learn. They aren't just for people with diagnoses. There are people who want to teach young adults these skills regardless of mental health presentation.  When you know the skills,  you'll see how unskilled a lot of people are in everyday life.

The hardest part of recovery (2 rounds of DBT here) was learning to trust myself. And stopping the value judgments. 

Dude, chin up. Keep trying. 

Right now it doesn't feel like you can do it. That's okay. That will change. So much less is fixed than we feel. 

Be kind to yourself, take a deep breath, and try again. Knowing all the skills doesn't mean we can do things, it means we can figure out were shit is going wrong.

3,"More so commenting to affirm what has helped me. Whatever you end up doing OP, I hope you have a path to a similar or better recovery I did.

I have BPD and I'm (mostly) recovered. I'd say about... 90% recovered? And that occurred in about a year, from diagnosis to my current level of disorder management. This isn't to say that I'm emotionally stable all the time, but I can effectively and healthily communicate when it's starting to happen and ask for the support which stops a split from happening. Lack of identity and emotional impermanence are still issues, but I'm actually quite emotionally regulated these days. Save for my first violent split in over a year that went down last night and I'm still not completely out of it. I just feel well controlled to be by myself, but I'm not bright eyed and happy like I usually am 95% of the time.

Reflecting back on when I was really, really out of control and splitting extremely badly on a weekly or twice weekly basis at least, my recovery was only possible because I was ready for therapy. Dismissing it and discrediting it would've made me resentful of my therapist and then there was no way they could help me. Not their fault. Mine. Because I wasn't truly listening to what they were telling me.

I also had to swallow that hard pill that I *was* feeling the wrong way. I was in the wrong. I was being unhealthy to myself and the people around me. It sucked, trust me, I know. But you know, self-acceptance is actually really helpful. I still laugh and openly say that I'm a psycho, I'm a nutcase. It's true. But that doesn't mean I'm a bad person. I often feel like a walking, talking disorder but I understand myself on such a deep level that I know when it's manifesting itself in destructive ways and I can ask for the love and support I need to defuse it. And it works.

And you know what really stuck with me after I left therapy? Developing the maturity to apologize for my behavior and reach out and help heal the people I hurt. I'm inherently incredibly selfish and needy with my BPD but sometimes I have to say you know what, push my needs aside and tend to the needs of my partner. Recognizing that it's not all about me and, if need be, going through our happy times to remember I love this guy even if my emotional impermanence is making it very hard to feel that like I usually do. I also have to accept when I said I hated him, I meant it. But that's something I only feel when my BPD episode turns hurt to anger. Because anger makes me feel better and I'm vindictive when I lose control and I want to hurt him as hurt as I feel but my anger masks.

I think it's good to recognize that while your feelings in episodes are valid, they're still wrong. And you have to actively strive to communicate them in healthy ways. So last night, I lost my shit and messaged my partner ""I really, really hate you."" And I meant it. I didn't regret it. But after a few minutes, I messaged ""I recognize that my lashing out at you is abusive. I understand and accept the potential consequences of my behavior. I sincerely feel like I don't have a partner and I understand that's largely my fault for not having the self-control to avoid this episode.""

See, just because you lose control of your feelings doesn't absolve you of the personality responsibility to take ownership of your actions and make amends as best as you can. You have to have the self-awareness that you were wrong, you couldn't control it, and then have the selflessness to put someone else first and make sure *they're* okay before they can help you.

95% of the time, we're a happy, healthy couple. Like, really. Still in the honeymoon phase after several years. Fights only ever occur when I split which is now a once a year or so thing. Communication and self-awareness and maturity to recognize when I'm being a piece of shit to someone is really healthy. As well as knowing I'm insane and laughing about it positively with my partner that he knows. Acceptance for being a psycho is really healing. Once you accept yourself, you start finding yourself more and more able to manage the disorder until it rarely manifests itself in destructive ways at all.",Feather-Light,b1ufh4

I would like to point out in a non-defensive manner that I do take responsibility, it's that it's negative towards me. For instance, if I lash out, I will almost immediately say, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that, I'm a shit girlfriend and you would be better off without me."" Because I feel that way. I don't want to have an outburst and when I do I feel so incredibly embarrassed and guilty that I blame myself but then also ridicule myself as well.

I know when my spirals are coming, but they happen too fast for me to stop and ask for help, and they're too strong to get out of. I have a constant fear of abandonment and it makes me say and do things in an attempt to keep those around me to stay around me. And if my boyfriend and I have a disagreement, I'm terrified he will leave me.

He's incredibly supportive and I appreciate him more than words can say, but I just don't want this. I don't want BPD.

Take some time and reflect on why it was wrong and then apologize without feeling bad.

Your emotions are attached to your autonomic nervous sytem, the system of nerves that control your fear responses - heartbeat, sweat, etc. When you see something scary, the system puts you in fear mode. Those two things, the ANS and emotion, always work together. Always.

And it works in reverse. Take your ANS out of fear mode and the fear goes.

Of all the ANS functions, there's one you can control - breathing. If you change your breathing rate, that hacks your ANS. It slows heartbeat etc. That changes your mood.

You know DBT paced breathing. Use it when you're afraid. Keep using it until you're calm.

There are scores of laboratory and clinical studies showing that this works. It will help you because you have the same ANS and limbic system as everybody else, all mammals.",RWPossum,1b8dwma

4,"As a mental health professional, being in the right kind of therapy does matter. However, if you're in CBT therapy it can still be helpful in treating Bipolar. DBT therapy is primarily used for people with Borderline Personality Disorder but can be helpful for other situations where struggling to sort through your emotions and make better choices based off how you're feeling too. Therapy helps Bipolar in the sense that it does give coping skills and opportunities to process through situations or things your experience in your life that also include Bipolar.  CBT therapy is primarily used to help change thoughts and behaviors for better outcomes. It also helps dispel cognitive distortions or certain thought processes we have that often times creates challenges. If you haven't already, don't be afraid to bring up to your therapist that you're unsure of how your treatment has been helpful and be upfront with them about some of the deficits you feel you're experiencing with the therapy. Therapists are used to these kinds of conversations and welcome it! 

I'll also mention that Bipolar is a mental disorder that needs a high compliance with meds. I know a lot of people struggle with staying current with their meds for various reasons, but meds greatly help stabilize someone's' moods and baseline so that they aren't going from one extreme to another between depression and mania. Being stable in your moods for the most part will help you better work through the situations in life that effect your emotionally. I greatly discourage you from quitting your meds.

The fact that you haven't had episodes in a few months is actually great news! It means the meds and therapy is working.

The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly.

2,"Hello. I've taken so many meds for so many mental health diagnosis I currently have that I simply would recommend to suck it up. I know this is not what you may expect but I've tried so many pills including this one. I suggest that if you have insomnia to regulate your schedule. You have to be healthy as much as you can if you happen to proceed without medications. I would say to speak to the same doctor or go to a different one. I would explain to my doctor the situation including the fact that he did not explained to you the side effects in advance, (even though he should only advice you about the ones that may happen. Side effects are different for everyone, as everyone works differently with their nervous system, I'd say biology. 

If this medication did not work than you should simply move to the next one or don't take them and regulate yourself. I personally cannot take meds anymore because I decided to fight it, this doesn't mean everyone can do it. But certaintely more of a challenge for me as I have severe psychosis. Sleep is not something I'm very found of. My entire life since I have memory I have had a psych mental health issues and Severe Insomnia is one of them as well as Severe ADD/ADHD, severy anxiety, dysthimia which is a prolongued severe depression..........(using 'a 'd' hd' doesn't fit anymore as it is proven that it's not a deficiency.)

Point is depending how well you are to resist falling sleep you may not need meds at all. Healthy is the way. Eat healthy, drink water. DRINK LOTS OF WATER OR ENOUGH A DAY. WATER IS VITAL. Healthy everything. 

What I do is if I'm sleepy when I know I shouldn't is that I end up fighting it till it's the best time depending on how many hours I in advance should of course know that I'll be sleeping. Right now I want to pass out. Running on 2 hours sleep 3 days. So what I need to do now that I got time is wait till about 10 or 11... so I'd wake up around 9am, but most likely won't as my insomnia gets me up for some reason I tend to wake up earlier than I should that's another name for what I have but I forgot is a serious sleeping disorder based on trauma. 

Point is as long as you're sure please be careful and speak to your doctor clearly. I do not understand why he/she would put you on this specific one for something such as Insomnia or ADD. Doesn't make much sense to me, I understand it can help but you need to be clear and deep into your situation on how you feel for completely because there are more pills. Just explain how you felt and he or she should prescribe something different or lower the dosage. Benadryl is helpful for some it makes me itchy peesonally but I think its psychotic behaviour, some do get allergic reactions from it though.

Anyways you should be better by applying healthy on EVERYTHING YOU DO. If you're job is not helping etc, get on disability, or unemployment or SNAP. Or you can try and qualify for Medicaid etc. Been diagnosed with ADD it's enough to cut many things off. Also you are not disoriented from ADD. You simply process information faster than your body can handle. So breath control is very important, for example try breathing excirces and massage. Stimulation is what people like us need better stimuly. Some say that's why its a deficiency, this is not a deficiency. Sometimes ADD can lead from trauma etc etc etc.... explain it to your doctor first unless you have your own suspicion that Doctor it's not working nor doing their job correctly.

Been so many times hospitalized for so much... now I take no meds because I regulate. Don't push too hard to  regulate your self either its not for everyone. Try Binaural Beats/sounds/music this is very helpful for neurodivergent humans.

3,"Effexor is a pretty potent antidepressant and the discontinuation syndrome (aka withdrawal) is nasty. If you have ADD, I'm not sure why your psychiatrist would put you on an anti-depressant and not a medication specifically for that condition but I don't know your history and I'm not a professional. 

I do struggle with insomnia and medication-induced daytime sleepiness. It's a Catch-22. I have treatment-resistant depression, not ADHD, and I take two activating antidepressants. One is Wellbutrin, which I found out the hard way I can't take after a certain hour or I will not sleep. I take other meds during the day that give me an incredibly hard time staying awake and focusing, which sucks because I have such terrible insomnia. For that, I have to take a high dose of sleep medication. Finding the right cocktail is a matter of trial and error and can take a long time to get right.

I've found pharmacists to be more helpful when discussing potential side effects and cross-reactions. I used to take a much higher dose of Wellbutrin, and my doctor(s) never told me it could mess with my blood pressure. A pharmacist did. I've learned lots of helpful information from them that doctors forget about or don't bother to mention.

8,"It is good to hear or I'd say read this. But the main thing to have is what's called regulation and control. You have to build resistance to that which is affecting you in the moment. Sadly it has been the same for many people in this circumstances. 

The main thing is to be aware of yourself as much as you can. As I had said in my previous one, you can wait to sleep so you can regulate.
But to do so you gotta also have to apply sleeping more on the days and hours you can. Because regulating and waiting actually takes more sleep time away,  it can help but not necessarily if you don't regulate correctly based on your own personal view and perspective on your health. It is very important that you still seek therapy types as sleeping disorders even ADD can cause circadian issues cause of sleep suppressors such as those where you sleep any time or less and such. 

Holistic therapy can help, there are many types and different practices and holistic medicine may in fact be all you need. I always recommend going the most natural healthier ways, as the only reason we are like this now is because how life has been shaped until now. Food in USA has too many chemicals, the public gets sicker weaker, you inmute system uses to be stronger. But  because of what we invest on including clothes etc, materials, etc, we end up weaker and also we don't realize how it affects us. Everything can be a variable to specific vulnerabilities that sometimes we would never figure out. It's just so sad. 

I know you'll get better. I also recommend breathing practices, make sure that when you do breath that you feel the air pressure inside,  just simply feel as much as you can. Picture/imagine (if you can,  as some people have Aphantasia and such) your chest feeling up either with fire old freezing air as you do the breathing, it is very important you feel the air and lose yourself.  Sit on the bed where you can lay off you fall back you know,  then choose your eyes, put your hands on Stonegate on your body where it feels light, such as your legs,  but when you move your hands so it all as if you were floating or light as if you weight nothing. And initiate by closing your eyes breathing the way we said, imagine the temperature air going in that may feel most comfortable to you (I recommend cold or freezing, could stimulate your neurological system, and then make sure your eyes are close and fully tilt your head back, allow yourself to feel light, weightless, breath in do it slowly. Disconnect from bed by feeling your head,  you should feel a little floaty and allow yourself to fall back to bed slowly and eyes close always when you lay back you'll feel the head float highly than before. Your body should feel floaty, May even feel as if your spinning. Do not allow yourself to get sick to your stomach by breathing technic. Control is the key, resistance always,  sometimes some can't, as some work differently,  don't push too too hard or you may hurt yourself or throw up. Sometimes opening eyes earlier is better.  
I suggest doing this before sleep.

And my last recommendation is child water shower right before sleep, if your can wash hair,  way better,  but maintain breathing under hand,  practice always breathing freezing air deeply as much as you can always.

2,"Pinecone, your long grocery list of disorders is not as bad as it sounds. Strictly speaking, a true ""disorder"" is the CAUSE of a set of dysfunctional behavioral symptoms. 

Yet, because psychologists are unable to actually diagnose the underlying cause of mental disorders, they are forced to rely on a severe occurrence of behavioral symptoms to infer the existence of some underlying (but unproven) disorder. That is, when BPD symptoms are severe and persistent, professionals ASSUME that some unproven disorder must be causing it.  
  
The result, Pinecone, is that the American diagnostic manual contains 157 mental ""disorders,"" each of which is simply a set of behavioral symptoms. Significantly, no scientist has yet proven to a certainty what is the cause -- i.e., the disorder -- that is causing any of those 157 behavioral patterns. Nobody knows whether they are caused by 3, 8, or 90 actual disorders.  
  
I mention all this, Pinecone, to explain why having a long list of ""multiple disorders"" does not imply that you are hopelessly impaired. On the contrary, it is quite common.  
  
With BPD, for example, a [2008 study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/table/T3/) of 35,000 American adults found that the vast majority of pwBPD also suffer from 2 or 3 co-occurring clinical disorders -- e.g., bipolar, depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, or ADHD. For example, 74% of pwBPD have a co-occurring anxiety disorder and 75% have a mood disorder such as depression.  
  
As to bipolar disorder, that same study found that 30% of bipolar sufferers also suffer from BPD. And about 40% of pwBPD also have co-occurring bipolar. And 39% of pwBPD also have PTSD. On top of those clinical disorders, most pwBPD also suffer from 1 or 2 other personality disorders as well.  
  
Importantly, the psychologists' inability to identify the actual underlying disorders does not imply that they are unable to help you. On the contrary, they can do enormous good by treating the behavioral symptoms that cause you so much pain. 

They do this in the same way that medical doctors help their patients by treating the symptoms whenever they are unable to identify and eliminate the underlying disorder (e.g., Alzheimer's) causing those symptoms. I therefore applaud your decision to join the DBT training program, Pinecone!",Up-Town,10nbm7c

1,"The most beneficial coping mechanism is satisfaction.

If you are satisfied with what you are doing or what you have done, then in the long term you can always look back on it and say that you did something. Might not have been a world changing thing you did but satisfaction from it seems the best route through life. 

It's a bit depressing in some contexts but if you do something you're proud of then you can always turn back to it and say that you did something. For example; I was proud of machining medical screws to a higher standard. They would come out almost polished. Didn't help me at the time, doesn't help me now, but I am satisfied that I put my effort in and tried to improve the whole process.

It was an overall thankless job and required repetitive motions and ideas, but when I look back, I'm glad I tried to make it better. I am glad that I didn't just auto-pilot the whole thing.

There is no logical reason why it would cost so much, even if the day was filled to the brim with therapy.

They're transplanting tissue for gods sake. Even if what the surgeon makes and the cost for being at the hospital where non-existant, it would still cost tens of thousands. Mental health treatment can vary widely between countries, phallo costs 50.000 - 70.000 wherever you go. Surgery actually costs money, its a fact of life. Ofcourse there are countriea where insurance will pay a certain amount or even everything, but that cost is non-negotiable.

Edit: Also you saying ""simple phalloplasty"" makes me think you don't actually know how many surgeries it takes. Like there are almost ten steps involved to getting a dick, which each in and of itsself is a massively invasive surgery and depending on the hospital they'll do multiple steps in one surgery, but you're gonna have to go under at least three times.

That means that all stages are performed at once, and the only stage ""missing"" that usually happens in multiple-stage phallo is metoidioplasty.

162,"I don't live in the US, I've been waiting for 5 months for a bed in the only psychiatric hospital my insurance will pay for. I've almost jumped off a building twice in that time, and all that happens is a 24 hour solitary suicide watch hold, then I get sent back home and told it won't take that long anymore. I've been going through manic phases, sometimes waking up at places I don't know or to things in my room I don't remember getting or even mizzing entire days from my memory. And yes, I've been to every single charity and help organization, even the fucking church (I'm jewish and have never been in a church before) just to get told they can't do anything while I'm waiting for treatment because all they can do is set me up with the appropriate treatment, which I have done myself. If I don't get treatment or get medicated soon I might legitimately die because I'm doing something stupid like running in train tracks without consciously wanting to do it. And I live in Germany, a country with supposedly one of the best health systems in the world (which is true for a lot of parts except mental health treatment.) 

Honestly I can't imagine that these kinds of situations don't happen in the US. I'm actually flabbergasted by the arrogance it takes to look at a person dead by suicide or a severly mentally ill person living on the streets and say ""its their own fault. Tough luck.""

2,"You are not alone, in my experience it is a very common thing to go through that sense of lack of happiness. I've done some stupid, impulsive stuff due to that. However, the fact that you feel like you have to chase happiness says something, and I don't mean to say that in a bad way but just maybe try to analyse your life, your actions. Are you doing things for yourself, or for others? Are you living the life that your are ""supposed"" to live or the life that you actually want? Happiness is not something we should try to get, searching for it is meaningless. What I mean by that is, that we shouldn't search or chase feelings, they usually are random, they come as we act or as we experience something. In my opinion, happiness comes when we do things that inspire us, that are connected to ourselves (amongst other things). Keep in mind that, just like grief, happiness is not permanent, and that is completely okay. Things end, just like everything, but I said it's okay because you did something meaningful for yourself and possibly for others, something that produced a sense of true happiness. Maybe DBT is not your way to go, maybe there is something out there that will give you the thing that you most desire. If you haven't, maybe try seeking professional help such as a psychologist or even talk to someone you trust. I truly hope that you find what your are looking for. Everybody deserves to have that sense of relaxation and happiness. A sense that you are doing things right, not for society, but for yourself.

1,"I want to give you a look inside your sons head. Intrusive thoughts are unwanted and typically scary thoughts. Your son does not desire having sex with his siblings at all that’s not what’s happening. With intrusive thoughts the worst possible thing pops into your head and never reflect your real desires they are often things you fear. For me it’s what if you hurt your pets or stab your mom or stab yourself and yes what if you r*ped that person. None of these things I want to do. The thoughts terrify my as they do your son. I want to be clear your son doesn’t desire this and these thoughts are hell to live with. They’ve brought me to tears several times. I’ve had them since I was 11 or 12, I’m 18 now. I have only ever told 4 people about the sexual ones. They scare the shit out of me. Your son doesn’t want this, he doesn’t want these thoughts. You need to sit down and acknowledge how hard it was to tell you and tell him your are proud of him for seeking help, it’s such a hard thing to do. One thing that has really helped me is mood stabilizers and naming my intrusive thoughts. I named my intrusive thoughts phil the pedo and to my surprise it helped to acknowledge that these thoughts are not me. Your son is so scared right now I can guarantee it. Please give him a hug and tell him he will get through it because he will and be so so grateful he trusted you enough to tell you. Big hugs to you both

I want to add this is from my experience mental health has been a huge part of my life since I was very little and I have adhd, bpd, depression, an anxiety disorder, and ocd.

I don’t have any solutions, but if he has opened a dialogue with you, that’s a tremendously hopeful sign that he 1) understands that acting in those urges/thoughts is wrong and 2) genuinely does not want to act on those thoughts and urges. You can have no better foundation to helping your son that he knows he has a problem and wants to change. I’m sorry you’re going through this. It sounds awful.

Invasive thoughts are more common than you’d think - violent or sexual ones can be pretty normal if you’re dealing with anxiety and/or a host of other mental illnesses.

If you make it through ""step one"" it's then usually an initial interview that then needs a ""review"" through the board. Its truly sad there isn't at least one place people can just go when they feel they need help. When you look at it though the doctors and clinicians need as much information as possible to make sure their place is the right place for your son/any patient. It doesn't do patients any good to end up in residential treatment without the proper therapists/ psychiatrists to be there for them. 
You could try 90 day treatment facilities for mental health. I know recovery centers sometimes have beds for people with severe mental health diagnosis. The same will the case though. Lots of paper work and then they also have to have a bed. They can usually get you in quicker than residential though. During the 90 day stay could give you time to look for a good residential to keep him longer??

I would recommend looking at intensive outpatient programs or partial hospitalization programs, where he can receive intensive treatment and medication management to help! Given the lack of responsiveness of his psychiatrist, it may be the best move here. And it doesn't jump to hospitalization immediately.

The minimum for hospitalization varies state to state and facility to facility, assuming you're in the US, so he may not ""qualify"" for admissions based on intrusive thoughts. However, being hospitalized can be a catch-22 because your child gets help or your child gets worse. He may stay there longer than you intended because he doesn't improve right away, or the treatment team decides it's not safe for him to return home. That's typically when the team would start looking at alternative options that don't involve extended hospitalizations. The goal is to always send the child home with their family. Again, this depends on the quality of the facility and state, sadly. 

What does his individual therapist specialize in? I would recommend finding a therapist that specializes in OCD (intrusive, unwanted thoughts = obsessions) and start there. These thoughts seem like they are the primary stressor for your child right now and that's what treatment should focus on. He was willing to disclose these obsessions may be turning into compulsions in the future and a specialist in this area can help tremendously.

29,"Hello! I'm an 18 FTM! I've also experienced having intrusive sexual thoughts with my siblings and other family members. I even have times when I dream about it. Sometimes, those dreams would follow me when I woke up and I'd think about what would happen if I did it. It all began when I was around 11 years old and admittedly, it is super fucking weird. At the start, I was also very concerned as intrusive thoughts can be very disgusting. They came involuntarily and I knew I shouldn't have been thinking about them in the first place. It's good that your son is bothered by it and is trying to address it - it's a sign that he's against it and he knows it's morally wrong. I talked to some people and I realized people do have them time-to-time (even cis-gendered people). I think it's also related to a person's libido developing and family members being the one closest and familiar to you. From my experience, it's important to recognize that they are INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS and that's all they are - they are not a reflection of who your son is.  They usually come, visit once in a while, I go ""That's really weird"" - and just go. 

It's very healthy that your son can communicate with you regarding his problems. Props to you as his mother! I turned out fine (other mental problems aside) but, if these thoughts are negatively affecting your son's behavior and mental health, then no harm in continuing with the therapy!

39,"Good for you. You sound like you are really trying to help your child. It says a lot that your child is willing to talk to you about things as uncomfortable as this. When my son was 12 he did not indicate he was having these feelings. He sexually abused another child.

 I felt awful. Like I raised a monster. I was terrified he would always be like this. I felt absolutely awful for the other child. I was lucky and found a therapist who specialized in treating sex offenders/sexual abuse. 

 Another thing we had to do was create a safety plan to keep him at home. We both had to sign it and stay with it. It was hard but it kept everyone safe including his siblings. Things like never allowing my son to be out of an adults sight. Never alone with another child.  We had to go to the hardware store and get door alarms. They are cheap little things you put on the door frame. At night you flick a switch and if the door opens an alarm goes off. Your kid isn't trapped in there room at all. His therapist was able to help us.

There is a book series called Pathways. They have a guided workbook for treatment. You may want to look into it. I realize your child has not offended so it is not exactly the same but some of it will help and apply. I wish you well. It is very scary but I promise it can get better.

42,"It can be a sign of a few things or a combination of these things. Either they aren't finding a healthy masturbation outlet so they are getting very horny. Or their testosterone is too high and its effecting them because of puberty temporarily. Or, its a sign of a developmental problem, which is likely the case judging by their other mental problems. Borderline Personality Disorder is also a sign of abuse sometimes. The fact they are wanting it with family, and not drawing a line, shows its a prefrontal cortex problem which translates to a developmental problem.

Studies on sexuality, I did not read much, but what I read seems to indicate that not having a healthy sexual outlet for some causes the urges, except when they have acted on their taboo desires before then it causes them to want to do so again. By which I mean pornography. Like, unrelated to your child but related to the behavior pattern potentially, if a person wanted to assault someone violently so played a violent videogame instead, it would calm them down temporarily but possibly habit form them to use it as an outlet. But if someone did assault someone irl, then the violent videogame would just increase their desire to assault someone, not decrease it.

As long as they have other healthy hobbies and a good diet and lifestyle including proper sleep and no major deficiencies, this problem could be overcame more readily. Like how low potassium is associated to diabetes type 2, and, low magnesium is associated to anxiety or depression and poor sleep, theres a possibility its because of the combination of a deficiency, stress, brain developing while having developmental troubles. Even having technically unstimulating hobbies can cause brain atrophy, such as watching tv for more than just an hour or two before bed. So to improve their cognitive development they should practice a healthy diet and lifestyle (but not to a controlling degree as it may increase tensions).

Also, a way to overcome personal problems, is meditation. People with problems when they meditate, tend to first think of troubling things before the mind calms. This reduces stress by acknowledging the stressors, and letting it pass. But for someone with developmental problems, they need to reflect on formative memories, and this is easier when trying to listen to music from their formative years. They should ask themselves, why are they acting the way they do? In a specific sense not a vague sense, but only they can ask themselves.

And if a person is pursuing a discipline in a balanced manner (not compromising on sleep or other activities required for mental health or mental engagement) then the personal problems actually become roadblocks and demonstrate the need to overcome in order to improve at the discipline. Something you can always get better at, that has good feedback on current skill level. Such as producing art, programming, overcoming challenges in sports or videogames (some videogames fuel addictive behaviors or impulsive behaviors tho, just playing it over and over doesn't mean they are improving, its games that require study, games that are so demanding or complex they can never be fully solved so theres always room for personal growth, similar to sports of course.)

Meditation has a thing in common with certain disciplines. Golf, tennis, and table tennis for instance are one on one sports, its just you, you don't rely on a team, its just you and what stands before you. These sports and meditation increase gamma brainwaves after some level of proficiency, which could take years. And some videogames are similar. 1v1 RTS games, fighting games. But they require specific study and practice not just play, and if study stops, they should view their replays to study those to see what they did wrong. Perhaps choose one based on the social environment they would connect to easier, or of course something more interesting to them if it fits the bill. Some communities, such as Smash Brothers (ironic name lol), did have some sexual predation in them however (Be your son the victim or the predator). But that can happen in a variety of communities, so you need one that seems more responsible as well if theres a discipline they are to pursue.

Gamma brainwaves have only been shown to increase with those highly technical one on one sports, and meditation, and listening to isochronics or binaurals of a gamma frequency, or magic mushrooms and other classical psychedelics, which recently have been getting shown to, with one integration method dose, can relieve anxiety and depression for 6-12 months, and is being studied for half a dozen other conditions including addiction. There are legal avenues to pursue for this. And studies have shown theres less hospitalizations proportionally for magic mushrooms than any other drug even between alcohol and weed, from PEW and it was a global survey of hospital data. And Cell has reported it causes dendritogenesis, and another study has shown it can produce new braincells as well rather than just increasing the neuroconnectivity of older ones. The tones can be a little grating but can aid meditation. Setting up expectations and intentions before is important for whichever is chosen. If you are skeptical of the magic mushroom method, you should read some testimonials from studies, but again it relies specifically on the integration method.

Also its important they have enough social activities that are not solely focusing on their mental health status, because it paints a picture of their worth and esteem and such. The problems should not be ignored but its fine to leave them on the backburner for healthy normal interactions as well (if they can, maybe they need some time before they can tho).",NeurogenesisWizard,sqtbrf

If he is expressing that he now wants to act upon these thoughts, I would suggest that you should try to get him some help at a in-patient psychiatric hospital as quickly as you can. I will say that I was committed as a teen and it wasn’t that wonderful of an experience, but if your son is expressing these serious thoughts that are actually developing into urges where he wants to/is going to act upon them, that is probably your only option. I’m not sure where you are or if there are any other psychiatric hospitals near you that you could look into other than the behavioral emergency room, but if you can find any others I suggest giving them a try. If he is still adamant that he does not want to act upon these thoughts, it’s probably OCD and he could likely use some out-patient care to help him with his intrusive thoughts.

It varies from state to state and county to county. I know in Oregon their are group homes. I used to work with many teens who were living in these situations. There were parents and children who had similar experiences that you have.

It sounds like those resources aren't available as you mentioned something like this in your original post.

Here is my question; how much do your other children understand their mental healthcare needs? How old are they?

It has been my experience that children who grow up with a sibling or parent with mental, developmental and physical disability are more aware that things are different.


Do the siblings have a positive relationship? 

Are there friends they may be able to hang out with after school before you get home from work?

Lastly a sex therapist may be a positive thing for your teen. Depending on where they are growing up there may be so many feelings they get on top of just normal teen stuff that they are unclear which direction to go to which can result in lots of desires that are scary, like this one.

A long while back a women I was dating confided in me that her youngest brother shared feelings that he wanted to be with her in a sexual relationship. He knew it was wrong but she was the only one he could turn to for help.

They had a traumatic childhood. Their Mom had intense grief after their father passed away at a young age. Her brothers and her had to fend for themselves and she was the brains and step in Mother when needed.

She felt conflicted but loved her little brother. I explained based on her and her brother's experiences they had a very isolating and lonely childhood. They were all super close and went through similar trauma together. Her little brother felt 0 and secure with her and had no other close friends and or girlfriends before. Based on all of this it made sense emotionally why he felt the way he did.

Generally speaking sexual feelings begins in trust and feeling safe and secure with someone and then it grows for some into intimacy etc... 

Clearly the feelings are misdirected but your teen may be feeling very lonely, due to transitioning, and mental health all  with 16 being known for being a very lonely time for some.

Maybe not from their family but from their peers which is so hard at that age.

I am not sure what the culture is like where you live but getting them in touch with a LGBTQ and or trans focus group may help with connecting with others.

Digital wellbeing:
- Monitor his digital activities and prevent any sexual content such as porn, incest sex has a whole genre and multiple studios dedicated to it in that industry!!!
- It's best if he could take a rest from every social network, or better yet go offline for a year or two.

Lifestyle:
- He should try to occupy his mind as much as he can, and tire his body as much as he can, so that he has no time to fantasize and doze off the second he lays on his bed!
- Getting a job will definitely help with the above plus having a strict plan for personal goals (academic/hobbies/whatever)
- Exercise, exercise, exercise.
- Meditation or better yet prayers if you're a religious family.

I do agree that these could be intrusive thoughts and they may be caused by the other mental health issues he experiences.
Why do I think they are just thoughts and he's not planning on doing this? Because he told his parents he was having them and he didn't really act on them, so I don't think it's an impulse that he can't control but more of a thought that he has and scares him. But I do know only what the OP told us and she sounds really worried so I hope she can find a solution or at least someone who can provide her one.

1," 

I'm really sorry to hear about what your boyfriend has been through. It sounds like he's dealing with some really heavy stuff, and it's admirable that you want to help him.

First and foremost, it's important to recognize that healing from trauma and managing mental health struggles like depression isn't a quick fix. It takes time, patience, and sometimes professional help.

Here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. Encourage him to seek therapy: Talking to a therapist who specializes in trauma and autism could be really beneficial for him. They can provide him with coping strategies, tools to manage his emotions, and a safe space to process everything he's been through.
2. Take care of yourself: Supporting someone who's struggling can be emotionally draining, so make sure you're also taking care of yourself. Reach out to friends or family for support, and consider talking to a therapist yourself if you need someone to talk to.
3. Encourage self-care: Help him find healthy ways to cope with his emotions, whether that's through exercise, creative outlets like art or music, mindfulness practices like meditation, or simply taking time to relax and do things he enjoys.
4. Be patient and understanding: Healing isn't a linear process, and there will likely be ups and downs along the way. Be patient with him and let him know that you're there for him no matter what.
5. Celebrate small victories: Recovery can be a slow process, so it's important to celebrate the small victories along the way. Whether it's getting through a tough therapy session, trying out a new coping strategy, or simply getting out of bed in the morning, acknowledge and celebrate his progress.",Classic_Ad_5292,1aqe9a2

a copy of your crisis plan,

It’s like they have a financial leash around my neck, which immensely sucks but I’m making steps to make sure I won’t live my life like this forever. I’m sorry to hear about what you’re going through. It’s a nightmare. But as far as your family goes, because I totally understand being triggered by the smallest of interactions with them. I know for me if they say something that rubs me the wrong way it’ll bring me back to when I was a helpless child, leaving me to panic.  What’s helped with this is learning how to create boundaries. Not only for them but for myself as well. It seemed nearly impossible at first, like how in the hell am I supposed to choose what to think? Because I was on such an emotional overload auto pilot. But mindfulness of my current thoughts, and reminding myself that thoughts do not hold as much weight as we’re often under the illusion they do, has helped more than I can tell you. And that’s the first step, is being aware of the thoughts and feelings going on in yourself in a non judgmental way whilst understanding their true nature. The second is teaching yourself that you do not need to take on the problems and feelings of others as your own. They are simply not yours. That’s been one of the hardest things for me to grasp because I was always the fixer in my family so I had to rewire 20 years of codependency.  But the group therapy I was going to had men and women in their sixties that were able to learn how to think in a healthier mind set so there is hope!

1,"The best success story I know - back when the diagnosis of BPD wasn't a thing, teenager Marsha Linehan was hospitalized for self-harm and diagnosed schizophrenic. Today, Dr. Linehan, the founder of DBT, is one of the world's most influential psychologists.

2,"You'll need to be on top of it and you'll need to have good emotional intelligence to deal with it daily, sometimes it might be worse, sometimes better, but you can definitely work with it to have a good life. 

Regarding relationships, it's better if you let people know, and if you find loving friends and partners that take your BPD into consideration and help you get out of some of the spells of it. Avoid toxic people and abusers, always.

We all have traits that we have to work on, BPD just happens to be harder on people because it can feel that it's relentless sometimes.  
I recommend you continue going to therapy and working on the events or circumstances that brought you to have BPD, healing those episodes of your life can make things easier.  
Sobriety is definitely important to keep up too.

3,"Successful, yes.  I recently learned that Pete Davidson has BPD and I would say he is fairly successful compared to most of us normies.  Happy and stable?  I am really not sure.  I think it is possible for people with BPD to be happy and stable for a span of time.  But from what I have researched on it, it doesn't seem like being happy, stable and successful long term is achievable.  I think with a disorder like this you just have to do the best you can day by day.

4,"**Are there any happy, stable, successful people with BPD?**

Mammoth, yes, the vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning"" -- i.e., they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, classmates, casual friends, and total strangers. None of those people are able to trigger his fears of abandonment and engulfment.  
  
There is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment. Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually appear only when someone draws very close to the pwBPD.  
  
This is why it is common for a high-functioning pwBPD to do well in socially difficult jobs such as being a social worker, nurse, professor, salesclerk, or doctor. And this is why most pwBPD can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers -- but often will go home at night to yell at the very people who love them. Only the loved ones are able to trigger his fears.

**Are there any happy, stable, successful people with BPD traits?**

Mammoth, BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either ""has"" or ""doesn't have."" Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means everyone on the planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).  
  
At issue, then, is not whether you exhibit BPD traits. Of course you do. We all do. Rather, at issue is whether you exhibit those traits at a strong and persistent level (i.e., are on the upper end of the BPD spectrum).",Up-Town,si50sf
5,"I have BPD and I'm definitely not stable but since I've quit drugs I am a lot more stable if that makes any sense? 

My biggest struggles with BPD is holding down a job and relationships.. Kinda friendships as well but it's easier for me to form friendships than it is relationships. 

Happiness is a fleeting emotion, nobody is happy all the time, if they state that they're talking complete dog shit. 

Or maybe they are? but I think if someone says they're happy all the time they're definitely ignorant to what is happening around them.",,si50sf

A lot of things can help, mostly things that are easy.

The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.

 Simple distractions can help - anything that changes your mood like beautiful music.",RWPossum,1at3yjm

It won't be you experiencing the pain. It's your loved ones. Sometimes that last a lifetime. It's also something people neglect their own mental health. Your body keeps the score.  Sometimes you fight battles that you don't know you are fighting.. Even if it's been years after initial trauma.   It's fight,flight and freeze response. People relive their trauma like it happened yesterday.  The only way you escape all of that. Live in the moment. What could you do today to make a better life for yourself? If everyday was a new day.  You just made a major break through today. Though you might not know it. I am glad you survived.   Change your mindset and build the foundation of a new life.

fortunately years later when I changed insurance I was able to reconnect with him in his private practice and now he's basically my psychiatrist for life, by far the best, most caring doctor I've ever met in my life. over time I finally became stable and have been feeling better than I have ever felt in my entire life.

1,"It’s hard to say how your specific psychiatrist really feels without directly asking her. I encourage you to do so and tell her how you’re feeling after the conversation about treatment resistant depression. 

Treatment resistant depression is a bullshit term. It means the current therapies are not working for the patient and therefore the patient is the problem. This is the exact problem across the entire medical field. Unless something is in a book and been studied for years and widely practiced otherwise it’s usually rejected, unfortunate pitfall of western medicine. Western medicine fails to treat individuals as individuals but rather as statistics and for those that do not fall under a category they are left feeling hopeless. However there are other proven methods of treating depression without ssri/snri/antipsychotics etc. 

Check out Tara Brach and Marcia Linehan. Finding a psychodynamic psychologist who actually practices psychodynamic therapy can be really helpful.",prime777time,198zkoy

9,"I won’t lie, doctors are humans too and some people just don’t click. That’s okay! But also sometimes we just don’t understand the way someone expresses themselves, and we also really have a hard time understanding the emotions conveyed especially when we are fighting something like depression. 

It could be that your doctor is just trying to keep a wall - this is important for ethical reasons but how much of a wall to keep up is really based on the practitioner, some will feel more comfortable being more close and some will feel it’s best to stay pretty far away. 

It could be that as your doctor has gotten comfortable with you, they don’t feel the need to express a lot of unnecessary pleasantries in their eyes. This could just be a personality trait of theirs. Some people are more outwardly warm than others. 

The doctor could just be a bit tired, or not having their best day when they see you. Sometimes my psychiatrist is pretty clearly a bit extra tired and that’s okay, they’re human. 

Sometimes you just don’t click personality-wise but that doesn’t mean they don’t care. 

And sometimes your mental health will do all it can to tell you someone hates you when you are receiving care from them. 

It could be many factors and it’s okay to ask, and even hold a discussion on it. 

“Hey I have felt like you may find working with me frustrating and I just wanted to ask how our working relationship is to you?” For example. These are valid discussions to have and can help you both reach a solution you are happiest with - be it different ways to communicate, just understanding mannerisms, or moving to a doctor you feel is most aligned with you.

10,"I know your question was around how psychs feel about their patients... However I'm more intrigued to understand what ""treatment-resistant depression"" really looks / feels like for you. 

The reason is, I have a podcast where I share mental and emotional health self help. There was a lot more I learnt outside of therapy that helped me to understand why we are the way we are and how to make change, and when you say ""treatment-resistant"", I'm curious as to whether you mean drugs don't get rid of your depression or if you mean no form of internal work you're doing is helping. If it's the former, and you want to change your situation, you might benefit from giving my podcast a listen. It's called ""know more do better"" on Spotify and apple, and mental health starts episode 8. Based on the limited information you've shared, I'd suggest episode 8 and episode 20 might help you, episode 8 covering the basic mechanics of how the brain and nervous system work and episode 20 covering identifying and challenging unhealthy core beliefs (such as ""I am unfixable"" or ""there's something wrong with me""). 

If you do give it a listen and have follow up questions you can reach me here.

Two thoughts about this -  
  
As you may know, one of the DBT coping methods is paced breathing. The evidence for this as a fast and effective way to calm down is excellent.  
  
The autonomic nervous system regulates all the aspects of the fight or flight response - heartbeat, sweat, etc. You can't control any of these except one - breathing, and your control of breathing lets you hack your ANS and get control of your mood.  
  
DBT paced breathing: breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
  
Therapist/researcher Steve Ilardi says, note the times of day and situations when you're most bothered by the thoughts, so you'll be ready for them. Be ready to stop, slow down, and get calm.",RWPossum,xowqnq

1,"aaw, sweetie don't be so hard on yourself. Really, worrying about it is only going to make it worse.

In general, when the tears come, taking some deep breaths and telling yourself it's okay, getting some fresh air, spashing your face with water and similar things can help.

However, with this type of pattern, I can't help but think there may be some underlying causes. The past three years have been tough on most of us and our social skills.

Be honest with yourself, are you okay? Has something been bothering you without you realising it? Have you maybe been bottling up some stuff that needs out? Crying isn't necessarily a bad thing. Yes, it's uncomfortable when it happens in public, but a good hard cry can actually be therapeutic. Crying releases stress hormones, which is why we usually feel better after a good cry. So. I'd say, have a good cry in the privacy of your home with plenty of huggables and ice cream (or whatever is comforting to you) and see if it helps. if the problem persists, consider seeking professional help or talking to someone you trust.

0,"Some thoughts that may be helpful:
1) I’m glad that you’re supporting your bf in every way you can. It’s difficult when someone we care about is struggling with an issue that may always be a part of their life. Remember to take care of yourself as well. It’s easy to lose ourselves trying to help someone else.
2) What has your bf’s experience been with [the practice of Radical Acceptance](https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/mind/mental-health/radical-acceptance)? Bipolar Disorder is a lifelong condition managed by therapy, medication, and self-care. If he’s hoping for a miracle treatment that just makes it all go away, that’s an unrealistic expectation. 
3) What are his experiences with [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://www.abct.org/fact-sheets/bipolar-disorder/) and [Reframing](https://www.allhealthnetwork.org/colorado-spirit/reframing-our-thoughts-to-have-positive-feelings/)?
4) Practicing [Gratitude](https://www.mindful.org/the-science-of-gratitude/) may also be of help to him.
5) You may want to discuss the above with your bf and his treatment team if they are not techniques that he’s been practicing already. It seems like you’re doing everything you can to be a supportive partner, and I hope that both you and your bf can find what you need for a healthier balance.",DontBrainMyDamage,15zp8cf
1,"Thanks for commenting, I'll address your points with some extra info.

1) Thank you for the reminder, I do try make sure to take time to take care for myself. We live apart, and I'd say we have healthy boundaries and communication, and I'd also say that I have a pretty solid support network outside of our relationship with friends and loved ones. I'm mainly reaching out as I feel like I want to cast a wider net to get some more varied or nuanced advice.

2) I'm assuming you meant borderline not bipolar. He's intimately familiar with Radical Acceptance as it's a huge part of DBT and something he's been practicing for many years now. I think in a way radical acceptance has almost lead him to ""accepting"" the bleak reality in his eyes that he's just exhausted every possible way forwards. He tells me how he just has to accept that he feels helpless, and that it's not even self-pity or pessimism because he's focusing on the facts of his situation (a result of DBT ""check the facts"" skills). He's definitely not expecting some magical treatment that makes it go away at all - he's more feeling absolutely out of options because he's tried so many options with very little change to this feeling of hopelessness.

3) He's done CBT and found it to be not entirely helpful. I can try and bring up reframing but I have a feeling he'll already have done it via DBT skills as it reads similarly to some of the skills in DBT. He said Schema therapy made a big difference earlier on in his journey though.

4) Gratitude seems like a good thing for me (and him) to look into, although there is a chance this is something he's already aware of too. Thank you.

5) Yes, I'm definitely going to push him to bring this issue up with his new mental health professional with his upcoming session. I just hope he doesn't feel like he's going through the same cycle of having a psych and nothing really changing, though, as I can tell he feels very burnt out on it all.",JeJappe,15zp8cf
2,"On your response for 2: Yes, bipolar was a typo. Apologies for missing it on my proofread. On your bf’s experience with DBT and Radical Acceptance, is he taking into consideration what his life was like prior to treatment and medication? Were you with him then? If so you can directly address the progress he’s made. It’s curious to me how he seems to have maintained a healthy relationship with you and doesn’t associate that with the work he’s put in to improve his situation.

3: Schema therapy evolved from CBT and borrows many of the same techniques. It’s interesting that his experience with Schema is more positive, but that may also be attributed to a good therapist with a complimentary therapeutic style that worked for him. Hopefully he and his new therapist can build towards that.

4: A good idea for incorporating Gratitude into your relationship would be to start off with them as the first part of your conversation for the day. Each of you chooses three things you’re grateful for and share it together. You can have a rule that only one Gratitude from the previous day can be repeated so you don’t fall into a complacent “I’ll just say the same things everyday” routine that takes the self-reflection out of the exercise.

5: The process with any new therapist is usually the same. The biggest difference tends to be their therapeutic style and technique. Your bf can always lead the session by starting with the techniques that are effective for him and he and his therapist can build from there.

You may also want to speak with your bf and his new treatment team regarding his antidepressant medication. If you’ve noticed that his hopelessness started around the same time he was prescribed the meds, either a dosage adjustment or alternate medication may help.",DontBrainMyDamage,15zp8cf

28,"Sorry to ask but BPD as in Bipolar or Borderline? Sometimes people get it confused lol so just clarifying. I was diagnosed Bipolar and then had a more thorough eval and was re-diagnosed with Borderline, so I think I can understand where you’re coming from a bit.

With either of these disorders I noticed a trend with ppl such as ourselves that as *soon* as someone says something triggering or upsetting it can turn us off immediately. It’s a slippery slope which is why it’s hard for us to hold relationships (assuming you’re like me). I had a therapist I liked and then he asked me questions about my sexual identity because they were conflicting with how I felt before and I immediately wanted to never discuss it again.

That being said, does this feel similar? Like you usually enjoy talking to them but they made one wrong assumption and you went off the deep end? As you know our disorders usually include having emotional extremes. Perhaps if you told the therapist you felt offended or taken aback it would help clarify the next steps?

And also I do agree sometimes we need a break from therapy. It’s good, but at the same time constantly talking about your issues can remind you of said issues, which can become obsessive and depressing.

>as soon as someone says something triggering or upsetting it can turn us off immediately.

This makes so much sense to me. When someone says something upsetting I can spiral and it will make me feel **awful** but I don't know if it can trigger a depressive episode. I'm sorry you had that experience with your therapist. I'm not sure if it can happen to me that one wrong assumption made me feel that way, what happens with this therapist is that she's super unprofessional and it makes me feel super uncomfortable, yet I still go see her, but I think I won't anymore. I once told her about the way I felt when I saw her constantly using her phone and not listening to me and the basically dismissed me, like it didn't matter or something.

1,"The most important thing of course if you ever have suicidal feelings is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. DBT, a therapy that helps borderline people - who are often very suicidal - recommends what they call distress tolerance methods.  
  
Article- DBT methods  
  
https://www.sunrisertc.com/distress-tolerance-skills  
  
These methods are good for maintaining stability, and if you like you can use them daily - any of of them or a combination.  
  
Marsha Linehan, who created DBT, was talking about the methods and two she emphasized were DBT paced breathing and distractions - things that change your mood, like a funny movie or video and beautiful music.  
  
Paced breathing - put a hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, then breathe gently while counting seconds - inhale to a count of 5, exhale to a count of 7. Breathe gently through your nose. You don't have to completely fill your lungs  
  
Psychiatrists Richard Brown and Patricia Gerbarg recommend using this exercise for 20 minutes twice a day, for anxiety. Inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
A good habit is responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.  
  
Childhood trauma and CPTSD  
  
In this video, author Anna Runkle talks about her study of Complex PTSD and summarizes treatments shown to help. She says that as a CPTSD survivor, the thing she has found most helpful to her is dealing with the symptom known as dysregulation, which is getting very upset. I would definitely see her videos on dysregulation.

I’m not a mental health professional but it sounds a lot like an extreme case of an anxious attachment injury. Do you fear abandonment?

Me and my boyfriend have been on and off more times than I can count, and he was the one who initiated the breakup every time. I'm not new to this rodeo, not at all... so once I was at the psych ward (he had admitted me) and I was calling and calling, begging for him back, screaming at the top of my lungs but he hung up on me out of fear. He was under the impression it was the ""right"" thing to do since our relationship was so unhealthy, but I couldn't bear it. I had all the nurses chasing after me, doing everything in their power to calm me down. I wasn't eating or sleeping. I felt like there was no way I could go on without him. I'm still this way, the only solace is his return. I've had so many moments I've worried I'll do something irreversible and impulsive during my most intense moments. You're not alone. I was even planning on flying to his house while we were apart (we're long distance) and begging at his doorstep. People insisted I'd get a restraining order against me or would even be tossed into prison. I was like this as a teenager too... with people I didn't even know. In adulthood, it got much, much uglier.

I know how hard it is. It's a living hell. I would suggest therapy asap. I'm on medication right now and it's sort of helping me manage.

It’s very easy to look at someone like Anfisa as abusive, annoying and arrogant.

0,"1. Yes, I did DBT for a year.

2. Yes, it helped me a lot.

3. Yes, I completed my DBT sessions in 2015 and the skills have stayed with me and offered a huge amount of help for my continued recovery.

4. To make it more efficient, honestly the big thing is deciding for yourself in your head if you really want to put the effort in. I was really against it at first and got kicked out of a few different therapy programs the first time around — they always said it was because I had such a severe personality disorder that they weren’t capable of helping me. But with this particular one, after I was asked to leave, I spent a year going through a DBT workbook by myself to teach myself to be more open to what they were teaching. Really had to work hard to sort of train myself out of the rigid black and white thinking, at least enough that I was able to take in what they were teaching when they went back. Then they did welcome me back to that group, and I had to put in a lot more hard work to make sure I wasn’t just taking up time fighting with the counsellors instead of admitting that I was uncomfortable. The way it worked for me was, 2 repeats of basic mindfulness practice, then cycle through each section of DBT going through each part twice in total.

5. For me, it wasn’t until my second time going through each section that I actually started to notice I was able to make changes that were helpful to me. That took about 5-7 months of just sticking through, taking the time to listen, and reminding myself that these people were not trying to attack me as a person, that they really were trying to help. By the final 5/6 months, the instructors were commenting on how I had become a grade A student in their course. Not gonna lie, that feeling of validation really kept me going through to the finish even though I didn’t say so at the time.",nilherm,7lokct
1,"For me, despite having borderline (comorbid schizoaffective) I didn't find it extremely useful however it was still pretty useful.

Disclaimer: While it was not for me to the fullest extent I do believe that it is great for most and will still promote it.

I have done DBT 3 times and what I found was that I had already practiced a lot of what was taught. I also grew sick of distracting myself from my problems so a lot of the self soothing techniques became quite redundant for me. Though they did help for a long time. 

One thimg I had a lot of trouble with was recognizing the emotions because it became apparent my emotions don't feel like other people's. For example they describe worry and fear as being in your stomach but for me its above my shoulders (like a feeling that exists outside my body). I am not sure if this is due to having a psychotic disorder though. 

The best advice I can give is don't quit even if it's not working out you need to try and try again before figuring out what works and what doesnt. 

Not everything they teach will apply to you in some cases but nonetheless keep at it.",unusuallyalice,7lokct

What helps you not to think so much in black and white?

Even after the training do you still use the skills you learned today?",druggedmonkey,7lokct
4,"Thanks for replying,

How did you found out what worked best for you? And was it a good thing to stop using some techniques even if they did not work that well? Didn't you miss out on some things?",druggedmonkey,7lokct
5,"One part would be asking questions and actually listening to the answer. For example, at first I was confused and uncomfortable because it didn’t seem ‘right’ to me to try and erase all free thinking with constant mindfulness. When I asked for clarification on that, they said it’s not about always being mindful and never letting your thoughts roam. It’s a grey area and it’s about finding balance. That was hard to grasp at first, but then with assessing situations when I found myself confused in the all or nothing thoughts, it slowly got easier to pick out what balance means in different situations. 

Another big part was confronting my attending counsellor to tell her that I had been viewing her in an ‘all bad’ way and hadn’t been able to acknowledge any of her good traits, and apologizing for being so argumentative with her when she was trying to help. Then also saying it would take time for me to learn to see her as a balanced person and there would still be times I’d see her as all bad, but that I was willing to work with her and learn. Ended up being hugely helpful to talk with her about that and we still have really positive appointments to this day.

Yes, I do still use the skills I learned. For me, as I got more into practicing the skills every day (for real, every single day) they slowly became my go-to reactions for difficult situations instead of a conscious effort to correct the harmful reactions.  Now they sort of just keep going all the time, every day, as a subconscious processing style to go through my day. It does take a lot of energy even though it’s not a conscious effort though, and I notice it when I get really sick because then I have to revert back to actively practicing the skills as my body doesn’t have the left over energy to keep it running in the background.

Edit: I would like to add — the biggest improvements that I noticed came long after I finished DBT and happened very slowly, over time, as I continued practicing every day. So the other user’s advice of sticking with it (even if it doesn’t seem to apply to you or really make sense at the time) is pretty important. And for me, through the consistent practice, I was able to find ways or make little changes that made the teachings more helpful for me personally than they were originally.",nilherm,7lokct
6,"I think all of them can be uaed depending on the situation and the person. I wouldn't say I stopped using techniques completely they just are hardly needed for me to function better. Like I'm a person that is up in their head a lot and I don't find grounding myself helps me solve problems but when the problem can't be solved it's beneficial even if only momentarily. Just to give an example.

I am more often than not in wise mind except when it is really bad-- i tend to go between the cold/logical/rayional mind and wise mind a lot. When I slip into emotion mind it is nowhere nearly as bad as it was before (though I've had my days).

Number 1 thing: don't let bad days discourage you either. This therapy will not work 100% of the time lile anything, 'radical' acceptance can be key sometimes. (I hate yhe word radical tbh)

2,"I'm not saying that this is all you need, and it really seems that you should be seeing a therapist, but there are evidence-based self-help methods for the problems you mention.

I want to focus on agoraphobia here, because being able to go out and about opens doors for you. The monotony of being inside is not good. Exercise and sunlight are lifestyle therapies.  
  
Advice from experts about the other problems at the end.   
  
Phobias are very treatable, although overcoming one can take patience and persistence.  
  
Psychiatrist David Burns is the self-help author recommended most often by mental health professionals.  
  
Basically, therapy for phobias, explained in The Feeling Good Handbook by David Burns, is making a list of situations, ranking them according to how scary you find them, and using that ranked list as your objectives. Imagining a situation can be an objective. Start with something really, really easy.   
  
What's the easiest objective for you? Maybe walking to the mailbox or just standing in the doorway of the front door. Have as many objectives as you like, and spend as much time on one as you like.  
  
The thing to remember is never go from objective A to objective B until you feel completely confident with A. Things that give you confidence are experience and slow breathing. There's enormous laboratory and clinical evidence  that slow breathing is effective for calming people down quickly.    
  
Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

3,"I mean, honestly 'anger issues' are a pretty commonly treated thing all by themselves. Reddit is probably gonna be more than happy to arm-chair diagnose you with anything from autism to BPD. You really just need to talk to the professionals you're already seeing. 

Legitimately, look into anger management. It's not the same as normal therapy in the way most people think of it. You'll be given more specific ""handle and regulate your emotions *right now* so you don't end up in jail"" type coping tools. The sense of urgency is different when we're talking ourselves down from a road rage incident vs. psyching up to make a phone call or something, you know? 

Getting tunnel vision about getting a diagnosis shouldn't be the goal here. Especially since anger and/or rage are super, super common symptoms for many, many disorders.

It amazes me how many people minimize my reaching out for help and assistance.  They minimize me when I say I have “Severe Anger Issues”.  They so easily chalk it up as “common and no big deal”.  So they will not change my meds.  I have started keeping a journal so that everything is documented and that I sought treatment and was denied and or taken as a joke!

I have been on meds for almost 10 years and they are no longer helping.  I have asked my PCP to change them or at least try something different?  I have requested to see a Psychiatrist for over 5 years now and my insurance company continues to reject this request.  They keep sending me to LCSW’s and Psychologist that cannot even prescribe medication or adjust my current meds.  

It’s ridiculous!  I am trying to reach out for help, practically begging for help… and everyone wants to minimize my efforts and write them off as no big deal…everyone is angry now a days.

9,"Honestly. Change your insurance.


Even medicaid covers mental Healthcare.


Have you looked into telehealth for your med situation?


Call your insurance and have them email you a list of psych providers that accept their plan. There are multiple levels of psych providers and most of them valid.

10,"I'm sorry for making you feel that way. It wasn't my intention. My intention was to commiserate and make you feel more heard and point out that anger and rage isn't a mystery illness, to underline the fact that help *is* available to you and that you aren't alone in this. 

&#x200B;

You didn't include the rest of this context in your initial post. Your primary care, insurance issues etc. were not mentioned. So I made the suggestion to communicate with whoever you are seeing, lacking the information to point you in a specific direction. 

What did your PCP say when you asked them to adjust your medication? When was the last time you talked to them about it? 

Your insurance company may need a referral from your primary care to send you to a psychiatrist. Have you brought this up specifically to your doctor? 

If you aren't getting help from your current physician, the best and most obvious next step is to find a new one. That can be pretty challenging/discouraging, but changing nothing won't help you. 

Talking to your therapist *specifically* about your anger and your concerns regarding it is really important. Based on your response here, I assume you did approach them with these concerns somehow and they ignored you or something? 

Have you talked to your therapist about your medication? They can't prescribe, but they can certainly work with the rest of your care team (PCP, psychologist, etc) to discuss your treatment plan. 

Have you looked into anger management specifically, or just regular therapy? As I mentioned in my initial comment, it *is not the same thing,* but you don't say whether or not that's something you've actually tried. Me asking this isn't meant to 'minimize your efforts'. I specifically said you *deserve credit* for trying to get this figured out. You biting my head off in the comment section isn't the plea for help you think it is. I'm trying to give you ideas and you're telling me it's not good enough and I'm part of the reason you'll explode. 

Rage and anger are serious issues. I would say you are right to be concerned. I hope the best for you.",triflinghuman,1antswa
11,"Yes. My insurance covers Psychiatrist…it just practically takes an act of congress to see a psychiatrist.  They want you to go through a chain of command starting with Social Workers, Counselors, Psychologists etc.

Thank You so much for the info regarding Psych nurses as well:  this is helpful!  Thank You!",Renz_51,1antswa
12,"I appreciate your follow up and I guess sometimes I read too much into things, so I apologize as well.  

I probably left out a lot of details because my post would probably be pages long otherwise.  (I have a hard time being short and concise).  

I have tried anger management.  This was about 3 years ago and I actually paid out of pocket because my insurance company denied the claims.  🙄.  

It was beneficial in helping me to identify a couple of triggers that I was unaware of, but the redirecting of my thought patterns didn’t seem to work.

I guess that’s why I was saying earlier, if they could somehow provide a “Diagnosis”.  It’s not like I want to be labeled as something, but whenever you need to address things with a mental health provider, physician or specialist, one of the first questions they ask is, what were you diagnosed with?  

While this may not necessarily be true, in my experience, medical professionals don’t take you very seriously without a diagnosis.  It also helps having a diagnosis because you can do your own independent research to help educate yourself and self manage while in therapy and or on meds.

Hope that makes sense!",Renz_51,1antswa
13,"My first psych provider was a psychiatric nurse practioner, he was awesome. I was his patient for 8 years before he retired. My next provider was a physicians assistant, she was also awesome. I then moved states and haven't clicked with any of my providers since then but my meds are prescribed and I can make changes to them as needed.


But yeah, if I were you I would change insurances because fuck that noise. Most insurances at most require a referral from another provider like your gp.


Also shame on your gp for not listening to you about the meds. Because frankly the meds could be causing your anger and irritation. It's a thing that can happen with ssris and a few other classes of medications. 


There are a bunch of meds to try out, even mood stabilizers like lamical that are used successfully for depression.",MyLife-is-a-diceRoll,1antswa

2,"A therapy called DBT is known to help with serious behavior problems like eating disorders, but getting access to it can be hard. It lasts at least 9 months and it has high drop-out rates.  A Psychiatric Times article reviews studies of a brief version called DBT skills training. Much lower drop-outs.  **Of all the things DBT-ST is good for, the best evidence is binge eating.**

1,"Hey,

Jealousy is a common trait for people. Everyone feels jealous at some point of time. But, it is important to not let it go out of your control.

If you are willing to get over this, you need to understand the root cause of jealousy. Jealousy occurs when one is not content from their life and they feel that they arent important/ unique. 

I personally used to get jealous of people sometimes. Then, instead of working on getting rid of jealousy, I worked on myself. That is, learning new skills, gaining knowledge, etc. Doing all of this, made me feel confident and I was proud of who I was. 

This made me less jealous over time.

2,"I don't know about you but when I get jealous, I just indulge in it. Through that, I could find the reason, the crux of my jealousy and try to work through it. Or I just straight up talk to the person I'm jealous with, usually, it helps you rationalize the situation and you realize that ""Oh, this person has shit to deal with too and we're all the same!"". Hope you the best!",TotalAdhesiveness778,nmpnmh
