1,Need advice for EMDR therapy ,"I have experienced a lot of trauma in my lifetime - mother brother addicted to drugs, loss of a parent, money being stolen by familu member on a frequent basis, accidents with lasting physical pain, beaten by a group of bad people.

I often relive these memories involuntarily and my mind and body reacts to them. There have been a lot of times where I find myself tackling the situations verbally, but myself while alone.

Is emdr therapy a good option?

This stemmed from being physically abused by my father as a child and emotionally neglected by my mother to this day. I’ve tried a range of cbt and dbt therapies nhs and private and nothing has really worked for me. The past 10 months I had been doing well and made 10 months self harm free but since I had my anti psychotics and antidepressant dosage reduced about an month ago I have deteriorated badly and really close to relapse. I was discharged from the cmht in January and moved house so I haven’t been referred to my new local one as I was stable until a few weeks ago. I can’t get much info on EMDR other than paying £150 upwards per session via priory. I can’t afford that I am a recent uni grad on a 25k a year job. Any help would be appreciated .

5,EMDR/Brainspotting,"I have gone through brainspotting (very similar to EMDR). I have ADHD and I question if my experience is similar to others. As I went through brain spotting and was trying to focus on reprocessing traumatic events in the past, I noticed my attention waning. Almost in a throbbing way. It would come and go, increasing and decreasing. I really had to muster up effort to concentrate. My therapist said this was normal. I want to know if it really is normal or if this is an indication of how my ADHD brain functions.

6,8th emdr session results,"It was a chill session, because the last two were super intense. Vibrations, on the modules I was holding, were set to low.

It was nice to take a break. The more I do these sessions, the more I realize that dealing with trauma as an adult sucks and dealing with it as a child is pure fucking terror. 

We talked more about how my explosive episodes are my lizard brain doing what it does to keep me alive, maybe even rejecting the dysfunctional situation before I have a chance to realize what's going on... I kind of like thinking that my body is looking out for number one. 

Other reactions could even be shitting/pissing/throwing up, something that happened to me as a kid!

I suddenly remembered and realized what the initial big trauma was. A memory of a nightmare I had always known about, but never associated with the trauma. I always thought it was because of a stupid movie I watched that scared me as a kid (it was Beetlejuice).

It was the connections that I made that felt like a revelation... Because the trauma was always there and the nightmare too, I don't forget things. It was making the connection that felt right.

7,9th EMDR session results...,"The more I do these sessions, the more I'm like wow the CPTSD is real. I could be stuck in this cycle of dysfunctional, self traumatizing cycle FOR LIFE. If not for these sessions. It kind of reaffirms how I can trust the healing process and do what works instead of feeling bad for feeling bad (for feeling bad and so on, ""chain sinning"" as one of my old mentors would put it).

It feels like living with a pinched nerve and I'm in constant pain and this is slowly healing and I can start to live my life and cross that wall of fear. Today at work I realized how scared I get at totally innocuous things.

During the session we talked about enjoying or giving permission to allow the inner child stuff to flourish. The example given was how with her family, she sees her niece or nephew acting out and how it's charming. When she acts out it's something she would automatically dislike or will disapprove of.

The session we connected on a deeply emotional level, where we could see eye to eye on a lot of things. The topic was on immaturity. I felt like the conversation had flowed naturally on the stuff I wanted to talk about. Sometimes I'll cry heavily on things that I feel immense gratitude for or for other people and how they would show empathy. That session I cried on our ability to communicate about very complex issues. It made me feel more trustworthy, of being able to hold complex, multi-dimensional, authentic, and genuine feelings outside of these sessions.

Tomorrow is the 10th session and I don't know if the max allotted are almost over for my insurance... My last therapist was CBT and we got to at least (from what he says) 12 or 13 hours of therapy so 12 sessions. I thought that was cool and I'm proud of going through that and doing the work.

All I know is that I'm trying really hard to trust the process and have patience... It definitely is giving me more of an outsider, observing ego, eagle eye type of perspective on myself and the world. I just imagine what it would be like to trust myself to fall asleep when I feel tired and to process my emotions and to actually regulate them to completion! Every day too!

9,5th emdr session results,"I'm sad all the time. My body is going through changes. I'm reliving the past.

Guys if you do EMDR, it helps to have a support team and to not do this alone. Also I saw someone recommend this type of therapy while someone was in a dysfunctional relationship... I would recommend also to do this alone (I know mixed messages), to focus on yourself and not a trauma bonded, crab bucket person. Also, do it sober please. Weed inhibits emotional growth.

Anyway, my appointment was this past Monday and the thing is, it is like I'm getting that same awareness I had when I first encountered a lot of my trauma growing up. I'm recognizing my shadow self more and more, this antagonistic, narcissistic, fragile, and insecure dude. All I can do is cry, because it makes me sad.

I'm missing out on all this beauty in the world, in favor for a weird, low effort, stress fantasy. All the times I'm this sheep in wolfs clothing, hurting others and being in insecure attack mode.

Though I'm also crying, when I think about powerful people doing good things in this world.

10,My 6th emdr sesh,"I'm learning all the different complexities of grief and how to express all those different dimensions in my own way. 

When the vibrating modules started to affect me and I got that dizzy feeling, nothing was coming out.

I suddenly needed to breathe and I started to hyper ventilate and then that went into some lamaze breathing and then I went through several waves of crying, mixed with breathing, mixed with making these animal noises that exposed and expressed what I was going through. 

It was quite profound and amazing getting to go there and start to develop and ground myself with these new emotional tools (the breathing and crying). 

Before this session, I've noticed (among many, many other things) that I'm watching way less porn and my desire to jerk off has decreased by 75%. I've only done it twice in the last two weeks. I think that's kind of cool.

Afterwards my therapist said we are slowly lowering the threshold. I'm 50/50 on knowing what that exactly means but she said we will take it slow.",1696968446.0,False,2,0,ds2316476,None,174uqn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/174uqn1/my_6th_emdr_sesh/
11,7th emdr therapy session results,"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fd5d5osyy3vwb1.png) is a cool recovery from depression starter pack picture that I found recently.

My 6th emdr therapy session ""gave me"" some heavy breathing techniques, to foster emotional depth by crying better and letting it flow easier.

This last session (7th one so far) was even crazier... PUN INTENDED.

That was last week. 8th one is tomorrow.

Thought I'd continue to post these, as I'm doing this for myself. It's a progress thing.

I came home and couldn't stop talking.

I realized that my three brains weren't working in tandem. Physical, logical, and emotional brain. I'm not operating at the center of my boundaries, but the outer rim and working my way back to the center. 

I realized that my emotional brain is an invisible, uncontrollable thing. Imagine something like that living inside of you and the only thing you can do is feed it. What you feed it, shapes the metaphor ""you are what you eat"". My emotional brain swells up and blocks out everything else, when I feel upset. I've been re-traumatizing myself over and over my whole life.

Emotions aren't a logical thing, they are dumb af simple. Happy is happy, sad is sad. Emotions have been inside of us since we were born, much like the deer who is born with the ability to escape a predator from the second it lands on its feet.

Is shame an emotion? Is it an invented concept that only fosters destruction?

I came to realize that emotional maturity is boiled down to one thing, building the relationship I have with myself.

It's funny because I'm fully aware of all my trauma, it is just all unprocessed. I've been affected by what I can only describe as being groomed to be a violent, creepy adult.

This is the first time I've ever been scared of therapy, as before I just dove in head first and rattled off all the bad stuff that happened to me over and over. The good news is that I no longer have the shakes or the chills when bringing up trauma. I can safely cry and not feel too overwhelmed by the EMDR therapy.

The even better news, is that EMDR therapy works really well. It's like using the ducest brainstem stimulator for cpstd or electroshock therapy to treat seizures. I can feel my emotions again and I'm starting to enjoy things that I would otherwise ignore because of all the trauma distractions.

20,EMDR saved my life,"
Hi! So I have a lot of trauma in many different aspects of life. After 20 years of talk therapy and CBT for my depression, C-PTSD, anxiety, BPD, adhd and autism. Finally, I started EMDR about 4 months ago. I can 10000% say it changed my life. Saved my life even. I notice everybody mentions the obvious benefits that comes with EMDR but I notice so many more with every session I do I seem to get better and better. Of course I can only assume with me processing these demons, it has given me new clarity and allowed me to be..me? But at the same time I feel like doing this therapy connected neurological pathways in my brain that just didn’t exist before and it’s allowing me to function more normally as a person without intense triggers clouding my existence. So here’s a comprehensive list of my experience so far! I post this in the hopes that others can relate and get validation in their journey to healing because it’s hard to believe that you might actually be okay for once!! And if you aren’t seeing all these benefits or even none at all, please don’t get discouraged. Everyone has their own timeline when it comes to healing and you cannot compare that to anyone else’s. And I also have 20 years of experience and a thorough education on psychology so I have a huge upper hand. If you are thinking about EMDR, I encourage you to go for it!! And if you’re already doing it, then bravo! Either way, you are brave, you are important and you are a survivor. Everyday you survive is a success no matter what. 💕

21,Has anyone used EMDR to help with serious diagnoses like schizoaffective disorder (undiagnosed) without meds,"I’m early in my diagnosis but my therapist think I may have schizoaffective disorder. 

I am hearing constant thoughts in my head. Not necessarily different voices but like my own thoughts that are mean and nonstop. Like if I ask “I am…” I will hear my thoughts say “stupid, a loser, ugly” immediately. Not my own thoughts. They will just have such a negative response in my head to lots. 

There is a disconnect between my mind and body. My mind is “normal” and present but my body goes into fear-mode where I will be sitting down doing something and my heart will race (blood pressure goes to 85 BOM at rest when my normal is 50-60), I will feel fright, heavy chest, and it just lingers like my body goes into panic-mode. My conscious self mind is like, “what is going on… I’m literally fine” but I just have to let my body do its thing. It happens multiple times throughout the day. 

I haven’t been diagnosed with anything but my therapist seems to think it’s a response to old abandonment issues brought up in EMDR and an herb spiritual retreat that cause psychosis a month ago. She thinks as a theory my body is going into “I am scared and need help” mode so that I will be nurtured… like what I did not have during my abandonment 0-6 months then 6-11 months at the orphanage. Like my brain is misinterpreting that I am safe now. 

She seems to think meds just patch it and that you can still have this issue with meds. So basically that I shouldn’t take antipsychotics (not that I have yet been given them) and instead should work EMDR with her to rewire my brain to not see a threat and not panic my body. And that things like running in place and ice could try to trick my brain out of panic mode. Is this true or stupid to not try to take meds for this? 

I’m getting drained by my body racing and going into fright mode while my brain is trying to be present and feel through it. Plus the constant thinking and mean thoughts are not me…",1710432595.0,False,2,0,Material_Leopard_175,None,1beoucv,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1beoucv/has_anyone_used_emdr_to_help_with_serious/

23,EMDR for CPTSD?,"EMDR for CPTSD?

Hey guys. So I was recently diagnosed with PTSD. Long story short I was in the Marine Corps for 4 years, and right at the end of my contract I was in Kabul for the evacuation. I witnessed most of everything there from the mass human suffering in the crowds to the people falling off of the planes to seeing fellow blown-up service members getting casevaced. I got out in January of this year and have been struggling with the symptoms with PTSD and to this day it is untreated. 

I do not know if I have C-PTSD, but I have been through a few hardships in my life that I have listed

-Moving to a new state and new school at 11 years old

-Getting severely bullied in middle school because I was the new kid

-Was in a dangerous accident on the road, no crash but a tire blew on the interstate, my grandmother who was driving managed to avoid all the cars. No one hurt but that was the first time I felt I came close to death

-Joining the Marine Corps infantry, just an intense transition from civilian to that

-Kabul evac

-Transitioning out of the military, leaving all friends behind, dealing with going from having friends to having no friends.

I would assume these things would validate CPTSD? I do not believe i showed symptoms before Kabul but i definitely am now. Is it worth it to try for EMDR? And ive given up on waiting on the fucking VA. Ive waited all year on them and nothing has come of it.

24,How should the target traumas be like at EMDR Session?,"

Hey there, hope you guys can help me here:
I have panic attacks for almost 8 years now. Seen a therapist (pyschodynamic therapy-talk therapy) for 3 years and it helped me understand myself and my root issues (they are mostly related to my early childhood traumas but i can recall them just have an idea) and some events with my family when i about to marry triggered me, at least that is what we discovered.
since then, ive got panic attacks in the places that i fear that i cant runaway easily.

But i worked on mindfulness i read a lot and i exposed myself to situations that trigger my attacks. I managed it to a good level to live my life but it is not enough to have a fulfill life. My body still automatically reacts at the beginning of those events and i take control. But everytime it is like that. I cant live in flow. 

So im starting to EMDR therapy and i wanna ask you guys 2 questions:

1-can the panic attacks themselves be a target trauma to work on (i feel like it can but some research online and they say no) (i have an idea on my root issues, they are from family but it is the panic memories that are making me scare to have one again)

2-should you remember your traumas to work with an emdr therapist or can you remember or guess during the therapy?",1694600486.0,False,1,0,Mobile_Plane7445,None,16hja76,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16hja76/how_should_the_target_traumas_be_like_at_emdr/

Ive been havinfg anxiety (GAD) for 8 years and seen a therapist who was making psychodynamic therapy for 3 years. After i end the therapy i made mindfulness meditations, exposures myself and got better. But still im not in my best. I still have anticipation anxiety before the events and during the events that used to have me attacks. And some core beliefs around that. (I cant do it so dont wanna do it etc.) I wanna do future plans in a relaxed way and dont want to be afraid of doing things. Even if i manage to do things, the next time i will be again afraid to do and it is a cycle.

So im now starting to EMDR. Do you think it is an advantage to have years of talk therapy and understand yourself and also expose yourself to situations (managing the anxiety attacks)

29,"After my 4th EMDR sesh, I finally feel an acceptance of crying.","In self help they say, ""grief is the doorway to emotion"" and ""follow the grief down"". I was trying to learn what that means for me, because a lot of what I do is just a blind dive.

After crying in EMDR sesh (therapist has me hold two vibrating objects that alternate between left and right vibrations while we talk) I felt good. 

When I cried before as a kid, I HATED IT. It didn't feel right. I felt humiliation. It was embarrassing. I felt a very strong pang of acidity in my gut. 

So now I'm feeling very full circle right now. I can cry and it feels GOOD? Like REALLY good! It's almost as if all the normal coping mechanisms for regulating and processing stuff, was twisted into some kind of dysfunctional carnage from the shit I grew up with.

It's freaking wild and I can't wait to run these therapy sessions through. I didn't know my complex emotions can feel better than drugs. I believe now that my emotions were turning against me constantly. No wonder I needed to escape them...

Anyway I'm just excited and I felt like sharing... 

By the way, I get my therapy sessions for free from the county and I had to specifically ask for EMDR. Normally it's twice a month, allotted 12 sessions a year. But sometimes the therapist will let you come in more if they are cool... good luck everyone... stay safe <3",1695947305.0,False,5,0,ds2316476,None,16uwt8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16uwt8i/after_my_4th_emdr_sesh_i_finally_feel_an/
30,OMG Brainspotting and EMDR therapy changed my life! (with advise on why EMDR failed me in the past),"This is a repost from a PTSD group, and judging by the positive reactions from my fellow survivors there, I felt many in this group could benefit from my story as well.

(It begins with my original story on Brainspotting, and concludes with a 3 month update below, outlining how I feel now, why EMDR didnt work for me before and why EMDR works for me now)

I am writing this the night of my first mind blowing experience with this therapy.

4 years of talk therapy for me did nothing. (Results may vary for each person. It may work for you, it just didn’t for me).

So I looked into EMDR, because it was hailed as the best for PTSD and especially after reading “The Body Keeps the Score.”

But 8 or 9 sessions in and I just wasn’t getting it. Feeling it. Just… nothing.

I was about to quit yet another form of therapy.

Then, my EMDR therapist said “hey, I just got certified in something called brain spotting. Wanna give it a go?”

“Sure. What is it?”

She then held up a stick with a little ball on the end, looked like a magic wand.

(This was Telehealth by the way.)

“I’m going to to move this very slowly down the screen while you think about the traumatic event we’ve been working on. When you feel something, tell me when to stop.”

“Something?” I said. “Like what?”

“You’ll know when you feel it,” she said.

“This is total woo woo new-age bullshit I am about to waste my hard earned money on…” I thought. “But, to hell with it. Got nothing to lose.”

“Just keep your head still and follow with your eyes,” she calmly said.

She then proceeded to move the wand down the screen. Very slowly.

Nothing.

Nothing.

Okay a little something.

Okay there is pressure in my head.

Wow, this is getting intense.

My face red, and tears forming in my eyes I struggled to finally say “right there.”

I felt it coming to the surface.

She did the same horizontally across the screen.

Nothing, nothing, then BAM! A new spot.

After a couple other movements across the screen that yielded nothing, she asked which of the two previous spots felt stronger.

I chose the one, where the little ball rested just below her chin.

For the next 40 minutes, in total complete silence, she held the wand in that position and I just stared at it.

It was an emotional explosion! I cried like I never had in therapy before. The event would come to the forefront of my mind and I could literally feel it “working it’s way forward and out!”

I cried so much staring at that ball that snot was pouring out my nose as i deep weeped.

My mind started with what I felt was my top trauma, then it suddenly shifted to my brothers death - which was 5 years ago and I felt I had handled it well at the time, all things considered.

But my brain was now telling me that I hadn’t processed it yet.

And now it was time to do that.

Suddenly, I balled like a child. My subconscious showed me that I had blamed myself partly for his passing - because I wasn’t there to help him.

I went from surprise, to sadness, to anger, then … self forgiveness.

Actual, real, self forgiveness.

There really wasn’t anything I could have done to prevent it. And suddenly, I embodied that feeling deeply.

My emotions oscillated on extremes for the entire 40 minutes. My mind was … FIXING THE BURIED!

And all I did WAS STARE AT A BALL ON THE END OF A STICK!

What??????

More was done in silence in 40 minutes than 4 years of talking.

And I could just simply FEEL it working.

I can’t explain it, but I was just more clear in my head afterwards. Lighter.

My therapist gently smiled and said “I think we found the modality that works for you.”

I cried even more when she said that.

Because I knew she was right. I felt like I had reached my therapy “home,” at last.

It was brutal and hard- and thats how i knew it was where my healing journey was about to finally begin.

I booked her for weekly visits for two months out, wiped the snot from my nose, cancelled my appointments for the rest of the day and went for a walk in the sun - my mind clear and face grinning for the first time in ages. :)

07/27/22 UPDATE:

Hey all! Sorry for the delay. Going through a move to a new city but wanted to update you guys on my progress.

I have to say, I’ve felt … different. Better, different. Anixety is down 50-60% and depression has also subsisded to similar levels.

Sessions 1-4, were intense, non stop crying for long bouts. 5-7 was about 1/2 crying and “trauma work out.” And last session was … no crying.

I was shocked.

So shocked that i said “okay, let’s try EMDR.”

That’s when I found out what I was doing “wrong” with EMDR before and why it wasn’t working.

She moved her wand across the screen at a steady back and forth pace for up to 10 minutes. Somewhere along minute 6 or 7 I could feel the trauma coming forward, same as brain spotting (though not as intense now given my precious brain spotting sessions).

It turns out, EMDR didn’t work before because the therapists would only have me following the light or finger (or pulse pads) for at most 30 seconds. It never felt like enough time to dig deep.

And this therapist showed me that different brains need different amounts of time to process the movement.

So now we have shifted to EMDR for a couple sessions to see what we can “work out” still. I won’t stop until 30 minutes of spotting or EMDR produces nothing. And I feel oh so close! Perhaps only a month or so away.

Before, I was having numerous bouts of autistic levels of “stimmings,” extreme agoraphobia where I couldn’t leave my bed for fear of, well, everything, and my brain was so pressurized with trauma, I could cry at moment on any day, and this was almost every day since the incident that catalyzed all these feelings. (I was incarcerated in another country for a crime I didn’t commit, and was treated quite horribly as a result, placed in solitary confinement with no books or outside world contact, only to be proven innocent months later, once all the damage was done).

I still have anxieties, and pace the room sometimes, but it’s about 80% less than it used to be.

So I would call that a HUGE win.

I know how hard it can be to find a good therapist. But honestly, while mine is amazing, this therapy kind of does the work itself, you just need to make sure you are with someone that is

A) trained in it (obviously)

B) one you can trust being vulnerale with when the emotions (and snot and tears) come pouring forth.

If EMDR failed in the past, just ask the therapist to do the bilateral motion longer. If the therapist gets physically tired of moving their finger back and forth, ask for the pulse pads or that they use a wand with a ball on it and to place it propped against the edge of the desk so they can swivel it like pendulum, keeping its motion consistent and not wearing out the therapist’s arm.

I feel light bars might be best here, at least for me.

I hope this update inspires some of you who didn’t “feel” EMDR working or wanted another option to talk therapy.

It does work.

It sounds so new agey. Or bogus.

But man, after years of talk therapy, this is the only thing that made me function again. It was like digging up the traumatic roots inside my brain.

I hope all of you find the emotional comfort you deserve.

You are worth it.

You can get better.

The chains can be broken.

38,Venting (Abuse etc.) and scared about what I'll experience in EMDR therapy,"**(new to reddit, sorry if this is a lot)**  
My upbringing was very distressing from what I've been told from the actual adults in my life.   
I know from the few memories that I do have of living with my parents that I was constantly abused and blamed for things that were not my fault. Daily beatings for not doing or doing something, verbal abuse, mentally ill & drug abusing parents, etc.   
When I was 16 I started therapy and my therapist started mentioning EMDR right before recently switching due to aging out, and my new therapist mentioned EMDR as well, this time with C-PTSD and this thing I experience apparently called Structural Dissociation, things I don't know much about yet. I'm not sure what I'll experience, and I'm scared I might react wrong and build more hatred for my parents. I ""loved"" my parents until recently, I guess.   
**Venting about parents and sibling mostly TW: SA:** In June of this year I was hospitalized for safety reasons (for myself) and while I was in the hospital, my sister, who I have never gotten along with and is the family favorite accused me of SA. Being in the hospital, I had no way to defend myself, and of course my parents took her side, leaving me without most of my significant family, and I'm pretty sure she's building some sort of case against me. Right before I went into the hospital I lost my best friend of 4 years, so everything in my life has basically exploded and now I'm left with the pieces. All of what's happened recently and in my past got me thinking about if I really want to have family anymore, and can I really trust anyone? I feel like I should be mad at the world, but I still want to love people, I still want to be there for people, I don't want to give up on love and relationships, but this year has really hurt me.

39,EMDR therapy for behaviours formed in childhood,"I didn’t have a terrible upbringing in comparison to others, but my parents both had drinking problems and frequently had very heated and occasionally aggressive/violent arguments, often handled very poorly, spilling out towards me. It’s beginning to become clear through therapy that a lot of this came from their insecurity, fear, feelings of self-worth and their own childhoods. I have worked hard through talking therapies to address these experiences, but I have a destructive tendency to lash out myself in arguments, belittling and shutting down my parter whenever I feel like I’m not being listened to, patronised or threatened. I don’t get physically aggressive but I don’t deal with confrontation well and tend to go on the offensive in a way that has ruined relationships in the past and is destroying my current one. 

My therapist recommended EMDR as a way to address these experiences. I have quite ‘woolly’ memories of these things happening as a child, almost like they’re repressed and I’m therefore finding it hard to work through the root of the behaviours. I’m keen and motivated to change the way I act, but I find I get such a strong overriding emotion when threatened that I struggle to resolve it in a more constructive way.

59,What is EMDR?," 

EMDR, or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, is a partially physical treatment in psychotherapy used to reduce psychological pain associated with trauma. It involves watching a light move back and forth, tapping your hands on your legs, or holding two small vibrating paddles, one in each hand, while letting your brain relive a traumatic event. The physical component (be it the moving light, the tapping hands, or the vibrating paddles), causes bilateral stimulation. When combined with the brain’s amazing ability to make sense of complicated feelings and situations, effective healing can occur.

We have two hemispheres in our brains; the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere. They are connected in the middle by a part of the brain called the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum does the job of communicating thoughts, memories, emotions, and other information between the two hemispheres. When you experience a traumatic event, your brain makes a fixed memory, including all of the physical and emotional feelings you had at that moment. This is sometimes referred to as a “flashbulb memory” (flashbulbs were used with old cameras as the necessary light source for a photo), because the image is frozen in your mind in great detail, and details will remain there, largely unchanged, for years. It is important to note that most memories are extremely flimsy and subject to change, even from hour to hour. Flashbulb memories are different. They are “stuck” in a neural memory network in a specific part of your brain and are cut off from the rest of your brain. Anything that comes in contact with this “stuck” part of your brain will be negatively affected by your trauma. The stuck trauma can cause negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This is where EMDR comes in.

Bilateral stimulation means that both hemispheres are stimulated alternatingly (right brain, then left brain, then right brain, then left brain, and so on). Bilateral stimulation is the crucial element in EMDR because it aides the corpus callosum in communicating between the two hemispheres of the brain. Switching so rapidly from side to side helps break up the “stuck” memory, and put its emotional components back into more appropriate or healthy places in your brain. In layman’s terms, bilateral stimulation allows troubling thoughts and feelings to go back into the parts of the brain where they belong.

So what happens when you undergo EMDR? With the help of a therapist, you take an initial reading of how disturbing the traumatic memory feels on a scale from 0-7, and then how true a specific, applicable negative statement of your choosing about the memory (Ex. “I cannot protect myself”, “I should have known better”, “I am worthless”, and so on) feels on a scale from 0-7. These numbers are your baseline, and you will revisit them before and after each session, with the ultimate goal of getting to a reading of 0 in terms of how disturbing the memory is and a reading of 0 on how true the negative cognition feels. You will also choose an opposite, positive statement that you would like to believe (“I can protect myself”, “I can trust my judgment”, “I have value”) and will be asked how true that statement feels on a scale from 1-10 at the end of each session to assess your progress.

When you start the process itself, you will take a tapper into each hand (I will use the vibrating paddles, also called “tappers”, for this example, since this is the method my therapist uses with me) and the therapist will tell you to close your eyes and put yourself into your memory of the trauma. She will start the tappers and adjust the speed and intensity of the vibrations. She will tell you to take a few slow, deep breaths, and to bring the traumatic memory up in your mind. After that, she will fall silent, and you will be in your own head. You start at the specific traumatic memory, but your brain will move to other memories and thoughts, and sometimes even daydreams or fantasies. All of this is normal and helpful. My therapist says that “the brain knows what it needs” and will take you wherever it needs to go in order to heal itself. I’ve had memories, affirmational true thoughts, and even daydreams where my adult-self interacted with my child-self in a very old memory. I’ve been told that this is common; sometimes the adult-self will enter a childhood memory to offer support or guidance to the remembered child-self as part of the healing process. There’s no wrong way to process. The only time you’re not “doing it right” is if you shut down and stay in a pleasant, unrelated memory out of fear of processing the trauma, or you get stuck on one thought and can’t move forward. Even if this happens to you, don’t fret, because this is why you’re doing this with a trained therapist. Your therapist will stop you every few minutes, tell you to take a deep breath, and ask you what you are experiencing, and as long as you haven’t shut down and you’re not stuck in the same place you were the last time she checked, she will just say “Good. Go with that”, and you will close your eyes, resume bilateral stimulation, and continue to mentally wander. If you do shut down or get stuck, she will bring you back to the initial memory with which you began your session, and you will go from there. If you continue to get stuck, your therapist may choose to end your EMDR session for the day and go into “Safe Place” to calm down.

“Safe Place” is a place of your choosing, real or imaginary, where you feel calm and safe. You bring it up in your mind and try to imagine every detail of what you would sense if you were really there. Sight, smell, touch, sound, and taste are all part of the total picture of your safe place. You hold the tappers and use Safe Place to end your session of EMDR, whether you got stuck or you were able to do an entire session. Your therapist will turn down the speed and intensity of the tappers while you meditate on your safe place. After a couple of minutes, she will switch the tappers off and tell you to take a deep breath and open your eyes. She will ask you what your distress level is. If you are still bothered, you will do another few minutes of Safe Place. You can choose to do multiple sessions of Safe Place if that’s what you need to calm down. This is *your* journey of healing, after all.

Lastly, your therapist will take down the new measurements of your distress level, how true the negative statement feels, and how true the positive statement feels. This record is important for keeping track of your emotional responses to the treatment, especially if you do multiple sessions, which most people need. The first one or two sessions of EMDR are intense and can be very upsetting, but the benefits are enormous because you can change your entire perception of a lifelong trauma in (possibly) as little as three weeks in a row of one session a week. You can change the way you relate to a memory that has haunted you your entire life. It is recommended that on days that you do EMDR you set aside some time after your appointment to relax, write, meditate, or cry; time to do whatever you do to calm down. EMDR can trigger bad feelings. It can also trigger seemingly unrelated memories for weeks afterward. These memories can be positive, negative, or neutral, and may not have anything to do with your processing. This is your brain “rearranging” itself, and is common.

There are multiple types of EMDR: traditional and feeling-sense. What I described above is traditional EMDR. Feeling-sense is slightly different. I used both methods to address my issues with food and overeating. Feeling-sense is when instead of starting with a traumatic memory, you start with all the physical and psychological feelings you have while doing an unwanted but pleasurable activity, like overeating. You focus on this feeling, living through every moment while holding the tappers. Every few minutes, you will be stopped and the level of intensity of your desire to engage in that activity will be measured. Your goal is to get to a measurement of 0 desire to engage in that activity. You repeat the process of thinking through the pleasurable activity as many times as it takes to get down to 0. You can choose whether or not to conclude with Safe Place.

EMDR was controversial at its inception, but the more studies come out, the more evidence we have that it works. I am not a doctor or therapist; I am only a patient. I know it has worked well for me on several issues in my life. My EMDR work on my relationship with food helped me lose 120 pounds. Now it feels really good to eat well and rather unpleasant to eat a pot full of Kraft mac and cheese. It has also helped me with traumatic childhood events that gave me problems with negative emotions and behaviors as an adult, and I don’t have those problems or engage in those behaviors anymore. EMDR is a relatively fast way to address deep-seated wounds. It can change the way you relate to both your trauma and the painful feelings that have built up on top of that trauma for years. I believe in this technology, and I am grateful that this tool is available to me. If you are in the market for a therapist, it would be well worth your while to find one trained in EMDR.

65,EMDR vs Family Systems Therapy,"I finally contacted a therapist in my new city about EMDR. I've been wanting to try EMDR for my CPTSD. In the initial email I sent to the therapist I mentioned covert incest. 

She normally does 30 minute phone consultations with 1st time patients, but She was in a hurry because she was leaving town for a week so ours was all of 10 minutes, and basically just her seeing when I was available next. I agreed to just schedule a first therapy session. 

I told her I was interested in EMDR and that I had spoken to a therapist in my old city, who I went to specifically for that therapy, and I almost started before I had to leave to get a new job. 

This person went on about how she doesn't normally do EMDR and prefers family systems. I looked into it and am not sure if that's a right fit. I didn't over email or the phone (because there was not time) mention the very violent aspects of my childhood or the overt sexual abuse. I read that some think Family Systems can be detrimental in cases of physical abuse. I now kind of feel like I was rushed off... which I was, and she thinks I'm just some whiney rich kid with a mean mom.

69,Anyone recommend EMDR for trauma or ADD meds for anxiety?,"My anxiety has been untreated nearly my whole life. Recently, my sister whose also a psychiatrist linked certain forms of ADD to anxiety, at least in our family and the family she married into and had kids with. Her, her husband and one of her three kids especially prone to anxiety have gone on slow-release ADD medication and have praised it deeply, however she credits most of her recovery from crippling anxiety to learning about, becoming certified in/practicing, and having EMDR therapy done for herself. She recommends it VIGOROUSLY. 

About me: I have had crippling but somehow also high-functioning anxiety as long as I can remember. Experienced plenty of trauma, from parents divorcing, mother diagnosed with and fighting cancer twice, passing away from complications from cancer a week after my high school graduation, harsh breakups, being cheated on repeatedly, an abusive marriage in which I watched my stepson be emotionally and mentally abused repeatedly, took custody of him when she went and had an affair and fucked off for a year and she saw him and our son together maybe 4 or 5 times for a few hours apiece, then had custody of the stepson legally taken away by her... I could go on and on.

We have resolved one major issue with talk therapy, and currently we are tackling the problem that I fizzle under anything challenging, and exhibit self destructive behavior. During my childhood academic life, my mom was overbearing and would constantly yell at me when I would get bad grades, or didn't follow her ""study plans"" and micromanaged everything I did up until I was 17. Fast forward to my Senior Year of University, and I am skirting by with a 2.8 and I am horrific at basic tasks like admitting I need help, admitting I dont know something and following through in schedules and setting timelines. Anything that I cannot succeed in with raw talent I fail almost guaranteed. This is true for all parts of my life, relationships (almost exclusively with women that dont challenge me at all) music (have not challenged myself musically in almost a decade, even though my parents support it) and especially academics (I virtually never ask any other human for help for fear of seeming unintelligent or lazy, but use online resources like crazy).

With that background,  my therapist hypothesized I have a fear of feeling inadequate or failing and suggested EMDR to tackle it since it was so embedded in my personality. She is a certified practitioner by EMDRIA and thinks it will be successful.

Maybe its just the video is not a great reflection?


If you assume the is some efficacy in this treatment then I can see that treating a specific event like being in an earth quake could work.

But if the trauma is complex in nature as in my case its not one specific event its a sort of smear of multiple interlinking events otherwise known as my childhood (LOL). It seems that focusing in on something specific to ""de program"" is from my minds view a bit chaotic and unwinding to even know where to start. some of the things that need working out have been consciously set aside by me because ""i have enough to deal with already"" So....

1. is emdr a real ""thing"" as in is this accpeted genrally as a legitimate treatment

2. IS it any good for dealing with multiple traumas.

3. how does the buried stuff factor in to this, should it be worked through first?.

4. IF it is worth a try. Is it something that I could try on my own or should I seek professional helpp first ""i may do more harm than good?.

I never thought I'd get to this point! My life is on track, finally, at 34 years old. Better late than never 🙏

90,19M Struggle with behavior patterns,"I’m in a unique situation such as my mind has developed enough to recognize my patterns of how I think of others thoughts of what I’m doing, about to do, or have done. I have a really hard time just engaging and listening to people during conversations because my mind is filled with these thoughts. I noticed in some cases I would even imagine a person that who I seem to care what they think of me a lot, and my subconscious would ask a “why” question about myself in which I would respond out loud why as if they where there. 

My anxiety over these thoughts have had a huge impact on my relationships and work life. I feel I lack core values and I haven’t found out my true self as of yet because in a lot of social encounters I’m thinking of what someone else would say instead of what I would say. I recently adopted meditation into my routine and have a couple of mental tricks to help me out but it still haunts me even tho there was a point I felt just a little free.

91,Could use advice on how to deal with a brutal inner critic,"Hello all,

As the title suggests, I'm looking for advice, specifically on coping skills or behaviors for having an inner critic that is pretty intense. It's been there for a long time, ever since I was young, but after starting emdr therapy I have grown more in touch with my emotions, which in turn makes it much more difficult to tune the critic out.

My therapist believes that with emdr we can tame it, and there has been some success with our intro sessions, but it will take a while, and in the meantime the inner voice is making me absolutely miserable. If someone in real life treated me like the critic does, I would consider them cruel and abusive, if not outright dangerous, but since it is a part of me I can't cut it out of my life, much as my younger self would have liked that. 

It's gotten to the point that the relentless internal messaging is impacting my job performance and overall life to a painful and exhausting degree. There is a bully in my head and she despises me, regardless of my attempts to be kind and make peace with it. If anyone has some advice, I would very much appreciate it.

92,I felt a shift in my head(brain) after my last EMDR session (surely only a good sign haha) :),"To make a long story short I had a bad drug experience where I thought I lost everyone in my life and that they were all dead. This was roughly two months ago. This seemed to have a terrible effect on my brain and me the following day and I can’t describe the feelings I had. I felt so anxious and depressed and nothing felt real. It was like my brain was still telling me that the people in my life are still gone but logically I knew they weren’t. I couldn’t emotionally  feel anything. I started therapy a month ago and in my last session (3rd EMDR session) I talked about what happened that night. I told myself everyone was still there and I’m not alone anymore and I cried with sadness and happiness throughout. This might sound stupid or crazy but I could literally feel something moving in my brain for a day. It was like there was a knot in my head and untied a bit. As if there was a release of some pressure. It was so weird and powerful but yet so amazing as I can literally feel me becoming ME again if that makes sense. The next few days I have started to feel way better and can see massive improvements already. I can connect a small bit back to people again.

99,Has anyone had any success with any therapy other than talk therapy? How have these alternatives worked out for you? Considering ECT and EMDR,"After 8 years of bouncing between 5 long term therapists, I've come to the conclusion that talk therapy isn't for me and that I'm finally stopping talk therapy.

I feel like I'm paying 80$ a session to talk with someone who tells me things about myself that I already know (' it seems like that you get really discouraged when you fail a test that you studied for when you didn't understand the material, I think because all throughout your life your parents have stressed that grades determine your college options, which determines the likelihood that companies will hire based on the prestige of the school, which will determine whether or you have a good career, which will set you up for the rest of your life""..... which like, I've known for years..)

My current therapist especially doesn't beat around the bush with me. I once asked her what my options were if I wanted to discontinue therapy, and she said she could recommend me to other therapists, I could go to psych wards constantly, or file for disability. I was taken aback at how extreme the option she listed was. She's very forward, and in her doing so, it makes me anxious to go to sessions because I feel like she's putting me down without intentionally meaning to. It makes me feel guilty for having problems and my mindset.

I've looked into alternatives, primarily Electro Convulsive and the Eye Movement one.  They seem like they'd work. It seems like (from my reading up on it) a short term process for a long term--I think up to 6 months?-- solution

102,"""I'm pretty sure it is real...to her!"" EMDR had me remember first time my reality was validated by my Edad.","First of all EMDR really is great for working through all of my past traumas. However, it can be hard. Last year I woke up in a hospital bald and with two weeks of post traumatic amnesia and a broken femur and pelvis. I have already processed that in EMDR and it helped me heal and overcome that injury and get back to my job and passion.

However, I have just started on some new things in EMDR and my therapist is pleased and thinks we are finally getting to the ""deep work"" and ""really important stuff."" Last week we processed my ""fear of being alone."" Not only would I like to share this one memory, that was revealed to me as the first time I had my reality validated by a parent, but I would also like to share some other things I learned from that processing.

I'm sure many of you are overcoming some of the same problems as well, and may have already had some of these realizations (different ones, but what makes you YOU) or are in search of them on your journey. It is crazy how DEEP these emotional scars and wounds are, that I literally cried way harder in this session, than in even processing waking up in a hospital bald!

In this memory, I had post-partum depression right after my son was born and was living with Nmom and my Edad when they were still married 8 years ago. (I'm so grateful that they are no longer married. He is such an excellent parent/person NOW that he doesn't care about ""undermining her"".) I lived with them while my (Now Ex-Husb) was stationed in Korea before I could join him.

My then Edad never stood up for himself or us kids unless he was pushed past his breaking point and I was utterly shocked that he did in this instance. My depression and anxiety was so bad that I couldn't eat or sleep. I was so full of fear that I would stay up all night watching my baby for the ominous feeling that if I didn't, he would die of SIDS, and I was constantly tachycardic.

Nmom abused me horribly as a young new mother who just had a C-section and made me feel like I wasn't good enough (nor would ever be) to parent by myself, without her ""selfless sacrificial"" help, that was thrust upon me daily whether I wanted it or not. She cooked my dad and I dinner one night, and brought me out of my room to try and force me to eat. In reality it was a good looking dinner, but everything tasted like cardboard and just the thought of ingesting anything made me feel like I was going to vomit.

""Eat more than just those 3 bites!"" She scolded me as I picked at my food and really was trying my hardest to eat it. ""I can't eat,"" I said, ""It's really weird, I don't know if it is part of the post-partum, and I wish I could but I just can't. It looks good though."" She then scoffed at me, ""Oh that's not real! You're just making that up, you are FIIIIINE. You're being so stupid with all that post-partum depression drama. Just eat it!""

I just sat there with my heart racing and stomach churning. Out of NOWHERE my dad piped in, ""You know what? I'm pretty sure IT IS real to her!"" I felt so FINALLY validated and reassured that my reality MATTERED and it wasn't just me fabricating things. However, that was the FIRST time he did that in my 19 years (yes I WAS a young mom) of life at the time.

Through more memories playing on fast forward in my head (what EMDR does) and this one, I was able to reach some amazing conclusions. I'm not quite able to feel the full healing power of these conclusions yet, but just getting to them is the first step.

They are:

-That I always felt lonely and alone even in childhood because I received no reassurance that I was deserving of unconditional love and could be alone, or that I could make it alone, from either parent.

-That I have even been willing to put my own safety at risk just for the acceptance of other people. Such as by doing extremely hard drugs as a teenager, having sex with men I just met, dating abusers, and pursuing dangerous activities in sports. (My passion now is a dangerous sport, not to say they are wrong, but just that you should do them for the right reasons.)

-That although I want to blame all of this on Nmom (which most of it is her orchestration) that just by standing by (even though he was being emotionally abused himself) that my Edad has some responsibility in it too.

-That my Edad as he stopped putting up with the abuse and eventually left Nmom is on his own healing journey, that I am very lucky to have him now that he is finally the dad that I really needed in those molding years of childhood. However, that I forgive him and love him.

(you can reply without reading details if it’s too long but it’s still appreciated🤍)","for context: i am 22, my loved person is 27, the rest of friends are around our ages too

i had this veryyyy close group of online friends for 2 years, my best and only friends, i was always attracted to one of them and last year i had a romantic thing(playfully crushing on each other) with her for few months then became fwb and that’s when i realized i was actually in love, she also started catching feelings so she decided to stay just normal friends, but we were really close friends i considered her my best friend and kept falling more in love with her. i had extreme anxiety increasing due to illness but she thought i wasn’t being confident in out friendship(always asking if i’m annoying her etc) and felt we were tiptoeing around each other, however we fixed things and i controlled my anxiety for months and she was very sweet with me at that time then i tried texting her and panicked one day when i had been at the hospital(she didn’t know) but i was sensitive and felt sad bc of the way she replied to me that day. few days later she sent me a cute gif and came checking in but i replied to her kinda badly the apologized but it lead to us having a long conversation which then lead to her deciding our relationship isn’t healthy and we shouldnt be close anymore and have some distance yet stay friends.

the day afterwards i was so anxious/crying hysterically and spammed her trying to convince her that i have been doing better and we can be friends again. she barely replied but agreed to everything i’m saying and kept saying i know. after talking to her a lot she started talking to me badly and seemed like she’s trying hard to force being nice and said she want to end the conversation, but i didn’t hear from her for months.

then i had a serious surgery and wanted to make sure we’re on good terms before going, i even delayed my surgery twice to respect her wishes on ending conversation, but then i had to reach out to a friend to ask her if we’re good and the answer was kind of unsure, so i texted her on ig when it was one day before surgery and she said soooo many hurtful words that she seemed to have been hiding inside her, she called me disrespectful, accused me of crossing her boundaries and said she would block me if i didn’t get out of her acc so i stopped.

after the surgery i saw that she blocked all my social media. after a month i was able to come talk to my other friends again so i tried but they all dismissed me badly, talked to me rudely for no reason, at the end when i came to ask them to end out relationship on good terms they blocked me too.

this all started 4 months and 10 days ago, but i cry hysterically every single day since then, went to a psychiatrist and started antidepressants and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder that then turned to depression. i stopped caring for myself or health from self hate, did so bad in my semester and bed time feels like turtor from the amount of crying, tried committing suicide few times but was saved too but i keep feeling shame and hating myself for causing myself lose the most person i ever loved plus my whole group of friends. i have so many trouble admitting that i was wronged and i keep thinking i deserved losing everything that made me happy and ending up completely lonely. i keep thinking how i lead a beautiful person to have to do these harmful actions and how horrible of a person i must be for her to do all of that to me. i keep thinking of all the times she helped me and hte myself more and excusing her later unfair actions. plus i keep thinking that if the whole group who arent bad ppl and once loved me so much and helped me a lot hate me now and did these bad actions then i must deserve it otherwise they wouldnt all agree on it. 

i keep experiencing flashbacks of her hurtful conversations, and i cry hysterically for hours almost daily when i see anything nice that reminds me of her or smth that reminds me of the friend group conversations(this is basically everything in my life now caused i shared all my life with her), which leads me to suicidal thoughts again, i never in my life broke down crying the way i cry even in just one day of these 4 months. i keep imagining all the happy things happening between them all and especially with her now and how i am missing all of it, thinking i caused myself lose the best, kindest and most beautiful person i would ever meet, how she is talking to ppl who are much better than me and how i lost the best friend group i could ever both vibe with and fit in i keep blamimg myself, repeating everything bad i did in my head, so i am scared of the idea of friends and love. but i really want to start believing i can have friends again and can find someone who i can love just like i loved her, i want to compare ppl to them one second after i start the conversation. i want to love myself and stop shaming it, and say that even if i did so many mistakes towards myself i don’t deserve to die and can find happiness somewhere else. i want to believe the things happening between them now aren’t this perfect. i want to believe i am worthy of love and friendship. i want to stop being stuck being stuck in the memories of the life i had 4 months ago, i want to believe i can live with the fact that they will be best friends for many years without me and that i am capable to starting from point zero and maybe achieve good results if i take it slow, even if it took years.

my dr said i am traumatized by this hard period and it’s stopping me from living in the present and suggested emdr to help both my love towards her and the pain from the trauma from lately decrease, and to be less triggered from things in my life i shared with her that cause me flashbacks so that i stop avoiding the good things in my life and for this experience to not stop me from having healthy relationships in the future or be traumatized to even try having anymore relationships at all.

112,What do you do when therapy makes you feel worse?,"Throwaway account because I'm dealing with a lot of shame and in a vulnerable place. Please find it in your heart to be kind and sensitive to a stranger on the internet.

I've been in and out of therapy for about a decade. About 5 years ago I found a therapist I really really liked, and I actually felt more improvement than I had in all my adult life under his guidance. My family and loved ones even noticed and were super encouraging for me to continue when they had at other times lost all hope with me. 

But last year after I had my first and only child I realized I really needed to address some trauma I experienced in pregnancy that I'd been too afraid to tackle. I wanted to do everything I could to be a better parent and to avoid and learn to deal with any potential breakdowns (which I have a history of and lead to depressive episodes that can last anywhere from a couple months to a year). I agreed to do EMDR therapy in addition to attending a local PPD group. 

I couldn't stick with the PPD group. I found other women who had some similar experiences to me, but they just kept telling to ""feel different"" about it (something I struggle with immensely. I ruminate, I spiral, I've struggled with it since childhood). And I felt triggered and retraumatized from hearing the other women's stories and having to retell mine. I'd feel physically sick and barely able to take care of myself let alone my daughter each week. 

I found a similar experience with the EMDR. I kept having to take breaks, it would be too terrifying and painful and it would take me days to recover and I'd become like a robot or I'd randomly become inconsolable. It was only after I went on vacation and took a month long break from therapy that I realized how relieved I felt. I felt like the stress wasn't serving my family. I couldn't bring myself to go back. My husband reached out to my therapist out of concern and I felt so much shame around it (he felt he had the right to because he pays the bills, I can't work). The shame made me not want to talk to my therapist. 

Now I'm having breakdowns and mental health is really suffering from life events and typical holiday stress...I keep lashing out and in general behaving in a way that's not fair to my family, they're embarrassed of me. 

I just don't know what to do. It took me YEARS to find help, and if was just the EMDR that was too hard. But I don't know what else to do because I KNEW just standard talk therapy wasn't enough. 

Sorry this was so long. Disclaimer that I do also take medication that has historically worked well for me and I'm planning on talking to my primary gp about increasing the dose. I live in Canada. My husband was recently laid off and lost his employer's insurance

114,"Need help on finding resources for friend with ""school-anxiety""","hello everyone, will be making a short summarized post   
a friend of mine (who i'll name X for anonymity) seems to have an awfully dreadful time with school. the gist of it is that they constantly feel the need to work / study, and if they do anything else they start feeling awfully guilty. X confessed that they worry immensely about failing and fear disappointing themselves, so they don't make time for anything else like a hobby for themselves, and studies consume X.  
i was looking into different ""research-backed"" therapies and ways to deal and cope with anxiety in general, by googling it and looking up on those subreddits. i want to do this to help guide them towards a therapist who could help them with it, and give them resources on understanding how one type of therapy could help them.   
from my research, I have noted down talk-therapy, EMDR, CBT and its offsets, ACT, DBT (being an offset of CBT), exposure therapy and somatic therapy. i've also noted down a few notes from my little research ; they have to \*decide\* they want to get better was a big one.  
my feelings are that the best ones for X could be a mix of, by order, DBT to help ground things and have a way to reduce harm and stress. then, CBT to deal with the source itself. exposure therapy seemed interesting but mainly because of my lack of knowledge on it i'm (ironically) a bit scared by it. if the source of the way of thinking of it was trauma-related, maybe EMDR would be needed. then, of course have some additional support by way of being with friends, mindfulness, ways to cope like breathing exercices, etc...

117,is ISTDP good for CPTSD? if not - what kind of therapy is? DBT?,"PLEASE HELP.

had been doing CBT with brakes for a few years and depending on a therapist it was either nothing or finding a true mentor i was forced to leave bc of my age (the clinic was for teens and young adults up to 21)...

i delved into EMDR and felt true compassion; learned how to take care of my brain through my body, it was truly amazing, however, with such a strong focus on the topic of trauma and me still living with the oppressors (although without physical violence, still with emotional and financial) after a while i found it too overwhelming + the realization of their behaviour being worse than i thought made me angry which in turn made me act out and suffer more on their account.

recently after an almost a yearly break i tried a couple sessions of SFBT (Solution-focused (brief) therapy). it worked only with very small and short-term stuff. otherwise i didn't get enough emotional support from it and even the therapist themselves said at our last session that i've been through a lot of hurtful life events and that perhaps i should try a different kind of therapy. they suggested ISTDP.

i looked ISTDP up and the depth of it sounds really tempting however, i do not want to get retraumatized; i think one of my two EMDR therapists used it on me at some point and made me supper triggered and angry, that was also a joined session with my parents, and although we were all against each other, we could agree on one thing - that it would be my last session with him. perhaps, given that he had only started training with ISTDP back then - that's not the best example of what this therapy is truly like?

i also heard good things about DBT when it comes to OCD, which i'm not sure if it's an outcome of CPTSD or the way i was born (lol).

118,I despise men and lose sleep after multiple violent incidents caused by them,"I am 22F. The hatred and anger I feel about men now isn't healthy and I can't stop feeling this way. I watched my boyfriend be attacked from behind while he was in the bathroom and he was nearly blinded/killed. I had to throw myself between them as he had passed out. I was taking punches trying to keep his head protected because he had passed out while the men behind the bar and owner (who didnt hire a bouncer) just watched and shouted and didn't step in. It only stopped after he ran away and I was screaming for help. No one called the police or ambulance I had to call his dad to pick us up  After that incident I havent been able to sleep I got put on 5 pills by my psychiatrist to deal with the trauma and flashbacks. I have never went to a party/club and that was our 4th time out. Yesterday at new years the second time we have went out since the incident a man threatened me for moving a jacket, which I moved so I could sit down (it wasn't his, it wasn't mine, the guy who's jacket it was is up dancing he doesn't even know the guy) I wasn't about to sit on someone's jacket so shifted it up a bit so I could sit with my group. It was moved 5 inches and he had 2 seats of space ). I could feel my anxiety creep up after the threat and my boyfriend told him to calm down, there is no issue here and this man slid up behind me (he was 2 metres away) and started threatening my boyfriend telling him to meet him outside. My boyfriend rolled his eyes ignored him and just put his arm around me and kept talking to the group. At this point I was having flashbacks, I started having a bad panic attack, I couldn't breath, tears were streaming, I was gasping for breath. Boyfriend and his cousin noticed and got me outside so I could breathe where the bouncer came up to say he could understand where he was coming from since he was there first (I still have no clue how me not wanting to sit on a strangers jacket and moving it beside me so I wasn't on top of it is worthy of his behaviour) At this point I was just saying between gasps 'i dont actually care about that I'm just having ptsd I don't need this right now'    bouncer walked away and I was being calmed down between panic attacks. I woke up this morning with intense anger. I can't let it go. IV had enough of grown men not being able to control themselves and being violent over something a simple as a jacket that wasn't even his or someone he knows. I'm going to my psychiatrist soon because I can't keep living like this.

It's going to be a while before I get an appointment and I'm just not wanting to go outside for fear of something happening. It's consuming my every thought and I start shaking in anger over my disgust with men.

123,Can a failed relationship cause PTSD?,"I was under the impression that PTSD only affects people in war zones, victims of abuse, etc. I have been reading that more and more situations are falling under the umbrella of PTSD. I would like to know if this is true.

Without going into detail, I was a late bloomer. My very first serious relationship was doomed from the beginning, and I knew that going in, but chose to pursue it anyway.
It lasted for 3 years, but I was the only person giving 100% and always getting 0 in return. I am the one that ended it. I was so depressed that I couldn’t function after the breakup, I ended up taking a leave from work.
I decided to see a therapist, and as kind as she was, she really wasn’t anything more than a listening ear, and never offered any advice or coping skills. I ended therapy.

I never have been able to completely erase the memories, and I suspect I won’t ever be able to… this person occupies a part of my heart, as bad as that sounds.

Fast forward almost 10 years later, and with some events happening in the world, thoughts of the person and our relationship comes front and center in my mind, and it became borderline obsession, almost to the point of stalking. Again, I decided to look for therapy again, this time, choosing a therapist more carefully, one that I felt I matched with better. He allowed me to talk about it some, but quickly decided that I needed EMDR, and that took up most of our sessions, for many sessions. I didn’t feel any improvement (or anything for that matter) with EMDR. Again, I ended therapy.

Now and again these thoughts of the person/relationship come back, and I realize that I am still slightly obsessed, and the memories cause great pain. I have to avoid certain types of restaurants, music, foods… to try to block the heartache. This isn’t going away.
I’m just wondering if this could possibly be PTSD in some form? 

I do feel it’s important to mention that I did experience major trauma during the relationship. The particular situation I am thinking of was not caused by the other person directly, but it did affect them as well.

I’m wondering if there is a possibility that PTSD could result from a relationship, that it may be wise to look into a clinical psychologist or at least someone with some credentials. I honestly can’t afford it right now as I’m living paycheck to paycheck, but if I could get to the root of the issue and learn to manage it, it would be money well spent.

I just had a mental health professional tell me, after I called to get some support for a unprocessed trigger, that I should look at it as a blessing because talking about it will heal it. I get that this is the reality for some people, but it really really frustrates me that this professional is saying this. 

It frustrates me because I heard this so much before I discovered EMDR and every time I was triggered and then talked about it and then triggered again and talked about it, absolutely nothing changed. I began to think that I was hopeless and that I would never heal because of what I had been hearing began to think that I wasn’t doing healing correctly. 

Turns out I just needed a different approach but there were probably 4 years where I felt hopeless and thought I’d never feel any better which was terrible, especially considering I had endured 8 years of intense trauma. 

I understand that this person was trying to help, but I think it’s harmful to say this as a general statement because it’s not true for everyone and can make people feel more broken, helpless and hopeless. 

I think mental health workers need to be careful about blanket statements and need to be more aware of the impact of their words, especially when working in a profession where people are already feeling so desperate and vulnerable.",1692046028.0,False,1,0,Fast_sloth_,None,15r6jnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15r6jnv/healing_after_getting_triggered/

I'm a nobody because it's safe. All I do each day is eat and force myself to work.  No interactions, no self-expression.

141,Things I’ve noticed working in mental health.,"Hey all. I wanted to write out a few interesting things I’ve noticed in my decade working in the field. Interesting bits that you might not find scrolling.

•The age or experience of a therapist does not equal competence. I’ve met associate licensed clinicians who were awesome and I’ve met 15 year vets I wouldn’t hire to run a lemonade stand.

•The “system” in most places is completely overwhelmed and inadequate. Like hilariously bad.

•Getting disability for MH reasons is nearly impossible if you are a heavy substance user.

•Xanex, klonopin, and benzos are extremely addictive and very rarely actually help the people who take them.

•Most of what we treat is varying manifestations of varying forms of trauma. 

•I’ve seen just as many incorrect Bipolar diagnoses as correct ones. The misdiagnosing issue here is so bad, I always assume it’s wrong and do my own screening. 

•I’ve only worked or consulted on one case in my entire career where a DID diagnosis was appropriate and I’ve met thousands of clients. Sometimes people self diagnose incorrectly, sometimes clinicians go looking for it and are biased, sometimes people are malingering.

•Real “progress” is slow, messy, and nonlinear. Don’t give up.

•When someone receives trauma treatment, there is an incredibly strong urge to avoid the emotions around the event(s). Symptoms usually get worse temporarily and then improve.

•They don’t actually know how EMDR works. They got ideas, but no consistent evidence.

•A certain percentage of persons with schizophrenia are not able recognize they have the disorder. At all. Ever.

A bit of background about me, I have struggled with depression since my early teens and it has only worsened over the years, I am currently 22.

As for me, I developed PTSD and PTSD-inducing anxiety following the incident. Prior to the accident I never experienced much anxiety, and now it is overwhelming. I have both panic attacks and anxiety attacks, but thankfully the panic attacks has decreased over the years. My family has a strong background of bipolar 1 disorders, affecting the women in my father's family (grandmother and aunt), however I have never been diagnosed.

I really liked my first one, had a really great first session but my appointments were always being canceled and in the one I could actually schedule, she was almost 2h late. Everything was too complicated so I've decided to look for another one.

Eventually I started going to another therapist, she's completely different. She went really deep on my thoughts, my childhood, relationships, everything.

I've been feeling depressed, anxious, I feel numb most of the times, there's nothing that makes me happy anymore and it's really affecting my work life and my relationships. 

When I asked her why I should start this therapy, she said that EMDR sees every unpleasant events in my life as traumas. So she's digging really deep into my childhood to try and start EMDR with that.

I haven't started EMDR yet, I've been going to these appointments for two months now and I'm hating every single one.

In the last session she said that I'm not making any effort to get better, even though I'm going there every week. She's working all these old memories and there's stuff I can't remember, even if I keep trying.

I'm worried about the present and how I feel right now and she's bringing all this stuff from 20 years ago. I don't feel comfortable or any empathy at all around her.

To be blunt, I am terrified for my future if these thoughts continue, and I do not know how much longer I am able to fight these urges alone.  

I have heard uneasy stories from people after they were hospitalized by their mental health issues, and I am trying to avoid the hospital route at all costs. A close family friend of mine who went to our local ""psych ward"" ended up being much worse when she was released due to traumatic events and rude staff. 

I have researched ""retreat"" style treatments, but I am worried they are too gimmicky and not worth my money/time. I live in the south (US) and there is nothing like that close to me anyway. Any suggestions?? Places?? Organizations??

162,How do you push yourself to study?,"21f here. Got a new wonderful diagnosis of Depression, PTSD, Bulimia Nervosa, Panic disorder, GAD, and Social anxiety. Woohoo (note the sarcasm). I’m in therapy (emdr) and on meds. 
Issue is last few days I feel like I can’t get myself to do anything, especially study. Like I’ll just stay in bed for hours. In my head I feel fine but my friends said I seem low. I have an essay due on 4dec, and exams on 11dec and 22dec. I haven’t done as well as I wanted to in these courses, and I really really really want to do well in the exams but I just can’t pull myself out of bed. Even if I get out of bed, I feel so tired and just do not feel like doing anything. More so, I had a really really busy week last week. So since Friday evening I’ve literally done nothing and just lazed around and I feel guilty about it because I know I should be studying. Whenever I did get out of bed, I was just watching Netflix. 
Today I finally managed to get myself out of the house and I went to do my chores, and then have class for rest of the day. I’ll stick to the schedule even though my brain is screaming to just go home and lie down. I will be speaking to my doctor about it too. 

Meanwhile though… how do you all push yourself to study when you just can’t get out of bed?",1701204367.0,False,2,4,blacknwhitelife02,None,18668gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18668gr/how_do_you_push_yourself_to_study/
163,going through hell,"i want to start this with, i have healthcare worker burn out. i’m so tired of taking care of other people even though it’s my job and i do love my job. i’m also a full time student and i’m fighting to keep up on school work. after finals i’m taking a few days off work to rest. i also have ADHD, anorexia, PTSD, treatment resistant depression, and severe anxiety.
every late fall/early winter, i start to feel worse than usual. (not that i feel great otherwise). i’ve started abusing THC and caffeine. this isn’t recent, my THC use got bad in the summer to the point i did not miss a single night smoking. i never do it before work or school for obvious reasons. 

recently i started EMDR with my therapist. i noticed i do some weird things for a while after. i get anxiety that can’t be fought with grounding techniques or breathing. i end up doing weird things out of panic. my most recent psychiatry appointment was just arguing with him about how i will not be taking lithium to treat my depression. he put me on lamotrigine which is terrifying enough. i told my therapist about both of these things and he told me that’s pretty normal with EMDR and to get a new psychiatrist. he also gives me breaks to talk about my life problems if i need.

within the last few weeks, i noticed my depression and anxiety have gotten almost as bad as when i was hospitalized in 2019 if not worse. the only difference is i haven’t made and attempt on my life because if i botch it, i’ll just end up screwing myself over with school, work, and my relationships. it’s crossed my mind a lot recently though. 

i quit smoking weed a few days ago because i read there can be some pretty irreversible effects on the brain. i am cutting back to once a week for fun after i’ve gone without it for a week. i wonder if it’s been hurting me rather than helping. i also cannot focus very well, which is my ADHD but it’s made college a nightmare and i drink maybe three red bulls or monsters in a day if not more. that’s on top of my ritalin.

i started my lamotrigine today along with vitamin d and i got a weighted plush to help at night. i’m doing everything i can to figure this out and i am looking for new ideas every day. next paycheck it’s going to be fidget toys and a weighted blanket. i don’t know if any of it is going to help.

the truth is, i’m tired. i feel stuck and even though i’m surrounded by support, i’m just so done. i’ve been fighting these battles for most of my life and i genuinely don’t know if it’s worth it anymore. i get worse with the season changes and i told a friend at the end of last winter, i don’t know if i can make it through another one. i really am trying to though. if i’m honest, i don’t want to live through this winter, but i don’t want my best friend or their partner to have to find my body.

does anyone know what i can do to help myself? more therapy? ketamine? a better psychiatrist? brain scans? an exorcism? i will try anything that will help with any of these problems.",1699259348.0,False,3,1,glamrock_crunch,None,17oy8wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17oy8wv/going_through_hell/

For context, I struggle with anxiety, but it’s improved over the past year. I haven’t noticed any depressive symptoms, unless they’re situational. 

I had a couple of people point out over the past few months that I’m always “just okay.” It’s made me think, am I never good? Am I unhappy? I guess I haven’t really felt good in a while or good enough that I could tell someone, yeah, I’m doing great! 

My life feels pretty mundane, but idk if that’s a bad thing. I’m working on EMDR stuff in therapy, so I’m reliving two huge traumas and it gets heavy.

Also open to reiki and alternative forms of trauma processing. I’ve been in talk therapy off and on for 10 years with good therapists. Currently on 10 mg of Lexapro, Buspirone 4x/day and 25 mg hydroxyzene several times a day and even all of this isn’t helping the way I’d like.

However, right before impact, i told myself 

“I’m now going to die” and accepted it, all within about a second. 

During the impact, i told myself 

“I am dead” i felt like my brain popped, like breaking through an embryo. 

The a second later, i came back, i told myself 

“I died, now what do i do”

I was scared that when i got home, the bed may be in a different spot, with my girlfriend telling me it’s always been there. Or that i would be driving and realize that “wait, the powerlines were on the other side of the road before” but as time passed, i noticed nothing different. 

However, about a week ago, i went to feel a mole i have always had on my stomach that i would always randomly touch, and i couldnt find it. I looked at my stomach and felt around and i am 100% sure that there used to be a mole there.

170,I am afraid of changing therapist," I'll  try to be as short as possible, I suffer from depression, generalized   anxiety and social anxiety from four years, in therapy since two and a  half.

Her approach is gestalt and  she helped me a lot during these years, expecially for my alchoolism(  sober from 1 year and a half) we also came to the roots of my problems,  which I couldn't even imagine without therapy, but now,since 3-4 of  months I feel at a dead spot.

I am  feeling the pressure of years passing by and losing the best years of  my life, I am 25 and invalidated to the point that I struggle  getting  out from home, working, ecc

During  these years after every single session I felt relieved, I felt better,  but since a couple of months I am not feeling the progress anymore  despite she genuinely cares about me, almost every time I get out from  there I feel a sense of hopelessness.

We  are currently (re) doing EMDR, I did that in the past but she wants to  try it again for the same trauma that I thought we solved but then it  started making me feel bad again.

I  told her that I am thinking to change therapist and to switch to CBT  and she is fine with it, the problem is that I am scared, I fear that I  may do a bad thing  to interrupt the EMDR sessions we are doing, I got  attached  to her, when I have a problem I can call her even out of a  session

It's a choice I feel the  need to do soon, a part of me is  totally convinced to change, it's just  the anxious, avoidant part that fears unknown that wants to stay

So I (39F) experienced a lot of trauma growing up and engaged in cutting when I was a teen into early 20s. I’ve recently been trying to work through the trauma in therapy via EMDR, which has brought up a lot of old pain and emotion as well as the cutting. 

I’m working on getting past it, but in the meantime I am struggling with hiding the wounds/scars from others. When I get the compulsion to do it, I feel a strong urge for it to be in particular for places, mainly my forearm or lower leg/calf. This obviously makes any cuts very visible to others. Am I strange in this? I feel like most people who cut do it in spots that are hidden by clothing. But to me, being able to see or touch the scars at any point throughout the day weirdly brings me a sense of comfort and security. Yet at the same time, around others it makes me extremely self-conscious and ashamed.

176,On depression - options exhausted,"I’m diagnosed with treatment resistant, atypical depression. It manifests itself in acute social anxiety, pessimism, self-hatred, exhaustion, and despair about the world’s and my future. In the past ten years, I have tried:

- 8 long term therapists, including those who work with CBT, DBT, EMDR, groups, Somatic healing, and Buddhist koans
- medications such as Prozac, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Lamictal, two MAOinhibitors at high doses, some adhd related meds, and more
- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (three rounds)
- Mindfulness, Zen, guided, group, and Transcendental meditation
- exposure therapy in the hopes that I gradually feel more comfortable around large groups of strangers
- blood tests for possible thyroid problems
- diet and exercise regimen in a vain attempt to transform into more of an upbeat go-getter
- journaling
- Landmark forum
- psychics and astrologers
- people’s advice to “just relax, be happy, go easy on yourself, might as well enjoy the only life you get”

None of it has helped. At least not for more than a week or two. And every time I look for articles on struggling to find something effective , they go over the list I just made. The only other things I’ve heard of are ECT and psilocybin trials. The latter are not an option until I wean myself off my MAOinhibitor (Nardil), and my attempts have been quite painful. That’s my history with antidepressants: if they’re effective for a little while, that will pass and their only noticeable effect will be anguish if you forget to take them. My doctor doesn’t want to go for ECT and just assumes that it’ll all work out because of the time 4 years ago when Nardil initially made a difference.

185,Anyone feel like no treatment option gives any hope?,"I am prone to anxiety with low mood and adhd symptoms and it surprises me how positive people with mental health problems are about treatment. These are the things i have tried:

- therapy. Non-suitable therapy was damaging and GAVE ME MORE mental health problems like anger and self doubt.  Good therapy helped, but only to a certain extent and is not a long term solution due to it being time consuming and scarce
- ssri medication. Helped my anxiety but gave me more depression.
- benzodiazepines. Slightly helped my depression but is addicting and no long term solution
- methylphenidate. Made me more social but also even more distracted. Only made me more distracted and depressed when it wore off. 
- antipsychotics. I never read a story of those making someone feel better unless they were completely out of touch with reality.

Then there are other options i haven’t tried:
- gabapentin and such. Even if they worked i would be scared of respiratory depression and hair loss
- wellbutrin. Don’t think it will help me but this is probably the best drug to be prescribed so scarce and unavailable and rarely prescribed at least where i live. Also probably causes psychosis. 
- amphetamines for adhd. Think it would help greatly but cause insomnia, heart problems and psychosis. Also very scarce like wellbutrin.
- ketamine: extremely scarce and only for suicidal people
- emdr for something other than trauma - too afraid it will change my personality
-  electroconvulsive therapy and implants: afraid it will cause memory loss and change of personality

Also, i have tried living healthily and many supplements. The only ones that worked for my energy levels were also the ones with horrible side effects. I have tried almost everything, magnesium, iron, b vitamins, vitamin d but also many many more.

187,"What can I do to start trusting people? I feel like I can't trust anyone ever again because of all the times I was hurt and betrayed, and had my paranoia validated.","I've had so much bullshit happen to me throughout my life, I was sexually assaulted and molested as a child and a teen, once by a family member. I feel like that's where a lot of my trust issues stem from, having my parents, the people who are supposed to protect me failed. I really blame my father a lot for that because he could've protected me but was strung out on drugs or drunk all the time and left me around shady characters. If my dad wouldn't have been like that I probably wouldn't have been violated as a child. 

A lot of my ex's kept secrets from me and lied about things that I found out about later for a long time, a year or more. I think it REALLY fucked me up even more because I had a gut feeling they were lying and betraying me, so when I found out it was like all of my paranoia was validated, I didn't see it as paranoia any more, it was the truth I had unconvered. I felt gaslit, betrayed, and it makes me feel like it's just human nature to lie and deceive others. 

Because of this and a lot more stuff (there's too much to go into detail) I'm ruining my current relationship. My bf's ex messaged him and he told me about it, he told me he blocked her and hasn't spoken to her. I'm DYING to message her on FB asking if they're talking, I know it's such an unhinged and insane and innapropriate thing to do and would probably fuck up my relationship but I'm overwhelmed with the paranoia and fear that he's seeing her behind my back. 

I need help, I'm still waiting to get my new therapist. In the meantime how do I deal with this? How do I trust? How can I stop being paranoid? I started taking 2 medications 4 days ago, Hydroxyzine pamoate and Venlafaxine, will this start to help my paranoia and anxiety?

189,Turned off from therapy forever I feel like," I was a patient of hers. I was out of a medication I've been on for 3 years. She completely turned me off from psychiatry  ever again. She told me Clonzepam wouldnt give me a seziure if I  suddenly stopped, with the knowledge that I've been on it for 3 years. I asked her something and she said something like ""cant prescribe it its a controlled substance thanks"" and I did have a bit of a temper tantrum because I was scared and I couldn't get a straight answer out of her. I told her today that everything I've been told about this medication will cause you to seize if you suddenly stop. And I ran out on Monday was when I had my last full dose. She got on the call with me and said, ""so you still have your medication?"" I was like no. I explained that in my e-mail.

So now I'm thinking ok... She specializes in mood disorders and ""psychosis"" but  let me go as a patient because I had an episode. I never felt heard, understood, or like *i mattered*. She deliberately pushed the idea  of gabapentin on me, EMDR, and several things that I've been told by  others not to do. Beyond that, she never even bothered to look at  my medical records from the past. She's a psychiatrist who ""specializes in psychotic disorders"" but shes only available 2 days out of the whole week. I don't understand why she's allowed to give out schedule 4 narcotics then. All this to say when she let me go she threw a months supply for my rx and basically said good luck. 

I feel better not being a patient of hers because she made me so uncomfortable, asking me about my sexual health and anything about sex really makes me squeamish. I have a fuckton of trauma from sexual abuse.

She wasn't receptive to calm, constructive communication where I explained that I want her to have clear concise communication with me, that I don't want to talk about EMDR (she does EMDR and when I told her I wasn't going to do it her demeanor changed) but it seemed almost like she couldnt handle me anymore. She seemed particularly annoyed I cancelled one or two sessions with her and I totally understand but also- I was extremely depressed and couldn't work, get out of bed, talking to her just the thought of it made me cringe. She was money oriented and thats fine so am I. But shes not hustling or at a job where she can afford to make mistakes and to only be available to your patients 2 days out of the week, yet you want to specialize in psychotic disorders and give out schedule 4 drugs and then lie or be extremely uninformed about what it is youre talking out your ass about????

190,Im scared of doctors/hospitals ,"Hi, writing out this post is pretty embarrassing for me especially since I havent really told anyone this before but im terrified of doctors and hospitals. Whenever i have to go to the doctor i have to drag my mum along with me, im 19. I can make my own appointments fine, its just being there that freaks me out. My dad died of cancer in hospital when I was about 14, leading up to that a good 60% of my life was spent in hospitals, doctors and medical settings for my dad. I remember hating all of it, sitting in waiting rooms for hours, all of the tubes sticking in and out of his face, never hearing any good news, seeing all these other sick or dying people, so many people crying, I think it really effected me. I havent been back to a hospital since he died, even walking past one makes me nervous. Hell I’m even tearing up typing abt this. I used to have to be physically dragged to the doctor, which Ive gotten over now, but the fear is still there. Usually my mum has to hold my hand and sometimes answer questions for me cause I just cant bring myself to speak. I feel so embarrassed, Im an adult and I should be able to do this myself but I just cant do it. Sometimes if I need a script repeat on my meds ill go for weeks without them because just thinking of going to the doctors makes me too nervous to book an appointment, which just makes my whole life worse until I can get them again. I know its bad, I dont know what to do. I’m planning on moving out with my gf this year, so I need to figure this out, I cant force my mum to appointments with me if I dont even live with her. I’m worried that I’ll just put off going all together out of fear, and I cant let that happen, im sick of prioritising my fear over my own health. If anyone has any sort of advice it would be highly appreciated. Or even if you experience something similar, id like to hear about it

191,I was doing so well.,"This past month I have been going through EMDR therapy (a psychotherapy meant for PTSD patients.) and honestly, it has been doing me so well.
My first EMDR session was terrifying, I admit. But after my session ended? it was like I was finally able to breathe again. No anxious thought entered my body, my mind was at peace, I was able to do so many things I couldn’t have done before.

Though, that feeling didn’t last forever. To be honest, it only felt like I was on cloud nine for about twelve hours- I slept, woke up in the middle of the night, and had an anxiety attack. Then I had another one the next morning. Then I ended up in the hospital.

Next week comes around, we do another session, more scary than the previous but my anxiety attacks stopped almost completely. Two days later, I revisit my hometown- where all of my trauma occurred.
Minute, by minute, as we drove closer, it felt like i wasn’t able to breath, it felt like the world was collapsing in on me, I started having anxious and intrusive thoughts again, i felt absolutely terrible. Everything was overwhelming me, the bumpy road, the mountains, the vehicles, the sky looking like it was spinning. Plus, the fact that I had a single donut during that entire nine hour drive- then I didn’t eat for the rest of the road trip. 
I was triggered, I was so triggered that I was gasping in my sleep for air, had a long period of dizziness (I still am experiencing this dizziness, even though I got back from our trip out of town last night.) 
I’m scared. I’m just absolutely terrified, it feels like all of my progress in therapy has just been completely wiped.

192,What happened,"So I (20f) was in therapy today, and for a while my therapist and I have been discussing EMDR. Idk how it came up, but she handed me a sheet with phrases like “I’m worthless” “I don’t matter” “I don’t deserve happiness” “I’m a mistake” and “I’m a burden “

She asked me to highlight the phrases that I most align with, and as I was highlighting them, I start getting emotional. like I was just tearing up a bunch. Seeing all the words on the page was just tough for some reason.

She kind of stopped doing that after she noticed I was crying a bit, and said that maybe we moved too fast.

I’ve been seeing her for four years ish, probably only cried in front of her four times. Only for big deals. Apparently those words were a big deal.

It’s now five hours later and I’m still super emotional and upset. I’m depressed and tired. My question is what happened? I’ve known that I have a negative core values about myself for a while, so why the freak out today? and how do I make myself feel better?

194,therapy methods for trauma processing?,"i realized recently that my ptsd from a car accident several years ago may be affecting me a lot more than i thought it was. i never really addressed it in therapy because the therapist i had at the time told me that i'd be sure to pay more attention while driving in the future... even though this accident was a result of someone stealing a truck, running from police, and bombing through a red light, all of which i had no control over and no chance to ""pay attention"" to before my car was totaled in the middle of an intersection and my partner was unconscious. i didn't think the therapist's comment was appropriate, and i never went back. 

it was a few years before i managed to get into therapy again, and by then, i figured i'd ""gotten over it"" as best as i feasibly could without therapeutic intervention. except, i've never been able to get over the guilt of my partner getting hurt. i stopped talking about that feeling a long time ago – before returning to therapy – because everyone told me the same thing: the guy that hit us had nothing to do with me, and i'm the only person who will ever blame me... so i shouldn't feel guilty.

but we weren't supposed to be there. i forgot what i had to do that day and i chose to go where we were driving and i put my partner in that situation and her life has been fucked ever since. i ruined it. i destroyed her life because i couldn't remember an appointment for something i'd been doing for years.

the fault is obviously on the other driver though! so i shouldn't be so burdened. i shouldn't feel so sick with guilt every day for years, because it's not my fault... 

these negative feelings surrounding an unreasonable, yet unshakeable and gripping guilt have to go. i'm seeing ways that it's harmed me and my loved ones and i need to figure out a way to work through it. however, i have always felt like there's no possible way to get rid of the guilt. i'm scared to try because i literally can't imagine a future where i'm able to release this feeling. i know that there are methods for trauma processing, though, and i'm wondering if there is a modality that may help with dissolving negative feelings.

i considered emdr, but then learned that it's more for uncovering repressed trauma rather than coping with an already-known piece of the trauma. unless emdr can be used to process just the emotions, too, then i think it might not be the right option. but i don't know! this is a recent realization so i haven't looked too far yet. wondering if anyone else has some advice or experience with therapy methods for trauma.",1676360727.0,False,1,1,bydesign-,None,111x2mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/111x2mb/therapy_methods_for_trauma_processing/

Not been mentally strong since then and had a big phobia because drugs are just so popular tbh, more than 50% of all americans smoke weed for example and yeah, it's not uncommon at with other drugs such as xtc, cocain, shrooms, lsd, etc. And I hear about people pranking each other with LSD every now and again because it's easier to make someone else unknowingly take LSD and then have it sneak up on that person as a surprise. They aren't doing this malicously either, some do I guess but most of them who do it, they don't think it's such a big deal because they themselves can handle drugs so well. 


Or maybe it's my phobia behind the above thinking.


So, I have huge trust/paranoia problems when I'm around people. Worried about anything I touch or drink/eat might have LSD in it. Even if I go just to a normal store and if there's something digestable that isn't sealed then how can I be aboslutely sure some guy hasn't dropped L all over it and waiting to have a laugh at whoever buys it.. I know it sounds crazy but that's how bad my phobia has become. I've stopped buying stuff that isn't sealed and I check packaging like if they were condoms, press the bag to see if air comes out because then I know the seal is broken/holes in it, could be injected with something. 


Like, one girl I was dating before, I would for example have my water bottle in the room, but if I left her alone in the room with the bottle then I wouldn't be able to drink from it without pouring it out and getting new water.

205,My dad took his life and my little sister has not left home for 3 years.,"In 2018 my (19M at the time) dad (54M at the time) took his own life on our family property. 

My little sister (17F at the time) was the one who “found” him. 
They were extremely close and of course it crushed all of us in the family but tbh it has broken my little sister.

The first year or so after he died was filled with grief but she still managed to go out and socialise in most ways including festivals/parties etc.

About 3 years ago her anxiety and mental health deteriorated dramatically. She had been going to therapy, including EMDR since his death.
 
About a month ago she decided to stop going to therapy and is not getting any better. 

In 3 years she has only left the house maybe 10 times other than for a therapy session once every couple of weeks. Trying to get her out of the house is a whole ordeal and often she will be excited but then last minute have a panic attack and stay home.

Her “friends” at the time were all quite frankly terrible people who did not offer her enough support in my opinion. 

She does have a couple of friends to note who are loved by our family and always reach out to her to support even though their offers of socialising are rejected 99% of the time.

As her older brother and only remaining male in the family I feel such heavy responsibility and moved back home in 2022 to help her get back on her feet.

I always offer her my support, invite her out, and never pressure her to do anything she doesn’t want to do.

I feel so helpless and useless seeing her in her room 90% of the time and not wanting to even come eat dinner with my mum (50F) and older sister (28F).

207,Can I get some advice on this? OCD help?,"Can I get some advice on a particular thing that I’m struggling with. I was diagnosed with OCD in 2015 and have had obsessions, worries and anxiety about different kinds of things throughout my life including relationship related obsessions, compulsions and worries. This is a pretty long winded message but here goes. I’d really appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, thank you in advance.

My most recent obsession is regarding the new relationship that I am in and my best friend. My girlfriend and I originally met last year and dated briefly until she broke things off for mental health reasons after a few dates.

In the meantime between then and us beginning to date again in May this year I became really close to a female friend of mine, to the point of her being a best friend to me, a source of support, help, encouragement etc. I began to develop strong romantic feelings for her and told her about these feelings one night. She gently and politely said that she didn’t feel the same and stated that she did not see me in that way, to which I understood and said that our friendship is more important. I was pretty cut up about the whole thing for a while and found it really hard being around my friend at times. But our friendship was more important to me and I did not want to lose her as a friend. 

Roughly around the same time I’d been thinking of sending my current girlfriend a message again to see how she was and possibly catch up again. She had been on my mind since we stopped dating but I always felt that I couldn’t go back and talk to her again. One day I decided to leap and send her a message and we got talking again. We arranged to meet up and it felt so natural again, very much like hardly any time had passed since we dated last year. We kissed and all that kind of thing and it was amazing. I was completely into her all over again, so much so that I felt that my previous feelings for my friend were now an irrelevance and that this was me ACTUALLY fancying someone, this felt more ‘real’. I’m completely attracted to my girlfriend and we have wonderful chemistry, with my friend I’ve not really felt such a sexual connection, it was more emotional, supportive etc (I guess because she was there at the time when I was feeling cut up about previous girls I’d been seeing at the time we became close friends). 

I dated my girlfriend throughout May and June and never thought twice about my best friend in that whole time, she’d tell me about dates she’d been on and I was supportive of her. Or for example I’d be with my now girlfriend and my best friend would call me and I’d be so engrossed in spending time with my girl that I wouldn’t respond as quickly. There were times where I would just be like ‘meh, that was in the past’ about my liking for my friend. 

That was until the week I introduced my friend to my girlfriend in July. I can remember that week having a dream about my best friend and waking up feeling really freaked out, worrying that I wasn’t over her. Then when I introduced my girlfriend to my friend everything was absolutely fine until at some point I began to ‘notice’ my best friend again and started getting all these thoughts and worries that I wasn’t over her and still liked her, which then sent me into an anxiety spiral over the next few days. The worry and fear grew and grew to the point where I’m asking for advice now!

Really since then I’ve been obsessing about the whole thing, not able to get a moment’s peace from obsessing and analysing my feelings towards my friend. I could totally accept that I still have those feelings but I don’t want them to affect my current relationship. My girlfriend has gone back to her home country for visa reasons and so we are long distance. I’ll be seeing her in November in her home country and I’m looking forward to it, but I’m carrying the weight of all this on me, I feel very guilty and dishonest and scared that I have to leave my current girlfriend because of these feelings/worries/obsession. 

I am still very much in touch with my best friend and we hang out, but I’m constantly worrying about the whole thing, analysing when we hang out. She has recently begun seeing someone new and I keep getting what feel like pangs of jealousy followed by mad anxiety because that ‘means I’m not over her and I’m dishonest to my girlfriend and leading her on’. I feel terrible when speaking to my girlfriend even online because I feel like I’m being dishonest by not speaking about any of this. 

This has happened to me with previous partners, where I’ve obsessed about wanting to go back out with a previous girlfriend. Every time I was honest about my worries/thoughts it has gone pear shaped somehow. One time I ended up ending the relationship because the anxiety is so bad so I know partly that this is nothing new. 

At the same time though because my feelings for my friend are more recent and I did have them, I’m now worried that what if I didn’t get over her properly and my new relationship was fine for a while but then my old feelings came back on like a light switch meaning I’ve rebounded my feelings and I’m now in this situation.

I don’t want to break up with my current partner, we have a wonderful time together and I’m holding onto the fact that before this light switch moment when these thoughts came back that all was good, I didn’t care about my feelings for my best friend and that was in the past. 

I ask myself ‘if my friend came up to me and said, I like you and want to give things a try’ how would I react? Would I choose her or my current girlfriend. I hope I would choose my current girlfriend and keep my friend as a best friend, but then I feel something is still holding me and then I get scared. 

I really don’t want to lose my current girl, I don’t know how to talk about this with her and I don’t really want to. I really want to figure this out for myself and then hopefully get through it. The only thing I have said is that before we began dating that I did have feelings for my best friend and that those feelings crop up from time to time, to which she understood. But I haven’t talked to her about the gravity and amount of stress, worry and anxiety this is causing me. She has OCD as well funnily enough so it’s likely she would understand more than most, but from previous experience and the way in which my mind is right now, I don’t feel like I can talk about this and I don’t know if I want to. I just want to get back to how I felt in May, June, where I was so sure of my feelings to just my girlfriend and the other feelings became insignificant! 

Could I get some advice on this, does this sound like ROCD rearing its head, should I treat these as intrusions. I know it comes across like I’m asking for reassurance here and that’s not a good thing, but I just needed to get this out. I have a therapist and I’m taking SSRIs, which help but I get so caught up at times!

208,"Extremely terrified of dying, I need help.","Hi all,

For many years I’ve ben very scared of dying and death. Almost my entire life I’ve had (and still have) severe nightmares about dying in the most horrific way and I feel like it has come to a climax where I can’t feel happy anymore. The thing that scares me the most is not knowing what happens when we die. I have multiple fears of what happens when I die that haunt me every day. During the night I wake up crying and begging that I don’t want to die and that I’m so scared for when that day comes.

My fear of dying is getting more and more extreme slowly but surely. I can’t enjoy being with friends or do anything fun. When I’m at the gym I have multiple times where I have to compose myself to not have a panic attack thinking about death. But where does it end? Does it end with me becoming too scared to even leave my house? And being extremely obsessed about it?
Thinking about death is something that just hits me, it’s like my brain wants to torture me and I don’t understand why.

I’ve had 3 types of medication (don’t know which ones) in the past that were supposed to help with my nightmares, but no result.

For my depression I’ve had Mirtazapine but that multiplied my nightmares (and weight) so I had to quit.

I’ve reached the end of the line in psychiatric treatment (group therapy, exposure therapy, EMDR therapy etc) last year (for other psychological complaints) where the national mental health care institution doesn’t want to help me anymore because they’re out of options (even though I’ve suggested several other therapy methods). They’ve completely dropped me against my will.

I have a one-time appointment with a psychiatrist (hopefully soon) and I’m hoping this person wants to help me with medication, because I can’t live like this anymore. I’m exhausted.

Are there any other people struggling with this fear? If so, what helps you? I need all the tips I can get.

Thank you <3!

Diagnoses I’ve gotten the last 10 years:
- Chronic depression
- complex PTSD (depends who you’re asking tho, not every psychologist I’ve spoke to agrees with this due to the lack of flashbacks)
- anxiety disorder

209,My anxiety is getting replaced with extreme inability to focus - why does my brain do this?,"Hello everyone, I would love to share my experience with my ever-changing state of mind and ask what steps to take in order to deal with this.



My issues began as OCD coupled with social anxiety disorder, both of which I am diagnosed with. However, I have never understood how my brain is able to constantly worsen the symptoms of my OCD despite me being on medication and doing EMDR therapy for months. I have also changed my perspective to become much more positive and optimistic, started exercising and doing relaxation techniques, as well as exposing myself to anxiety I have when talking to people by putting myself around them a lot and keeping myself busy in an effort to distract my mind from intrusive thoughts. 



I believe that all of those things, and especially medication (I am on 100mg a day of sertraline) significantly reduced the anxiety I was experiencing from both my SAD and OCD, which were causing me strong distress. However, instead of returning to a non-anxious state, I am now completely unable to focus. And this doesn't even cause distress anymore, but I am just unable to complete basic tasks with minimum level focus anymore. I do all of my daily routines on auto-pilot, mostly relying on muscle memory. I have an incredibly hard time with reading and listening comprehension, which reflects on the quality of my studying. And my OCD is getting worse on top of this, further distracting my brain from whatever it is that I want it to focus on. 



So what I want to ask is whether anyone else has experienced something similar, or if you have an explanation of my brain reacting in this way. The best way to describe it is probably that the anxiety and distress from obsessions left to make space for my thoughts wandering off and inability to concentrate. I've tried meditation, breathing techniques and the pomodoro technique, but they do not seem to work, and frankly both my psychologist and psychiatrist do not seem to care and are focused on reducing my anxiety and usual OCD symptoms. If you have any suggestions of what I should do to improve this, I would love to read them. I know I'm not supposed to worry about my future, but I truly think that this will significantly impact my studies and career later on, and in the present it is also decreasing my overall enjoyment and quality of life.",1714171591.0,False,1,0,Slade_M_230,None,1cdyyxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cdyyxk/my_anxiety_is_getting_replaced_with_extreme/

I noticed a spot on my face that's been there a while and I decided I wanted it gone. But it wasn't a pimple it was some sort of hard ball underneath the skin. I got so obsessed with removing it I was digging into my skin and yanking on it trying to pull it out from under my skin. I found another one and couldn't get it off all the way and ended up digging around it so much I was bleeding all over. But I didn't feel any pain at all. It was like I was watching someone else do it.

This can't be normal. I don't know what to do. I tried telling my husband but he said he doesn't know what to do about it and kinda left it at that. I don't feel sane.

213,Treatment Advice? I'm frustrated and I need ideas of what kind of therapy to try. TLDR at the end.,"For background on my issues, I have a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and depression. When I'm anxious/panicking you probably won't be able to tell by looking at me. My heart pounds and my mind starts talking me out of whatever I'm doing like I'll need to send an email and my mind will scream at me to not type it or send it, that it's unnecessary, that I'm wrong to email, that I'm making a fool of myself etc. I've dealt with anxiety for as long as I can remember but over time a series of traumatic events occurred that has tailored my anxiety. What I mean by that is, my most recent major traumatic event was a few years ago and involved bullying, betrayal, and writing so now I'm anxious about stuff I write (like school essays) and my anxiety is now very social because my mind is trying too hard to protect me from that event. Another thing that I've dealt with my whole life is maladaptive daydreaming. The biggest concern I have with my trauma is that over time and as events occurred, I progressively stopped expressing emotions. I'm now at a point where I have to guess what I'm feeling based on my thoughts because I'm not actively aware of my emotions outside of flashes of anxiety or other fleeting intensity. I'm not emotionally present, or even down to earth at all, most of the time.

My history with therapy: I had very inconsistent care for a couple of years from a CBT therapist who wasn't very good for me. She was dismissive and didn't hold me accountable, she chalked up my daydreaming issue to dissociation and didn't really do anything to address it. I had another therapist in 2019 who I liked because she was very genuine. She also claimed she did CBT but we just talked and there was no clear plan for me. I have another therapist now who is going to do EMDR with me once she has in-person appointments again, but all she's done is mindfulness stuff that I couldn't get into. I told her about maladaptive daydreaming and it was new information for her. Plus, when we tried EMDR remotely, my trouble with feeling/identifying/expressing emotions made the whole thing feel unproductive. All of these therapists have been counselors and not clinical psychologists.

End: Have any of y'all dealt with similar issues? if so, what therapy helped you? Since CBT hasn't been effective, and EMDR might not be either, what do y'all think I should look into?

215,How to Overcome PTSD,"**Introduction**

PTSD stands for Post-traumatic stress disorder, which is a mental disorder that someone can develop after a significantly traumatic event. Some of these events can include: physical assault, sexual assault, natural disaster, car accident, armed robbery, warfare.

About 6 of every 10 men (or 60%) and 5 of every 10 women (or 50%) experience at least one trauma in their lives. Women are more likely to experience sexual assault and child sexual abuse, whereas men are more likely to experience accidents, physical assault, combat, disaster, or to witness death or injury.

(*The following statistics are based on the U.S. population*)

About 7 or 8 out of every 100 people (or 7-8% of the population) will have PTSD at some point in their lives. About 8 million adults have PTSD during a given year. This is only a small portion of those who have gone through a trauma.

The latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) groups the symptoms of PTSD under the follow four clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions and mood, and arousal.

**Re-experiencing:**

* Vivid flashbacks, intrusive thoughts or images, nightmares, intense distress at reminders of the trauma, physical sensations (such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling).

**Avoidance:**

* Feeling like you have to keep busy, avoiding anything that reminds you of the trauma, being unable to remember details of what happened, feeling emotionally numb or cut off from your feelings, feeling physically numb or detached from your body, being unable to express affection, using alcohol or drugs to avoid memories.

**Negative cognitions and mood:**

* Feeling like you can't trust anyone, feeling like nowhere is safe, feeling like nobody understands, blaming yourself for what happened, overwhelming feelings of anger, sadness, guilt or shame.

**Arousal:**

* Panicking when reminded of the trauma, being easily upset or angry, extreme alertness (also sometimes called 'hypervigilance’), disturbed sleep or a lack of sleep, irritability or aggressive behaviour, finding it hard to concentrate – including on simple or everyday tasks, being jumpy or easily startled, self-destructive behaviour or recklessness, other symptoms of anxiety.

&#x200B;

**Tip 1: Know Your Triggers**

Triggers are any stimulus that causes your mind or body to recall a previous traumatic experience, which can feel like you are re-experiencing the event that originally caused the trauma. The stimulus may not be frightening or exactly the same as the original cause of trauma. Triggers can come in a variety of forms including: sights, sounds, smells, tastes, textures, people, thoughts, emotions, places, news reports, movies, situations, anniversaries, and words. Traumatic coupling is the process of connecting a traumatic experience to a trauma trigger.

To better understand and manage your triggers, ask reflect on the following questions:

\- What trauma(s) have I experienced?

\- What are my trigger(s)?

\- How do I normally react?

\- What are some better ways of coping/reacting in these situations?

&#x200B;

**Tip 2: Relaxation Techniques**

Relaxation techniques are another treatment for PTSD, which can help to reduce anxiety and calm the nervous system. The following list contains several ways of helping to become relaxed, which should ease some of the symptoms of PTSD:

**Meditation** \- Meditation is about training awareness of the mind, and learning to observe your thoughts and feelings in a nonjudgmental way. (Learn more about it here: [https://www.headspace.com/meditation-101/what-is-meditation](https://www.headspace.com/meditation-101/what-is-meditation))

**Breathing exercises** \- Breathing exercises are a simple yet effective way of calming both the body and the mind. Try square breathing: 1) Visualise a square 2) Breathe in for 4 seconds picturing one side of the square. 3) Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the second side 4) Breathe out over 4 seconds visualising the third side 5) Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the fourth side.

**Yoga** \- Yoga is a Hindu spiritual discipline, which includes breath control, meditation ,and adopting certain body postures. It can be used for simple relaxation, but also has numerous health benefits.

**Massage** \- PTSD has shown to be responsive to massage therapy for many patients. Massages can help to alleviate tightness and pain that are felt in the muscles and tissues in the body. Stress and anxiety may also be lessened by loosening things up and creating more flexibility in the patient.

**Sleep** \- Getting enough sleep is important to stay healthy and refreshed. Sleep deprivation can leader to irritability, anger, and moodiness. (Recommend 8 hours).

&#x200B;

**Tip 3: Exposure Therapy**

Exposure therapy is a behaviour therapy sometimes used to treat anxiety disorders, including PTSD. It involves deliberately confronting the source of what causes someone anxiety or fear (if it is safe and reasonable to do so), which often helps to reduce symptoms. Numerous studies have shown the effectiveness of exposure therapy in treatment various disorders including: generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, PTSD and specific phobias.

To make this process easier, you could try systematic desensitization instead, which is a gradual exposure to the source of the fear or anxiety, whilst also incorporating counterconditioning principles including mediation and breathing.

Both exposure therapy and systematic desensitization may be easier if you have a friend, family member, or trained therapist with you to help you overcome your fears. It really depends on the severity of the condition, and what the person feels the most comfortable with.

I was SA and almost unalived when I was 12. It was by a family friend and two other men. Long story short, the family friend was to pick me up after school. He did, I trusted him and also had a crush on him. I knew one of the two other men. The most I remember is being in some woods and being SA by all three at different times. I blacked out and regained consciousness in the hospital. My mom told me I had been out for a week. Also, it took them 3 days to find me. And the family friend “found” me. Being 12, all I wanted was my mom and dad. I was able to tell who did it. There was no trial, all pleaded guilty to SA and attempted murder. From 13 to 16 was hell for me. The worst time in my life. Tons and tons of therapy, started helping me deal and heal from what happened. I still do therapy at 50. But lately, those memories have started coming back.

218,Thoughts on The Holistic Psychologist?,"So I’ve been in therapy for almost a year now for CPTSD. My therapist and I do a mixture of EMDR and talk therapy, but in between sessions my main focus is on reparenting. I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress and I feel the best when I’m doing that. However yesterday, I saw that people were calling out The Holistic Psychologist or Dr. Nicole Lapera for multiple things. If you don’t know her, she does have extensive training in the field, but basically totally rejects everything they teach and promotes self healing. I was very drawn to this for a while before starting therapy because I had traumatic experiences with therapists as a child. Hopefully you’re familiar with her already so this makes sense.

Today I had someone from a recruitment agency call and tell me about a position available at a company, they sent me an email about the role and to let them know if i was interested. It wasn’t something I was really interested in so I emailed them instead of calling letting them know I don’t think that position was suitable for me. But now I’m anxious cause I think they were expecting me to call them telling them not emailing but I genuinely can’t keep calling people cause it stresses me out also it’s a waste of time on their end for me to call and say no.

Tried many things, medication never worked, EMDR, talk therapy, diet and lifestyle change, yoga, workout, acupuncture, medication changes, literally nothing has worked. No answer can otherwise be found medically to cause my night terrors and imesnse sweats. My doctor sent me to a clinic in the city hours away. This clinic offered me a stellate ganglion nerve block, a treatment that has extremely high success rates for other people with PTSD. I got the treatment on my left side and was told results are rather immediate but my problems only really happen at night. Long journey home, went to bed. And nothing changed. Absolutely nothing. Family told me to hope it worked the next night. Nothing. Same with last night. I wouldve made a big deal and been upset maybe a few years ago, when a treatment didn't work I'd be devastated, but I'm out of hope. I have a follow up appointment with the clinic over the phone in a few days, but im afraid they won't believe me. It wouldn't be a first time a doctor dismissed me. Additionally there are no mental health professionals at this clinic (clinic is chronic pain based) so im afraid on how it'll go.

221,Weather,"So it just dawned on me today why this year I am absolutely dreading the summer days getting colder and seeing the onset of winter. For context, it’s always been my favorite season. 

This past year I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depression, went through EMDR therapy and conquered that, and am on medications for both. I’m so much better now. I’m myself again and I feel amazing. Summer was so fun for me. I have friends again, and I’ve been able to see them this year. 

Anyway, I was in my car today and the first flurries of the season are falling. I realized that I was in a really, really dark place last year. Maybe that’s why I’m dreading these darker days, because instinctively they’ve been mentally darker in the past. 

Well anyway, I’m much better now. I’m trying not to be sad or discouraged about the snow and short days but dang it gets cold over here! Haha",1666510516.0,False,1,2,gingersnap919,None,ybbbor,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ybbbor/weather/
222,Always feel like I've done something wrong,"I'm wondering if there is a term or anything for this?
And what, if anything, I can do to stop feeling guilty?

I struggle with always feeling like I've done something wrong and need to apologise. Even stupid small things, that I know are stupid. I feel like ive wronged people and will feel immensely guilty until I've explained myself and been told it's alright. It stays in my mind forever until I do.

----POTENTIAL TW----


I know where it comes from, it's due to having been in a narcissistic abuse situation, where I was constantly gaslit and made to feel that everything i did was wrong. Constant feeling at fault and apologising was normal to me for a very long time. Was also quite a violent situation, if that's relevant.
I suffer PTSD and other struggles because of it

I went on a bit of a mission recently, messaged absolutely everyone that I felt I'd wronged in some way, explained what I felt I did wrong, apologised, etc. only to have absolutely everyone tell me that it wasn't a problem, or they hadn't even noticed, and that I was worrying over nothing. Actually had a few people laugh at me for holding onto the guilt of something tiny for so long.

Felt free of the guilt for a little while, but now I'm back in the situation of feeling like I've wronged someone.
It's a fling-come-new-friendship that I met at a festival. I feel like I made them uncomfortable somehow. (Yet they spent 3 days with me after the thing I feel I did wrong) They've given no indication at all that they are bothered by it, they could easily have just ditched me there, and could easily have blocked me since if they WERE uncomfortable. but I still feel like I did something wrong.

I know it's in my head, or at least I'm fairly certain it is (everything else was)
Most of my friends understand this struggle, as I've been quite open with them, having apologised to most of them for similar stupid things.

But I'm looking for a way to explain to this new friend, who doesnt really know me yet, that this is how my brain works.

Is there a term for this?

Also, if you have any advice, or experience the same thing, please help me out here.

I'm sick of feeling like this all the time, and especially sick of making things awkward with people when I can't explain properly.",1712464091.0,False,1,1,Altruistic_Diet_9831,None,1bxvjt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1bxvjt8/always_feel_like_ive_done_something_wrong/
223,It is not working.,"IT HAVE NEVER BEEN WORKING. I have been doing emdr therapy since 5 months ago now, and all I've done is making the memories foggy and confusing. Take it along with the every day medicines, and everything gets even worse. Quetiapine, lithium, and all the stuff that is supposed to help you but that makes me sleepy instead. So I become sleepy, confused, I can feel the pressure inside my head of sheer violent and intrusive thoughts that are related to surreal stuff. Every time I close my eyes, I can feel the extreme desire of hurting someone, possibly myself. Not really because I hate myself, but simply because I'm the easiest target. I'm willing to get hurt and the mental image of me with an arm less is just...so good. It's godly. It makes me relax, almost in a sexual way. It's been months. I take the max amount of many medicines. 600mg of quetiapine. 600 fucking mg. It's the largest legal amount my psychiatrist can give me! I would even be happy with them, if things were going foward! But as I said, emdr isn't doing anything. The only thing we understood, is that I actually hate myself so much I want to be someone else. But even then, there is nothing to do. I can't be fucking brainwashed. Yet somehow I manage to do that myself. My copying mechanism is extreme. In the moment I see a personality I like, I try to assimilate as much as I can. And if your brain works, you can intuite that it doesn't work out. I feel...cold. I feel really cold. Alone. I am surrounded by people but I feel alone. I finished high school and I want to go to a psychology university here in italy but yet I consider myself a failure. It's those fucking voices. I don't actually hear voices, but I can hear the pressure of THINGS in my head moving as they tell me to do despicable things to myself and others, for reasons that I don't understand. A really good specialist told me that for some months I would've been doing emdr therapy to get some bad effects of my memories from the way, so we could understand what is wrong with me. But apparently it's not working. That ""something"", that is wrong with me, is just too off. I cannot fight something I don't understand. I cannot just keep taking more and more medicines. I cannot just keep thinking about memories that don't have emotional attachments anymore. I...I just feel like I can't go on in any way. Yet I keep doing that anyway.

225,I had strange symptoms tonight and need advice.,"For some background, I'm a marine corps veteran. I got out recently on a medboard. I was injured in a training accident involving me, a grenade sump and pitch blackness. I'll let you imagine the rest because I don't like to go into detail. 

I am disabled now and use a cane. I was diagnosed with PTSD and went through cognitive behavioral therapy with no fix really. EMDR was sort of helpful. We did sessions and for whatever reasons, pink is a comfort color for me. I type this literally laying on a pink couch. I couldn't tell you the weird hypnotic EMDR science behind it dawg, it just works for me. 

Well tonight I went to get groceries. I'm typically sort of anxious out in public. I am hyper vigilant and paranoid around other people. I do feel like other people may harm me, but I try to block out those thoughts. Tonight I experienced something weird. I was pushing the cart with my partner and started to feel off. Like super thirsty and dizzy. I thought I was probably dehydrated and brushed it off. I was sort of clinging to the cart and with a cane in one hand. I noticed everything was louder all of a sudden, and I felt like I could only hear the buzzing of the cold foods sections. I couldn't even hear my partner. It started to die down a bit but then worse shit happened. Recently I've been hearing voices and seeing some shadowy stuff in my peripherals. I haven't brought this up to a therapist because I don't fancy a trip into the grippy sock palace. 

So for a solid half an hour while my partner talked on the phone, I felt like I wasn't even in my body. I was hearing all these people talking, seeing my vision shift and these shadows move and dart across my vision. Almost like rats running along the floor.  That's the best way I can describe it. I couldn't remember my shopping list or anything. I told my partner I had to leave, but couldn't hear myself say it, so I started trudging through the isles a little. I didn't really remember where the exit was. I was just wandering. 

The last thing I remember was being in the check out line with my partner and grabbing a pink pack of gum. I started feeling calmer immediately just by staring at it. A lady got mad I was holding up the line and it shook me a little. I apologized and just clung to the cart and moved on. 

I'm back home now and I'm okay. Just drinking lots of water but I feel exhausted. Like I just lifted or went to the gym for hours. I can not for the life of me figure out what triggered this, what these are symptoms of. I know PTSD is a complex mental health disorder. But these are more frequent now and scary.

227,"My mind is confusing a traumatic memory, and it’s making me deteriorate. [SA TW]","Huge TW for SA. 


Hi all, I’m 22F. 

To start, I was SAed when I was between 10-12 years old. I went my whole life believing it was a doctor who touched me inappropriately, while a nurse held me down and my mother watched.

I started therapy last year, didn’t go for awhile and restarted recently. Through EMDR we revealed that it wasn’t a doctors office, and I was in my childhood home, and it was a man and a woman. My therapist said this might have been because i was so young, I tried to make sense of it in the best way I could to protect myself.


I revealed that, and then stopped going to therapy for awhile due to money issues. I finally picked back up recently, and we’ve started working on that part of my trauma because it affects my every everyday, in the way I walk around to the way I develop relationships.

But my mind absolutely refuses to unlock any memories. It bounces between the doctors office and the house. Who it was and who it wasn’t. I can’t see faces, I can only see snippets and hear little things. It’s so frustrating. No matter what I do, it’s like my mind is still trying it’s damnedest to protect me. 

Trying to push these memories has honestly made me worse. I feel awful. I can’t sleep, the most I can is about 2 or 3 hours a day. I’m anxious and sad all the time, and I break down often in crying fits.

I just need a little support. Is there anyone else who’s mind’s done this because of their traumas? Where you’re confused and unsure of all the details, or your young mind created some kind of false memory to protect yourself?  

 I’m worried that people are going to stop believing me because I’m so confused and can’t give all the details.",1695832135.0,False,2,2,ThrowRA_tower888,None,16tp5dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16tp5dj/my_mind_is_confusing_a_traumatic_memory_and_its/
228,"My mental health is declining and I can feel it, but can’t fix it.","Update: if anyone feels like this after getting meds increased, reach out to your doctor. I had a severe mental breakdown two days ago. The day after posting. I had to get the local crisis center support. I had a paradoxical reaction to my anti depression/OCD meds. It was horrible. I have been put on some strong medications that completely numb you just to counteract the negative effects of the med increase. 

Please, if you realize your mental health has done a 180 and you have had an increase in meds, talk to your doctor. It is not common but it happens. . . . . 



I have been diagnosed with so many differing diagnoses that I don’t know what I really have. At first, it was Generalized Anxiety Disorder and depression. Then it was regular anxiety and depression. Treated with minimal therapy (a therapist saying “take these meds, listen to this podcast, stop watching shows because you are using them as a coping mechanism and not working through your issues”) and meds. No change. 
5 years later, I decided to go to a mental health and recovery center for actual mental health. Have been diagnosed severe OCD, depression, anxiety, PTSD (severe childhood abuse) and ADHD. Currently taking meds for OCD (they seem to work better than old meds for GAD) and doing weekly therapy. 
Recently I have gotten into a deep, empty place. I don’t want to do anything. I can barely go to work. I’m the breadwinner and have to go to work everyday. When I get there, my brain fogs. I can’t focus. I feel empty and dead inside. My therapist has started me with EMDR but I’m feeling worse and worse every week. She says there is a process, that I am working through things, but I can’t see the light at the end. I dread my weekly sessions. I don’t want to eat, only sleep. I’m loosing my hair and have been throwing up daily. My job is getting more stressful but I’m managing-barely. 
I don’t know what to do. My meds have been nearly doubled in the past month. Is that causing this? Can I tell my therapist that I can’t continue EMDR? I’ve lost interest in all of my hobbies. I no longer want to do anything other than lay in bed in the dark. My husband doesn’t understand because he doesn’t have the mental health issues I have. No one understands. They think I need to “talk to the doc and get more meds”. I want to get out of this rut but I feel like the more I try, the deeper I fall.
