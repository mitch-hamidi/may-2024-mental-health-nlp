1,mental health medications clarification,"few weeks ago, i did DASS test online and made at the first appointment at a local clinic. my DASS result showed that both my depression and anxiety are severe. but the psychiatrist only diagnosed me with a mild depression after 45 minutes session. 

disclaimer- i have no objections to taking any medications if it will really help making my mental health state better. although, i did mention to the psychiatrist that i prefer not to as i don't want build dependency on the meds. i also inquired about the side effects of taking medicines and they said there were none(?) which confused me. bcs i did a lot of research before the appointment. and some articles also said that the psychiatrist is supposed to tell us the side effects of medications before prescribing it to us, right?

also, i felt like taking medications will only alleviate the symptoms but not fix the root cause of my mental health issues. besides, i have read that certain people build immunity over those meds and it doesn't help them as much as before :// i tried opening up about my old wounds and traumas but the psychiatrist doesn't ask any probing questions after that and cut the session short.

would like to know if anyone faces the same issues as me?",1715749354.0,False,1,0,perpetualruminations,None,1cscxl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cscxl0/mental_health_medications_clarification/
2,Endless medications,"I‚Äôve been on everyone medication you can name, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, lithium, quetiapine, valium, dominion, Zoloft and that‚Äôs just a few and only ones specifically for depression. Nothing has worked. I‚Äôm either allergic to it and up with Neurolepticmalignant syndrome or seratonin syndrome or it simply doesn‚Äôt work. I recently tried TMS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation) which was painful and exhausting but helped a bit but didn‚Äôt last. I am 15. 

My psychiatrist has always believed that there was a medical aspect at play. I‚Äôve spent years going from specialist after specialist and they can never agree. Some say it‚Äôs POTS and fybromylagia but others say vasculitis. I also suffer from tachycardia. Either way my offical diagnosis is treatment resistant depression, ADHD, autism, OCD and tourrettes 

I don‚Äôt leave the house and barely my room, I don‚Äôt have friends and have been homeschooled for 3 years now. It just me and my mum. She is a clinical psychologist and is very clearly getting hopeless. 

I am currently on, atomoxatine , dominion , perindopril, propranolol. The side effects are fucking horrendous. I am very sensitive to medications and am very prone to weird reactions.

4,My personal experience with psychiatric medications.,"After 3 months of taking Sertraline 100mg once a day and 10mg of buspirone twice a day(prescribed by psychiatrist), I am ready to share my experience with you, especially with those who judged me for not visiting a psychiatrist. In the first week I did not notice any difference, no side-effects, and no improvements. After week one the nightmare began: Brain fog: I had concentration, judgement, and decision-making impairment. I couldn‚Äôt even concentrate on a simple topic like listening to news on the radio. I couldn‚Äôt make a decision between two basic options like: Should I read a book now or watch TV? Headache feeling: a mixed feeling between headache and lightheadedness. Constipation: passing bricks instead of, oh you know, normal things. Excessive tiredness and daytime sleepiness: I felt extreme fatigue all the time, day and night. I couldn‚Äôt complete a simple task. I couldn‚Äôt even do my daily personal tasks appropriately. Weight gain and sweets craving: I was hungry all the time and I wanted nothing but sweets, specifically chocolate donuts. I gained 6 kilograms of extra weight. Sounds so nice and life-giving? I don‚Äôt think so. Agitation: What is your reaction if someone accidentally kicked your leg? Any sane person would react: ‚Äúno problem ma‚Äôam/sir‚Äù. But when you take these pills, you will react so strongly to such minor issues that you will immediately regret your nasty reaction. Muscle fatigue (muscle rigidity): I had pain and spasm in my shoulders and neck area, no matter what position I was in.
üö®Warningüö®: in the following i will say things that psychiatrists won't like, but these are truth. So if you are a psychatrist i recommend you to don't read this if you dont want to get hurt.
Taking into account the things I said above. I came to the conclusion that I became unhappy and hated myself because these characteristics that these pills had imposed on me were completely in conflict with my personality characteristics, which was an active and lively person. And this personality conflict made me hate myself. Because I had a desire to do an activity efficiently, but these problems caused by the pills prevented me from reaching my goal. Until one day, I decided to throw this garbages that the psychiatrists call them medication into the trash bin and I stopped using them. After almost a week of stopping the drugs, I returned to my normal state and was freed from that painful nightmare. And finally, I believed in my own opinion that psychiatry is not a science but a fraud. Pharmaceutical companies produce poisons under the name of medicine, and fraudsters under the name of psychiatrists are responsible for distributing these poisons. This is an unethical business. The doctor profits from the money the patient pays for the visit, and the pharmaceutical company profits from the sale of its poisons. When you visit a psychiatrist, you have one or two problems that you want to solve. But by giving you these poisons, the psychiatrist increases your pain and suffering so that you have to go to him again and pay, and instead he prescribes new poisons for you that double your problems and you go to him again until You realize that you have become dependent on him and his drugs. Yes, you are the credit card that psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies are constantly draining it.",1711141854.0,False,0,7,CaptainMarvel79,None,1bla98w,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1bla98w/my_personal_experience_with_psychiatric/

10,Frustrated about my 9 years on medications,"TLDR at the bottom

[27F] So 9 years ago I had a pretty severe panic disorder. The panic disorder was from previously untreated anxiety and a marijuana induced panic attacked. I couldn‚Äôt eat sleep or function, so at 19 and in my freshman year of college I was put on an SSRI, I think it was Zoloft or lexapro. Through the years I‚Äôve continued to struggle with anxiety and depression and stayed on medication, I‚Äôve tried several and I‚Äôm now on 40mg of Prozac. 

In 2022 I was diagnosed with ADD inattentive type and put on stimulants. At first they helped tremendously but homely the past year and a half has sucked so bad. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist and a general practitioner and I just continue to feel worse and worse and continue to get prescribed more and more. I‚Äôm now on 40mg Prozac, 300 Wellbutrin, 20 Vyvanse, and .5 klonopin as needed, which is becoming more frequent. I‚Äôm also about to switch to concerta because of the Vyvanse shortage.

To make it worse I went back on birth control 2 months ago due to being sexually active again and maaaaannn that was a mistake. I‚Äôve been crying for like a month straight so I‚Äôm stopping the birth control and talking to my GP about another 

I‚Äôm honestly  just so freaking over being medicated. I‚Äôm worse now than I was 9 years ago, I constantly feel like crap, and the medicine isn‚Äôt even working. I‚Äôm wondering how many of my symptoms are from the medication it‚Äôs self!! 

I tried talking to my doctor about stopping the stimulants but got dismissed. I‚Äôm just so annoyed and over it. I want to talk to a NEW doctor about coming off of all the med entirely because I don‚Äôt even know what my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is anymore. 

I also think I am going to find a new therapist as I am not making any progress with my current one‚Ä¶

TLDR: been on medication for 9 years, it‚Äôs not working and I‚Äôm arguably worse than when I started taking them. I‚Äôm so over it and want to come off everything but I‚Äôm so scared and don‚Äôt feel like my doctor is supportive ",1708536815.0,False,5,5,gingernila,None,1awhz0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1awhz0x/frustrated_about_my_9_years_on_medications/

19,How do you know that you REALLY need medications?,"For those of you who take medications for psychiatric reasons, how did you know that you *actually* needed them?  Or do you feel like you actually *need* them or is it more that it is easier to manage your symptoms without meds than with them, and you don't want to deal with the emotional/physical/mental work of doing it without medications?  


I am not asking this in an accusatory way, I am asking it because I am really struggling with this myself.  I am starting to think that I shouldn't *actually* be on medication.  I am not anti-medication, and in fact I have recommended people look into it multiple times.  What I am anti- is taking medication if you don't need it.   


I know taking pills for a mental illness is usually compared to taking insulin for diabetes.  But what about those of us who could control our symptoms with some effort and discipline on our part?  I guess I feel like it is more like a person buying a power wheelchair simply because they get tired when they walk because they don't exercise regularly or eat well, or just because they are lazy or something.  It isn't the same as someone using a wheelchair because they have a chronic fatigue syndrome, or paralysis, or an amputation or needs a hip replacement or anything like that.  


I sometimes wonder if that is what I am doing when I take medications.  Do I *actually need* them?  Or am I just being too lazy to really work on myself and my lifestyle?  How can someone tell the difference?  How am I supposed to know whether this is a matter of a poor diet, not enough exercise, not using the right coping strategies, not having a structured enough lifestyle, etc  OR  something biologically based that will need to be managed with medication *in addition to all of those other things*?

36,Getting off of Psychiatric Medications?,"I decided about a week ago that Im on too much medication and I need to reduce my psychiatric meds. Im already on Physical health medications that I need so I can walk,eat,etc but when it comes to  psychiatric meds they've never helped and only made me feel numb and terrible. 

I stopped my Antidepressant, my sleep medication and my nightmare medication. I was apparently sapose to taper off the antidepressant for safety to reduce seizures and things but now that I haven't had it in  about week its completely gone out of my system and I'm feeling fine. It takes 4 days for my specific medication to leave my body. Ive been on antidepressants from ages 12-25 and I'm sick of it. 

Covering up my issues with medications hasn't helped,   its been so hard for me to know what emotions I've felt and what I wanted to do with my life. Ive had trouble dissociation-wise with all these meds and I feel like being off them its easier to be present. 

&#x200B;

I just talked to my psychiatrist today and asked him to reduce my medications to ""see how I feel"" and he didn't seem to care I stopped taking all my sleep meds. I didn't want to tell him I already stopped the antidepressant because I feel like If I were to tell a doctor or therapist I stopped my meds they'd think I'm being ""non compliant"" or something and send me inpatient. I think if a medication is helping you stay on it, but Ive never felt relief from meds for psychiatric reasons and its been so hard.

* [Antipsychotics](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Antipsychotics)
* [Medication Log PDF](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Free_Medication_Log_PDF)

## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs

**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**

Drug class

This is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain.

**Over 10% of the US** takes an SSRI

What Do SSRIs Do?

What does **every** medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you‚Äôre blocking the neurons from *reabsorbing* Serotonin, meaning there is **more Serotonin** available.

Since this medication increases serotonin levels, you‚Äôll have more of it to regulate your mood and symptoms of anxiety. Your brain also has to adapt to more Serotonin. It‚Äôs thought that by your brain having to restructure from an increase in serotonin, it becomes more able to ‚Äúremodel‚Äù and better able to adapt to stressors like anxiety.

So what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, and our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.

Did You Know?

Serotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. We can measure the levels in our blood, but we can‚Äôt measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we‚Äôre all in the dark as to how much we have in our brain.

## Azapirones

**Buspar Buspirone**¬†

Drug Class

Buspirone is in the drug class of Azapirones. There is no addiction risk, overall there are less side effects than many other anxiolytic medicines. It can take up to a month for the medication to work fully. Typically prescribed for *generalized* anxiety.

What Does It Do?

This drug class impacts serotonin and dopamine receptors. The full mechanism of the drug aren‚Äôt known actually. But, because it seems to take 2-4 weeks to make a difference, that would mean it likely has to do with the receptors for serotonin and dopamine.

It is thought that by the receptors adjusting, it can make them more adaptive and therefore *better able* to handle stress. Another possibility is that by blocking serotonin receptors, an increase of serotonin is available, which improves symptoms for some types of anxiety disorders.

Did You Know?

The drug Buspar was originally developed for schizophrenia, but wasn‚Äôt useful. It did however seem to help people with anxiety. Dizziness seems to be one of the most common complaints as far as side effects.

## Antihistamines

**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,¬† hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,¬† triprolidine, triafed**

Drug Class

Commonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different ‚Äògenerations‚Äô & target different histamine receptors in our body.

* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body
* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion
* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System
* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched

What Do Antihistamines Do?

We‚Äôre actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that¬†**anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic;¬†**blocking** receptors for choline.

**Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax** are commonly prescribed for anxiety.

While your risks with this drug class are much less severe than when taking benzodiazepines, these are first generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this also means they can impair our ability to remember, think and learn. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain.

An example of **second** generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won‚Äôt do you much good.

Did you know?

The only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways **in addition** to the reason why it‚Äôs administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much **less** specific in their effects, they have more side effects.

Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings (for anxiety included).

## Benzodiazepines

**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**

Drug Class

These are commonly used as anxiety medicines (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.

This drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which **slows down** our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).

Anesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?

The Drawbacks of Benzos

When Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is we‚Äôre now in a benzo addiction crisis. We‚Äôre learning over time as a society, and those changes don‚Äôt happen overnight.

This drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is **advantageously quick acting**, the effects linger.¬† Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory.

The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.

This is why a rehab center isn‚Äôt going to allow the use of this drug class while recovering. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking benzodiazepines while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning at full capacity & you‚Äôre not able to retain information, progress becomes much more difficult.

The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.

Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They‚Äôre a life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with consistent¬†*repeated*¬†use we will need¬†**increasingly** higher doses.

Another point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.

This is often what is referred to as¬†*‚Äú****rebound anxiety****‚Äù*¬† because your anxiety is likely to get worse, **before** it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken frequently and long term.

The mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time. I‚Äôve even worked with prescribers who won‚Äôt prescribe them, period.

Now, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don‚Äôt go flush yours down the toilet after reading this!

## Beta Blockers

**acebutolol, atenolol, tenormin, bisoprolol, zebeta, metoprolol, lopressor, toprol XL, nadolol, corgard, nebivolol, bystolic, propranolol, inderal, innopran XL**

Drug Class

A beta blocker is most often used for heart conditions since this drug class lowers blood pressure and heart rate. But, they do this by blocking epinephrine which we commonly refer to as adrenaline. By blocking adrenaline, you prevent the progression of the physical symptoms of anxiety, like increased heart rate and blood pressure.

These can be prescribed ‚Äúas needed‚Äù and is also prescribed long term to be taken regularly.¬† Sometimes doctors will prescribe them for public speaking, or other stressful events someone has to face.

What do Beta Blockers Do?

Well, they Block Beta-adrenergic receptors, preventing norepinephrine and epinephrine from activating those receptors. This relaxes heart muscles, slows the heart beat, and lowers blood pressure.

That might seem completely unrelated to anxiety to some people, but when anxiety starts it will create **physical symptoms** that tend to make us feel even more panicked. This is why it can be pretty helpful to stop the physical symptoms from escalating an already *not-so-good* state of mind.

Did you know?

Beta blockers can be used for tremors, migraines, abnormal heart rhythms, and chest pain too.

Summary

Beta blockers can be a useful anxiety medication. As a nurse some of the things I pay attention to when a patient is prescribed them are obviously heart rate and blood pressure. **Energy level** is always something that can be impacted too.

It‚Äôs not uncommon for someone to become tired, groggy, lightheaded, or get headaches from beta blockers. Even for people who take it for high blood pressure and heart rate, it can have a tendency to drop them too low.

Everyone is different, our diets change, our weight changes, our stress levels change, how hydrated we are fluctuates, our salt intake varies; and **all of these** impact our blood pressure. So, it‚Äôs always a good idea to be keeping an eye on your heart performance with a beta blocker and your doctor who is prescribing should be too.

## Tricyclic Antidepressant¬† | TCAs

**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**

Drug Class

The word ‚Äútricyclic‚Äù refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed **before** SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays.

TCAs are still often prescribed for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.

What do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?

What do **all** TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors.

These key differences from SSRIs create a cascade of effects in the body that make them a bit more likely to cause side effects; like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.

Did You Know?

In 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 (a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new ‚Äòinvention‚Äô was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.

Summary

These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life, while for another it can leave a bad impression.

\*Note each drug **within** the class impacts the *degree* of these effects a little differently.

## Antipsychotics

**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics**

Drug Class

Commonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette‚Äôs syndrome, Huntington‚Äôs disease, and anxiety.

What Do They Do?

Most drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.

Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it‚Äôs to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.

This class is broken up into two categories;

**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which can impact our cognition and the complex way in which we store memories.

\*More movement disorders come with the first generation antipsychotics.

**Second Generation: (new, atypical):**¬†Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.**¬†Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.

Hopefully this helps clarify some information on these common 7 classes of medications. If not feel free to submit a question in the comments, or by using my contact form below and I‚Äôll do my best to answer.

57,How to get rid of loud screaming in my head and dissasociation from medications?,"I've been taking Sertraline 100 mg (everyday) and Quetiapine 25 mg (as needed, for insomnia) for about 8 months. I feel significantly better because of it, and my mood and overall mental well-being is the best it has been in a long time. 

I acquired physical side-effects from them, like restless legs, insomnia, teeth chattering, amongst others. I did some searching and apparently these are normal things to experience. However, I have been experiencing a lot more dissasociating, especially after I take Quetiapine. I also recently started hearing screaming in my head. Whenever I am alone, I hear screaming at random times. The most alarming thing that has been happening is that whenever anything slightly triggers me/reminds me of a traumatic event/be reminded of someone that hurt me/etc., it screams ""Kill yourself"" and other obscenities that I don't mean. I think I have become a more patient person recently, but sometimes I get irrationally angry too‚Äîbut not to the point of actually wishing/inflicting violence on anyone. All the internet tells me to do is take deep breaths, walk, find distractions, etc., but I do that all the time, it still comes back. Plus I don't want to keep looking for distractions, I want to stop it completely

68,Medications,"Hello. I have a couple of questions. I am currently on Adderall XR, duloxetine, propranolol, gabapentin, and klonopin. 

I suffer from depression, PTSD, anxiety, social anxiety, intrusive thoughts(thoughts that don‚Äôt feel like my own and that I don‚Äôt want to have), when I‚Äôm around people I feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong or acting weird, and ADHD. 

I have a huge fear of death. My nine month old son unexpectedly passed away in Dec of 2019. He was and still is my world. I have a lot of regret going to work that day and thinking there may have been something that I could have done to save him. I was at work at the time. I rushed home when I got the call from my husband. Th EMTs would not let me in the ambulance and I did not get to see my baby until he was already gone. Afterwards I would stay up all night and check my other kids regularly to make sure they were okay. I have a huge fear of anything demonic, death, windows where you can see your shadow ect. I went to the doctor and they said I was just depressed. I started having panic attacks regularly, which I had to go to the hospital for because I thought I was having a heart attack. Now certain things tigger me and I will start having intrusive thoughts(thoughts that don‚Äôt feel like my own and that I don‚Äôt want to have).

Also, I can‚Äôt go to sleep unless my husband lets me fall asleep first. If he falls asleep before me I will stay up half the night. I can‚Äôt have any fans running or the tv on because my mind wants to listen for every little sound and freak out.

I don‚Äôt like people very much. Mainly because I feel weird around them. I start to think that I‚Äôm doing something wrong or acting strange, so I want to get away from them as quickly as possible. 

I do not like to hear about depressive or sad events from other people regarding there lives. This acts as a trigger for me especially if someone in there family died or something. I have a hard time reasoning or trying to make other people feel better. Hearing peoples stories just clams me up, freaks me out, and intrusive thoughts begin. 

My child hood to me was terrible. My parents divorced at a really young age. My mom and her new husband never wanted to deal with me. My mom worked nights and my step dad stayed home with me. I was always bound to the house. If I did something wrong I would be grounded to my room for at least a month. I could only come out of my room to use the bathroom or eat. If I woke up to early I would have been called every name in the book when it normally was his fault if I woke up early, due to him being to loud while lifting weights. I wasn‚Äôt Allowed to pour my own milk into my breakfast until I moved into my dads house at age 16. I tried to commit suicide a couple times as a child. Ect my trauma just keeps going.

This interview pissed me off so much.  The little boy is great, but obviously this interview is about the little girl being different.  

It‚Äôs people like doctors and drug companies that have perpetuated the idea that by her being different, they need to change her to have her fit into society in the way that they see fit.  She wants to miss school because she loves her little sister. Beautiful.  I guarantee you a doctor recommended to her parents that she take a drug (literally probably something akin to meth) in order to have her focus in school.

It‚Äôs disgusting.

You aren‚Äôt like this doctor? (Fucking good thank god in my opinion) but they will authorize drugs so that you are more like them.

She gets bullied at school sometimes for being different. Sure. It happens with kids to not understand someone who is different than you.

But for a doctor to not understand and accept someone who is different the way they are, it is adult idiocy in my opinion.  This is professional bullying.  

Now this girl is going to grow up thinking she has a disease or disorder because she is different.  Did you ever think that maybe she made it as far as she did in existence (her kind, her lineage, her ancestors that she got this personality from) because she didn‚Äôt focus on your dumbass?

After a very bad past 2 months full of nervous breakdowns and panic attacks I've gone through multiple medications from my former psychiatrist. In the past month I've been on:  
  
50mg Sertraline (Up from my usual 7-year-standing 25mg)  
  
40mg Buspar  
  
20mg Propanolol (as needed)  
  
100mg Trazodone (night)  
  
25mg Seroquel (night)  
  
My sleep went from 2-4 hours to 6 which is not great, but was enough of an improvement. My anxiety however still persisted and keeps getting worse and it felt like nothing helped. My former psychiatrist felt like she couldn't help me and recommended I see a psychiatrist that specializes in anxiety and sleep, whom I met with yesterday.  
  
He recommended I get off the Sertraline & Buspar as they're not helping me and replace the Seroquel and Trazodone with Remeron (Mirtazapine). He wants me to slow taper the Sertraline to 25mg for a week and then stop. I explained to him that it's a lot of psych meds to be coming off of at once, and so quickly, and was very worried but he brushed it off saying I was on ""piddling"" doses and it shouldn't matter. He was very cold and distant, especially with how much visible anguish I came into the appointment with.  
  
Last night I took the Remeron with 50mg of Trazodone (I've read enough horror stories of trazodone withdrawal, I'm not going to cold turkey that one). I got tired but just couldn't fall asleep. Another hour later I took 25mg of Trazodone, a melatonin gummy, and finally when another 40 min passed, I caved and took a small amount (10mg) of Seroquel and finally was able to get a bit of sleep.

94,"Mind altering medications, SSRIs","Ok, so as a result of some legal troubles I got into mental health treatment. Despite prosecutors thinking I‚Äôm the next osama bin laden all they could diagnose me with was social phobia and emotion management issues. I‚Äôm a long haired anti government redneck and I think these bastards can‚Äôt see through that, I have an IQ of 136 according to the guy who did my psych eval. They probably didn‚Äôt expect me to read up on the drug they tried to get me addicted to 

Like 4 days after I went to jail, I was prescribed Zoloft, 50mg. For those of you who don‚Äôt know, Zoloft is an SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Now if your like me, you read that and go ‚Äúwhat the hell does that Shit mean‚Äù 
Well serotonin is a chemical in your brain responsible for your decision making and impulse control. Reuptake means to absorb basically, and I think we all know what inhibitor means. So, this drug basically stops your brain from producing and absorbing a very important chemical called serotonin. 

So they think I‚Äôm this dangerous psychopath because I got angry after court and said a couple things I shouldn‚Äôt have, fair enough I shouldn‚Äôt have said those things, and I‚Äôd like to apologize but I‚Äôm not allowed to contact the people I said them about. But if that‚Äôs the case, why would they give me a drug that will inhibit my impulse control and decision making in my brain? 

Not to mention that SSRIs are basically the equivalent of chemical castration. Low libido, erectile dysfunction, low testosterone, weight gain, slowed muscle growth, low energy, all listed side effects of this mind altering drug they want me to take 

Now my social phobia isn‚Äôt severe. I can hold jobs, I can talk to people, it doesn‚Äôt stop me from going out if I want to( though this ankle braclete does). I do have a bit of a temper though I will say. I‚Äôm a hot head, but this isn‚Äôt the drug to give somebody like that 

I firmly believe they are using this drug to soften the playing field. These people are hell bent on destroying my life. I‚Äôm 19 years old and never hurt anybody nor damaged any property and they are trying to break me. They financially destroyed my family, I‚Äôm not allowed to work, won‚Äôt be allowed to vote, own guns to hunt which is my passion, hold a job that requires any kind of license, etc. because of this felony record. I also could get 7 years in prison. 

It‚Äôs a lot easier to beat somebody into the ground if they are medicated. 

Now you might be wondering what this has to do with mental health? Wondering who let the hillbilly schizo out of his trailer? 

Well, idk I just wanted to bring their bullshit to people‚Äôs attention. If they are doing this to me, god only knows how many other people they are doing it to. It would be different if my social phobia was debilitating, or I had more serious issues. But the need to medicate isn‚Äôt there, and this medication is the wrong one to give somebody who they suspect is horribly dangerous.

95,Memory Loss and Mental Health Medications,"Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.

**Memory** refers to the mechanisms that are used to collect, accumulate, preserve, and later retrieve information. There are three actions involved in **'memory'**: processing, storing, and recalling.

## I will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.

[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)

## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs

**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**

### Drug class

This is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.

### What Do SSRIs Do?

What does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you‚Äôre blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.

So what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.

Did You Know?

Serotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we‚Äôre all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not it‚Äôs even correlated to the amount in our blood.

How SSRIs Impact Memory

Age and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesn‚Äôt exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.

Summary

So, after reading through many articles, there overall wasn‚Äôt enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRI‚Äôs can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.

## Tricyclic Antidepressant¬† | TCAs

**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**

Drug Class

The word ‚Äútricyclic‚Äù refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.

What do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?

What do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.

Did You Know?

In 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.

How TCAs Impact Memory

There are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.

**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.

>*‚ÄúMuscarinic*¬†acetylcholine¬†*receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie¬†*memory*¬†formation‚Äù

Summary

So, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.

\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.

## Benzodiazepines

**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**

Drug Class

These are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.

&#x200B;

Let‚Äôs taco ‚Äòbout it.

This drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).

Did You Know?

Anesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?

How Benzodiazepines Impact Memory

This drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger.¬† Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.

This is why a rehab center isn‚Äôt going to allow the use of 'said drug' while ‚Äòrecovering‚Äô. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.

Now, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.

Full Disclosure

My mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.

Do you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they don‚Äôt remember shit.**¬†

How about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they don‚Äôt remember shit*.

There has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.

Another point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.

This is often what is referred to as *‚Äúrebound anxiety‚Äù*¬† because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.

Take it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.

But this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.

Now, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don‚Äôt go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.

When Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that we‚Äôre now in a benzo addiction crisis. We‚Äôre learning over time, as a society and those changes don‚Äôt happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.

3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases

Overall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.

For instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.

However, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.

Many of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.

Phenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. It‚Äôs effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.

Gabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isn‚Äôt enough research to say it‚Äôs linked to dementia though.

As far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.

## Antipsychotics

**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**

Drug Class

Commonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease

What Do They Do?

Most drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.

Did You Know?

Oddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.

Why It Impacts Memory

First, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.

This class is broken up into two categories;

**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \*More movement disorders come with the old ones.

**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.** Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.

What do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.

## Antihistamines

**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,¬† hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,¬† triprolidine, triafed**

Drug Class

Commonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.

* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body
* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion
* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System
* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched

What Do They Do?

We're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that **anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.

### Why it Impacts Memory?

Being that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.

Did you know?

The only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.

### Summary

Overall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.

An example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.

Hope this helps clarify some of the impacts of memory and mental health medications. Leave a comment if there is a drug you're still wondering about.

Apparently medication would help me a lot, but I don't know if I can live with the fact that I will become someone who takes medication.

My family always told me that people who take it are absolutely crazy mental cases and should be locked up.

They used my bio parents as examples: they actually had to be in a mental hospital, they also took drugs, stole things and were physically violent. 

All of that I have connected to medication.

I don't want to become someone who society will see as a crazy worthless mental case. I don't want to see myself as that either.

110,Medical Phobia / PTSD,"Tw: Baby loss / Cancer / Surgery

 I used to be so ashamed of how I came by PTSD but I had no idea I even had it until I arranged my parents to babysit my 4 year old and attempted to self delete.

It wasn't a longterm plan I'd just spent years either dissociated and in a state of near panic all the time. My mum used to help with childcare as I was a single parent and on bad days I used to count the minutes until my mum picked up my child so that she would be safe from me. 

I wasn't abusive I adored her but I had this sort of  visceral fear that I would miss a cue somewhere, some symptoms, something dangerous left out of place and she would die because I was inadequate. By the end I felt like the only way to keep her safe was to not be here because I was the danger. 

So I have PTSD from childbirth sort of. I became pregnant at 16 after non consensual sex at a party. I was in foster home so I informed my doctor but I didn't realise there was supposed to be midwife appointments. I had no idea how it all worked. It was all progressing seemingly normally until I went into labour at almost 18 weeks. A scan confirmed he was dead but doctors refused to surgically intervene due to my age so for a few weeks I was walking around carrying a dead baby. People smile at you a lot when you're pregnant. It felt nice when I thought I was having a baby but I felt like a total fucking imposter once I knew he was dead. Like they wouldn't smile at me if they knew. I became pretty badly dissociative even during the labour. I had these incredible cramps then I'd just tune it out. I remember a paramedic talking to me in the ambulance and I knew he was saying words but I wasn't taking anything in. 

Eventually it came to an end. All in all took over a month. I felt changed just really empty or unbelievably angry with nothing really in between. 

I went to live in a different country to get away from the old me. Met a guy. Initially just coercive and critical but I kind of liked being called a useless piece of shit because I felt like a useless piece of shit. He sexually assaulted me twice then stalked me for 4 months so I went back home. 


Went back to my old job, met another guy, 
I lost my second baby, pretty upsetting but pretty standard. It happened quickly and without much intervention. Towards the end of my miscarriage we were constantly arguing about sex. I wasn't putting out. One night I said he could but I needed to get wasted first so we did. 

Within a few weeks I found out I was pregnant again. We were advised to abstain to maximise my chances of staying pregnant but the odds weren't great. After threatening to leave several times due to the ban  he finally did and I was so glad. I wasnt really thinking longterm but the idea of going to bed at night without him touching me made me want to fucking cry with relief.

The pregnancy was very difficult. Unable to keep food down and on bed rest from 5 months as any exertion was making me bleed. My doctor doubted my dates even though we only had sex that one night so I ended up going a month overdue. 

I went in to be induced on a Monday morning. Nothing happened apart from unbearable pain during the induction. More drugs, more intervention. My notes contained a family history of almost all the women in my family having c-sections due to small bone structure. By the 5th day of my induction I was spent, I'd barely slept and couldn't keep my eyes open. They took me to the delivery suite and put me on a stronger drip and gave me a spinal block my legs were completely immobile but it did nothing for the abdominal pain. By 10am I was just howling. It didn't stop and start, I wasn't having contractions I was just screaming. It felt like my pelvis was breaking from the inside. 

Another patients anaesthetist came in and actually shouted ""why is she screaming like that?"" He was then arguing with my consultant for ages outside and later the head of her surgical team joined in. They wanted to operate at 2pm they prepped me for theatre then she came back in and said I just had a low pain threshold and that I couldn't have a c section just because its easy (nobody thinks they're fucking easy or optimal it's moronic) so they had to stop. The surgeon said he couldn't go in until she agreed or we were in danger then he could override her. 

This went on for hours. We were pure drama. There were arguments between staff and concerned patients and visitors who had to listen to me scream all day. At 7.35pm my baby stopped breathing. Things started beeping and I was just wrecked. I was grabbed by my arms to sit up and had another spinal injection. The surgeon asked me my shoe size (indicator of pelvic space) I replied ""4""  I was squirming so the block ended up in the wrong place.After that it all went batshit. I was told if she survived there could be significant brain damage.  I couldn't move from my chest downwards and couldn't feel my lungs fill. I could still feel pain but couldn't speak. I felt them cut me. The anaesthetist stayed with me. He was incredible. He was lifting my head so I didn't choke being sick. There was no screen. I could see my abdomen wipe open with 2 surgeons pretty much up to the elbows in my guts. I could see my baby's flesh in the gap as they moved her. I didn't know they were purpleish so I thought she was dead at that point. It was all over in a couple of minutes. I was counting seconds hoping to hear her cry and just nothing. Nothing for ages. 

I started to haemorrhage and was very in and out. It took quite a while for them to find and stop the bleeding apparently but I don't remember much of that. At some point during my surgery they handed my beautiful baby girl to my mum who was in theatre with me. The last thing I remember was being glad i was going to die. It sounds melodramatic but I felt destroyed. Just like meat really. 

I woke up in the recovery room some hours later. 2 nurses helped me out of the surgical gown and had to peel it off me. It was just covered. Once I got back to the ward, everyone knew what had happened. I felt ashamed and some of my family were embarrassed the only time it was referenced was one of them remarking that ""even a fucking monkey can push out a baby"" 

I discharged myself as soon as she was well enough to leave. Without the blood transfusions and with my outer stitches still in. I took them out at home. I couldn't bear the thought of another person touching me even to take my blood pressure. A different consultant came and apologised and some of the surgical team visited us on the ward. They were absolutely heroic imo.

It took almost 2 years to recover from the pregnancy and surgery. I knew my scar was bigger than those I'd seen on the ward but it wasn't til the swelling went right down I could see how disfigured my abdomen is. It's cut at a weird angle from the outer edge of my right hip to above my left hip. The muscle tissue didn't knit back together so my abdominal muscles are useless and put strain on my back. I still can't sit up straight for long. I've only ever seen the scar twice. I still can't look at it even after 2 decades. Its still tangible proof that I'm not meant to be a mother. 

I was very dissociated for the first 6 months. I was terrified of being left alone with my baby because I felt like a liability. Like I didn't deserve her and that my first two babies died for the same reason. I was scared to love her because that meant she would die  so I tried not to. I trued to fill my life early on with everything that wasn't her so that I wouldn't miss her when I lost her. 

I was left so angry that she was handed to my mum first. I get it. I was having surgery but I was so fucking angry. I felt flat about these events as I'm an avoidance world champion but that moment made me feel explosively bitter at times. 

About 4 months or so flashbacks started but I didn't know what they were I thought they were old intrusions or my obsessive thinking. The flashbacks were tiny fragments but the nightmares felt like reliving it. I'd wake up unsure that I'd even taken a live baby home. I stopped sleeping as I was convinced she'd die in her sleep. I started having sleep paralysis after nightmares and eventually put on lorazepam.

I was diagnosed with mild post natal depression initially then after my deletion attempt I was diagnosed with PTSD. My family thought it was funny and pathetic because apparently you can't get ptsd from childbirth.
.
You can though. 

My girl has just turned 21. I couldn't be more proud of her. I'm still fucked up but EMDR really helped knit the fragments of what happened back together so I'm doing better now. I've got some hospital shit on the horizon though (cervical cancer) and I've no idea how to have any kind of faith in their ability. My phobia of medical settings is debilitating and a big bit of me is willing to risk not being treated rather than be there. I can't face surgery / treatment.

I‚Äôve been prescribed medication for ADHD for the first time and now that I have it, I‚Äôm scared to take it. It‚Äôs just a scary ordeal, to have something that can make my brain work completely differently for a number of hours. I‚Äôve never had anything like that before. 

I‚Äôve only had the actual medication in my possession for a couple days, and the reason I haven‚Äôt taken any yet is because of I‚Äôm sick right now, no use in taking it if I can‚Äôt do anything anyways.

I‚Äôve only ever known my brain working one way, and even if I always hated it‚Ä¶ the unknown is as scary as ever. 

Weirdly enough, I‚Äôm not even diagnosed with ADHD. Though I probably have it I guess? (It does run in the family) It‚Äôs hard to tell, I do have diagnoses for autism and a generalized anxiety disorder that I‚Äôve had for as long as I can remember so the symptoms get really muddied there‚Ä¶ But ADHD medication is still what my therapist and medication specialist think is best.

When I called nobody picked up the phone. I figured I would just call the following day and explain the situation. When I did, all went well, and I was able to reschedule my appointment for a new date.

So when I go to pick up my prescription, I‚Äôm told it was taken back and to contact my provider. So I do, and the receptionist tells me that since I had to reschedule it‚Äôs basically my fault I ran out of medication and that the prescription was reversed. I tell them I‚Äôm throwing up and going into withdrawal, and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable going without my prescription. I take Effexor, an antidepressant, and became very sick last night from missing my dose (I forgot pharmacies were closed yesterday due to holiday.) I asked if I could just get medicine to hold me off until my scheduled appointment. She says ‚Äúshe‚Äôll see.‚Äú

I‚Äôve never had this happen with any other doctor before. I thought if you rescheduled, they usually refill so it will last until the new appointment date? It just seems like the wrong thing to do to someone relying on medication (especially for anti-depressants, which aren‚Äôt typically abused.) They also had an issue of refilling the wrong antidepressant for me in the past, and it was another hassle to get them to correct it. I guess I just wanted to see if this is common practice in psychiatric offices. I‚Äôm thinking of switching to a different one, or maybe even going with my primary care doctor.

I said. ""Overly sensitive people are exhausting. But if I lower my meds I'll get more sensitive myself. I'll be sadder, annoyed more easily, less patient. But I'll also be more sensitive.""

I usually take her at her word for this sort of thing; however, after being together for so long I can't help but notice some strange stuff. No medications aside from a general anxiety medication (Buspar), no epi pen or allergy shots/medication, no real mental health treatment, etc. I believe that some of these problems, such as some of the supposed allergies, the DiD, the OCD, among a few others are either completely fabricated, or undiagnosed. It seems to me that she only brings them up when she feels like it benefits her or when it may garner some attention. I really hate to put it so bluntly but I have never seen an ounce of verification that she actually suffers from any of the problems she claims to. Nearly every day, she alleges that something 'pops out of place' due to Ehlers-Danlos, or that she can't have almonds (even though I have coincidentally noticed her eat almond-ridden products with no reaction). It really troubles me that this is her relationship with her health and I feel completely unequipped to talk to her about it without coming off as mean or uncaring but I cannot shake the fact that, in reality, I truly believe most of this is made up.

144,Thoughts on Medication for 5150 Patients,"Hi all, I recently experienced a week long 5150 hold and noticed that the dosage for my antipsychotic went from 50 mg to 300 mg over that span of time without any written or verbal consent on my part. Aside from some morning drowsiness I am fortunately not experiencing any side effects major enough to warrant changing this higher dosage immediately (though I do feel I could get by on half the dosage). What alarmed me most was the lack of communication when it came to a substance that could have lasting impacts on my body and brain, as well as reading up and learning that doctors are incentivized to prescribe certain meds and higher doses of meds. Does anyone have insight here or know how to fight this problem? I just sent a general letter to my state‚Äôs local representatives and would love to get more involved in patients‚Äô rights in general.

158,Is this medical neglect?,"I was accidentally injured by my mom when I was 10. She opened the front door on my bare foot. The door split my big toenail all the way down the middle and it obviously hurt like hell.

My mom cleaned my toe and bandaged me up. Because the nail looked really bad, I asked if I‚Äôd be ok and she assured me I‚Äôd be fine. We didn‚Äôt go to the doctors/clinic. Well, the nail did in fact grow back after a few months but it was never the same. It grew back thick and white. I was scared (cuz I was about 11 or so) and showed my mom. I asked if I needed a doctor and she told me to ‚Äògive it time, it‚Äôll heal normally after it grows out‚Äô.

Well it only got worse. By the time I was 13, my mom just gave birth to my half siblings and I was told by both my mom and her husband that I couldn‚Äôt be a burden, financially. My toenail looked bad but nothing hurt and it just looked kinda gross so I never said anything cuz I was always told as long as you‚Äôre not in pain, you‚Äôre fine.

By 15, my big toe was almost completely white (no healthy nail, just the thick white infected nail) and the infection had spread to my other toes, so now as of this post, all the nails on my right foot are infected. I showed my mom and she said that ‚Äòit‚Äôll go away with some antifungal ointment‚Äô. I tried every OTC medication they had as well as natural things like apple cider vinegar and epsom salt soaks and even at one point, had my big toenail removed, but it still grew back infected. Now the whole big toenail is completely white and is so thick, it‚Äôs growing downwards into my skin, making it hard to be on my feet for a long period of time.

163,Extend Medical Assistance in Dying to Include Mental Illness,"Currently, medical assistance in dying (MAiD) is not available to those suffering solely from mental illnesses. However, we believe that this should change before March 17th, 2027. The World Health Organization recognizes that ""mental health is an integral part of health; indeed, there is no health without mental health."" Therefore, it stands to reason that those suffering from severe and incurable mental illnesses should be eligible for MAiD.  
  
We are not advocating for this lightly, but rather out of compassion and understanding for the extreme suffering some individuals endure due to their mental illnesses when all other treatments have failed.  
  
By extending eligibility for MAiD to include those who suffer only from debilitating mental conditions before the specified date, we can ensure dignity and choice at end-of-life decisions are accessible rights for everyone.  
  
Please sign this petition if you believe people living with severe and untreatable mental illness deserve access to medical assistance in dying as a last resort option after all other treatments have been exhausted.

For context, many members of my immediate family have been diagnosed with ADHD and other mental health disorders as well as personnalit√© disorders. Let's say our family history isn't great regarding mental health. I myself have been diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid and have been taking Vyvanse for the last year or so. I also had struggles with anxiety most of my life which has been so bad that it caused me acid reflux issues (GERD) in the past. 

The last few weeks have been incredibly taxing on me and during the worst of the crisis a friend of mine noticed that I started repeating random words that my boyfriend said to someone on the phone in the middle of my own sentence. 

For example : ""I don't know how [travel] to deal with this stuff"" 

I *never* noticed I was doing it at all. That was a few days ago and no one told me I did it again since then but now the crisis period is winding down and I am back to GERD symptoms resulting from the stress, which is my best indicator of how anxious I really was.

I looked into it and the speech patterns is called echolalia and most documentation I see online on the thing is regarding autistic children, seizures or schizophrenia...

1.) Offer a different medication. 

There are a variety of medications to choose from. The patient may think it will help better than the previous medications. 

2.) If it continues for a long period, allow them to freely not take the medication (depending on the severity.)

This one is tricky. It‚Äôs more of a tough lessen. People can still have hope without medication. We know it will likely get worse, but we do have solutions if worse comes to serve. Then they will realize, ‚Äúthey are right. I need medication. 

3.) Explain the science behind the medications. (Schizophrenia. My illness) 

In this day, kids are confused. They assume meds has potential ‚Äúharm‚Äù to their bodies and mind. Tell the side effects first , then the benefits.

She was also giving me DBT therapy.I was rapidly improving and on a path to a great place mentally, until it was all taken away. 
About three weeks ago my appointments with her started to be postponed. I was instead scheduled with a nurse practitoner who had no knowledge of mental health care whatsoever. There was no explation of why I could not see my doctor. My medications were being shuffled around, or threatened to be taken away. This past month has been one of the most stressful months of my life not knowing what was going on. 
They finally put me on the schedule with my doctor June 1st. I had no idea that this would be the last time I was allowed to see her. She was very heavy hearted as well, and it seems as if someone above her was causing this. She also had me on adderall for ADHD and this was taken away without warning. This was also not her decision.
She told me I needed to get my medical records because she had taken careful notes regarding our sessions together, and my marked imorovement with the therapy, adderall, and other medications.
I am now in limbo. Going thru heavy adderall withdrawl. I cannot get out of bed, I am having severe deoression, crying fits, severe anxiety, my nightmares are back, feelings of hopelessness and despair, dread. Feelings that I‚Äôm worthless, uncontrollable mood swings, I have lost 15 pounds in the past two weeks, at times I can barely form sentences, also my haur has been falling out and this has never happened.
They did not offer to replace my psychiatriast. Only said I coukd only see a nurse practioner.
This is blatant neglect, derelection of duty, and absolutely goes against everything Eleanor Health claims to be.
I am a total mess. It is difficult for me to do anything right now. 
I am usually pretty thick skinned bc I‚Äôve been thru A LOT, but this is destroying me. I have brought all of this to the attention of the providers at Eleanor health thru a chat in this portal thing and have been ignored completely.
And this has nothing to do with insurance coverage or anything that would make sense.I guarantee you.

178,Should I go on medication for depression?,"I‚Äôm just curious if anyone‚Äôs every really had medications that genuinely helped. I‚Äôve tried them once when I was younger right at the start when I got diagnosed with MDD but I didn‚Äôt really respond well to any of it. Or therapy.

I think about killing and hurting my self a lot. I used to hurt my self consistently but I‚Äôd like to think I grew out of that. Or the habits graduated into addiction and sleep deprivation. I can‚Äôt really tell anymore. I wish I could just stop overthinking. I wanna believe in my self the way I see everyone else does. I wanna stop caring about how people view me.

181,My pandemic experience and Are medications causing me anxiety??,"So before the pandemic, I was perfectly healthy and happy. I was partying every night, going on multiple dates a week and was always surrounded by people. Loved clubbing and drinking at bars. I was actually supposed to go on a trip abroad in March and I was so excited. I even had a calendar and was writing each activity I would go everyday for the month I was there.

Never ever thought I had OCD. The only OCD symptom I had was checking the door to make sure it was locked a few times.

At first, I welcomed the lockdown. I thought it would finally give me a chance to lose the weight I wanted to lose. I lost 20 lbs in the first 2 - 3 months eating mainly oranges and other things up to 1200 calories a day. Don‚Äôt know if that had some effect on my mental health. Then I lost interest when the weight wouldn‚Äôt go any lower and gained it all back.

As the pandemic kept dragging on and on, my family locked ourselves in the house. My parents made me shut my windows and I didn‚Äôt even see sunlight or got fresh air for months. Then, when the riots started happening in my once quiet town and I watched it all live, getting upset and getting chest pains/fast heartbeat from all the stress. 

Was already thinking it was the apocalypse at the beginning of lockdown and thought I‚Äôd never go back outside again without a hazmat suit. Was shocked the first time I saw CNN reporting that the projected number of coronavirus deaths would be in the millions, I believe it said 10 million or so. I remember how the government seemed in disarray with states fighting each other for supplies, countries taking PPE from other countries at airports and even the Canada almost going into conflict with the USA over the material used for N95 masks. Then I saw places I once thought were safe, like European countries, on fire too from riots, albeit on a smaller scale than the US ones. Then election time came and there were meetings with the police and warnings for possible civil war. My city was the site of weekly physical fights between opposing political groups, televised on the news. 

Around the fall/winter time is probably the time I started experiencing strange mental symptoms. I remember being afraid of looking at objects in fear I might turn into one and throwing away potatoes I was peeling to make fries with because I almost dropped a potato and said ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù and was afraid whoever ate these contaminated potatoes might turn into excrement because of the word I said over them.

By then, I hadn‚Äôt really been out of my room that much for about 8 months. I hadn‚Äôt seen a single person outside of my home the whole time. My parents were the only people I saw, but I mainly kept to myself locked in my room, watching Netflix. The Mayor was on the news telling people not to breathe the same air; the few times I walked outside to get some exercise, I‚Äôd see permanently shuttered stores, boarded up buildings and very few people walking about while wearing a tightened mask to prevent breathing in the contaminated outside air.

The holidays came and it was so lonely and dreary. I playing that new depressing holiday song Sam Smith released and wanting to cry. Then the January 6th riots happened, crime increased in my once quiet town (I heard police helicopters outside my window every night from March 2020 to April 2021), and reports of Asians getting attack on the streets started coming in.

Finally, the vaccine was available to me in March and I was in such a rush to get it. I booked my appointment the first chance I got. The day came and I got my first Pfizer dose. They observe me for 15 min at the pharmacy and I was like yay, no side effects!

I was in the backseat of the car when I started feeling something strange. My parents were talking about blood clots or something from the J&J vaccine when I started feeling something vague. Like slightly dizzy or maybe I couldn‚Äôt breathe a little. I tried to take a sip of water but was having trouble swallowing. I told my dad that I was feeling strange so he tried to find a spot and pulled over. Then I went into a full panic. My face started feeling. Numb along with my whole body, my arms, chest, legs, crotch and I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I was shaking. By then, my dad had called 911. I was already thinking in my mind, OMG, I‚Äôm gonna die!! The fire department came and they took my Oxygen and blood pressure and they were within a normal range. Then he led me through some breathing exercises and things started to feel slightly better. They said it was an anxiety attack but said they could transport me to the hospital if I wanted. I didnt
 have much time to decide and I was kind of feeling better so I said I just wanted to go home. 

For the next 2 weeks, I had a sensation in my chest that felt like I could get a heart attach at any time. I kept my phone at my side, dialed already to 911. Saw a doctor and had a ECG to check for myocarditis and thankfully it came out normal. I had extremely high anxiety though and was afraid of taking any trips in the car in fear of getting another anxiety attack . I had to lie down in the car seat to calm me down so I wouldn‚Äôt get an anxiety attack and had to turn around back into the car another day when I was afraid I would faint or something when coming in for a blood test. Even a virtual appointment with the doctor made me shake with anxiety. Oh yea, and the Derek chauvan trial was going on at the same time and that any any hint of bad news would trigger me and I‚Äôd have to lie down so I can breathe or go outside to get some air.

Anyway, I did eventually see the doctor in person and he could see the bad shape I was in and my blood pressure was extremely high like 150/100 I think. He proscribed me Prozac to prevent an anxiety attack for the next vaccine dose and also for the ocd symptoms I mentioned to him and metoprolol, a beta blocker, for the high blood pressure.

Then things got worse. The doctor asked if I was feeling any difference with the 10mg Prozac he gave, but I said no, seemed worse. Then he upped the dose to 20 mg and OMG I had never felt anything like it in my life, like for the first time I might not have control of my mind. I started feeling weird emotions like thetyPe of feeling you‚Äôd get at a funeral . Had some very vivid dreams and woke up confused if I was dreaming or not. Then I got the second covid vaccine dose and had a crying fit and another anxiety attack and those side effects eventually faded after 2weeks. 

Oh wait, I almost forgot to mention that because of the vaccine and medications that there was a period of a few nights where every time I was about to fall asleep.my heart would jump and wake me and I couldn‚Äôt sleep for 2 nights. I went to the urgent care after the nurse on the phone told me to and had some more heart tests that came out normal and after the nurse assured me my heart was normal and it was anxiety I was able to sleep that night. I will say that all these symptoms of anxiety attacks and being someone by a sharp feeling we‚Äôre all symptoms reported by people who had taken the vaccine.

Oh wow. Wasn‚Äôt expwcting to write all of this lol. I just wanted to ask if metoprolol was giving me more anxiety but started writing all of this but now I kind of feel better after writing all of thisnlol",1634536346.0,False,2,5,TheNathan89,None,qagin5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/qagin5/my_pandemic_experience_and_are_medications/
182,Am I able to tell if I‚Äôm overly medicated? ,"First, this is kind of long and rambling. 

Second, my official diagnosis are; TRD, bipolar 1, anxiety, and ADHD. However, and I‚Äôm not a medical professional, simply from my own findings, I suspect I have mild OCD and maybe some symptoms of BPD.  I‚Äôve been medicated for about 5 years, and in CBT for 6 or so. 

So flash back about a year and a half ago. I was bouncing around doctors, trying to find a good fit for my psychiatrist/med provider. A few I didn‚Äôt feel like they were doing well and I left, the others switched positions/places and didn‚Äôt provide Telehealth. I found my current Dr about a year and a half ago.

When I met him the first time he looked at my med list. He knew my previous provider-they actually were in the same building. He immediately was like so you were seeing Mr. W*** before, correct? Did you feel like your meds were working effectively? I expressed I did feel much more stable, I hadn‚Äôt had any manic episodes, I‚Äôve stayed sober for 3 years, and my depression and anxiety were still pretty bad, but I could function and I didn‚Äôt feel like I was an immediate danger like I had been before. He sort of sighed. He said something like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a LOT of medication just for your mental health (I don‚Äôt normally take medication for anything other than my mental health) and I‚Äôm a bit curious as to why, for example, he had you on 2-20 mg fluoxetine as opposed to just the 40mg pill.. and a few other concerns like that.‚Äù I had no clue. So he said he didn‚Äôt want to do anything too drastic because I was pretty stable and functional, but he remedied a few things of that nature and bumped up a single medication slightly, and we schedule a follow up shortly after to check in. I didn‚Äôt have any extreme reactions. So slowly we began tweaking and fine tuning things to help me feel better, and it has helped a lot. 

I really need to get my ADHD and self destructive tendencies/intrusive thoughts under control, as they were causing some serious damage in my life. So we worked on those slowly as well. I still have my issues, especially with ADHD, but my intrusive thoughts, and really a lot of my symptoms have become a lot more manageable. 

Anyways, 
 Recently, I went to the back specialist to get some X-rays and whatnot done. I wasn‚Äôt always able to walk well, and my mom offered to help so she came as well. When the doctor came in, he doubled checked my med list. He asked if I was currently taking all of these daily, I said yes. He then expressed a bit of concern, saying (and I‚Äôm paraphrasing very loosely) that‚Äôs quite a cocktail, but hey if it works it works. 

After my appointment my mom asks if I thought I was overly medicated. She goes on explaining how she thought my grandma (her mom) was also over medicated, especially towards the end of her life (she clearly had mental health problems all her life, but I believe the treatment for dementia and or Alzheimer‚Äôs was more what she was referring to, but I personally saw many signs of BPD and Bipolar disorder, but I‚Äôm not a medical professional, and I‚Äôm not sure if she was ever diagnosed or medicated for anything other than dementia and or Alzheimer‚Äôs. ), but I said I have no idea if I am or not, but this is the most stable, happy and safe I‚Äôve felt-ever. However I do definitely still have my issues. Mostly chronic fatigue, depression, lack of focus, and probably worst, self destructive behavior and tendencies. 

These have been long standing issues for me. My chronic fatigue is for sure getting worse, self harm has improved some, but not greatly. Anxiety is stable, as is the mania. Depression still gets pretty bad at times, but I haven‚Äôt made any plans to harm myself or anyone else.

 With several others bringing it up I start to wonder if I am overly medicated? I‚Äôve been on some meds for 5 years. My first doctor prescribed me lamotrogine and it hasn‚Äôt been changed in 4 and a half years or so. As I said, I‚Äôm not educated on anything medically, but what if my lamotrogine was causing my chronic fatigue to be worse? Or reacting with another med to counteract its effects? I‚Äôm sure they know how things interact, but there are so many variables going on I don‚Äôt get how you can say anything is causing or not causing anything to happen. Does that make sense?   

I‚Äôm not making any decisions without talking it over with my Dr. of course. ",1714983256.0,False,1,3,Swampybritches,None,1cldt86,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cldt86/am_i_able_to_tell_if_im_overly_medicated/
183,"I'm considering taking medication for anxiety, but I want second opinions (they don't need medical prescription)","Hi. For the past few years (I think 2 or 3 years) I've been experiencing lots of anxiety attacks, specially after quarantine. I thought I was getting better lately but these few days I've been experiencing constant anxiety (like being in an anxious state during the whole day). 

I've had suspicion for a while that I might have either autism or ADHD (or both, I don't know anymore) but last time I tried to ask my parents to go to a therapist they have refused (due to the cost and the fact that they believe going to therapy for anxiety issues is a waste of money because everyone has it and I need to control it by myself), so I'm not diagnosed and therefore cannot do much about that. 

Anyway, I've found some pills that are gluten free and don't have counterindications and don't need medical prescription. The pills in question are called: Animafort Multi 

I just want to know more objective opinions of whether I should consider buying them or not and maybe if anyone has had any experience with it I would appreciate it a lot if you could share your experiences

I started feeling as if my medications were not helping as much with my depression and anxiety like the last week of June, around when I was on the Clindamycin.

I disregarded the headache since the pollen count has been high AND my 4 and a half year old recently came home from an extended trip to her grandma's up north before school starts. My psychiatric nurse practitioner isn't able to see me, as I recently moved and their office only sees patients who live in that county. I am trying to find a new provider ASAP.

187,MY THOUGHTS ON MEDICATIONS,"*Disclamer: This is my experience with mental health medications, I am not a professional or anthing, this is only MY opinion. ALWAYS consult about medications with your psychiatrist!

Little backstory: i started going to therapy 11 years ago, when I was 10 years old. In my mental health road I have tried so many medication, from antipsychotics, antidepressants, stabilizator of mood. 
(Zeldox, torendo and risperidal, wellbutrin, abilify, cipralex, edronax, lyrica, sanval (sleeping pill), depakene,...) 
I think at some point the medications were neccessary, I have stopped taking it 2 months ago tho. But the side effects of all these medications were so bad...i had side effects like: no energy at all, constantly tired, couldnt even function (everything even cooking a meal was really challenging), milk coming out of my breast, shaking, wetting the bed every night when i was small, couldnt control my body, contracted muscles (couldn't even walk), loss of orientation and stability, slow thinking, concentration problems, i couldnt wake up, literally my boyfriend was waking me up at least one hour so i could just open my eyes a bit and sensed that he is trying to wake me up although he was moving me and everything, and so many more i could go on years...
I decided few months ago I don't want to live life like this because this was no life for me. I was living zombie.
After 11 years of psychoterapy, I worked a lot on myself I consulted with my psyhiatrist and my boyfriend's father (he is a really good doctor) and i slowly decreased the medications over months. I felt it was time to do it and i felt I was ready for it (have tried it many times before,didn't succeed).
After stopping taking meds: 
I have a lot of withdrawal effects right now including nausea, vomiting, pains all over the body (headaches, stomach aches, throat aches), insomnia,.etc...
BUT: we are expecting these symptoms so dissapear over time...
I also noticed so much progress: I am more social, I talk a lot more, my memory is much better, I can actually feel emotions again, my thoughts have completely changed and I talk a lot more and am more positive and can have a deep long conversations I couldnt have before, my creativity is better, my imagination, i can wake up way more easily... and many more! 
I think it is completely worth it...still not at the end yet but i see a lot of progress.
So I wanted to suggest things that helped me to get here:
-a lot of therapy, I had 3 therapist at once, one was helping me on analyzing everything, especially traumas and family problems, one was really practical and spiritual that helped me a lot with excercises and meditations (she had an alternative exercises and opinions about ""disorders and disease""), and one for daily life problems
-meditation, meditation meditation (i worked a lot on focusing oriented therapy, mindfullnes, and other meditation tehniques) 
-a lot of nature, walks and exercises and also keeping care for my dog
-being the most social i can (supportive friends are really imprtant, and also in my case my really supportive and understanding boyfriend)
-listening to uplifting music
-when i felt bad listening to metal, sad songs so i got the emotions out
-always let yourself feel without judgement
-books: spiritual, psychological, self help
-inspirational people that had been througj a lot of trauma themselves but mastered themselves and thrive now
-youtube channels: actualized.org, christina lopes

I hope this can be at least a little helpful for anyone!üíûsending love and light

Indeed I heard a 37-year-old woman having a 60-year old's kidney because of Lithium. My pdoc said it like it was his idea! It should have been! Then he says ""well, for Depakote we have to monitor your liver but this is not nearly as bad as Lithium for the kidneys.""I am on Depakote (while tapering off Lithium) for a short time and it is sedative but when hypomanic that is what I need.

I (22F) used to have a SH problem, but have been clean for 4 years. My scars are all old/healed, but they're still visible if you look closely. I'm at a point in my life where they don't bother me anymore, and I now see them as 'badges' of survival in a way. 

For a couple months I've been experiencing these skin bumps/rashes, and over the counter medicine wont make it go away, so I'm going to go to the doctors. 

  
My problem with this is that I'm really scared of how my Dr will react. I've known her all my life, yet she's never seen my inner thighs. One of the biggest reasons I decided to actually start taking care of myself/pursuing confidential mental health resources, reading self-help books, etc. was because I'm so so so scared of being admitted to a psych ward. So, how will she react?

This costs $370 before insurance, my insurance which is high deductable, took out $86.21, bringing what I owe to $283.79.  This was for just the first visit, the doctor requests 2 week follow ups, I've had one so far and all ready see the claim on my insurance for the same amount.  

I know I'll hit my out of pocket deductable and will start seeing some relief there, but for me it's so moraly/ethically wrong to charge so much for less than ten minutes.  Also, they just prescribed what I told them the therapist recomended, they basically didn't do anything but act as a middle man between therapist and pharmacy.

198,want to file complaint to medical board,"Was dragged to psychiatrists by my dad since i was young.  My only problem was frustration, boredom, and mind wandering too much.  I had OCD from a young age but otherwise was an extroverted, friendly, fun type of dude.  Wouldve loved to have been cool with everybody, my problem was I had weak communication skills and no life.  Just sit in my room and do nothing but surf the internet, daydream, talk to myself.  One thing i know thats abnormal of me is i have this eccentric habit of talking to myself since i was a teen, it got out of control in college and i started fantasizing talking to people in my head (usually people i know) i just had a great imagination and got absorbed into it.  I went to the docs to see if i had adhd at first before i realized it was ocd with maladaptive daydreaming but heres the kicker, they kept seeing me with my dad and pushing random meds that had no effect when i said i was fine when i realized they were making a big deal out of it and i wanted to be left alone.  My problem i realized was i needed something to occupy my mind which is work or activity, part of it is depression, part of it is being a bum, but mainly i just have no clue what im doing and i struggled with driving (dont feel comfortable behind a car and refuse to drive).  12 years my dad took me to the docs because i look sad af (dad is successful and im an fup).  These drs kept pushing random meds with my dad in the room when i said i was fine.  Now i want to move out but cant figure my shit out and have been telling the docs that i wanted to, they ignored my protests with the treatment and the diagnosis (I was given Asbergers as the diagnosis but i mos def am not) regardless i want to complain to the medical board on them.  I had 20 meds a lot of times the same one pushed on me by my dad and got screwed up by them, one side effect was permanent sexual dysfunction which makes me mad because I needed to have sex, that woulda made me more ambitious if anything.  If i complain to the board i was being taken advantage of by my dad and asked for a way out and wasnt given any reprieve by the docs and they didnt catch that i believe theres a rule they can get their license taken away for that.  Idk if i can get compensation but i dont want to take their license away but am pissed after years of abuse.  What do you all suggest, its a lot of drs one who could go to jail for pushing benzos.  I know if their licenses get taken away their family situations could get screwed and they could band together and come back for me.  Just for the record i was pretty much fine in the beginning being in the system fucked my life up so please be aware not to make ass comments i needed a legit therapist and gym/social/dating/work life.

204,Medical provider or therapist?,"Hello,  
  
Seeking basic input on whether I should start with a provider or a therapist.  
  
I am a 38-year-old male, currently in school for a second career. Historically, I have had an issue with getting super excited about a project or task but only seeing it through to about 90-95% completion. I am about to start the final semester of my second bachelor's and have found a combination of senioritis and what I reason is my chronic inability to complete any task to 100% (I am not in a position where I won't graduate, simply not motivated the way I was up until this most recent semester).  
  
To expand upon my inability to see tasks through, I have multiple projects around my house that I get very excited about, research everything about to ensure the outcome is the best possible, complete everything up until the final ""finishing touches."" I built a 12'x16' shed but haven't finished painting the decorative trim or hanging all the decorative trim. I began remodeling a half bath but stopped 90% of the way through, the same thing with my home gym‚Äîfully functional, but the aesthetic touches have not been completed, and that is only a few of the unfinished projects around my home.  
  
I have had this issue as far back as I can remember; I undoubtedly have underlying trauma that needs to be addressed. I have seen a therapist in the past and made progress, but they were dismissive and abruptly ended our session, stating that ""I was better off than his worst patients"" (this is neither here nor there but rather a statement on the fact that I am aware of the need for therapy as well).  
  
As an aside, in my younger years (while pursuing my first undergraduate degree), I engaged in some recreational drugs that are known to cause tachycardia (cocaine and ecstasy), and I am currently taking an antihypertensive. I am not specifically seeking a CNS stimulant (I am concerned about its effects on my heart).  
  
This is all to say, should I begin my search for treatment with a psychiatrist with the possibility of being prescribed a pharmacological intervention until such time that therapy (hopefully) addresses any underlying trauma issues, or should I start with a therapist (hoping for a better match) until they conclude that a pharmacological intervention is necessary?

Earlier this year, my doctor prescribed Wellbutrin. I'd never taken any anti-depressants before so it was all new to me. I had to start taking 150mg the first week, then up it to 300mg every day after that first week.

I've had some rough days this week. No cause that I can pinpoint specifically, just feeling more 'down' than I regularly do on my normal dose of Wellbutrin.

215,Anxiety about Psychotropic Medication,"This is my first time ever posting on Reddit, I feel so lost and hopeless so I thought I would give this a shot. I (20F) have been experiencing the worst mental state of my life. I have started seeing a therapist (been in it for a couple of weeks) and only last week was convinced by my support system to see a psychiatrist. The big bulk of this will be explaining my situation, but in all I really mainly need support from an unbiased audience about going on psychotropic medication and guidance. I have extreme anxiety on becoming dependent on any substances (I do not even like drinking caffeine for this reason). However, I am an aspiring physician and have huge goals of going to medical school. My GPA isn't bad, I do pretty well in extracurriculars with leadership positions and research experience. However, I have been doing extremely poorly due to my situation, to the point where I do not see a way out or a way to achieve my goals well after this. I have suicidal thoughts from time to time but do not execute due to ""lack of resources"" to do so (I do not want a messy, painful death).

I think I have PDD and GAD, but not officially diagnosed with a distinction between PDD/MDD. I have always been anxious since I was a child, I tend to place extremely high expectations on myself with a huge fear of failure in any sense, big or small. I will shut down if I feel like I have not met my expectations. I have had depression before in recent years, but never to this extent or long-lasting as it feels now. This ongoing terrible mental state began over the summer, when I was taking organic chemistry. I was doing fine at first, but experienced extreme burnout (I realize now that I am in my 3rd year of uni and my longest breaks between semesters are 2-3 weeks, in which I sometimes still work/do extracurriculars). It led to me dropping the class, something I thought I would never have to do. This led to my several month long depression immediately after. I cannot not get out of bed most days, I can't sleep at night, but sleep way too much during the day, with some days I went only eating once. However, I knew that this Fall semester was going to be worse as I am taking 3 notoriously difficult classes at once, including the orgo class I dropped. I think I went into this semester optimistic, but was quickly shot down after exams. My anxiety and depression shot up worse than ever before, and I still have not recovered months after. My parents recently as well have decided to divorce and use me as a middle man when they refuse to speak to each other, adding to more issues, but they are much lesser now.

I am very lucky to have a great support system. My boyfriend, who also experienced depression and anxiety in his freshman year urged me to seek help. I started to see a therapist and it has helped me learn how to step back from everything, but stepping back has in turn made my academic career worse, leading to my anxiety flaring up again. He then urged me to see a psychiatrist and explained to me how medication helped him. I have always been extremely hesitant about this. My mother's side of the family all are mentally ill in some way and have been dependent on medications, but none of them are doing well in life. I cannot talk to my father about mental health because when I was depressed in high school he called me an ""ungrateful little bitch"" (hispanic immigrant parents). My mother is luckily far more understanding and supportive. My entire support system is telling me to at least try medication, but I have been terrified to even though logically I understand it is necessary at this point.

I believe most of my anxiety comes from being dependent. When I tell people this, they say it is better to be dependent and live off medication than be miserable/dead. I understand this, but it does not help with my anxiety at all. I additionally have an IMMENSE fear of side effects. I study neuroscience and am very interested of how it affects everyone differently, but it terrifies me. I would definitely feel more at ease if the research in it was more developed. As of right now, I am not entirely trusting. I also hold this odd double standard where if another person is taking medication/seeking help, I commend them, but now that I am in the situation I feel like an immense failure. I NEVER see other people seeking the same help as a failure at all however, it confuses me so much. I think a lot of my fears have to also do with how this will affect my career. For the first time in my entire life, I am not confident I can reach my end goal and I do not have a plan for the future or how to salvage this. I do not know if I will end up being good enough for medical school admissions (especially now that I am considering dropping more classes) and it has stressed me out so much. I also fear they would take into account the fact that I was mentally ill and reject me because the career is so strenuous. I have tried looking into other careers desperately, but I do not see myself being happy in any of them. If I go into another career, I have the fear that it will be a constant reminder that I am not good enough to do what I actually wanted/was passionate about and that in all, I failed. I do not know if I can fix this.

This was very long and all over place, I am desperate. I guess what I am asking for is insight on the medication experience and see if it is right for me. I believe I have been prescribed Prozac, but I am even to scared to go to the pharmacy and pick it up. I am going to a primary doctor to see if it could be anything else since I have always had issues with sleep (I could sleep 17hrs if you let me) since little. I could maybe have hypothyroidism/anemia because of this but I do not see a pipeline to such grave mental illness much from this, so I am not sure if I can avoid medication. I feel so lost.

tldr;

Have PDD/MDD (not sure which) and GAD. Often suicidal. Immense fear of drug dependency/side effects/trial period of drugs and lasting effects. Need help on being convinced to be medicated.

I'm having some very strange things happen after I discontinued trileptal under the guidance of my neurologist. He has me on only 1 seizure medication now, the reason I had to get off trileptal was because it was causing levels of the other AED to drop.

This does concern me though because i have a history of EDs and I wouldn't want this issue to cause a relapse. I have also noticed my gad getting worse again.

Has anyone experienced med weirdnesses after discontinuing something else? I'm on prozac, welbutrin, lithium and buspar. Not sure if the trileptal going away is increasing levels of any of these or what. I know that the levels of lamictal are now increasing since my neuro got me off trileptal. I will be bringing this up to my psychiatrist at our next appointment. She couldn't do anything about the lamictal as that's my neuro but wondering if she will have answers as to why I'm suddenly getting odd side effects.",1703134642.0,False,1,0,musician8820,None,18netxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18netxq/side_effects_after_discontinuing_medication/
218,"Medically Defining ""Toxic"" Behaviors","There are many people I know or have met that consistently and near-purposefully damage their relationships by creating fights and acting dramatically - essentially creating high stress environments for themselves and their partner, and inventing ways to add conflict into the relationship. We tend to call these people ""toxic"" but I'm wondering if how they would be defined in a clinical setting. Is that just likely to be borderline personality disorder or are there other ways to define it?

220,Looking for experiences with switching medications from Lexapro,"I've been switched from Lexapro to Cymbalta because Lexapro makes me really sick, like I'd wake up at night shaking and nauseous and at times I'd wake up and within seconds have to rush out of bed to get dry foods and take my pill or I'd feel extremely sick.

I asked my pharmacist today and they said even with me lessening my dose there's still a very good chance I'll suffer from withdrawals either way. I've been tapering off for weeks now but they said even with that it's still in my system. They also said there's no medication they could give me unless I went to my doctor's and that I'd have to get it from them, which I can't because they are all phone only. 

I've been through Lexapro withdrawals so I'm a bit worried. I was wondering what was your experiences, how long did the side effects stay, what made you feel better ect.",1631453896.0,False,1,1,Pr3ttynp3tty,None,pmstzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/pmstzo/looking_for_experiences_with_switching/
221,Missing medication making me feel insane,"I picked up my prescription for adderall both xr and ir 2 bottles 30 in each a month ago. 

Yesterday I'm pretty sure I counted 4 in each (idk if I can trust my memory) today there is 2 in one and 4 in the other. 

I live with my mom and my sister moved out a while ago. But today when I woke up my sister was over to visit. Both my mom and my sister don't do drugs, but my sister consumes alcohol regularly. 

I said out loud some of medication is missing and they both said ""don't look at me"" and my sister commented maybe I took 2 by accident. I responded if I took 2 I would notice and I wouldn't be able to sleep. 

I talked to my mom after my sister left and my mom said my sister would never do adderall because she is too anxious to even take a tylenol. And she said to even think one of us would steal your medication is being paranoid. She asked me if the medication is making me paranoid, I told her no I'm just worried about you guys.

My mom knows I just got a refill yesterday. Maybe she thought I wouldn't notice since I just got 30 more of each.

The one day my sister is over the pills go missing.

Idk where the 2 pills went idk what to do idk if i shouldnt trust my memory of having 4 pills or if i shouldn't trust my family. I might just have to move on from this it's hurting my mental health.

Also my medication was being kept in the living room in a box with all my other medication. But I now moved it into my room hidden.",1702322241.0,False,2,3,Trustedfag,None,18g1jc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18g1jc7/missing_medication_making_me_feel_insane/

223,What Are the Top Challenges Facing Medical Healthcare Students Today?,"Have you ever wondered what obstacles medical students face in order to pursue careers in medicine? Delving into the world of medicine is undoubtedly a noble pursuit, but it comes with its own unique set of challenges. From the relentless academic pressure to managing the emotional highs and lows of patient care, let's unravel the top issues that make the path to becoming a healthcare professional both rewarding and demanding.  
  
1. Academic Pressure:  
One of the foremost challenges is the intense academic pressure inherent in medical education. The vast volume of information, demanding coursework, and rigorous examinations can create a highly stressful environment. Balancing theoretical knowledge with practical skills adds an extra layer of complexity, often leaving students grappling with time management.  
  
2. Emotional Toll:  
Medical healthcare students frequently encounter emotionally charged situations, dealing with illness, suffering, and sometimes loss. The emotional toll of witnessing these aspects of human life can be overwhelming. Coping mechanisms and emotional resilience become crucial skills to develop, as maintaining empathy while preserving one's mental health is a delicate balance.  
  
3. Financial Strain:  
The cost of medical education, including tuition, books, and living expenses, can be exorbitant. Many students face the challenge of managing substantial student loans and financial strain, impacting their focus on studies and potentially contributing to burnout. Exploring financial assistance options and budgeting becomes essential for alleviating this burden.  
  
4. Work-Life Balance:  
Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is a perpetual struggle for medical healthcare students. The demanding nature of their studies and clinical rotations often leaves little time for personal lives, leading to exhaustion and potential burnout. Finding strategies to prioritize self-care and personal time becomes crucial for sustaining long-term success in the medical field.  
  
5. Competitive Residency Placements:  
Securing a desirable residency placement is a significant concern for medical students. The competition is fierce, and the process can be stressful. Students often grapple with the pressure to excel academically, gain relevant experience, and showcase their unique qualities to stand out in the highly competitive selection process.  
  
In summary, a medical healthcare student's path is characterized by obstacles that go beyond the classroom. Addressing these issues requires a combination of resilience, support systems, and strategic planning to foster success and well-being in the pursuit of a medical career.
