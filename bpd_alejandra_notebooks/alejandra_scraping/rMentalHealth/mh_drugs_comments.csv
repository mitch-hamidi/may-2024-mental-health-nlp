Take some time to build your account. Save some money. Budget. List your costs. Cut some costs. Utilize your meds. Step back from indulging. Use drugs to get by not to cope. Find your way to a position where the drugs are for fun not for getting by. You can do it. You have doubta? That's okay!!! Curb your doubts build your confidence. Reflect daily. Write a journal. Blog or something. Give yourself a chance to heal from your aches and pains that drive you to substances. If you can get down to one as opposed to whatever that would be awesome. We're supposed to be able to enjoy life. Not drown in substances due to our adversities.

Don't know your story but this si my take. 

I hope you reflect and learn a new way to live.",-_F_--_O_--_H_-,1ba03m7

3,Weed is amazing but it has diminishing returns. Smoking once a month is like an amazing trip to the moon. Smoking daily wears it out. The high isn‚Äôt as high and lasts less time. It also leads to no end of problems. You do you though. I just noticed this is venting. I do feel that the problems weed initially solves become problems it contributes to and may cause more problems. I hope you feel better soon. I get it. At some point hopefully the current problems pass or you may decide to dig into what drives the behavior. Many of use love to chase that dopamine rush. Gimme my dopamine.,Last_Cartographer340,1ba03m7

2,"I have been in this place many times. Life does come in waves like the ocean. The cool thing about nihilism is if nothing matters, then we get to decide what matters to us and where we do have control in this fucked up construct. Learn to take that red chaotic anger and turn it into cold sharp motivation. This passion can be used in a helpful way and increase our quality of life. Being in our body and knowing our truth is our greatest power. Knowledge is power. Discernment is wisdom.

5,"yea that's the thing, drugs aren't your friends and they're the ones causing your family to feel fake and distant, that's what addiction is, it makes you care about only your addiction and well everything and everyone else get pushed away, I've felt that ""something is wrong"" thing too and guess what, that's mental illness, I know that adhd, autism, some cluster b mental illnesses and such tend to feel like they don't fit in / aren't normal / something is wrong with them and the fact is that your brain functions differently than most other people, you aren't going to feel any hope nor will you want to become someone that achieves something if you continue down this ""drugs are my friend"" rabbit hole, yes drugs are fucking amazing, I live them myself but I use them to enhance my life not escape from it, It's hard but once you have had a taste of accomplishment and fulfillment it gives you something to keep pushing for, a career, a hobby hell ANYTHING you can do that makes you feel enjoyment, for me these fall back into my hobbies, gaming, cooking and content creation, you need to find things you can do that allow you to see your progress, within the last 6 years my culinary skills have improved and I've watch them do so, same for my skill with gaming and my proficiency with video editing, if you just continue to spiral down the ""this world sucks and I only like drugs"" path all you're going to be doing is chasing an artificial high for the rest of your life and guess what, you will NEVER be able to reach that high, NEVER. You build tolerances to these substances, your first high on a certain drug is usually unbeatable especially if you're just sad and only pushing to reach that high again.

I know that was just a lot of rambling but please trust me when I say that chasing that high isn't worth it nor will you ever reach it, when you don't abuse the fuck out of drugs it makes them that much more enjoyable and amazing, if you can start finding hobbies and other things that make you happy and taper off of drugs I promise you will love life so much more, I have the exact same mindset as you when it comes to the world, it's fucked, greed has corrupted this earth and makes it hard for us to exist properly, it makes it hard to wake up and go through another day of what feels pointless, but that's what makes the rewarding bits of life 100x more rewarding, I'm not telling you to drop whatever you're doing cold turkey but I'm asking you to tey and make a slow gradual shift into a more productive life, you're still young and you 100% have people that care about you and love you despite you feeling like that's not the case, you have support and you can build a better life for yourself, it doesn't take a lot of effort you just need to take slow steps in the right direction and I know that with the help and support of your family you will be able to do that with ease

About a week later she vanished without explanation, Changed her phone number, Moved house, Deleted her Facebook. Disappeared entirely.

11,"I‚Äôm 43. I had the same exact mentality as you until I was 40 when I hit absolute rock bottom. I‚Äôm telling you as I would tell my younger self, take all the hate and pain and grief and misunderstanding you have now then multiply that by 100. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like if you continue down this path. I was suicidal but managed to escape those thoughts and now that I‚Äôm sober and conscious about my true self, I‚Äôm SO MUCH HAPPIER. Helping people, or giving comments that may or may not help anyone, brings me so much joy. I‚Äôm doing more for other people than I used to do for my own self. 

Don‚Äôt get it twisted though‚Ä¶ the first couple years of self realization may hurt. But you‚Äôll never feel a high like being yourself and not giving a fuck about the negativity and being able to help someone who needs it. That same aggression you have can be reversed and used for so much more.

There was a chapter on ‚ÄòThe Pooh Way‚Äô will illustrates the principle of Wu Wei ‚Äònot forcing‚Äô. At the restaurant, I had this awful job wrapping potatoes in tinfoil. I decided I would do this job according to the minimum appropriate level of force and also using ‚Äòtherbligs‚Äô which are units of time, space and motion taken from industrial psychology (I recommend a deep dive into that term). I immediately was wrapping them faster and in a more relaxed fashion than anyone around me, they tried to copy my technique but they could not keep up. The light bulb went on. I applied this principle of minimum appropriate level of force first to my academics, then my friends, then my romantic life. All these things unfolded naturally.

0,"Similar story happened to me, but only through the consumption of cannabis. The addiction got so bad, that my head felt light during the whole day, most likely also due to very bad diet. This happened to me while studying abroad in Germany. I had to take a free semester and travel back home to family for treatment. I took three different kinds of antidepressants (I can't remember their names). Their effects showed up like two months. My family, friends and my psychiatrist told me that the true cure comes within, which I didn't believe/understand in the beginning. Eventually after 6 months I finally made it and got out of it; obviously stopping the consumption and the family support helped, but the main reason was literally because it got BORED of depression and healed itself. And here am I years after what this happened I've finished my bachelor degree and now doing a master's degree. So to put this in short, antidepressants did help, but the true cure comes from within, no worries, this will eventually happen, but you have to stop consuming the drugs, which is possible either through cutting the consumption bit by bit or completely in one go.

6,"Have your doctor fax a letter putting you on medical leave, at some jobs there is short term disability; I‚Äôd go to rehab and just be honest. Everyone who has done addictive stuff has stories like this.

My step family is affluent? My step aunt had a cocaine problem and even told me she was a prostitute to pay for drugs, I was going into high school and it was her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do drugs‚Äù speech and I stayed at weed and never tried anything else. 

I am an alcoholic so I have that lived experience, a long stretch of sobriety is impressive, people will support you and give you the much deserved credit for the long sobriety.

Dealers try to trick people back in with free drugs, offers of friendship, etc. it‚Äôs a story a lot of people in rehab will have heard before. Many of them will have gone through it themselves.

After rehab you can go back to your job because of the FMLA leave act, however it might make sense to talk to the bar association of your state about how to get the drug dealer to leave you alone and not contact you without having to testify. I don‚Äôt know what advice to give as I‚Äôm not a lawyer.

I was told when I first got sober not to have contact with people that I drank with, same goes for people you used with, especially dealers.

I‚Äôll add to that, my community health center said all street drugs could be laced with fentanyl or meth. These dealers are the scum of humanity and will sell kids bags of weed with meth or fentanyl in it to try to get them hooked. They‚Äôre awful people.

Don‚Äôt quit your job though, Fmla leave hopefully with short term disability, they can‚Äôt discriminate against you for substance abuse but it‚Äôs better to keep it to a medical condition that requires treatment, they can‚Äôt ask.

Everyone will understand in the recovery community. My step aunt even told me when I was like 14 that this happened to her so I wouldn‚Äôt do it. So at some point in your life you‚Äôll have enough sobriety under your belt that you can wear it as a badge of honor.

There is a recovery story telling class, pm me and I‚Äôll find you the link, people talk about addiction and homelessness and car accidents and mental health conditions and it could help you prepare yourself to talk about it.

The course leader was incarcerated, on methadone, while pregnant. she turned her life around, had this writing business, and had a good relationship with her daughter. Maybe doing peer recovery story telling would help put your narrative in into a form you feel more comfortable telling.",Graywulff,13y72ih
7,From someone who has dealt with addiction and still is today. Be honest. With yourself first and foremost and be open. You don‚Äôt have to scream it at the top of your lungs or maybe you do. But the truth will set you free. You are worthy of so much more.,chiliinmypeepee,13y72ih
8,"Those seven months were not a waste! You quit for a reason. Try to remember why you quit, and write those reasons down and put that somewhere you‚Äôll see it all the time. Mine is on the inside of my front door so I see it every time I go to leave the house. It‚Äôs helped me A LOT! 

Drugs are fun. I get it, probably most of us do, but they‚Äôre not your friends. As much as getting high in your free time and still being a functioning adult and going to work and participating in your family and social life seems like an achievable lifestyle, it‚Äôs not a sustainable one. 

So, have a talk with yourself. Be honest about what you want from your future, and be honest about what you will need to get there. You‚Äôll probably see that you‚Äôll need the money and time you want to spend on drugs to achieve other things that support a healthy life and world. And you know what? You can do it. You can do the hard things you need to have the life you want. You can do hard things. You‚Äôve already given up drugs once, you can do it again.

11,"You've had a temporary relapse - this is nothing to be ashamed of and the most common complication in dealing with substance use. Please continue to attend rehab and talk through the issues you're currently having!

Noone will think ill of you - it's quite the opposite really. It takes courage to say ""I'm currently not doing well and I need help"". Doing so, is admirable, and also means that you're taking responsibility for your actions and your life.

Utilize your support network, friends, family, therapists etc. and let them help you avoid completely derailing your life.

Besides, it's easier to stop now, while you've not become physically dependent on the substances again, and while you can still remember what it's like to have a proper daily routine. Thus, you can still save a lot of your treatment progress! It's not too late.

As for your job - you could tell your boss that you're bipolar and that's why you're strugling atm. Maybe ask him to get some time off (even if it's unpaid) to sort things out. That would be a less severe outcome than full unemployment, and what you're going through atm is a legitimate medical issue.

If you can talk to people close to you about it I think it's the best first step. It's hard but recovery isn't easy. Grab a pen and make a list of reasons why you're better without, I'm still adding things to mine but I know once I'm ready I can look at it and remind myself why I'm going clean.

In my opinion don't say to yourself I'm going to stop tomorrow, next week or next month.... Just find reasons to quit and repeat them to yourself everyday. Once you have enough reasons to stop, you'll get help and it genuinely makes it easier because you understand you're doing it for YOU.

The key is to bring the tough feelings into the light (be with the feeling, ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù to it and thereby accepting it), it might seem unbearable at first - but it is really exposure therapy, and the more you exposure yourself for those feelings associated to a thought, the lesser it starts feeling and by time it vanishes - and you are left with just merely thought. It takes a lot of practice, but completely worth it!",jbn89,13y72ih
28,"Hi  I just happened to read this chat while I was doing a web search and want to respond.  I have had many friends and family members struggle with addiction and have watched how hard it is to beat the beast.   I think my daughter went into rehab 20 times before she quit heroin.   Every time it moved her closer to sobriety.   Don't lose faith in yourself.  The way you talked about you felt about having sex with your dealer is telling.  You are closer than you think to managing this.   Methadone helped her the most to get clean.  There are folks out there that say she substituted one drug for another, but those people don't realize how hard it is to stay clean.   You have bipolar and you need to keep taking the medication for that too so you can make sense of your life in a realistic way.   Take all the support you can get because one day you will see how much better your life can be and you can move forward to help others with this challenge.   Go back into rehab however many times it takes.  You are not alone.   Love yourself enough to get help because if you don't do it, then who will.   Life is all about learning to love and care for ourselves.  Don't be ashamed of your struggles.   Open your heart to all the possibilities that are out there waiting to help you.

Everyone does things for different reasons. Learn to forgive yourself for whatever damage you have done or any setbacks. Establish healthy coping strategies. After I quit cigarettes, I like snacks like baby carrots or nuts. The hand to mouth addiction can be lifelong. If and or when you relapse, don't be too harsh as to accept defeat. Try again and do better, it gets easier, and you learn something new every time! Remember, you are letting go of an old identity that didn't serve your best interest and life goals. Start seeing yourself as someone who doesn't do that habit anymore. Part of quitting is identifying yourself in a different way. Make a list of Goals! You're on the right path by this choice. If you lack the self motivation, find support online, a therapist, NA, whatever fits your personality.

The Asian method with the best evidence is slow breathing. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

I would suggest you to start meditation, unless you have some heavy trauma with PTSD syndrom or things like this that could make you experience those trauma again.

That could become a new healthy addiction, since you will have a lot of positive results in your everyday life pretty soon. And with time it will help you know yourself better, especially on why you needed drugs in the first place.

I would also recommend you to get interested in sto√Øcism, but the real thing. Not the Fake sto√Øcism / broicism you can found online and which is bullshit.

I‚Äôm stuck in a similar thought pattern to you and wanted to list some things that may help to ground you before you get to that elevated state and start thinking about hurting yourself. I have my set backs but I know that these things need practice so the important thing is to be kind to yourself (easier said than done). 
-breathing exercises, especially inhaling for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8. (Insight timer is a great app for breathing exercises) it sounds silly but start off practicing this 2 or 3 times a day, and eventually you‚Äôll find yourself doing them more frequently.
-remind yourself to slow down and be mindful. This sounds basic as well but the more you practice it, the more you will naturally be able to slow yourself down if you find your thoughts racing. 
-audiobooks or reading
-cold water therapy. Things like swimming or holding ice cubes when you feel yourself panicking. Even switching the shower to cold for a few seconds can help. 
-meditation can be helpful for some. 
-go for a walk. I used to hate when people told me this because some days I felt like I couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed. But if you find the motivation to even sit by an open window or just sit outside in nature and do some breathing exercises, it can really help. 
-counselling/therapy. I know it‚Äôs not always available depending on where you live and your financial situation but there could be some charities that offer free help.

So you are back on the antidepressants now? And they give you suicidal thoughts? If that‚Äôs the case are you looking to taper off them? If you do I think the GAPS diet along with the right supplements will help you. The GAPS diet is so nourishing, grounding, healing. 

You could try a good herbalist to help with your health, herbs and supplements. 

Also exercise even if a short walk each day. The body needs the blood to move and not stagnate. 

You could look into mushrooms like reishi for brain health.

It‚Äôs really hard now because paranoias have kicked in in such a high gear that even a walk is disrupting - I used to walk like 4 miles a day when I quit that shit last year - still trying to do it everyday, but it‚Äôs really hard because my body and brain are shutting down. I could do it with lots of anxiety and pain before the hospital in December. Right before that I had been feeling better for a couple of days, I wanted to move, wake up and do things. As soon as I got in I (it was voluntary) asked them immediately to let me out, that I had to live and be outside because I felt like doing things after months of isolation and being in a nuthouse (that‚Äôs exactly what those places are, way worse than jail) was the last thing that I needed, but I let them talk me into staying because they wanted to monitor me to see how meds worked, I told them that the way I was doing you could not really separate those thing and I would not be able to assess how those meds worked in a place where all I could to was staying in bed all day alone with my paranoias. But still I let them convince me, because of their promises of  DBT therapy and all that. None of that came. And since I got into the hospital and back on meds all I could think about was killing myself 24/7, in such an impairing way that it would interfere with everything else. And I mean everything. Now I‚Äôm tapering off by myself, and I want to try and change my mindset. First of all fuck them all. I wanna get out of that disgusting loop of hospitalisation and no help whatsoever, I will try to find a good therapist for once and definitely follow your advice.

This is the issue with this post: the idea that every addicted person can will themselves out of addiction. Trust me, I tried, and I don't even suffer from addiction to substances, but I haven't been able to quit any of my addictions without forming another unhealthy habit or coping mechanism. Neither have I overcome any of my issues on my own, ever.

I had to be guided, not yet by professional help, at least not since I was way younger, but by friends and strangers alike, by stories on Reddit, by a world of other perspectives that I felt hostile towards me until I understood them on my own.

And still, I keep playing games all day whenever I can and I resort to binge-eating whenever I feel awful about my life choices. That isn't healthy, and I've been spiralling down for a long while now, so much so that I'm seriously considering seeking help. I know I'm going against myself with what I'm doing, I know it's ruining me, and I know that it's wrong even as I *decide to start doing it*. It's not enough. No amount of telling myself (or others telling me) that I'll feel better if I just don't is going to dissuade me from doing it - it'll just amp up the guilt and make me feel worse in return, further fueling the self hatred.

This isn't to claim that everyone is like me, just to counter the fact that everybody can get a hold of their mental health and get better by quitting their addiction, or better, that everyone can just quit their addiction through their willpower alone.",ImHidingBehindANick,18zts26

2,"They might, they might not. Different doctors have different risk tolerances for this sort of thing.

I will say that it probably won't help that you were self-medicating rather than using recreationally, as that's actually more likely to cause addiction due to the use being (presumably) more frequent. Lots of people try cocaine and move on with no issues, whereas people who self-medicate tend to have more issues.

I also don't think tolerance will be an issue. It's not like anesthesia where a high tolerance could cause serious complications. Worst case scenario the meds just won't work as well. Best case scenario, you might adjust more quickly and get less of the jitters. If you go in like, ""By the way, I used cocaine a lot and might need an unusually high dose of Ritalin,"" that will raise some very justified red flags with the doctor.

I used to abuse stimulants. I just stopped one day, decided I didn't want to live like that, and kept my past a secret. I'm now able to use a very low dose of Ritalin without any issues, and I decided it wasn't worth the risk of coming clean. But I do acknowledge that I'm playing with fire.

8,">Not with cocaine because it is not physically addictive but rather psychologically. 

I don't quite understand what you're saying. All addiction is physical and psychological, there aren't distinctly ""physical"" and ""psychological"" subtypes. Cocaine addiction is quite clearly a physical, chemical phenomenon as the drug predictably causes addiction with repeated use in a wide range of subjects, famously including rats.

>As I was only using it therapeutically, I did not develop a psychological need for it.

Well, first, cocaine therapy is just a nice way of saying you were self-medicating with a highly addictive, toxic substance. That you put a socially acceptable spin on it doesn't reduce the very real danger. There is no protocol for using cocaine ""therapeutically"" for ADHD, which means you were dosing yourself based on what you felt you needed, which is often how people get addicted to prescription stimulants.

It's easy to think that addicts are all just frivolous hedonists, but MANY of us started out using drugs to manage a medical problem. Nothing you've said rules out that your cocaine use is any less dangerous, and in fact seems more dangerous because you seem so convinced you're a special exception to these near-universal rules about how drug addiction works.

No it isn't. There is physical dependence whereby the body has a physical need for the drug to remain homeostatic, and sudden withdrawal can cause serious physical symptoms. For example, my mother is prescribed opioids for her pain. If she doesn't take her pills for a few days, she experiences physical withdrawal symptoms. She has no desire to take the pills but does so to alleviate the symptoms (and obviously the pain) 

Psychological dependance is where it is a mental and cognitive process. You feel a need for the drug and so take it. This is the same mechanism by which people can addicted to gambling, porn, and gaming. It is due to downregulation of certain neurotransmitter receptors such as dopamine. Some drugs can cause both but most tend to be stronger in one than the other.



>Well, first, cocaine therapy is just a nice way of saying you were self-medicating with a highly addictive, toxic substance.

ADHD medicine is also highly addictive. Stimulants in general are highly addictive. Most drugs are toxic and have side effects. Method of administration and use is important. 

I would never snort powder cocaine firstly because it is cut with God knows what and secondly because it leads to a high and brief peak which has little practical use and increases tolerance and risk of addiction.

I used coca leaves which contain cocaine at lower levels. I would chew on the leaves, and never developed a need to increase my dosage. I have never used it recreationally and haven't used it since receiving my ADHD meds.

>and in fact seems more dangerous because you seem so convinced you're a special exception to these near-universal rules about how drug addiction works.

I am not an exception. However, I have studied psychology, I have a lot of history dealing with mental health conditions, and know the process by which addiction creeps up on people, which is why I only ever used the cocaine for therapeutic purposes, and never to feel good or when I was in a bad mood.

All stimulants can cause addiction. I know how drugs work.",Novel_Candidate3068,1b4porf

As for physical dependence, that's not a form of addiction and is a separate phenomenon. People confuse them because one drug, morphine, served as the prototype for understanding both conditions.

Sorry for not being clear. In my mother's case, if her pain was to stop, she would be able to slowly decrease the dosage. She is not addicted. However, some people can become addicted purely because of the physical withdrawals. This is separate to psychological addiction where they are mainly mental symptoms.

>Processed cocaine is a very different animal but one that people with ADHD are prone to using, often with good intentions, but with harmful results.

And this is again due to people snorting the stuff. If you snort adderall, you're likely to become addicted as well. And not to mention powder cocaine is never pure which makes it more dangerous.

Vipassana meditation does just that. Look up some of my first comments to see more on what it is and how it helps. 

I'll explain the mechanics of it for this question. 
You breathe, your breathe is yours, you observe it try to focus on it develop a mindset of being aware of your breath. 

Then you move on to focusing on sensations throughout your body. That's how you experience the world, through sensations. So you slowly train yourself to observe them whthout adding any emotions to the sensations, for example an ant biting might be unpleasant and your response might be to act on it without thinking but as you practice Vipassana meditation you train yourself to see every sensation with equanimity so you don't attach unpleasant to the sensation and thus don't react without thinking.

It's much more than this but this is what basic Vipassana does. It does so much more than this for everyone. 

This is the teaching the Buddha left people, how to rid yourself of anxiety. See Siddharth Gautama who was later known as the Buddha, realized that the cause fo sufferening was anxiety (for the most part) and you develop then from the experiences you get though the sensations you feel and so he taught how to observe them in a way which was possible for everyone and it really does help with a lot of stuff.

2,Also your therapist can't make you go to a psych ward if you genuinely were in a position where that is necessary  your parents or anyone who lives with you would become your guardian and they'd have to choose for you to go to the psych ward also you wouldn't go to one unless admitted by yourself or family or unless you commit a crime and than you're forced to go to one,,xcz601

My mom gave us laundry detergent in a gatorade bottle. I look at it and it is blue like gatorade, it did look odd but yeah i just thought it was a flavor of gatorade i hadnt seen. Take a little sip and well it was not the nice refreshing taste of gatorade. Luckily i spit it out before swallowing. Lol the people in the house still give me shit for that cause its pretty funny i did that. Was pretty useless looking at my phone because my vision was so so bad and blurry even into the next day. Everything kind of seems like a face when i laid down in bed. I got asked if i was high and simply said no. I think they left idek when or how long i was tripping. So i lay in the cubby in the bad and have these horrible convulsions and couldnt get help because no one was there. It was like i was being punched on my stomach and or chest. It kept making me go up and let out a groan. When i took a shower the shampoo bottle kept morphing into my phone so i kept getting all surprised and thinking i ruined my phone, till i look again and realize it was just a shampoo bottle, i did this multiple times.

A Yale medical journal says that the best things for avoiding relapse from addiction are relaxation with traditional Asian methods and cognitive therapy.  
  
The Asian method with the best evidence is slow breathing. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
More info, including the 3-part mind-body program of Brown and Gerbarg, here -  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEM\_jlDRZI  
  
Cognitive therapy - SMARTRecovery.org is like a brainy version of NA, ex-users who believe in psychology. They have a program based on the most popular counseling methods.  
  
Other experts recommend activities that get your mind involved, like an interesting hobby. I know of a recovering addict who learned to play the guitar.

By the night time I'd be completely wasted, black out on most nights. Then the cycle would repeat the next day. The amount of alcohol I'd consume daily gradualy doubled over the period. It's my second week of being clean. Yesterday was the first time I went outside during this short term of sobriety. I've had troubles with weed and alcohol in the past.

11,It sounds like you struggle with some internal issues and a rough past the moment I knew I had to quit fent as when I was hallucinating people from my past so I had someone to hang out with. I did fent because I wanted to die and instead made myself the weakest I ever was. And I was taught the hard lesson that you know what it is you‚Äôre missing in your life you know your potential so step by step day by day do something different even if it‚Äôs hard it‚Äôll be worth it in the end.

If it shows up it shows up. From my own experience, I wouldn't say anything about it after the fact. Just ignore it. Drug screens are so ridiculous, I never really understood how those worked... I've been accused of taking things when I was completely clean, passed clear when I know I should have failed, and been accused of not complying with medication treatment not showing up in certain situations.

3,"""If it shows up...will I not be prescribed ADHD medication."" 

Answer: it should not matter, no. But again, all doctors are different and have their own beliefs and can prescribe however they want based on whatever they think about you. So again, if your doctor brings it up just deny it. Tests are wrong all of the time. If you bring it up that you did it recreationally once it could impact the doctor's decision to prescribe that specific medication down the road to you. Not necessarily any medication at all.

Unfortunately, it can seem pretty hopeless at times because diseases like depression are so complex, and take immense effort and time to treat. But to offer a bit of hope, I can confidently say that SSRIs and SNRIs are one of the main reasons I am alive and WANT to be alive. While they didn't cure my severe major depressive disorder or suddenly give worth to my existence, they did offer stability.

Not one time ever anywhere in any city in any country. Never. That's called anxiety dude. And weed calms that down. Smoke some more and chill tf out.

Here's why im rude, ive given you the facts, your ignoring them and jumping to things that confirm your biased conclusion that you shouldn't even have yet. Remove edibles entirely from the equation. Its been months and its literally impossible for them to affect you any longer than an hour after use. Dont believe me? You have the dam internet with the worlds information in your palm. Use it dude. Research. Actually learn something. Its so dam frustrating that people do this shit. Conclusion first then work towards the problem. Like what kinda thought process is that for real?

1,You‚Äôre not alone in this boat my friend. Weed has been a huge HUGE crutch of mine for a long time. My habits eventually carried over once I dabbled with other substances and it did not go well. Now I still have weed as a major crutch. My best tip is to not have it readily available to you at all times. Go out and do stuff where smoking would be a hassle. Go see family. Add a good amount of activities throughout your day that don‚Äôt involve smoking and once you get around to toking up you‚Äôll feel like you actually deserve it. You won‚Äôt feel horrible anxiety that kills your buzz. A nice tolerance break does wonders too. Give your body a break as often as you can.,FatPattyIce,p05sj7

4) why are you seeing 2 different psychiatrists?
5) why is psychiatrist 1 giving you the possibility of 3 different mental health diagnoses? What other symptoms are you having that could indicate bipolar, schizophrenia etc?
6) what's your age and gender?

2) symptoms came about a week after taking lsd and smoking cannabis heavily for about 7 years, I would guess symptoms came from both drugs but I‚Äôm not 100% sure.
3)I have a cousin who has schizophrenia , but that‚Äôs it though.
4)I‚Äôm seeing a second psychiatrist because I wanted to get more information on treatment options besides medication, as well as insight on what happened, as all he could really tell me was that I had an episode and some mental illness. The second psychiatrist is from a place called Amen clinic which took two brain scans of my brain in order to get more information on what‚Äôs going on. They found certain areas lacking major bloodflow/ activity which was most likely caused by drug use. 
5)The first psychiatrist based on my symptoms of being very depressed (suicidal) after losing my job, apartment, and girlfriend from having delusions/ paranoia. fallowed by mood swings were I would go from super sad to super angry and yell/ argue with my family. Lastly I experienced lots of paranoia and delusions. The first psychiatrist did not know what specifically I had. He said it could be a schizophrenia , depression with psychotic features, or Bipolar because of the mood swings I was experiencing. He couldn‚Äôt give me a definite diagnosis although he said I had something he just isn‚Äôt sure what.

My most recent one I actually weaned myself off of myself because I didn't connect with my psychiatrist and it took me two months to be seen by another one (who is so far great).
I learned something in my two months without Effexor (still taking Buspar) that my mental health was absolute trash, but not because I've become *addicted*, but because this is how my brain is (always anxious), and there's no shame in taking a medication to help with quality of life.

2,"We are here to figure out ways to exist responsibly, knowing ourselves and who we are so we can spend our time experiencing wholesome joy in hopefully just about everything we do, in ways that honor our deepest personal values. Usually by expressing our favorite virtues

Abstaining from unhealthy vices that cause us to degenerate over time, typically by making us more selfish and insecure in the long run...

Working to create good things no matter how big or small... this accumulates merit which allows for higher brain functions. makes it easier to be mindful and present, to have a good relationship with the self. we gain wisdom to solve the problems that accumulate in our subconscious and live our life high above our personal demons

Ultimately, this leads to ascensions that renders our life on Earth something more like a nirvanic paradise in the subconscious, grown slowly and carefully like a garden... pruning out the toxicity that would have it rot and turn into a desolate wasteland from neglect where we avoid and run from the bad things thriving under the surface... learning to turn heal such a hellscape and turn it into a paradise is a big part of the point of it all

resolving our issues and healing so we can be free to live our best live is what it's about.. we all have our own issues. some have answers to riddles we don't, while they need answers we often have.. making deep connections with kind people and honoring them in positive ways is a good way to help move the process along",BodhingJay,16swhpc

I am generally not a useful person in any regard

As for healing and cleansing myself of ""toxicity"" these past few months and to a greater extent maybe these past 2 years I've slowly realized that the world is cruel 
And there's little chance I'll end up accomplishing any goal I have, let alone having even a useful life. There's no ""evil"" part of me that can get told away by a therapist or drugged away.

1,"I'm so sorry you are experiencing that. It sound awful.

I've never experienced something like that, but I do know a lot about drugs and you absolutely should not be doing MDMA more the once every 3 months for future reference (I know that doesn't help you much at this point) that shit destroys your dopamine and serotonin receptors. I hate how prevalent this shit is in colleges cause I argue it's worse for you then meth.

Also may I ask, have you ever done any sort of psychedelics before this?? Sometimes these things can trigger psychotic breaks in people and that may be what's happening, but if you have had psychedelics before this and this is the first time you are experiencing this, you are probably ok and it is just a result of your brain being fried.

Edit: This comes off as very anti-MDMA and I don't want to help spread anti-drug propaganda. So I just want to clarify MDMA has a lot of potential positive medical value I just hate that there are so many misconceptions about it, it's not just a fun party drug, it's extremely powerful and addictive and needs to be used with caution.",xxxstonerman42069xxx,npmjr7

MDMA sure was a large part of the drugs I did too, and reading this post hit home.For starters, i am a dumb 19 year old, NO PROFESSIONAL BY ANY MEANS. I‚Äôd probably not take mdma again, and if you insist on doing it, please micro dose and ensure you are in a positive space physically/mentally!
Now, for the anxiety/panic attacks, i have those too, i did before, but after doing mdma every day for a couple weeks it sure got worse. Ive also been struggling with derealization, or whatever it is. Just feeling like nothing around me is real, or like im just a brain behind a pair of eyeballs, etc. Now I cant tell you if it will go away (im not trying to make you hopeless or scared) but I can tell you that being outside in nature helps me, being away from streets and buildings and cars and people. Helps me ground myself. I also try to always remain spatially aware (i think thats the word) like list 5 descriptive things about the room I am in (ex; the fan is spinning at a low speed giving me a gentle breeze, the curtain against my window is flowing softly because of the breeze from the fan, etc.)

If you don‚Äôt smoke I‚Äôd recommend smoking a blunt jus to have some opposite effects going, or if you do smoke I‚Äôd recommend sobering up for a couple weeks.

2,"As someone who has smoked their fair share of weed (actually, a medium-sized town's fair share of weed), all I can say is that it will not help. Like, at all. It will make things worse. So don't do that.

Other drugs? To be honest I have never tried them, but I am sure that putting a bunch of artificial substances and chemicals in your body that create a strong physical addiction is also not a solution. So don't do that either.

Alcohol and cigarettes? Well... I have never met an alcoholic person, but I know stories from people who have, and it sounds bad. I don't know what makes you go from ""having a glass of beer every evening after work"" to full blown alcoholism. If you can figure that out, and try to assess your situation and take measures if it gets too far, then maybe it is not that bad. I had my daily wine glass during COVID and it worked well for me. Of course I also almost doubled my body weight during the 2 years of lock down, so I stopped the alcohol for the sake of my diet. But still, it might help to take the edge off.

6," I have smoked weed before and it doesn‚Äôt feel terrible most of the times, I guess what put me off it is my upbringing (aka drugs are bad, dont trust people who do drugs) and also my trauma related guilt. In terms of alcohol, i had a really bad night a couple of weeks ago that led to me almost poisoning myself, because i am quite small and taking enough alcohol to knock me in and out of consciousness and also cause back to back panic/psychotic episodes isnt ideal. After that i said that i would quit drinking because frankly it‚Äôs too expensive and takes such a long time. I guess that puts alcohol out of the question. However, there is nothing really putting me off others things like cigarettes or weed (or other drugs) because like, they feel very appealing to me, and the only consequence i can think of (that being that i will hate myself afterwards) isn‚Äôt really a strong one because self-love was never a strength of mine.
Also the whole ‚Äúdrugs are bad‚Äù thing unfortunately mostly applies to other people and not me‚Ä¶",Antroktasiai,tb5ss8
7,"Oh, for sure, alcohol can be nasty. I was always also very petite (minus the fat COVID phase, but I am slowly getting back) and would get drunk very easily. I have been blackout drunk once (thankfully while on vacation with my parents, because I would have possibly died by myself). Also, once at university I got alcohol poisoning (I think, I still made it home, but the next day I was throwing up every 5 minutes, until I went to the emergency room and they gave me an antiemetic, which btw was NOT a pill, and that's all I am gonna say on the matter!).

Regarding the weed, it is complicated. It is very fun at the start, but when you approach the level I was at before I quit, it stops being nice. There are many studies that show that long term use can affect your mood, brain chemistry, seretonin production, whatever. I am always sceptical, because I always imagine there is political or religious pressure and war on drugs and blah blah, so I cannot be sure, who funds these studies anyway, whose agenda's are they serving? 

The greatest argument in my opinion comes from South Park. Weed is not good, because it makes you feel ok with being bored, with doing nothing. And if you are ok with that, then you do nothing. And if I may expand on that theory: Then you feel guilty for doing nothing. But you don't have the energy to do something. So you smoke another J to forget that you are guilty. And so on.. Also, it can mess up your social life. I could not wait to go home after work and just light one, so I avoided social situations. And then I would feel lonely. And then guilty for being lonely. And angry for smoking. And to cover all these emotions, I would light another J!

Anyway, I guess the conclusion is that, whatever you do, make sure you moderate it, and that you control it, it doesn't control you. I probably sound like your mom now, I know! But I mentioned that I smoke (and that I smoked), so you know I am cool! üòé /s",i_do_like_farts,tb5ss8

The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.

Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down.

0,"Advice... remember this. 

If you were man, you would not have the luxury of staying at a same sex shelter, or any shelter really. 

Try to find the good in the small things, be more grateful for them....including the fact that this shelter allows you to stay while pretending to be a woman.",throwaway99698798,182m0i3
1,"I know you didn't mean it like this, but this post comes across as a bit judgemental. All the women in the shelter are valuable and deserve safe harbor. This includes you, you also deserve safe harbor, but saying things like, ""I'm surrounded by low income people and that is traumatizing,"" just strikes me as...wrong. I can't imagine being so privileged so as to feel traumatized by the mere presence of poor people. 

Like I said, I absolutely know you didn't mean it like that. Perhaps some less harsh wording may be beneficial.

A good practice may even be to learn from these ""low income people."" They know how to survive. They know safe places and unsafe places. They may know how to use the system. They may have some really valuable things to teach you.",Abject_Dimension4251,182m0i3
2,"the housing situation in Canada (and most other countries) sucks right now, especially for people living with disabilities or who need to be on welfare. im really sorry for what youve been experiencing. that sounds super tough and honestly I've been through some trying times like this so i can relate to you. excuse the long answer but i think i have a suggestion that could help you and many others interested;

as somebody who strongly advocates for disability rights, gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights as well as many other current world/social issues, i would love to help. i actually work for a Canadian startup organization (based in Toronto) and we are currently looking for global impact leaders to join our movement, you would be paid for your work as well as get free training/networking opportunities and access to tons of resources that can help nurture your growth. this might not help in the short-term as it may take a short while for us to get off the ground. but we are releasing an app soon that covers 12 themes, i mentioned some above, plus climate change, racism, animal cruelty, mental health as well as various personal development issues that will help people become their best, most fulfilled self. you can learn more about our org [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/celinamankarios/etherea-create-your-own-utopia-on-earth?ref=user_menu) (you don't have to back our campaign or anything, would just love you to read and find out more about what we do/how we help). if you shoot me a message i can send more information on the global impact leader positions and try to help you as best i can! like i said, this would be a more long-term solution but we would love to be a support system for you in the meantime and see how else we could help.

i hope you find some comfort in this message and that it resonates with you, even just a little bit. despite the influences around you, stay strong and try not to be persuaded into dappling with drugs, it can be a slippery slope from there. 

please keep us updated on how its all going, sending love and light your way .. you got this!",cece200333,182m0i3
3,"Make a routine and try your best to stick to it (but forgive yourself if you sometimes don't)

Make sure you include exercise in your routine. Lift weights if you have access to a gym. Calisthenics if you can't.

Seek therapy. If Canada social welfare doesn't cover it and you can't afford it then I recommend going to a library and reading books about mental health (just make sure you're getting advice from authors that are actual psychologists... apart from Jordan Peterson... don't go anywhere near that guy's work)

All of this is about empowering yourself. Controlling what you can and letting go of what you can't.",Winter_Injury_4550,182m0i3

5,"no no that may have just been a miscommunication on my end, I have low income what is traumatic is the hard drugs, I grew up fairly sheltered from things like that and since i‚Äôve been here i‚Äôve seen someone OD, and seen people using",McKennaTay,182m0i3
6,"i did not interpret the post like that. i think you definitely misunderstood. she meant that SHE has a very a low-income. she has a right to feel unsafe where she is if that's her experience, she literally talked about people using around her. have you ever been in a situation like that? people living with addiction can be sporadic, violent and unpredictable. they can also be the total opposite to that of course, but clearly if the OP is writing about being scared and traumatised where she is, they are not the latter. its a valid feeling. you don't know the full extent of her circumstances so telling her to learn from the people who are making her feel traumatised and unsafe is crazy advice. OP have you tried joining a support group? that might be the best place to learn from people in a similar situation to you",cece200333,182m0i3

im all for gratitude but this comment in particular is clearly kicking somebody. it comes across as transphobic and that you're hiding it behind giving ""advice"". not cool",cece200333,182m0i3
11,"all good, thanks for clarifying and sorry for the oversight by me. i guess im overly protective of vulnerable people and given the OPs unique situation -- trans girl living with a disability, mental health concerns and in a shelter that's making her feel unsafe/traumatised-- i just think your initial comment might have been a tad harsh. your suggestion about learning from others in the shelter didn't seem right to me, especially given the instability and addiction concerns among the individuals there and the fact that she said she felt unsafe. if they're dealing with substance use issues, seeking advice from them might not be the best approach, especially if she hasn't been around people in such situations before or might not be well-versed in those environments. that's just my opinion though and im definitely interested in hearing your perspective on this too. again sorry for being a bit defensive",cece200333,182m0i3

14,">I believe your in err to assume that one who is traumatized by poor people shouldn't try to learn from them

from my understanding she wasn't traumatised by the fact that they were poor.. and never did i make that assumption either.",cece200333,182m0i3
15,"You're correct. That was the nature of the misunderstanding which prompted my comment.

Again, I both understand and commend your impassioned response. I think I'm just the wrong target. I fully support OP and her right to a safe harbor, just like any other woman (or frankly, any other person regardless of gender) in her precarious situation.

My intent was not to condemn OP but to uplift whose who are often seen as lesser or dangerous because they are low income. We both share a passion for speaking out when someone is harmed. We are actually quite aligned I believe.",Abject_Dimension4251,182m0i3

1,"Sounds like you are caught in a neural feedback loop that is the genesis of addiction. If there aren‚Äôt sufficient rewards to stimulate your brain and motivate you outside of the chemicals, they will have a pull, bc they hijack your brains reward system. The more you feed that instead of the other things in your life, the stronger the pull, and the better they will feel, until eventually - at the end of the line - nothing else feels good. Ppl who are able to moderate their use of drugs/alcohol have a balance in their lives where other priorities - like health, school, or work - prevent them from overindulging.

So you are aware of the trap you face. You need to do the opposite of what the feedback loop is telling you to do to break out of it. If you can get out of bed when you don‚Äôt want to, you can do this. Look for areas of your life that are challenging, but not overwhelming, and focus on improving that. Try to find hobbies, interests, friends, extracurricular activities, anything to distract you and get you engaged in something/someone new. It won‚Äôt immediately feel good. It will take persistence to create new neural reward loops, but at your age, neuroplasticity is very high, so it will be much easier  to do now than at any other time in your life.

Keep a fitness routine! Regular exercise (esp cardio) will help stabilize your brain chemistry, and can speed up changes to reward paths as you try new things. 

I have no way of knowing exactly what you need, but lots of ppl recover from addictions without inpatient rehab. It‚Äôs necessary for some, but many more ppl ‚Äúkick the habit‚Äù of whatever without even considering it an addiction to begin with. Regardless, it would be good to have support from someone - if not a professional than I hope you can talk to a close friend, or ideally a trusted adult in your family that has your best interests at heart, but i know not everyone has that. 

You are already doing the right thing by opening up about it. The more you hide it, the more shame can grow like mold in the darkness, reinforcing the cycle. The more you share it, and get understanding, (bc millions of ppl are going through the same thing) the better that will feel compared to the substances. Human connection is the long-term alternative reward, and also the way out of the cycle, so keep your best ppl close, and keep reaching out and talking about it.

1,"Getting high is a bandaid solution, you'll still have the same problems waiting for you and possibly grown larger. If that person is truly your friend you should make amends and try to come to an agreement, don't be the one to hold a grudge just tell them how you feel and if they don't listen then just try again another time, if they still don't listen is that friend worth your time? 

Imagine having no friends, and I mean no one at all just 4 walls to stare at all day. Going online for any shred of human contact. This is how I live and it's disgusting, never wish it on anyone because friends are something you earn and I literally burnt every bridge I had on purpose, my anger knows no bounds apparently. But you can do better than that, both of us can and I'm taking steps to do so by getting a career in the military. What is it in your life that you look forward to? A goal or aspiration or maybe just enjoying time with friends or family?

Anything is better than wasting your time on drugs, it's not a bad thing to use a little bit of weed or drink a few. Hell even a bump or 2 isn't gonna kill you but as a person with mental issues like me you'd only be playing with fire, and sometimes you might burn down everything you've built up, possibly even your own house if you're not careful.

The only thing I can say to you is that you are not alone, we all feel that urge at night to howl at the moon and run through the fields, get high and wild. But what does it accomplish, another headache and false sense reality is all. We crave to escape our surrounding when of really, we shpuld change them so we are happy, not sit in our mess and get high. You can do it, you are strong as anyone.

Now if you're looking for spiritual use of drugs, I can recommend shrooms, they can clear the spirit but also bring out some very dark things, best used with a friend to watch over you. But it can awaken dormant feelings and really let you feel a different perspective on life, sometimes super happy, or sometimes super sad.

2,"Yes, it can be treated without medicine. Whether or not this is the best approach for you as an individual is another question.  
  
From an article posted by the International OCD Foundation:   
  
*""The first-line treatments for OCD(1) are a specific type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a type of antidepressant medication, called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  As a practitioner, I am equally comfortable with recommending either (or both) of these treatments""*  
  
If you go to the Amazon ad for You Are Not Your Brain by psychiatrist Jeffrey Schwartz, you'll see that people with OCD say they really appreciate this book. Also you might listen to the testimonials from readers on YouTube.  
  
As this article shows, his approach has been validated with brain scan studies.  
  
https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/rewiring-the-brain-to-treat-ocd  
  
Dr. Schwartz' approach is based on a simple, 4-step method -  
  
  
1) Relabel the obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges as obsessions and compulsions, not as real thoughts.  
  
  
2) Reattribute the obsessive thoughts to a brain malfunction called OCD.  
  
  
3) Refocus on a wholesome, productive activity for at least fifteen minutes.  
  
  
4) Revalue the entire obsession and compulsion group as having no useful meaning in your life.

1,"Yes. And do not take nortriptyline for any reason. It is the strongest inhibiter there is so will really f you up - like psychosis level within a week or two. Paxil and Wellbutrin also were very rough -  strong, bad hallucinations. I have multiple overlapping f'd up liver enzyme genes tho (COMT, MTHFR and CYP2D6) and i have heard they can combine to make things worse so it could be that was what was happening. I tried so many things for so long, but Dr. Brian Lum (chiropractor, i know! but reg docs don't know the gene stuff and everything he says matches my research) helped me get on magnesium, which is key for mood, and it's been a game changer. Average anxiety went from a 7 to a 4 over a month.   


Not trying to get off topic, but I've been struggling with stuff for 15 years, and wanted to repeat what OP said, which is that it's not all 'brain chemistry' or whatever - these genes for liver enzymes can be a big part. My body is inefficient in processing magnesium. I have tried meditation, diet, sleep, etc. and all help some, but it helped me to know some of why SSRI's never worked for me.",adunx,vqfn5d

3,"Ik this is an old post, but oh. my. god.

I even tested negative for amphetamines on a pre-employment screening repeatedly when I was taking Adderall daily.

I tried Nortriptyline for two nights. It triggered such a terrifying disassociation/depersonalization episode I thought I would have to be hospitalized. One of the worst couple of days of my life. I asked my psych why tf that happened/what does it mean and he had no idea.

1,"Okay, it really sounds like you're in a dangerous spot right now, my dude. My advice would be to contact your doctor and be completely honest with them about what you've consumed, when, and how much. You may have done some damage to your brain.

Your thoughts are your thoughts, and they're not going to expand with more psychadelics; if anything, you might cloud up some of those interesting ideas. Write them down for somebody you trust to read them and give you honest feedback - great novels have come from less inspired sources.

It sounds like you may be attempting to self-medicate your obsessive behaviors with psychotropes; instead of going it on your own, work with your doctor to manage the chemical side of things and a good therapist to help you manage the behavioral side.

1,"Okay, while it may make you feel good at the start, you will develop a tolerance for it, meaning that you will need increasing amounts of it to feel happy. Also, any drug that's addictive kinda screws you down the road in life because you will spend tons of money on drugs that you could be putting elsewhere. Also quitting drugs is a pain and it's far from easy.

So I obviously can't stop you from doing anything but if you value your financial and physical health, you won't do drugs.",MysticAviator,jqnc70
2,"Because taking drugs to make you happy isn't the same as finding happiness. You're taking chemicals to force a reaction in your brain.

It's like writing a story where you cut out the middle and you're just left with the end. Except the end has now been tarnished by addiction, a failing liver and a stroke. 

You'll also be constantly scrounging for money to fuel your ""happiness"", when in reality you're just fueling your addiction. Your addiction will continue you to grow as you'll need more of the drug to get the same effect.

You'll end up probably a criminal trying to gain the funds to buy more drugs. 

You said you'd ""kill yourself"" if you were put in prison. I don't think the quest for drugs is your biggest problem here. I think your true issue is your lack of respect for yourself. You come off as a person who doesn't value themselves. You seem to care about short term ""gains"" without thinking about the long term effects, because you don't see a future where you're alive.

1,"Well‚Ä¶ thats a tough one, I was addicted to MDMA for a fairly short period of my life but had developed serotonin syndrome and had to stop because there was not enough serotonin to make MDMA do its thing‚Ä¶ so I obviously had to stop and enjoy the sober life, right? And so I did. My method was pretty simple, I just moved on to weed for a bit, and got high on that every now and again. To be honest its still hard to enjoy life sober and once you‚Äôve tried something that is better than being sober its hard to see the good things in being sober. Maybe just try to list all the bad things that you would feel after it, because a comedown is way worse than a hangover, for example. The only way to enjoy being sober is to realize how bad being under the influence can be to you and to the people around you. Idk. I have nothing against the usage of such drugs but‚Ä¶ it is hard to answer your question, since everyone enjoys the sober life differently you just have to find that one thing. Sorry if I wasn‚Äôt helpful but I hope you find YOUR way and you‚Äôll feel better about it eventually, it just takes time :)¬£",Pommunist,pm5n2x

What helped me recover is getting the root of the underlying issues I had, the reason why I started using drugs to cope in the first place. Until you solve those issues and learn more about them, you‚Äôre always going to find a reason to use. The reality is that using drugs to escape sober life is a coping skill used to mask underlying issues, even if it‚Äôs a really bad one. I wish you the best and hope you can get the help you need.

There used to be public service announcements on TV that I thought were good. They were called My Anti-Drug. People would talk about things that gave them satisfaction, things that served them better than drug abuse. My advice to to find something you find interesting and meaningful. 

An article in a Yale medical journal said that the two best things for avoiding relapse are methods from cognitive therapy and relaxation with traditional Asian methods like controlled breathing. You could get some CT advice from SMART. The video below, about self-help therapies, tells you about a lot of things that are good for stress including the Asian methods. I suggest talking about these with your mother and maybe a professional.

Letting someone close to you know about your problem will help keep you accountable and open up opportunity for you to receive help. 
That said, I also understand if you want to keep this hidden. Depending on your state, you may be able to seek addiction counseling completely confidential after 16, but if you‚Äôre turning 18 soon, you could wait until you turn 18 and it will be kept confidential regardless.

Our stories sound similar and I‚Äôve had severe anxiety in many forms since I was 10 (now 23) and I haven‚Äôt been more than an hour away from home in the time. I‚Äôve been on sertraline before when I was 17 but it stopped working and instead of upping the dose (I was on 50mg) they switched me to something else, since then I‚Äôve been on 5 different ones that haven‚Äôt helped and I‚Äôm now on the lowest dose of venlafaxine which has never helped so I‚Äôve been given 25 mg sertraline to start on but I‚Äôm too scared too.

I‚Äôm scared of nausea (I have emetophobia), serotonin syndrome and most of all that it will make me worse. I feel I can‚Äôt cope with any worse atm and that also prevents me from taking it but I should really get my head around taking it because it could change my life like it has yours.

1,Medication saved my butt.,,t0o40a
2,"You don‚Äôt have anything to worry about. I‚Äôve been on meds for depression and anxiety a few times and they help you a lot, specially if therapy isn‚Äôt enough sometimes. Just a few tips, follow the doctors orders as said, don‚Äôt drink while taking them (they‚Äôll make you get drunk way faster , also alcohol depresses you more), if you‚Äôre feeling worse after a few days taking them notify your doctor ASAP (that happened to me the first time I started taking them, so they switched my medication). If you‚Äôre feeling insecure ask your doctor anything you want to know , like how long your treatment could last, etc. And if you start taking them never ever ever just stop taking them, after you‚Äôve been on them for a while they will slowly reduce the dose until you don‚Äôt need them, getting off of them from one day to another can really mess you up. Hope this helps!",,t0o40a
3,"Depending on how your illness behaves, going to a psychiatrist and taking medication might be a lifelong thing or a lifelong episodic thing.

A psychiatrist is trained to carefully consider what the patient is already taking or what is going on in them before prescribing anything. But it also pays to do your research online. If they want you to start taking, for example, Brintellix, look it up online and talk to the psychiatrist about any concerns. Most medications used to treat mental illnesses are safe to take for anyone who needs them, but there are occasions when they might also be ""contraindicated"".

Hopefully pregnancy and breastfeeding will not be a concern for you for another ten years at minimum (the age of the mother at birth is a critical factor for certain social things with children), but many medications are considered a no-no at such times. But a good doctor will work with you to find solutions for that, too.

It is important to never overestimate your own knowledge, but reading about medications or diagnoses can help you with questions that you might have.

The people who told you that crap about medications ruining your life are morons. It is possible to react badly to a medication, but not **that** badly. And a decent psychiatrist will see the bad effects then switch you to another medication. Sometimes finding the right medication is a trial and error process. But the more informed you are, the less fear creeps into the process. Sometimes learning to ask the right questions is the best self-help, too.

I have had some real stinker experiences with medications that are no longer made today. I was misdiagnosed five times. And it was only because I did something terrible that I found a good doctor that prescribed me with good medications that I am relatively okay now. My current medications, Brintellix and lamotrigine, are keeping my anxiety in check just enough that I can function in life.

I hope this helps at all.",,t0o40a

There are things other than medicine that work physically on the system. These are things that for most people are low-risk and easy. It's good to combine them for a greater effect.

1,"Apart from drugs, psychotherapy is also very important.",samlsho,u4i6g3
2,"I'm not saying that what I'm saying here is the answer to all your problems but I think it can help. I say that because a psychologist who has carefully studied the relationship between lifestyle and depression says that the lifestyle choices that help with depression are good regardless of what has caused the depression - low thyroid, death of a loved one, whatever.  
  
These things are especially good for teenagers because they often find therapy hard. Doctors are often reluctant to prescribe medicine for teenage depression.  
  
I hope that you'll talk with your parents about this. I say that knowing that parents often fail to see depression in their children.  
   
It may help if you're not dramatic about it. You might say that you haven't been feeling up to par lately and you think you can use more exercise. I'm sure they would have no objections if you said you've been reading about ways to improve your grades (details below).   
  
  
If you can't see a therapist, self-help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self-help is a way to show you're serious that doesn't create friction in the family. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior.  
  
  
  
Self-help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self-help book explains what therapy for depression is like.  
  
  
  
With depression, there's what seems like a Catch 22. People say, ""I know there are things that will make me feel better - getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I'm depressed and I don't have the energy.  
  
  
  
Here's the thing - very important. People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.  
  
  
  
We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks.  
  
  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you our of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey.  
  
  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes.  
  
  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
  
  
You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise. As little as 20 min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve Ilardi, the therapist/researcher who headed the lifestyle-depression project at the Univ of Kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise.  
  
  
  
If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Ilardi's book (""splendid"").  
  
  
  
Of all the traditional mind-body practices (meditation, etc.), the one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is yoga breathing. Slow breathing is used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and PTSD. It's safe and it doesn't take any training.   
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.  
  
It has advice specifically for depressed students, such as StudentsAgainstDepression.org.

1,"Wax pens are hella strong and aren't researched very well yet, depending on the coil you had you could have been tasting iron from burning coil burning the wax. 
Anyhow sounds like you greened out - That shit was way too strong and you smoked way too much of it! CBD helps relieve anxiety stress and other symptoms of mental illness, without it just THC can be extremely potent and cause psychotic breaks but it shouldn't biologically be possible to happen in such a quick introduction state, I.e you'd have to have been smoking for years/smoke the equivalent of a kilo of weed in a puff and trust me thats not physically/biological possible. 
Also edibles affect you differently than smoking does. Edibles break down in your liver where as smoke in your kings and create 2 different chemicals. Interesting thing tho is that the compound produced in the liver is much more psychoactive than the one produces in the lungs while smoking so in practice, edibles should be more likely to cause psychosis.

Ever since then ive felt detached from myself and i get very bad social anxiety i would be paranoid about how i talked and how i acted around other people, i wouldn't feel like my self and felt like i could be read like an open book because i couldn't hold it together. One time a few months later i was pretty stoned and paranoid with my girlfriend and her mates. I felt like i snapped back into reality properly. It was as if my eyes had turned around and un-knotted themselves.  I was excited but also felt bad for my girlfriend as i had been disconnected for so long. However this was short lived and somehow i fell back into what felt like psychosis. 

Looking back on it now i have come allot closer to my senses. Sometimes i feel closer to myself or more distant depending on levels of anxiety. Quitting smoking weed about 3 months ago has definitely helped allot. Taking md in a good environment has seemed to build my confidence back and make me feel more connected. Although recently ive probably used it too regularly to have a positive effect. I still search and hope to snap back to reality.‚úå",wishbone1099,ofy1qk
3,wow thank you so much for the reply; Crazy to think i smoked too much with 2 small hits I might just be hypersensitive to drugs. Do you happen to know anything about it related to people with ADHD ? A couple people told me that apparently ADHD peeps who try smoking pot can be very bad for them and have a overall bad effect on them. I am not diagnosed but many have told me that I probably have it because I apparently show a lot of symptoms:'),NeverForgetMeBro,ofy1qk
4,"Ahahaha wow what a coincidence lol me too!  
But im currently trying to get diagnosed with the help of my physician. ANYHOW, yup thc and cbd affect people with ADHD very different than normal. For example me personally, I would have similar side affects from smoking high thc Indica wax but maybe not such an extreme next day downer, like I'll be really anxious the next day but that would be it BUT generally people swear that indica helps reduce anxiety and relax so that's a huge difference I figured out for my self - and since then I've been using weed more medicationally and it's really been helping me and my ADHD, helps me manage symptoms too! Ao id say yeah could be your hyper sensitive to drugs, or just could have been the wrong kind of drug!

I am a bit confused.

You talked to a psychiatrist, they prescribed you medication.

Now you ask a bunch of untrained randoms for a suggestion for a different medication because you believe that might somehow be a better fit, to then get that medication from a more qualified doctor?   
If you have access to a psychiatrist you trust more, talk to them about what medication they think would work for you.

In my experience, treatment for symptoms you describe require psycho therapy and medication. I am not professionally trained in any mental health profession, so i might be wrong.

Paranoid notions - not true paranoia with delusions - can come to us when we have a lot of stress and/or anxiety. For example, a veteran with PTSD will have what's called hypervigilance, being nervous in public places as if there was an enemy lurking somewhere. It's not being delusional, just being nervous.  
  
High anxiety puts worrisome thoughts in our heads. My recent comments about stress and anxiety have advice from experts about dealing with the thoughts and you're welcome to click on my name and read.  
   
About mind-reading, the idea that there are people who know what other people are thinking all the time is dismissed by the paranormal researchers who have studied this. They argue for psychic abilities based on statistical analysis.

Think to yourself about what you really want out of life. And I mean really want. Things you could only have or do if money, fame or pride didn't exist. The best way I've found to not cave under pressure is to look forward into what causes me to suffer rather than to wait for it to happen.

In painful truths you could admit about life and desires is you have to find something to aim at. Something to be completely immersed in that gives you both meaning, bliss, struggle and pain all in one. But an aim where the pain is worth the payout. Sacrifice in a sense.",singularity48,p9bhjw

Hopefully, you're not an addict yet but I'll mention a couple of good resources. One is SMARTRecovery.org. They're like a brainy version of NA - ex-users who believe in psychology. The other is a doctor.  
  
What I do not recommend is spending a lot of time in one of those expensive ""rehab"" places. William Miller of the Univ of New Mexico, one of the leading experts, says that those places are scams. States don't have standards for rehab and con artists cash in on this. The expose' John Oliver did for HBO has details. You can see it on YouTube.  
  
What I usually tell people who have a problem with money:  
  
1) Your GP may be helpful, perhaps in directing your search, helping you with your priorities, or giving you a prescription.  
  
2) There's a variety of things that can help - low-cost, low-risk things that are easy and can be combined with each other. I have advice from experts in my comments.   
   
 https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/o52kin/tips\_on\_how\_to\_cope/  
   
  
3) Do research, including study of the online therapy reviews. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.  
  
Do what you can to get a therapist. You may have to do a lot of research about this. Don't give up. Call your local social services (211?) and ask about Medicaid and Obamacare. Also, you can google ""affordable psychotherapy."" The cost of therapy can vary a lot.

You can try your local designated mental health agency. They typically have psychiatric prescribers and tend to take a wide array of insurance.",RWPossum,u0ombt

0,"Not a doctor, but since no one else has answered so far: certain types of depressive symptoms are associated with specific neurotransmitters. While it's no longer considered likely that these neurotransmitters are the sole root causes of depression (at least not in a simplistic sense of not having enough), drugs which affect those neurotransmitters do appear to help with those particular symptoms, so doctors may try to match the particular grouping of depressive symptoms with an appropriate drug. For example, serotonin is associated with anxiety, poor mood/emotional processing, rumination, etc., so a doctor might prescribe an SSRI for a patient with those symptoms to increase their serotonin levels. Dopamine is more associated with anhedonia / lack of pleasure, lethargy / low energy, poor motivation, and apathy, so a doctor might prescribe an NDRI to affect dopamine and norepinephrine.",RickAstleyletmedown,10feg1g

medical marijuana is no better, if you need an organ transplant you wont be eligible for it.

after 14 years of smoking marijuana I blew a hole in my lung and it got infected... now I only have one lung. a few months later I was back at it... its a nasty addiction because nobody that uses/smoke marijuana thinks its addicting and the misleading title of ""medical"" or ""medicine"" infuriates me.",,bts1r7

She relapsed twice. And then she was out of options. So you can fight it yourself or get help. Either way there is no shame. The reason you (probably) don‚Äôt suffer from withdrawal comes from a couple different variables most likely. But I‚Äôm not licensed so don‚Äôt quote me on that.

If you don't get enough fiber (30g a day) you will probably have IBS-C or IBS-A.

1,"Cannabis use can definitely trigger psychosis in those genetically vulnerable to it, particularly high THC strains. Smoking cannabis is not definitely going to make you unwell, but you are at increased risk and it might be best to err on the side of caution. If you want to continue to smoke, make sure you don't do it too frequently, especially when stressed, and try and stick with lower THC, higher CBD strains. ",amymeaniemineymo,88lqun
2,"I work with mental health patients.

I had a patient who got schizophrenia due to heavy drug use in his early twenties. It ruined his life and he can barely function anymore. I'm not trying to scare people but it's more common you'd think.

You might have a higher chance of getting sick, if it runs in your family. If you do plan on using be very careful with what you take and how much. In my understanding weed can trigger it, even if it's quite rare. Weed can induce psychosis which in turn can lead to all kinds of mental issues though, so keep track of how frequently you partake and keep the amounts fairly low.

Opioids are in my opinion never worth the risk. And as fun as psychedelics are, they have a higher chance of triggering schizophrenia.

If you are susceptible to mental illnesses drugs may trigger them. If you do plan on using though, make sure you get your drugs from a trusted source, keep the dosages low and never mix your drugs.

Also never take hard drugs unless you wanna ruin your life.",Werotus,88lqun

1,"No reason to feel guilt brother. I'm on methadone right now, lined up for an alcohol detox and I'm getting started with my meds too. I'm 32 been a drug addict for probably 8 years and slowly lost everything. The alternative to not taking the medication your literally prescribed could hypothetically trigger or get the relapse ball rolling.",NickyNomads,nodgmi
2,"I honestly think that there's a higher societal judgement on prescription meds, than there exists for actual drugs. It's such a weird concept. When you're using other drugs, you're just a ""druggie"" but let Sue, Tom, and Harry find out you're taking antidepressants, or anti-anxiety, or antipsychotics, and suddenly you're ""crazy"". It's the dumbest shit in the world, and it can be super isolating. You have to know for yourself, that these meds are a part of you doing the best that you can, and being the best you can. And another thing. You don't owe anyone shit. If it's something you want to share, share!! But if you don't feel like sharing, other people can fuck right off. You're doing amazing. You're trying to stay sober, and deal with life through a sober lens. I'm proud of you.",leburton,nodgmi

Now that I take it every day, exactly as my doctor tells me to take it, I do not have that same feeling it just helps me with my executive function as it should. I had an unhealthy relationship/feeling from it bc I wasn't taking the correct dose consistently.",kittycholamines,nodgmi

1,What is happening inside your mind when you feel the urge to use the drugs? What is the function of the drug use? To escape? To have fun? Is it a sexual thing? ,deathbydoghair,a0iafx
2,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. Well, figuring out what‚Äôs going on inside you when you‚Äôre feeling the urge is the first step. Next time you notice you want to do drugs, stop for a second and think about how you‚Äôre feeling, what thoughts you‚Äôre having, what events have just happened or are about to happen. Write it down. Tracking the urge will allow you to better understand why it is happening and then treat it. If it is something that can be helped by a therapist (eg wanted to escape negative emotions), I would recommend bringing that tracking log to therapy. Good luck. ",deathbydoghair,a0iafx
