0,cognitive decline,"Ever since I started noticing a decline in my intelligence, I can't help but obsess over it. I used to be a bright, insightful, mature person, and it feels like I've lost those qualities. I struggle a lot to concentrate, retain information, and use my vocabulary; every time I speak, it's like the words are slipping away. In the past few years, I've tried to figure out the cause and a possible cure, but all I've come across are empty speculations and paranoid ideas. It seems like everything I've done, my past actions, and the places I've been could have played a role. My obsession with finding an answer is making me more miserable, yet the symptoms feel so real that it can't be something I'm inflicting on myself. I really need some advice.

1,Does marijuana affect cognitive function?,"I feels like my brain is numb everytime i got asked a question. I cannot think fast enough or cannot think at all after being asked for sudden like math questions or others that need to be thought immediately. And I need to think about that question or that particular thing with time in order to get the answer. Sometimes it may be something I know but I can’t think of it suddenly or in front of others or the person that asked. It’s happening to me everyday. And I think I’m having memory lost both short term or long term. Also, I'm having so much difficulties while learning new things. Like staring at the paragraph for long time but not focusing like thinking about others or sometimes actually reading it but not understanding what the context is.  
  
I smoke 6 puffs of marijuanas around 10-11pm and then game before 12:30pm and wake up 7:30-8am everymorning and study before 10am and works all day before 8pm and then study before 10-11pm and repeat. That’s my daily routine. Is that smoking marijuana causing all that I'm describing above or do I need to change the routine?

2,How to handle cognitive decline from long-term depression?,"I'll keep it short! I'm a 30yo M that has been going through depression for 10+ years aswell as chronic back pain for the same amount. I've been trying multiple pain meds and depression meds that have not helped, though I've learned to manage the pain without meds. 

The issue is, that I've been noticing a slow but steady deterioration of my mental sharpness, I don't feel as mental sharp, feels like a slog to come up with ideas or even basic things.. like coming up with conversation topics or keeping up with conversations. I have EXTREME short term memory loss, sometimes I bring myself a glass of water and can't even remember going to get it.. or remembering what I just said in a span of 5 mins. I also have a tough time recollecting broad information. At the start, when it was milder, I thought it was a normal aging process, but as I got worse I couldnt help but think there was something more going on and Im extremely worried this will only get worse with time. Brain fog and feeling stupid most of the time.. and while I don't want to make myself seem full of myself, but I felt I was an extremely smart and sharp kid. I can barely recognize myself

Has anybody faced these issues? Is there any hope to get better in this facet? Is there any other conditions I should be looking at?

I'm starting to accept my fate as just being stupid and forgetfull, slow mess, but I hate it.

EDIT: Just to add more information! I have been excercising a LOT in the past few months, with a very consistent routine of 5 days a week, 1 to 2 hours a day in the gym. While it hasn't helped my brain fog and other symptoms as much, I will definitely keep this up. Also, I do have an history of Vit D deficiency and I will be doing a follow up on blood work. Last I checked my testosterone was fine. I dropped effexor recently and started taking Pristique. I'm following a relatively low card high protein diet to go with the consistent workouts I'm doing.

3,Is my cognitive ability declining?,"Sometimes I feel like I’m in my eighty’s when I’m only 17 years old. I will forget things in seconds(Due to my terrible short term memory it is very hard for me to learn and memorize new things), I will misplace objects(there have been times where I’ve watched myself throw a spoon in the trashcan, I was too slow to realize what I was doing), I have no energy or motivation to do anything anymore, and nothing to me is fun or enjoyable like it used to be. I can’t concentrate on just about anything anymore. The last year before my brain started having these problems was when I was 15. I was a ninth grader, and my GPA was a 3.7, I managed this without studying or trying, I was able to memorize the material. But here I am in eleventh grade, with a GPA of 2.8 and an inability to memorize anything learned anymore, I’ve tried studying but I can’t memorize the knowledge no matter what I try. I’ve studied for hours and got well below a 50% F on many of my tests. I just feel like my potential is done and over with, like I’ve lost the potential and that I have lost at life.

4,Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - Fluctuating believes,"I (M 28) have going to Cognitive behavioural therapy. Due to things that happened during my childhood I have certain negative believes about myself that cause feelings of insecurity and anxiety.

Together with a therapist I have setup some experiments to prove my negative believes wrong and to see myself in a more honest, fair and realistic way. I have been working on experimenting and improving daily.

Last week I totally felt the more realistic and honest believes, it made me calm, less anxious and made me feel more okay in my own skin. It was amazing but also scary and really weird to actually feel relaxed around people for the first time in 15 years.

But this week I'm back at my old negative believes again. I can think about the more realistic believes and thoughts but I just don't feel it.

7,"Trying to get better (cognition, confusion, concentration, etc.)","# What the title says.

This is a first post on a new account that exclusively revolves around trying to fix what I consider my incredibly broken mental state, as an icing on the cake of the psychotherapy that I... don't have yet I think, but I'm talking to a therapist. Uh... yeah. My idea of ""fixing my broken mental state"" is, in addition to doing all the therapy stuff, posting on forums about it, and I guess thus getting more conscious about it? I talk a lot on the internet, I... think, so why not talk about that.

I'm feeling very tired right now, so I'm not gonna put in a ton of effort into this post, but I'm just gonna run through a couple of different points that describe my issues the best and leave asking for suggestions. I might do a follow up post, and I hope for interesting answers!

Needed context: I have PKU, also known as Phenylketonuria. To put it simply, and probably a bit reductively(?), it's a genetic metabolism disorder. Basically, I am, like, terrible in Biology, and especially especially bad in phrasing my already limited knowledge in english (I'm german), so let me phrase it like this: There's proteins. Proteins have amino acids. Body needs to do things with amino acids. Phenylanaline is an amino acid. My body can't do anything with amino acid because error. It just pumps the shit into the brain. Hilarity ensues (aka. mental disabilities, concentration problems, sensibility, etc. all that fun stuff)

[https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/phenylketonuria-overview](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/phenylketonuria-overview)

[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/phenylketonuria/symptoms-causes/syc-20376302](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/phenylketonuria/symptoms-causes/syc-20376302)

You might find more if you look at those two pages under ""Symptoms""

The solution: Just eating extreeeeeeeeeemely little Protein. So no burgers, no milk, no meat, no bread, no noodles. (The highest amount I could take in, in my life was 16 grams of protein per day. That was the highest!) And lots of replacement stuff and drinks. But - I take medication called Palynziq since November '21 shortly after I turned 16. A couple of months ago it actually started working very well (It usually needs a while) and I started eating everything!

Other context: I'm very obese. My BMI is 41, and I think it even used to be 42 or 43?

So yeah, I think this is enough context.

To put it vaguely, the mental problems I have can be summarized like this:

-Extreme disorganization

-Extreme concentration problems

-Extreme memory problems (I generally don't remember anything)

-Extreme intellectual disability (!!!)

-Extreme confusion

-Extreme sensitivity

-Godawful motor skills (Breaking everything that I touch, I had like 13 phones by the time I was maybe 14 or 16?)

-A weird... immaturity. This is something where I don't know if I'm able to quite describe it in concrete terms. It might fit if I'd elaborate on random examples, but I'm too tired to do that right now. Let's just say that, even if you put obvious temper tantrums aside, I tend to react to things in a manner which, by every emotionally mature person in any room, can be easily recognized as a bit... childish? I know that's very vague.

-A general feeling of over indulging on things that I like (this is being formulated very shitty. Think of proto-substance abuse without drugs)

-Lots of lying and deception from my part, when talking to other people

This should cover all of my general feelings and issues that I have, but every one of them is a little microcosm of insane mental fuckery.

To expand on some of these a bit, I do not meet a single deadline that is given to me, and surprise myself with how intensely I can procrastinate. I also have an incredibly hard time with thinking. The central theme of most conversations I have is how I expand simple 2 minute question-answer convos into 45-90 minute long torture fests where I'm cognitively stuck in a rut and can not think of a single thing to answer, no matter how irrelevant or even really easy that topic is.

What tends to happen is that my brain either just gets hung up on a word for no reason (like if you'd ask me if we should buy scissors... best convo 10/10, i'd just mentally repeat the word ""scissors"" a bunch of times, instead of thinking about the issue), or my brain simply - and this sounds kind of dumb - can not spawn a SINGLE association with a given word. And when asked to, say, examine the pros and cons of something, I am unable to even think of one thing, and if I happen to think of an argument that thing is some random illogical bullshit that can usually be refuted by the person thinking for, maybe, 2 seconds.

I am so INSANELY infamous for just spouting really dumb bullshit and coming off as and being utterly fucking stupid, to the point where it has been an ever-staying presence in my life for every single day I'm alive.

The procrastination issue is also a thing where, even if I get the idea to do a thing that I'm supposed to do, I'll forget it after 0.5-1 seconds because my brain is scattered as fuck. Even if I'll set myself a reminder to do it, I'll just ignore the reminder. And until I can do something about it I alrady ignored it.

It feels like to actually start doing a thing I'm supposed to do, I'm supposed to a. hold a thought, b. think the thought through and c. act based on the thought through, three INCREDIBLY hard things for me, especially c, ESPECIALLY c.

So it feels like any solution that could've been given to me is completely irrelevant because I won't follow through with it. Why? Well, the answer has been reduced to ""Because I simply won't"" while it actually is ""Because I don't know how to make myself do a thought immediately and I forget a thought after a second"", but thinking about it more and more has left me so perplexed that I reduced it to a ""Because I simply won't"",

I have phases of extreme confusion, where not only my entire world seems to be a giant blur (this is the case for most of the time of my day, between medium and hard, well... most of it is just unconsciousness and being switched off. 99% of my day I spent in front of my computer, doing random shit, and i enjoy that a lot; but even reducing computer time has shown to not do anything, but thats too much to get into now) but also everything is completely non-understandable, no matter how clear someone phrases anything, and no matter how easy something is. It's not that I don't understand a given sentence, it's that my brain broke and I don't understand the world. (think of alzheimer here)

I also have an extreme, EXTREEEEME habit of indulging in intense fantasies and daydreams where I pretend I do something else that I'm doing at the moment. INCREDIBLY fucking common, I would argue it accounts for 90% of my ""life joy"".

Ok, so this is where I'm gonna stop myself from writing, because it's already too much. Well... I could write more, but I'm gonna leave it for now.

There might be some stuff I'm missing, and I think for the most part I phrased things like shit but oh well, too bad!

I got my thoughts out pretty quickly though, so thats nice.

I will end this post on the two following things:

1. I have been referred to as fairly intelligent numerous times in my life, even though most of my current life involves me being not just a kinda buffoon in a colloquial way but actually, severely cognitively stunted.
2. What are your thoughts? Feelings? Suggestions? Does that sound like anything particular you've heard?

14,"Low self esteem, self confidence , cognitive dissonance....","Hello everyone,

I'm a F(32) , divorced with a 5 year old.

I am upset with how my life turned out ....it's nowhere near what I imagined it to be.

Despite having above average looks and being academically smart my entire academic life .....I have accomplished nothing ....I did not create a fruitful career nor did I succeed in choosing the appropriate partner/husband and on top of that I brought an innocent life into this world who is already suffering from the divorce.

I can blame others and circumstances for my situation however I am a believer that one should self reflect. I was the one responsible for all of this mess.

I believe my low self-esteem and little confidence have been key factors driving most of my life decisions ....and fear is still what prevents me to this day from achieving what I want in life ....mind you I don't know what i want from this life anymore .

I am feeling depressed, overwhelmed, dizzy all the time, and I feel at my age it's over ....I am at that age where I am young but old enough to be embarrassed to start over or change careers ....I feel stuck and paralyzed.
I hate spending time with my child, she a very difficult little person and I think I have a phone addiction problem and im trying to distract or numb myself ....as well as my mind is always wandering off somewhere else. 

I have cut about 7 people from my life this past year and a half for various reasons all of which have the same common denominator that is people are trying to use me or I didn't serve their benefit any longer.

I often find myself wondering why I can't keep relationships with certain people like why I can't keep a man interested in me as a friend? Or why I can't keep that one colleague from betraying me even though I have stepped up for them when they were in need?
Why that one friend was jealous and envious of me eventhough my situation in life isn't the best?

17,Aesthetic chills mitigate maladaptive cognition in depression,"[This paper](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-023-05476-3), in my opinion, is an important stepping stone in using positive affect as a therapeutic. In the context of mental health, especially for mood disorders, the focus often leans heavily towards the mitigation or reduction of negative affect. However, it's equally important to promote positive affect. I think of mental health akin to a garden; while it's crucial to pull out the weeds (negative affect), it's equally important, if not more important, to water and nurture the flowers (positive affect). Just as a garden thrives not merely by weed removal but through the active cultivation of plants, mental well-being flourishes not only by lessening sadness or anxiety but by actively fostering joy, contentment, and other positive states. This approach emphasizes the growth and nourishment of positive emotions as a key element in achieving overall mental wellness.

18,My cognitive function has messed up my life outlook help,"Hey everyone, here's a little backstory to my issue. So essentially after about a few years of smoking weed heavy, questionable carts, vapes,drinking, and a long round of depression and self image issues I feel like I've reduced my ability to be able to reach high levels of orderly thinking by a large amount.

Let me elaborate, I feel like I struggle to keep that seamless awareness of what's going on in my life in terms of what individual tasks or actions i can proceed with in conjunction to the events that have already taken place. It's like I've lost that innate direction of life that I used to create for myself to build onto this character/personality that I have that encapsulates my desires and my past. Everything just seems too blurry to be able to really build significance in my daily actions as if all the things I can think to care about don't really add up to anything truly desirable.

It would be great if my mind could reach out to other objectives or emotional deep goals subconsciously that come into my awareness to build upon based on what I've already built myself on as a character but 1. I feel like I'm stuck working with whatever knowledge I have left of the world and myself in immediate mindful vicinity and 2. My life events don't seem to stand together sequentially it's just like I'm poking through the holes of swiss cheese that already exist.

It just hurts because what values do I really have left? were the values I used to strive and care for in the past just an illusion that my mind had made seem important for me. I just feel like I didn't mentally develop properly from 18 years old to 20 and that I can't create anymore significant memories to strengthen/build my character and make me feel truly comfortable with myself.

The stuff that I'm feeling is pretty hard to explain, so googling it isn't an option and that's why I came here. I hope to find someone who has experienced my symptoms and has a diagnosis. So to start, one of the scariest things I'm experiencing is the feeling that my perception or my surroundings have changed in a way that I can't explain. It happens randomly and I always have to tell myself that nothing has changed. Similar thing is when my brain expects something to happen which shouldn't, for example when I move my hand near an object, I feel the impulse that it should've touched the object even though I clearly know that I haven't touched it. Another thing is very poor memory, like I literally forget what I did a few seconds ago, almost feels like a very short blackout and I have to try very hard to deduce what I was doing. And on top of all that, there's always a feeling of derealization that I can't get out of. Feels like I don't even know what I'm looking at, but still can function normally, apart from keeping my focus for more than 5 minutes on one thing. I truly think I have some symptoms of depression like losing interest in all things, basically no emotions, dulled senses, but I don't know if depression can be linked to the other things I have mentioned.

25,Behavioral and Cognitive Theories on OCD,"Behavioral and Cognitive Theories On OCD: 

Behavioral Theory: 

The behavior theory suggests that human beings with OCD associate certain things or circumstances with fear, and that they discover ways to stay away from the important things they worry about or to perform rituals that help lessen the concern. 

One the sensation of concern becomes set up, human entities with OCD keep away from the matters they fear, rather than face or tolerate the fear. 

In behavior therapy individuals with OCD find ways to face and reduce their anxiety without working toward avoidance or ritual conduct. After they learn how to straight face their fears, they be less afraid. 

Cognitive Theory: 

The cognitive theory focuses on how people with OCD misread their thoughts. 

The majority of people have intrusive or unwelcome thoughts just like the ones pronounced by way of human beings with OCD. Many people shake off those intrusive thoughts. However, people with OCD might exaggerate the value of the thought, and respond as if it represents a real hazard. 

In cognitive treatment, people “unlearn” their incorrect beliefs and exchange their styles of thought. Through doing so, they have the ability to get rid of the anguish connected with such thoughts and to stop their compulsive habits. 

Some Solutions:

Left untreated, OCD generally develops into a persistent condition with episodes where symptoms appear to enhance. 

First-line treatments for OCD will regularly include: 

1. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)  
2. SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibitors).   
3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

CBT is very effective. There are two treatments under CBT. These are ERP(An exposure and reaction avoidance) and Exposure and Response Avoidance (ERP). 

These CBT treatments involve direct exposure to the conditions that cause fear and anxiety while avoiding reaction and responding in the usual matter that’s been enhancing the OCD. 

Stretching can help people with anxiety problems relax themselves and so they might upgrade the impacts of treatment. There is evidence that vigorous practice may have a quieting impact. Since caffeine, certain illegal medications, and even some other pharmaceuticals can disrupt the  sings of anxiety issues, they ought to be avoided them. To put it simply: Do not do drugs or any medication the doctors haven’t prescribed, and don’t use caffeine. Talk to your medical professional or drug professional before taking any extra medications.",1680433146.0,False,2,0,ocd-and-anxiety,None,129htxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/129htxo/behavioral_and_cognitive_theories_on_ocd/

33,"Deceased feelings, personal changes, cognitive deterioration","Hello Reddit!

I have the following problem. I am not enjoying things anymore.

Stories, ideas, plots, characters in movies, etc. don't make me interested anymore. Even if I engage in some activity without interest or desire, I won't feel any joy, even from the most favorite things.

Carrier paths, occupations that interested me once don't interes me anymore. Design, visual styles are no longer interesting, again no joy. Even cute things don't make me feel anything. Sounds like anhedonia, I thought. But it's not only the positive feelings that disappeared. Social things, situations that used to cause disappointment, anger, sadness, even emotional suffering - stopped causing all of these. The thing is, now I internally perceive it as absolutely normal things, and only in my thoughts am I angry (and it feels more like it's a memory that tells me to be angry). I don't feel fear as well. I used to be afraid of spiders. Can't say I can touch one now, but I feel no fear as such. An event that would scare me before, now only scares me in my thoughts (meaning that I understand, if the event happens, it will be bad, but I don't feel the fear). When I would be walking alone at 2-4 am I could have irrational fear about ghosts and a serial killer, but now I don't have it. 

My cat died not so long time ago. When I was alright, even the thought about this would make me want to cry. When it happened, I have been in this state for a long time, and I felt no sadness and had no tears, which would be a normal reaction.

Important to say that the interest is missing not in the consciousness, but somewhere ""inside"". Can't describe it better, sorry: it's simply different from when you are consciously not interested in something. 

Its started in April 19th. On that day I finished a book in English (not my first language), which I have been reading for a month. Then I watched and contemplated on a 4 hour movie, then I read comments and reviews about the movie. My head felt ""overloaded"", and I started feeling an internal pressure in the head. I took a break for 1 day. Didn't help. That's when I noticed the lack of interest and pleasure. So I took a break from all information for 1 week. I did it before from time to time. Usually on days like this I had a flow of useful thoughts, but this time it didn't happen. But I started noticing things.

I noticed that my bed was broken. I don't know for how long time I have been sleeping in the broken bed. After this I started noticing a squeezing feeling in the backside of my head, slouching and  curved spine.

Can't go to doctor because I don't have documents. Couldn't find any similar cases on the internet. The only ilness/disorder that has similar symptoms is depersonalization, but I don't have it as such - never have I felt like not being me, or perceived my actions as those of someone else. Apathy doesn't fit either - from what I see, apathy more like a conscious indifference, while in my case I DO care, but it's simply not accompanied be any feelings. Some sources say it's ""burnout"" and ""depression"", but they don't have such symptoms.

To be honest, I kind of want to stop trying to figure it out, but from time to time the desire to fix it comes back.

I hope you can help me. What do you think the reason could be? I understand you can't give me a diagnosis, but I would appreciate some pointers. In addition to this, I am losing thoughts that have been active for many years. And my argumentation gets worse. For example, a few days back I talked to a one's person and I couldn't recall the arguments (which have always been in my mind) that I would use to support my point of view, and it doesn't feel I can come up with it again.",1671069046.0,False,1,1,Square_Quality_3752,None,zm8vpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/zm8vpd/deceased_feelings_personal_changes_cognitive/

The issue is that I am struggling with some mental health things (previously misdiagnosed with ADHD, currently getting diagnosed for bipolar), and it's almost impossible for me to focus (as a stereotypical person with ADHD would seem). I have bad cognitive function and am terrible at organizing, planning, and coordinating, all of which are crucial elements for my current job. In my previous job, I spent about a year on stimulants (which made me MUCH better at it).  
  
I received a call from my boss today, basically telling me that I am not achieving results and that there's an evaluation coming up (so I better get my shit together ASAP). They said that I can't take my annual leave next month (I requested 7 days, they want to give me less than that), because we had planned some activities in that period (which could be postponed for a week). I am pretty devastated at this, and I don't really like my job. I feel like a loser and an idiot (although I know I am smart and capable of doing other things.. just not this).

i believe i have a cognitive bias that stems from despising selfish people, is this a positive or negative mindset? if negative how can i change it to become a healthier observer and thinker? 

i just cant stand the thought of selfishness because it degrades the rate at which humanity can progress, i believe people to be so convoluted and selfish that they cant grasp the opinions of others, whether their opinion is right or wrong, it doesn't matter, all opinions are important and everyone is entitled to their own. thats the entire beauty of opinions, differing opinions are not something to belittle or place judgement upon, they are an opportunity for two different mentalities to come to reasoning and find a truth which one can not do alone.

the issue is, nobody sees this as a correct way of living, and everyone im around believes they are right and nobody else's opinions matter, this does not make sense to me, its like their ego won't allow others to have differing opinions, they have to always be right and everyone else has to be wrong, i genuinely cant understand or reason with this mindset and i constantly dwell over whether im wrong or the people around me are, or maybe even neither of us or wrong; but at the same time their mindset seems so selfish and entitled that i cant help but believe i am correct. 

i feel like my opinions come from justification and personal experience, and i try to develop them in a way that seems positive and allows a person to grow, i don't try to affect anyone in a negative way but everyone around me says that im always wrong, im fairly young, and i believe maybe people cant accept my opinions because of my age, but i cant understand why this is. i feel like if i continue to dwell on this i will turn into a person i don't want to become, but i believe it to be a result of how my peers treat me.

- I havent been able to attend more than 2-3 minutes of online classes. I lose my focus almost immediately.

- I keep forgetting things I look at and will have to look again.

- Im unable to think straight and therefore unable to keep up conversations or make any sort of decisions. (even small ones)

- I feel dumb, unable to learn and kind of dead inside. I have lost touch with / forgotten who I was and starting to be this sad dull thing that I cant stand its existence.

- I dont have a sense of self at all. (specially recently) it is thought to be common with BPD cases. but i feel it going too far since i have kind of lost touch with my actual brain.

51,I want to give cognitive behavioral therapy another try but I run into a problem,"My therapist wants me to try CBT once again. She said I can do things that I enjoyed in the past, or before or in the early stages of my depression. These things would be:

1. Gaming, however this is not only limited to the past since I still pay games today and I often spend TOO much time on it.
2. The gym. However I permanently quit lifting weights for a reason that is not related to depression. Originally I started working out my muscles because as a 14 year old boy I got bullied alot in school. Later, this turned into an obsession with wanting to look like a huge bodybuilder. Now that I've grown up a bit, I realized I do not want to look like that at all, I have no interest in having big muscles anymore. None at all. So now I could go to the gym all I want but it wouldn't feel the same anymore. I don't have the obsession anymore. It wouldn't feel satisfying to complete a workout. The physical pain won't feel mentally good anymore. The gym is done for me, I'm just not interested. And it is not depression that made me uninterested. I just realized I would feel more attractive in a normal body than in a muscular body.
3. Running / cycling. I had an obsession with both of these as a young boy because I loved having the ability to travel anywhere quickly. On short distances it would be useful to be able to run fast and on longer distances it would be useful to be able to ride a bike fast. I was also so obsessed with these that my dream was to become a top athlete and earn money that way. Now that I grown up a little, I no longer have this goal, I also don't see it as a matter of ""efficiency"" anymore. Because yes if I can run fast that would help me in my daily life in any rare situation where I have to run fast, but if you compare it to all the time that is lost running and racing on a bike, then its actually more of a time loss than a time gain. I have more of this type of realizations that made me completely lose interest in those activities.
4. Volunteer work. I did volunteer work with animals for a year and it was a cool place with nice people, but.. I originally only started going there because I had a hope of finding someone who would end up being a close friend or even romantic partner with me. I was very lonely at that time (I still am kind of lonely) so my main reason to do volunteer work was social interactions. However, it was disappointing. After a year of doing volunteer work there, even tho the work itself was fun, I felt very frustrated that the most I could achieve was surface level interactions at the workplace that never resulted into anything outside the work place. So mainly because of these frustrations I decided to quit.
5. And the obvious... as a little kid I played with toys, there is no way I would do that or enjoy doing that as a young adult

So I want to give CBT another shot, but I'm very sure that none of the activities I can think of will be enjoyable for me, even if i wasnt depressed. I lost interest in all those activities and not because of my depression.

So I have no idea what activity there is that I would potentially enjoy. Definitely not the things I quit for reasons unrelated to depression.

54,Clozapine and cognition,"Hello everyone. I have Asperger's syndrome and BPD type II comorbid. Several years ago and in recent moments I've had big problems with motivation and sustained attention. And no medication or therapy did alleviate these problems, but recently I discovered that low dose clozapine at daytime (50-75mg) strongly alleviates these problems. Strangely, despite clozapine being usually said to be potent anticholinergic it turns out that it's very selective in action on different receptor isoforms, and respecting this it's more of a selective cholinergic/opioidergic/glutamatergic modulator. Also, its primary metabolite is N-desmethylclozapine which is present at higher tissue concentrations than the parent drug. And NDMC is a potent Delta opioid and M1 cholinergic agonist. The only major drawback is the possibility of agranulocytosis but fortunately, I'm also taking lithium which majorly prevents it.

I've struggled with this persistent anxiety that revolves around me thinking that I'm becoming stupid because I consume alcohol/weed on the weekends sometimes. My mind thinks that because I've done this while I'm young (18-20), I'm doing irreversible damage to my brain, and then I start panicking and can't focus on my work/goals.

Deep down, I really think I'm ok  because I don't consume intoxicants that often and haven't noticed any measurable problems in my schoolwork/work/cognitive function.

56,"Feelings of cognitive decline, inability to think deeply, struggling in social situations, memory issues... Curious to see if anyone has had a similar experience and got better","I'm curious to see if anyone has ever found themself in a similar situation and what can be done to help get back to the old me.

 Currently I am struggling with the issues I listed in the title. Over the past few months, I have noticed a lot of deficits in my cognitive abilities. First is my ability to recall information. This is prominently shown in my ability to remember conversations that I have had with people. Yes, I will remember having the conversation with someone, but I won't remember what was specifically said (its like I forget a lot of the important details). Also recently when I have been reading different articles and reddit posts, I often find myself skipping words on accident or misreading what was actually said. While these things bother me, the thing that bithers me most has been the difficulty I have had recently when talking to people. I feel as if I have no thoughts when in conversation with someone. Everything I end up saying either comes out awkward or is something that doesn't seem to carry on the conversation. Not only that, I will mispronounce words and stumble while I am trying to speak. The reason this is so concerning to me is that this isn't something that I have struggled with in the past. I was always the type of guy to be hanging out with friends and doing stuff with people, often being the center of attention and making others laugh. Now I feel like I have turned into a shell of my former self and no longer feel the desire to hang out with friends or family. I don't want the people close to me to see what I have become, a complete 180 version of my former self. Before all of this I felt intelligent, witty, and charming. Now I feel like I have lost all of those characteristics and I desperately want to get them back. 

To be fair, over the past few months, I have been stressed from starting a new job as well as going through a break up which definitely contribute to these feelings. But ultimately I don't think those two things should cause such a negative impact on my brain's abilities. Because of all of these symptoms I have been experiencing I find myself constantly thinking and worrying about what is happening to my brain and trying to research ways on how to fix it which in turn also leads to more anxiety and stress.

I'm sorry if this post seems to be all over the place, with all the mental fog I have been experiencing it makes it extremely difficult to put my thoughts and feelings into words.

If anyone has ever found themselves in a similar situation I would greatly appreciate some advice on how I can help myself get out of this rut that I am currently in and start enjoying life again.

I’m currently attending meta-cognitive group therapy. It all makes so much sense when we’re in the classroom, but I’m having a hard time implementing it into my real life. 

I’m having a hard time distinguishing between pushing away my thoughts and just letting them be there while ignoring them. I feel like when I just let them be there, they grow on their own and spiral out of proportion. And our therapist said that like taking deep breaths and trying to ignore them is actually pushing away your feelings, instead of embracing them.

She gave us an example of a Kaiten sushi bar (or running sushi bar). Imagine you’re sitting there and a bunch of nasty sushi is coming your way on the conveyer belt. If you eat them, the cook thinks you like them and will make more. If you push them off the conveyor belt, the cook will think you ate them and make more. However, if you just let them go around on the conveyer belt a few times, the cook will realize you don’t like it and make different sushi.

I lived three separate lives in which I lied to and manipulated three people. Most of these actions were questionable to say the least. And have hurt them in significant ways.

During this time I started to believe most of my own lies and the things I did didn't look that bad to me at those moments (they were). At the same time I lived with a constant feeling of guilt, but whenever I was in a moment I just didn't see consequences or tried to fix mistakes made before. This way of thinking was not normal and when I look back at it, I have so many questions and my actions just don't make sense. 

I'm currently working on cognitive behavioural therapy and we're working on actually seeing consequences and analyzing them BEFORE taking actions, staying away from lies and even when most would consider them harmless.

I see my therapist for 3 - 4 hours per week. In the meantime I actively have to do ""homework"" for it and implement the treatment into my daily life. Being aware of your every action and things you say is draining for now, even though it will come more natural in the future.

For example, got my first job when I was 13 because I didn’t like doing chores but I needed to do something to get candy from the candy store. 

Fast forward a couple decades, and now we have seen technology advancing at a rate that nobody could have predicted. 

Now I hate to say this, but, “back in my day” we had to learn about things that we were interested in from doing our own due diligence. Whether that be spending time at a library reading through books or asking someone smarter than us, like parents or teachers but mostly teachers because they specialized in their area of study. 

We didn’t have YouTube until I was in senior high and I can’t tell if this was a blessing or a curse. If you know what you are looking for, YouTube probably has a video explaining whatever it might be to some extent. Or eat least enough to help someone figure it out on their own. 

Now we have 2020, an election year and a public health crisis that nobody wants to believe because of the cognitive dissonance in the form of misinformation on the internet that is spreading like wildfire in the algorithms designed by social media. 

In the year 2000, my mother used to yell at me to stop playing video games and to get off the computer so she could make a phone call. It don’t work like that anymore and now I watch my mother scrolling her life away staring at her Facebook feed and melting her brain watching crime TV shows. 

WTF is wrong with everybody? Has everyone forgotten how to learn new things and do their own due diligence?

Why is everyone believing the lies on TV and the internet and why the fuck doesn’t anyone want to help anyone anymore?

The most common responses I get from friends and family members lately when I ask for assistance are:

• I don’t know how to help you...
• I’m busy...
• I don’t know what to say...
• I’m tired...

And then I get ignored. Well, my problems still exist and it’s been over 6 months since any of my friends or family members have spoken to me. 

Wake up you stupid mother fuckers! Your feed isn’t going to figure everything in your life out for you and your friends and family members (especially the introverts like me) are losing their minds and it’s trending.

I’m fortunate enough to have found a new joy for reading. Back in high school I hated language arts but I’ve discovered the true knowledge and inspiration you can find in a good book. 

You just have to realize that everything takes effort, some stuff is hard, nothing is given to anyone that doesn’t try. 

Stop wasting your god damn dopamine scrolling through your fucking phones all day making you tired watching other people do cool shit.

When someone asks for help, fucking help them or at least talk to them. 

I’m sorry for offending everyone, I’m just so fucking sick of being the smartest person in the room. 

It’s time for me to move on and surround myself with smarter people once again so that I can be happy but I’m fucking struggling and I’m stuck.

I’m not crazy, I’m just fed up with lazy, justifiable excuses for being so busy being busy that I get ignored by everyone.

I see what’s happening to you because I’ve done the fucking research. 

We all need help sometimes and most of the time, if we ask for help from someone that doesn’t understand how, what, or why...don’t ignore them.

I don’t know how to ask for help because I’m dealing with a completely new situation and I understand that you probably don’t either, it’s a pandemic. 

Calm down, it’s really bad, but ignoring someone you love and care about doesn’t show them that you really care. 

That’s why suicidal thoughts are on the rise...but just remember, I’m not the one that made the truth hurt. But I am the one that is being brutally honest. 

Nothing beats a good phone call, emotions are lost through text messages. 

I’m actually very happy writing this because I’m sick of watching people struggle like me and it’s time that people realize they can be fine just the way they are if they get the real attention they deserve.

Work hard, be nice, stay human. Unplug yourself from time to time so you can breath. It’s going to be ok, as long as you can wake up tomorrow and try to do better.

Get some sleep, it’s good for you. Being kind and helping someone else will really mean the world to us/them.

80,How to deal with cognitive dissonance and feeling like garbage basically all the time?,"So right now I'm dealing with 2 main issues:

1) Intrusive thoughts.

Doing normal stuff is like walking through a minefield. I could be doing my own stuff during class when from a conversation that's completely unrelated to me I pick up ""my mom's so annoying"". After hearing that my mind jumps to ""damn kids are really ungrateful for what their parents do for them"" which leads to ""you know there are some really shitty parents"" and then my mind just pulls up a ton of stuff about abusive parents, kids who don't know how to deal with their environment and have no one to help them, parents who care for their kids but get taken advantage of, basically every example of an unhealthy family. I could also just be letting my mind wander and then I hit a thought that starts that kind of reaction. This just makes me more stressed out as the day goes on because my mind keeps thinking about this kind of stuff and no amount of ""dude thinking about this isn't helpful"" makes it stop. 

On top of this I constantly have those intrusive thoughts where a random thought pops up and I get really disturbed by it, stuff like making really nasty assumptions about people or wanting me to do something really unsettling.

I also stress out about things that aren't my fault or I can't control, and my mind just goes haywire trying to find a solution to something that doesn't have one. I also feel really guilty when other people are upset and I'm not constantly doing something to help them, and either I burn myself out figuring out what else I can do and doing it or I marinate in my thoughts about the worst stuff they and others could be going through.

The main issue is that trying to deal with these thoughts (unsuccessfully) or getting through my day with this stuff running in the background is really stressful and burns me out, like it's hard to think and I'm not even comfortable in my own thoughts.

When I ask about this people usually say something along the lines of ""you're having these thoughts for a reason just acknowledge what they're for and move on"" or ""don't pay so much attention to them because then they just get stronger"". The issue with just not dealing with them is that they just stack up and after a bit if I'm stressed out so much stuff is going on I straight up can't think and have a massive headache. I also haven't found anything that clears up my thoughts noticeably. I've tried figuring out why I have these kinds of thoughts (protects myself from worse case scenarios) and saying ""thank you but"", shutting them down instantly, and trying to logic with them.

2) Feeling like garbage.

So I'm definitely a sensitive person, anxious, and I take criticism really personally, but on top of that I'm easily frustrated, annoyed, and stressed. Stuff like things people do that I don't personally like, tiny inconveniences, or that things aren't perfect in general just really bother. 

When I talk about this with people and mention that this stuff gets worse when I'm stressed (like yes, you are generally easier to get upset if you are stressed out already), they ask ""what things can you do to make yourself happy or calm?"" and then I die inside because I say ""rock climbing once a week and talking to someone who works until 10 because her teachers are dumbasses"". There were so many things that used to make me happy, like drawing, playing games, and doing stupid things in general, but now I feel like they're pointless and get more stressed when doing them. (In general I feel like my dopamine got nuked, because now even jacking off doesn't feel good aaanyways)

Additionally, people say that starting something is the hardest part. I can start things pretty well, the problem is with every little inconvenience or annoyance and with my mind always running in the background I get more and more stressed out until I decide it's not worth it. And then I stop and just marinate in my thoughts and I get more stressed out so it's a bit of a lose lose. I ask people ""what's the bad part about doing things you don't want to?"" and they say ""I want to do other things"" and I just get mind blown. Like, you guys don't feel like complete garbage, get uncomfortably warm and dizzy, and can't concentrate? Crazy.

&#x200B;

Well, this turned out way longer than I wanted it to be. 

So I guess I'm just asking if any of this is relatable, what did you do or change that helped with this kind of stuff? I've tried therapy, medication, exercise, socializing, working, and self love for months now.

82,Cognitive Abilities,"Is it possible that a two year period of depression and anxiety has wrecked my brain? I am currently a freshman in college and am really struggling to focus on any sort of work. I feel like my attention span is about 30 seconds and when I do manage to focus on something, I am nearly incapable of learning a concept and retaining it. My entire life I was known for being a very focused and academic person. I have always done exceptionally in school and in pretty much everything I as a result of my drive and dedication.

83,What am I dealing with exactly? (in regards to cognitive ability),"My cognitive abilities vary greatly, depending on my environment. When I'm in class, I can only (figuratively) describe it as the people around me siphoning out a chunk of the cognitive energy I have, making me not perform as well as I would if I were completely alone and in quiet, where I would have all my cognitive energy available to myself only. 

 It feels like in such an environment my thinking is effectively slowed and ""locked"" beyond a certain point, unable to reach the potential and clarity it can at home, alone. This applies to learning and doing work, where work quality suffers in class due to a limit on usable vocabulary and thought reliability. Retrieval of information from memory is more latent than if I were alone as well. 

Every noise can be distracting, ranging from talking and even the slightest of noises sometimes, which makes me use up more energy than I'd rather, to concentrate ""harder"".

Additionally, I can describe my brain as the polar opposite of a sponge in this case, anything but absorbent. 

This all varies greatly, akin to a rollercoaster ride, so my throughput is nowhere near balanced and constant. I have days where I feel as if I were perfectly sound, others where I know I'm ungrounded and all over the place. 

I might wanna mention, I had a period of pure hopelessness and absolutly no regard for the future, where I simultaneously felt like a one of a kind person/superman that doesn't experience harm from drugs like others would. A large part of what I did was MDMA, and that way too frequently. I knew all about harm reduction, just chose not to follow it because I believed I were to die soon anyway, so it's all my fault for not thinking straight.

The last time I dropped MDMA was in October 2020. A drug-themed bad acid trip ripped my eyes open and changed something in me, making me wean off the monoamine releasing drugs such as amphetamine and ecstasy. Big leaps have been made since then, but while I have emphatically grown and learned to greatly appreciate the things dearest to me, in some regards still feel like I am less of what I used to be.

87,Cognitive Dysmorphia and the use of recreational drugs?," 

What do you think about this?

In  short, that some people (including me) use recreational drugs and  supplements, solely because they feel like their cognitive functions are  only as they should be while on these substances, even tho they do not  suffer from cognitive illnesses or decline?

Like  I feel ""normal"" only when I take speed/adderall, even tho I decidedly  don't have ADHD, but I finally feel ""sharp"" again as I was in highschool  (I am 28m). On the other hand, even tho I have no symptoms of anxiety, I  only feel like I am truly relaxing when on benzos or something similar  and sleep properly just as a kid (you know, when nearly nothing can get  you up and you have those deep lucid dreams and wake up refreshed).

I  have tried for years other methods. Working out regularly, sleep  hygiene, a perfect diet, minor supplements... and you know what? I feel  great and healthy, happy and relaxed, but just not that sharp or that  relaxed/deep sleep, like on those marginally harder substances.

I  am also an amateur natural bodybuilder, and I realized that I have mild  body dysmoprhia. I.e. as soon as I get a bit of fat or my muscles start  to drop, I feel ""subhuman"", even tho I would never think that of  somebody else who looks worse than me! Thus, I came to the conclusion  that I also have this ""cognitive dysmorphia"" with false memories of how  ""sharp"" or ""relaxed"" I was as a teen or kid, making me to seek out these  drugs.

88,"23, M and my cognitive dissonance might not be real","Have you ever felt like you are in a movie where everything is predetermined like a scenario. I do. All the time.

Just to be clear, I know what delusions are and these may sound like one, but I'm trying to not dissociate from reality.

Last night was a disaster. I couldn't fall asleep for hours. I took melatonin 1mg and ultracod 500mg/30mg. When that did not help, I meditated. But nothing. Next, I took quetiapine 25mg hoping for the best. Still nothing. Last straw was one bottle of beer, and sleep finally found me. My mind was racing like I was taking an important exam that determined my future. I ran through my past - how I got here, my cringiest moments, thought about my friends and how some of them lied to me, how I lost friends, how I managed to dig a hole in my mind and jump into it, how I was a coward by not showing my true feelings to a girl that will move to Australia next year, how I was a fake all these years and *how the fuck* I still managed to have friends that care about me.

I am not the same person I was year and a half ago. Nothing seems real, not even this subreddit so I don't even know why I am writing this. It's just me and my infinite train of thoughts.

Of course, this is real. People are real. Their emotions are real. My emotions are real. Everything has consequences. I feel things. You feel things. They feel things.

Someone is talking to me. I might think it's me, but that does not seem right. My thoughts come and go, but I'm sure someone has placed them there. For example, last night I thought about how both my best friends - a girl and a boy - ditched me in a Valentines day party that was organized by my university. When they came back, both of them lied about their whereabouts. It was painful, but suddenly, in a instance, I was thinking about how sound travels from my ear to my brain. It was like turning a page in a book and moving from chapter one to chapter five.

I don't know, maybe I am not that special and you experience it too. But this is something that started just a year and a half ago. And from that day I started finding proof that I live in a simulation-like world. I started feeling more deja-vu's, I started feeling like I was sleeping even though I am fully awake. I started finding patterns in everyday life, everything started to make sense and make no sense at the same time. An opened book about neurons in our brain felt like the drawn neuron is trying to talk to me. My cellphone, which was put on silent, no vibration, felt like it was vibrating, even though it was on my table, not in my pocket. Watching 8 mile felt like eminem made it just for me to watch it. Music feels awesome and scary at the same time. When my thought pattern follows the beat, how it goes from louder to more quiet, from beat switches to fast raps it feels like it is written just for me. Friends talking about how we would not be able to be sure if this is a simulation if it was felt like this is a clue, that they now something I don't. Having thoughts about how silly all this sounds and everything is real felt that *someone needs* me to think about it.

The Truman's show syndrome. I have heard of it. This is where my cognitive dissonance comes in to play. I believe I have to find my own purpose in living and that I already have a purpose at the same time. I believe I am the only real human being, that all of you are just projections of my own sleeping mind and that all of you are real and I am the one sleeping at the same time. I get torn in half over and over again, because I keep finding proof for each one of those contradictory thoughts.

I just don't know how to face it.

89,"Sometimes we cannot let go of the past, there’s a term for it: Cognitive Immobility"," Sometimes we cannot let go of the past, there’s a term for it: Cognitive Immobility  
It bugs, it traps and doesn’t let us move on. How to break it…  
Can you recall instances when you felt as though you were physically present in a certain place but mentally somewhere else?  
This happens when emotional memory is more powerful and long lasting than semantic memory.  
The  mind then makes a conscious or unconscious effort to recreate past  incidents. The mind tries to retrieve what was missed or left behind.  
When  people move places due to work or other reasons, they physically move  to a new world, but their minds may be left behind – trapped in the  previous setting.  
Cognitive immobility often occurs in most of our  lives. This happens when you feel you don’t belong to a certain location  or place or situation and may last for days, months, or even years.  
Restrictions  and circumstances may necessitate their physical migration or  departure, but not their mental migration or departure.  
“When we are  emotionally connected to a place, person, or an incident, it might be  hard to adjust to a new life. This is because our minds are stuck in our  past and are unable to process those emotions.  
Do we want to become cognitively grown-up?   
The  awareness or separation begins when a person becomes aware of the  feeling of being stuck in the past, and the stress. When we move away  from our comfort zone, we realize our life changes forever. We realize  that it is no more the life that we lived in, and this can be quite  stressful.   
The retrieval stage starts once the loss associated with  separation from the ‘past’ has begun. This results in the continuous  reliving of past events, life experiences, or locations left behind.  
Remembering  past incidents, revisiting / recalling the same location, doing  something in connection to the past that have no sense to the person  in-present, or simply scrolling through pictures from the past will  prevent you from moving or thinking ahead, making it difficult to adjust  or accept the present scenario.  
When you accept your present-day  situation and try to make small yet meaningful changes to fit in, the  stabilization  / normalization stage takes effect. We are done.  
A  cognitively grown person does not participate in the continual  reconstruction of the past. He makes peace with the past. He increases  his focus on the present moment and decreases his maddening addiction  into the realm of illusion.”

97,Anxiety Therapy - Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy,"One of the best ways to help people treat and heal their mental condition, cognitive and behavioral anxiety therapy has its major focus on how you think. Anxiety is a mental condition and the ways to cure it is found inside your own head. It takes a lot to be willing to really look at yourself as well as your life in order to get started with accepting the changes that are ideal to heal your condition.

**Cognitive Therapy**

Cognitive [anxiety therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) has its major focus on how you think, and it is often seen that people’s thinking patterns tend to lead them to having anxiety attacks. Anxiety starts as a worry, which becomes excessive, leading to unexpected anxiety attacks. Cognitive anxiety therapy has a major role to play in helping you learn how to stop those thinking patterns. The whole idea of cognitive therapy is to change the way you think and enable yourself to break the old habits that lead you to excessive worrying. The techniques used in this therapy includes ways to help you slow down and evaluate your thoughts while also gaining control over it. Some of the techniques are talking slower, stopping negative thoughts from contaminating your mind and using a rational approach to tackle your feelings.

**Behavioral Therapy**

[Behavioral therapy for children](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) and adults is about taking everything you learned in cognitive therapy and applying it to your everyday life. You learn to react differently to others and to the number of situations you face without triggering any hint of anxiety attacks. You learn to act in a very conscious way during behavioral therapy, which means you start controlling your thoughts and feelings while also applying everything that you learned in cognitive therapy. Behavioral therapy is pretty much a challenge as well as a reward, because you tend to regain control over your own self.

**Emotional Therapy**

Cognitive and behavioral anxiety therapy lead you to emotional therapy, which is used to address a number of triggers, especially the ones that are related with stress and the feelings that you must have under control. Anxiety is often the result of stress and the need to control a string of emotions. It is important to learn to beat these two things in order to do well in treating and curing your anxiety. Emotional therapy is all about stress relief and getting you into a calm state of mind. The things you can do to make yourself feel better are yoga, meditation, exercise and a little peaceful time amidst nature.

The key to healing anxiety is inside your mind. Thanks to cognitive and behavioral therapy, you will definitely find it better to understand your condition while also being able to control it. You will learn to control your thoughts and feelings, that once had a strong hold on your life decisions.

I did so well in school, and even in grad school but when my last psych fucked up my meds (feel like I have brain damage from klonopin)... I went into a never-ending withdrawal state and/or a resultant depressive state I'm still recovering from 2 years later.

I feel like I haven't been able to learn or be enthusiastic about anything (other than learning about ways to try to heal myself faster- out of desperation). It's affecting my job and my outlook on life. I see young adults years younger than me zooming past and I'm 'only' 26...I feel like I've had dementia for 2 years now. The stimulants only help so much, they almost give me a false sense of feeling like I'm up to par but realistically I'm struggling to keep up and everyone can tell.

112,My mental illness is cognitive isolation and it predates this pandemic.,"I'm mildly infuriated by the sudden surge in discussion about mental health, not because I don't think people should talk about it more, but because it feels like it's only now become socially acceptable due to numbers, and not due to empathy. 

The population has effectively been subjected to an experiment which, in a way, emulates the entrapment of mental illness. The things people love, their networks of support, their access to things like recreation, routine, to life in general, have been cut off, and while the physical ability to enact those things remains, people cannot simply just 'do' them anymore. 

For years people have told me 'just do it'. For years, it's been near impossible to get them to appreciate that it's not a case of will or won't, or that I don't want to, it's that I CAN'T. 

I CAN'T because my depression has shut me in, away from my life. I CAN'T because my anxiety has enforced the confinement as a desperate condition of my own safety. I CAN'T because my ADHD has torn up my schedule and scattered my hours for work and recreation and sleep beyond the acceptable 9 to 5. I CAN'T because my PTSD has locked me out of my time and place, of space, of me, and how can I do anything when I CAN'T THINK beyond that dissociation? That separation from me? 

My mental illness is cognitive isolation and it predates this pandemic. 

I have been locked in my mind for lost days and counting. There is no perceivable end. I am waiting for a cure that may or may not one day be provided to me. I am uncertain. I am alone. 

This is not a sentence I have chosen. It is enforced by the chemicals governing my brain. I WANT but I cannot DO things. Do they understand now, the rest of them? They cannot go outside their houses and it hurts, doesn't it? And here we are, having watched and wanted the outdoors for so much longer, isolated all our lives. We have never been able to go outside our minds.

It shouldn't take a pandemic to force empathy. I wish I could say the increased discussion is going to change the stigma the mentally ill experience in everyday discourse, but I don't believe the popular memory will hold on to something like empathy. 'Just do it', 'get some fresh air', 'look what a beautiful day it is!'. Read the damn headlines. We WANT but we CAN'T. 

One day, governments will proclaim the outside accessable again. People will open their doors and they'll leave their houses. 

There is no door out of our heads. We can survive like this, sure, but if we didn't have to, why would we?

121,Severe Cognitive Dissonance,"My results on tests and exams throughout my primary school/high-school life are terrible, so I must be an idiot. Throughout high school (less so in primary school, because general oddness (thinking out loud a lot, intense and regular daydreaming, long periods where my mind would feel fuzzy and I couldn't think, absence epilepsy) made it seem like I was just a moron) my teachers said how bright I was and said how unexpected my results were. I'm not an idiot.

My mother (less so my dad, who's always believed in me and encouraged me to pursue a maths/science career) would regularly indirectly say what she thought about my intelligence (she believed I had a learning disorder) while I was at primary school (in high school she noticed my French results and decided it must have ""gone away""). She treated this with a in-school visits from a therapist of some sort, and tried to send me to [Rossbourne](http://www.rossbourne.vic.edu.au), which noticed I was intellectually normative during a trial period and rejected me (she responded by saying ""he's not that bad but he's not at *their* level either [where ""their"" refers to ordinary school students]. It's a shame their's so little space for kids who are ""in the middle"" like that"" and suggesting I repeat year 6). I know that she didn't really know what she was talking about, but I internalised her opinion nonetheless. I must be an idiot.

I'm currently following up on a passion for video game development by completing a programming degree at the AIE (http://www.aie.edu.au). The degree has entry requirements of a [VCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education) score of 20 (I had 23 iirc) in any maths and a 20 (I believe I had either a 21 or a 25) in english. These are very low. I must be an idiot.

During my interview I demonstrated a basic 2D game implemented in HTML5 canvas with a partial physics system; if I'd had the chance I would have demonstrated a home-made PHP blogging system/CMS that utilized my own home-built formatting language. I'm not an idiot.

I consistently get Distinctions (75%+) and High Distinctions (85%+) for ""essays"" (which don't follow essay format at all and are essentially practice papers) on topics such as complex lighting for games and comparisons between different software development methodologies. I'm not an idiot. Most of the class gets good marks and I suspect they're marked softly to balance out the way their academic nature compared to the highly creative work needed for other assignments (e.g. developing a rendering engine). Maybe I am an idiot.

I learnt about complex rotations and some basic calculus from [BetterExplained](https://betterexplained.com)) before my course started. I'm not an idiot. BetterExplained exists for people who don't ""get"" math or have issues learning from the school system. I'm an idiot.

I implemented a stack-based memory manager and a type-agnostic logger out of a textbook + SO over this year's summer holidays (Melbourne, Australia here). I'm not an idiot.

I also built an SSE-friendly maths library with quaternions (partly self taught) and matrix inversion (self taught). For a lot of complicated reasons, many of it's operations are broken and emit garbage or NaN results. I'm an idiot.

I have a knack for remembering the basics of lots of different things, and I can do arbitrary multiplications (up to three digits) in my head. I'm not an idiot.

My mother asks me whether I'm ""keeping up"" with the other students in my class whenever we're studying a maths topic. The last time we had a significant, multi-week maths class (last year; it was linear algebra + trigonometry and pythagoras' theorem) I understood everything and actually surpassed the class by researching the wedge product on my own, yet I failed the subject test (we have per-semester subjects, so it didn't affect the maths subject we do as part of physics simulation this year). I'm an idiot.

I'm currently revising the polygon-based rendering engine we built in our initial assignment this year to sample continuous scene information into a fixed-size voxel grid instead. I'm not an idiot.

My dad has said that I'm a highly divergent thinker and that my sister (excellent marks in everything) is highly convergent. Wikipedia tells me that these are basically swappable thinking modes and that convergent thought is strongly associated with cognition while divergent thought is associated with creativity; the implication is that divergent thinkers are less ""intelligent"" than convergent thinkers but more creative. I'm an idiot. 

I don't know where I am psychologically.

Currently on my first week of using a CPAP to treat 'severe' sleep apnea. 
Been on anti depressants for 5+ years

I've dealt with increasingly bad cognitive issues for over a year now, and I'm starting to feel as though there may be a bigger picture that myself and my doctor(s) are missing. 

Anxiety and depression have been an issue for a large majority of my life, but I'm struggling moreso with my day to day due to my lack of cognitive ability and random but severe speech impairments. 

I have issues with both short term and long term memory. I have problems remembering peoples names I've known for 15+ years at times. I frequently am unable to recall or break up my days in any sensible manner so every day feels as one big conglomeration. 

Remembering the day of the week is near impossible, and the month and year escape me quite often as well. 

The biggest hurdle and one that has hindered my ability to obtain and maintain meaningful work is that even the most menial tasks are near impossible for me to hold onto day to day. I can be taught a very simple process, and even if I do it 15 times that day I'll be completely wiped clean the next day. I'd say it takes me 5x as long to retain process and specifics relating to a work environment than it should. 

In regards to the aforementioned speech impairments, I am seemingly randomly hit by incredible confusion during conversations where I either quite literally cannot get the words to reach my tongue or I am just unable to name even the most mundane things. If I am able to think of what I want to say I sometimes cover this lapse in speech by saying the completely wrong thing in hopes that the person I'm talking to corrects me. (Bus instead of truck, cat instead of dog) If this happens and the person corrects me I'm suddenly able to connect the dots from my brain to my tongue and can say the word completely fine. 

I apologize for the literal novel, I could go on and on and on but what I'm really looking for is some guidance. I've been seeing my GP as well as my psychologist for a year now and I haven't seen any notable improvement whatsoever. I've been bounced around on 15 different medications and I'm incredibly frustrated to say the least. 

In short, I need help. I have no idea where to go from here or how to proceed. What tests to ask for or what I should be trying to find out myself.  

If this is not in a suitable sub, I am happy to post it where it should be. I'm quite a new poster in regards to reddit (just a lurker really) so if a mod can PM me a better route than this I'd appreciate it!

130,Why cognitive behavioral therapy was dangerous for me,"When I went into therapy in my early to mid 20's, I was having a lot of problems.  Looking back, I was dealing with unrecognized and untreated childhood abuse.  However due to the heavy gaslighting component within my family, as well as their ability to appear wonderful in front of others, I was not myself aware of this at the time.  I had a vague sense I didn't really like my mother, but overall it just seemed like I was anxious and moody and felt randomly afraid out of nowhere.  I now recognize that much of these were actually flashbacks or similar states.

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.  No screening for abuse was done beyond a very basic asking ""were you abused"", nor was any serious attempt at asking about my past ever done.  Rather, every therapist I saw wanted to do CBT.  I agreed because I thought it might help, but quickly became uncomfortable and distressed by trying to identify distortions.  None of the therapists I saw seemed to understand this, and they saw my discomfort as a sign that they were on the right track and just needed to push a little harder.  When I eventually dropped out of therapy it was met with confusion and statements that we were ""finally getting somewhere"", while I felt increasingly distressed and like the therapists hadn't been really *listening* to anything I said.  (This experience persisted over about a half-dozen different therapists.)

What I realize now is that CBT relies on the therapist being able to correctly recognize distorted thinking.  This can be dangerous when neither therapist nor client recognize covert abuse.  What ended up happening was that the focus on my cognitive distortions recreated and reinforced the gaslighting - the idea I had been told all my life that I had a good, kind, loving family and was lucky to have them, and that my distress at my mother's behavior meant something was wrong with me.  When I did start to bring up issues with my mother, I was guided away from focusing too much on them, as they were seen as further manifestations of my anxiety.

At this point I'm incredibly frustrated.  I feel like I wasted years of my life on therapy that was ultimately incredibly harmful.  I was only able to begin recovery when I quit therapy.  I know many people who have benefited from therapy, and I by no means think that it's useless or worthless.  But I don't understand how so many different supposed experts could miss such an issue and ultimately end up reinforcing the idea that I was at fault for feeling bad about abuse.",1565123017.0,False,2,2,WarKittyKat,None,cmvpce,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cmvpce/why_cognitive_behavioral_therapy_was_dangerous/
131,Depression and cognitive impairment,"I've read a lot about depressionand it's affects on emotion but when I saw a link about cognitive impairment, it all made so much more sense. I suffer massively with issues with ability to concentrate, listen and understand when being told things, inability to read and take in the information and then remember it. 

All these symptoms were never looked at before because I could never explain them to my phycologist properly. I've always felt like the phycologist was going down the wrong path for treatment as he was always trying to get me to remember my childhood, but this has had 0% effect because my depression isn't down to emotional issues.

132,"Memory, cognitive ""glitches"" and brain fog a result of medications? TW: suicide, mental health","Hi! 

Over the past three years, I've been slowly suffering from peculiar forgetfulness and confusion that I didn't have previously. I'm worried it's a result of being on so many medications but I can't be sure. While it's nothing 'severe', it is concerning me , and making me feel out of tune with myself

There are of some reports of medications causing some degree of cognitive impairment, but there isn't enough data for me to be certain. **I want to understand if what's happening to me is a result of the meds, mild dissociation, or a result of trauma.**

**For context:** I am a 22 yr F, with ADHD, depression, and anxiety (Bipolar II is also a possibility).  I was diagnosed at 16 after depressive and suicidal episodes. I took Prozac till I was 18. I've been in therapy and psychiatry for the past seven years.  I work in neuroscience research, so these topics are of both personal and academic interest. 

I have been on **cymbalta, concerta and lamictal** since 2017 and just started taking low dose of **aripiprazole** a few weeks ago. 

 I've always had a very good memory and despite being a little aloof and disconnected in social situations, I've always felt ""in sync"" with myself.  After a bad suicide attempt in June 2017, I was immediately put on Cymbalta. Once school started again, I started noticing that I was forgetting appointments and classes - something which never happened in the past. It didn't even feel like I was forgetting, it felt like something was removing or blocking info for me. I'd sit for a minute thinking ""do I have anything at 4 today? hmmm. no. no I don't""  then later that day realize I had a class - a class I have every week, at 4.  In November 2017, I was hospitalized at a psych ward for some panic attacks and had some fairly ""memorable"" experiences there that might have been mildly traumatic but again - i am unsure. After the hospital, I was put on Lamictal. A few months later concerta. I was in a lot of pain that year so I don't think i prioritized my memory glitches. plus a part of me was worried that it the glitches were result of doing a few edibles (3-5) that summer (2017) since a lot of my friends who smoked weed every day also had 'glitchiness' but my psychiatrist told me it was most likely not the case (thank god). **This mild 'brain fog' continued for a bit but then got a little more noticeable last summer (2020).** 

&#x200B;

\- Feb 2021, got covid. DEFINETLY experienced brain fog. constantly doing something then forgetting why i was doing it. Also possibly because started working, tasks at work might have been confusing me. 

\-April 2021 - started taking abilify in the morning and gabapentin for sleep

\-May 2021 its just been worse. that's it. so many glitches. maybe vaccine is affecting me, maybe its just  lack of sleep . no clue. 

\----

It feels similar to my grandpa's dementia, my friends dissociative experiences, and almost resembles aspects of my friends that have done too many drugs. especially the ones who took too much adderall as a kid when they didnt have adhd. they just seem a little fried. But yes... that's what i feel and act like at times. 

If my memory use to be a fluid pool or ocean, its not a pool with certain memories out in boxes that I cant see or access unless someone opens them. 

&#x200B;

Anyone feel this way? 

**Examples:**

\- confusing appointment times despite them being written down

\- forgetting what i was about to do

\-literally hovering over elevtor up down buttons unable to press either for a moment

137,"24 years old, cognitive decline and memory loss","Hey guys. This is a throwaway account, for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

When I was 16 years old I started smoking cannabis and experimenting with a few other drugs. I was fine until I started using synthetic cannabis at 18. I experienced really strange psychological effects and changes in my thoughts. It improved a few months after stopping, but I still didn't feel right. I started noticing memory issues; when falling asleep, I would have problems holding thoughts in my head. I would sometimes literally forget things instantly. Thoughts would suddenly dissapear and I wouldn't be able to remember what I was thinking about just a second or two ago. My memory is always at its worst when I'm sleepy, especially right before falling asleep. 

&#x200B;

I also started noticing warning signs of schizophrenia. I would have disturbing dreams, hear loud noises while falling asleep, felt a pressure in my head, hearing voices (not audible, but as if I was imagining someone saying strange things) while awake, and often I had moments when my mind felt like it was on the verge of breaking). Over time the schizophrenic symptoms have gone away, but not the memory problems. I can't rememeber what I've done the day before unless I stop and think for a little while. Memories from two days before are even worse. 

&#x200B;

I have cognitive problems and can't maintain thoughts in my head very well. For example, if I'm trying to do a maths problem with different steps, as soon as I move on to the next few steps I forget what I was doing just before and have to keep repeating to myself verbally what I'm doing. I can read a paragraph and retain barely any of it. I have to read slowly and concentrate on the words. My brain is just very slow in general.

&#x200B;

Lately, my dreams have become strange and detached and reflect my waking state of mind. They used to be so beautiful and vivid. My mind in general is duller. I'm mildly depressed. I should mention that I sometimes smoked weed through aliminium cans. I've heard that can cause problems later on.

138,"Is there an analogue for ""cognitive dysmorphic disorder"" on the lines of ""Body dysmorphic disorder ""?","I.e. personally, I am not diagnosed with ADHD or depression, but I only feel like ""the way a normal human should feel"", when I take small doses of Adderall. Not a big dose to get a amphetamine high, but just a small dose, to help me be in the moment. 

Similarly, I sometimes take benzos, even tho I do not suffer from anxiety, but I have a perceived notion that a ""normal human being's"" state of relaxation is that of me on benzos, and I feel like there is something wrong with me for not being able to reach that state on my own, being that state of focus on adderall or that state of relaxation on benzos. 

Do I have a ill-perceived notion of how a healthy human should be like? I mean, I don't feel it possible to be focused in this age of information and fast-pace and all the obligations I have day to day, from managing my finances, my job, my family, my friendships, my obligations around the house, my health and my hobbies, thus I feel inadequate and think that there is something wrong with me, because I see a lot of other people managing all that just fine, and I can manage it also just fine, or better, with adderall and benzos. 

However, is there something wrong with me? Am I supposed to be able to deal with all that on my own? I've read a thousand self-help books, I meditate and work-out daily, practice sleep hygiene and track everything I eat for a healthy, balanced diet, practice time-management, prioritize etc... But all of that makes me feel empty and tired, until I use adderall or benzos. Yet without all of that, I feel like I am wasting my life. And just to make it clear, I also do my hobbies diligently and enjoy them a lot.. It's not like I have given my life to being a drone... It just feels that I can only be a functioning human in the capitalist 21st century with a little help from these substances. 

But maybe I am just misspercieving how a human should feel about that? Maybe it's ok to not always be sharp and focused. Maybe it's ok to be empty and tired after all of that? Maybe it's ok not to be fully relaxed with all those obligations even if one is doing them diligently. Maybe it's ok to not be full by living a full life.

I am going to be 21 this upcoming September, and it dawned on me this year that for a large part of my life (since i was 11), i have been relying solely on my interpersonal relationships for a sense of self, and when they leave i am destroyed and i ""lose my mind"".

141,I tried doing cognitive behavioral therapy on myself and I can't seem to find my core belief," 

So, what’s the problem?

I have low self esteem.

So what if you have it, what negative impacts does it have in your life?

It makes me depressed, anxious about the future and my relationships bad. I seem to seek approval and love from others. I get easily disappointed when my actions aren’t accepted with eager participation. I always seek the thumbs up and a smile whenever I say something. And during conversation with people, I want to be understood. I try to shift the conversation to make it more about me, about my feelings

Why do you think doing so is bad? Why do you think seeking affection from others is bad?

Because it is a sign of weakness and unattractiveness. People don’t like needy, self conscious, unconfident and overly sensitive people. I am afraid they will find out that I am unlovable, the type of person that they hate.

What would happen if they find out?

They would talk bad about me and see and treat me as someone worthless. They’d try to use me, if they found out I have low self confidence. They will hurt me.

I will update as soon i got new insights and im open for science backed answers that can extend the list. Feel free to contribute and enjoy life.
Point 1 is freshly discovered, maybe it gets extended soon

side note: most mentioned methods also improve autophagy , cleaning your cells from trash


1. Nutrition:

Do's=
- Eat some Olive oil or/and Nuts , prevents high insulin
- use the intermidity diet. 16 hours not eating / 8 hours eating- will keep your brain running and insuline low!
- eat egg yolks and curcumin (turmeric) , they increase neuroplasticity 
- omega-3 fats (fish) intake, as well as l-theanine (tea)
- vape nicotin inside an e-cigarette  , isolated nicotine helps boosting memory and learning whilst having harmful ingredients in normal cigarettes

Don'ts=
- Dont use preperates to cover brain or health needs! some of them are unhealthy cause they provide to much of a normaly healthy ingredient making you sick at the end
- Dont eat high carbs! Things in your brain cant work nicely when the body produces to much insulin caused from carbs
- dont drink cow milk, it blocks folate receptors and decreases methylation, which are improving your neuronal build (neurogenesis) , Goat’s and sheep’s milk products are usually fine—unless you have an autoimmune disease.


2. Daily Routines

- breath trough your nose : The benefits of nasal breathing are associated with how this breathing purifies, heats, moistens, and pressurizes the air. These changes to the air increase oxygen absorption by approximately 10-15%.

- You all may know it : Meditation. A daily session of meditation , even in doses of 5-10 minutes per day can improve mood, destress, helps fokus

-- Phone tools=
- Mesmerize - with visual , audio and breath stimulation
- Brain.fm - i prefer those sounds as they are binaural, bringing your head in a synchronized state with the selected mindset

- Cold Showers : It releases anti-depressants and is an stress trainer. so its a good prevention if you seem to have a lot stress. i recommend to start cold and change it to warm later.

- Brain training - also classical advice and a hot science topic as some scientists beliefe you just get better in the tasks , my opinion is if the brain gains neuronal connections , its a very good choice/thing. the average brain starts to slowly reduce unused parts at an age of 25!
-- Phone tools= 
- Neuronation
- Brain Wars
- Nonogram King
- Sudoku4two
- Futoshiki
- Hex2048
- Loop: Energy
- I Love Hue too

- Sleep - sleep is used to store information in your long term memory, dont lose it! study shows that uncovered sleep can be restored in the next 2 days

- Exercise physically - a healthy body keeps your mind running. dont try to overuse alcohol (healthy amount: 0,5 l each day on 5 days a week) and keep distance from drugs even if you think they provide you a brighter sight of how things are, they change your neuronal connections
-- 10 minutes a day running will help to release neuronal builders and strengthen your allready existing neurons

- Games - yes even games can help you, especially action games cause they fasten your cognitivity

- Plan your work : we are most productive in little time frames, this covers also learning. Dont multitask, if you excluded all unnecessary distractions, you can enter the highly effective flow state. motivate yourself when imagining why you do something. Theres no reason to think ""i cant"" , instead think ""i dont"". failure is the key to sucess , learn from it
-- there are many proven methods to take care of the little time frames, here are two examples =
- 25 minute , followed by 2 minute break , repeat 3 to 4 times until you choose a larger break of around 15 minutes
- 90 minutes , followed by a 10-15 minute break
this also helps when doing things you dont like or if you are procrastinating - brain sends a pain reaction 20 minutes of time , if you overcome that period you will teach yourself its not that bad
surprisingly the same time span (20 minutes) is needed to decrease your focus, breaks will help you getting new information processed

- Use your subconsciousness : Things become sticky when you repeatly hear or see them. Try to take a look on motivational short notices over the day

Also, I cannot think about things and analyze them in my head the way i used to do it months ago, I struggle to even keep the conversations in my head going and it doesn't feel intuitive and smooth anymore.

I have been like this for a period of 7months now, but this is affecting me in a way that I have began losing fate in myself and I struggle with my confidence now. I am starting to get into the unconscious habit of comparing myself to people who are better than me and this is crushing me even more, I am beginning to feel anxiety every time I want to do something now.

The reason I've felt my left ear doesn't work as well is that I can't understand what people say if I'm only hearing them on my left side, or if I'm trying to use earbuds and they're in my left ear. 
I was reading some information my doctor gave me about migraine disorders, because I've had more frequent and more severe migraines lately, and I came across the term ""central auditory processing disorder"" for the first time.

I've learned to work around the issue, so I'm not too worried about it, but I am very curious and I'd like to know what it might be.

158,Is my deficit in certain cognitive skills normal?,"Sorry for the long post, I'll TL;DR this shit.
I'm an 18 year old male who's been having some difficulty with certain cognitive skills. This isn't recent at all, its been going on my entire life. However, after an incident two days ago at my work place I've decided I should probably seek some help, even if its just on Reddit. What happened wasn't extraordinarily abnormal for me, it was just the ""last straw"" I guess.

In a nutshell; I work as a server. A couple things happened at work. For instance, I quite literally forgot I had a table (it wasn't even busy, I had nothing else to do). When I went to take the trash out I took it out and brought the can back in...with the trash still inside of it. There are many other examples of this sort of thing that happened just in that day.

Today I went to a webpage (http://www.cogread.com/cognitive-skills-defined.html) and read up on some of the cognitive skills defined there. Here's what I've noticed out of the sections they've defined. (Check out the link for the examples provided)
Attention- Everything here is accurate.
Memory Skills- Almost everything is accurate.     
Processing Speed- Totally fine.
Auditory Processing- Totally fine     
Visual and Spatial Processing- Mostly fine, aside from my TERRIBLE directional sense.    
Executive functions- I'm really really good here.

To shorten this up a bit, I have difficulty paying attention doing day to day tasks, I rarely seem to form memories of events, and I have TERRIBLE directional skills. I was also an oxygen-starved premie at birth who they said might be retarded. 

I know its normal to have deficits, but honestly mine feel absolutely god-awful. Is it normal or should I talk to a professional?
TL;DR: I was an oxygen-starved premie who they said might be retarded, I'm fine overall in school, but I have extreme lapses of attention, get lost easily, and have difficulty forming or recalling memories of events.

165,I've been diagnosed with a cognitive dysfunction and its been a blow,"Hi everyone

I'm posting from a throwaway because this is honestly a humiliating problem for me.

So for most of my life, i've struggled with depression and Anxiety. They've been with me for as long as I can remember and i've learned that how to deal and manage with them.

A few years back, I developed an issue with talking and speaking. I would frequently forget words, stutter, or most egregiously, call people by another persons name. This problem cleared up after a small shift in my medication, and i still sometimes trip up over words but its not as bad as it was.

Two to Three months ago, I developed a difficulty comprehending things I was reading. It started with rules text in games I play, but eventually reached the point my partner (who is long distance and communicates mostly through text chats like discord) said to me that she felt i was not properly paying attention to her messages and misunderstanding.

I went to my psych 2 days ago, and they diagnosed me with a cognitive dysfunction affecting my reading comprehension. It makes sense with my struggles over the past few months. The best way to say it is my mind seems to remove or add words at random to the text im reading.

This is humiliating and very upsetting for me. My hobbies, board gaming and card gaming, my job, media based, and relationships are all text focused. I also worry about my condition deteriorating and my understanding getting weaker. Recently i played a new board-game with a close friend and had to read a segment of the rules out loud multiple times before i could grasp it.

I fear losing my ability to read entirely. I recognize part of this is because of my paranoia that i've got, but im afraid of losing my cognitive abilities. I dont know, i am beginning to ramble.

I've started a treatment of Concerta today, and im hoping it helps me grasp the things im reading better.

I just wanted this off my chest

166,Suffering from cognitive dysfunction as a result of lifetime of mental illness.,"Not sure why I'm reaching out and not sure how much I want to share. I'm sort of a private person. But not all by choice. My mental illness has made me that way as well as carved out a lot of other aspects of my personality that I regret. See I've suffered from depression since I was about 13. I was later diagnosed with bipolar when I was 15 after my first manic episode in which I had delusions of grandeur as well as paranoid thoughts. I basically thought I was psychic and that cameras were watching me everywhere \(and that my dad was controlling me through some kind of biotechnology\). 

Anyway, I'm not trying to prove to you how crazy I am \(it actually gets worse\). My main focus is that over the years of suffering with mental illness \(I'm now 30\) I've become very conscious to a lot of cognitive defects. These include lack of psycho\-social skills \(not to mention bad social anxiety\), lack of comprehension, trouble with memory, bad with direction \(I get lost very easily\), poor mechanical skills, \(the list goes on\). 

I don't want to spend the whole time blabbering and crying about this. Just know that it's bad. I also still suffer from depression from time to time \(a lot of the time actually\) and like I said my social anxiety is terrible. I'm just wanting to know if there's other people who have been in the same boat as me. I know that years of mental illness has caused my cognitive difficulties. In fact there are studies that attest that anxiety and depression over a certain period of time can cause brain damage. As well, my illness has grooved this pattern of anxiety and depression for me keeping me in a loop. Is there anybody who has experienced this and came out of it? Like do you feel you've gained what you have lost cognitively \(or even spiritually, emotionally, what have you\) from mental illness? Was there significant healing? I'm actually doing decent compared to other times but I feel there is still a long ways to go and if I don't change certain things about myself I'm bound to stay in this cycle of depression and anxiety. Is there anything that has helped any of you out there in my same condition? Please share.

Just to add I've tried lots of things and continue to try them. These include diet, exercise, meditation, yoga, journaling, creating \(I play music\), therapy, and medication. I try and get out and be around my friends but my mental illness is always peeking its head. One of the new things I'm trying is reaching out to people like here. Also I'm going to attend a meet up for people who suffer from all types of mental problems and stress. However, if there are any stories anybody would like to share that would be great.

167,My Experience of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: is it Normal?,"EDIT: Should probably add I'm in the UK.

I started (and ended) CBT some months ago. I was only allotted a block of 3 hours in total, split into 30 minute sessions.
I don't think either of these limits were helpful, as they added pressure and anxiety to the whole situation.

The therapist did a lot to let me take the lead and decide on my own treatment, and while I appreciated that, I was only there because I didn't know what to do. While I don't think he should have just dragged me where he thought was best, I would have appreciated a guiding hand (or at least a couple of fingers).

In particular, when asked to define what I considered to be my main problem, I simply spewed out every issue I could think of.
Depression, anxiety, insecurity, social ineptitude, low self-esteem and probably several things more. I didn't know, nor did I receive any indication, if this was a an appropriate problem-scope for only 3 hours of therapy. In hindsight, I can say with confidence that it was too much and too broad, and could well have been better had I been more specific.

In general, in fact, I found myself rambling a lot, I tried to make notes to help me but it was difficult to plan what to talk about before sessions.

The therapist gave me exercises to do, mostly written exercises and recording my thoughts and behaviours. I think a lot of these were good and some of them really helped (others didn't more on that shortly). What I thought less of was the stream of published self-help material that came my way. I tried that sort of thing before coming to therapy and it didn't do much, I got a therapist because I felt that doing things by myself wasn't helping.

The plurality (possibly even majority) of the 3 hours was given over to anxiety, and I saw a reasonable improvement in that area.
It was the anxiety related exercises that worked the best because we had time to practise them together and iterate (analyse my work and point out ways to improve in subsequent sessions). I think having more 1-1 time in general would have helped.

Being honest, though, I feel I could have tried harder with the exercises that we didn't have time to go through together (mostly focused on depression, low self-esteem and other delightful members of that family). I felt a little out of my depth, but I could have kept them up for longer even without feedback. I feel it is likely that I went to therapy for someone to talk to, rather than the exercises.

I feel I've focused a lot on the negative here, so I should also say that I feel it was helpful overall, especially with anxiety and that I do not regret going. I want to know, though, if these are typical experiences and if I can find better ones... or at least, a paradigm that suits me better.

Thanks if you got this far :)

Is there anyone here with a similar experience?","I had a pretty abusive childhood, never felt connected to my family at all, maybe i'm autistic as well (a doctor said that, but my mom made that all about herself and didn't get me tested), i was bullied in high school and have religious trauma, so a lot of sh.t happened to me before that. I disappointed in a certain community in 2012, and after that i got harassed, that was the last straw. One day in 2012 when i woke up i felt that something is missing, something is gone forever. It's clearly not simple depression, i've battled with that before, it was... something ELSE. I finished my school, i'm in a happy relationship, i have friends who i love, but even in my best days i'm dead inside and feel nothing. 2012 is just like yesterday, every year after that is like the same year, just repeating with different scenarios.

175,"Cognitive struggles, Can't process information at normal speed+I can't focus too much","It has always frustrated me to say the least. But just recently it struck me that it can be actually a real problem in my day to day life.

The other day I just played a new card game named The Wizard. Very fun and not at all that complex. But its system was new to me. My friend explained to me and another 2 people the basic rules before we started. And I tried my best to concentrate on them. But later on I still found myself struggling to remember the logic behind it, what I was supposed to do. I was feeling real slow and kept putting questions throughtout the game. My friends that were also new to this game grasped the dynamic of the game a lot faster and didn't seem as confused as I was. 

Eventually I got it. But I wad embarrassed by my slowness. This thing is happening to me in a lot of daily activities. I can't even enjoy the experience of a new video game with my peers without feeling like a total noob and helpless. I just feel like too many things are happening on the display and I can't grasp it all. This usually takes me a bit until I get used to it. 

But it frustrates me. I feel like an old person. Thinking slow, processing slow. It's affecting tremendously both my social and profesional lives. Not to mention my self-esteem.

Is it a disorder? An impairment of some kind? Am I just slow and stupid? Is it fixable?

177,"I had a horrible dream last night regarding hoarding, attraction, and cognitive entrapment","Back story: three years ago I suffered a horrible mental breakdown. Two years ago I tried to kill myself. I was stuck and felt no chance of escape. 

My dream took me on several journeys back in time. First the helpless feeling of my parents telling me at 15 that I am too young to ""play around with kitchen tools"" (I was going to cook my own meal) and instead eat fast food like them.

Second, was the helpless feeling of looking at a time schedule on the wall of when to work and seeing all my hours dictated randomly (fast food job). The sensation was not even correctly processing, instead I just obeyed. My life existed only for the company.

Third, was the helpless feeling of being stuck in a major with a group-like thought 100% the opposite to my personality. They were heavy consumers with the high likelihood of hoarding. I felt like I was being ripped alive, especially when I tried to gain insight on their thinking style.

How exactly are these things related to hoarding? Well the environment was so cognitively interconnected with my choices that its negative influence felt like a natural part of my personality. It made unattractive choices and decisions attractive.

Let me repeat that again: it made unattractive choices attractive. 

This, to me, was and still is extremely problematic.  How much influence has the environment shaped my cognitive decision making abilities? 

For example, I thought anything for a time was better than being stuck in my parents' hoarding home: military front lines, jail, death, any job. But the more I psychoanalyzed my parents' behavior, the more red flags I see in other people's behavior. Like huge, avoid this person, red flags. I find it, for example, extremely difficult to talk to business people that are in sales, marketing, accounting, finance as I get extremely triggered. 

My college major was in the business school due to helpless attraction (before realizing the red flags).

I am still technically living in the hoarding home but I am burning some savings at AirBNBs to deprogram some of the helpless behavior if that makes sense.

However this is not sustainable forever (limited funds). What are some jobs/careers that are anti-hoarding in the direct or indirect sense? For example I cannot see myself doing fast food work ever again. Polluting is a sister to hoarding and we have a large enough debt already to mother nature (which no balance sheet really ever tends to show).  

I already feel so old (26) and that most of my life has disappeared. What are your thoughts and suggestions? I have no college degree and I have been out of work for over two years.

He has perpetrated a sexual offence, yet I seem to be transferring all of my rage to my sister, whom I don’t have a great relationship with due to significant and harmful lies in the past.  I can sit on the outside and know this is some kind of transfer, I just don’t seem to be able to rationalise this.

179,"Is depression associated with irrational thinking and cognitive distortions like anxiety is? Not just losing interest, but saddened by things I enjoy?","I have a long history with anxiety and panic disorder. It’s primarily fueled by health anxiety. Generally, cognitive distortions fuel anxiety, whether or not it has anything to do with help.

Recently, I have been in a severe depressive state. It was rather sudden. I’ve had depressive symptoms before, but this is the first time it’s felt like an extended episode. Difficulty getting out of bed, spending many days mostly in bed, loss of appetite and weight loss, loss of interest, and just feeling painfully sorrowful all the time.

What is weird, and sometimes these depressive symptoms are anchored around worries. Worries about things I care about, to keep it short. I’m having difficulty wondering if I am assessing these things rationally, and wondering if irrational cognitive distortions are common in depression?

Another symptom I am having that is scaring me a lot is associating things that I love and that warmed my heart with sadness. When I was dealing with anxiety, I used to enjoy looking at old photos and videos. Now, they make me sad. When my son engages in certain cute, heartwarming heartwarming, innocent activities, there’s a certain sadness to it as well. I walked past a box for one of his really cute toys, and instead of warm, like normal, I felt sad. Other things just give me a sinking feeling in my stomach when they used to make me happy. Is this normal?

This is long enough, but in many ways, I feel myself changing. I feel like my value system is severely warped. I don’t recognize myself as a person. Is this normal for a depressive episode? And then hopefully fleeting?

 - They're not *always* like that, you're just making it out to be black and white.

 - You can't read their mind, so you can't know that they have negative motivations.

 - You're saying they ""should"" do this or that, and that's setting yourself up for failure because you can't control other people.

I googled how I’m feeling, which is really bad for someone with health anxiety, and now stuff like Mild Cognitive Impairment can’t leave my mind, and now I’m super anxious. 

I’m looking for reassurance or something, idk I just feel really anxious.

Background info: I’m a male and 15, with no previous health issues that I know about, but I really worry about my health a lot, and that makes me think I have many things, and I go to the doctor or want to go to the doctor for little things.

I’ve recently felt like I’ve been forgetting things, it’s made me worried and I don’t know why I’m worrying, but still. I recently met with some old friends that I used to see usually every month or every few months, but the last time I saw one of the friends was maybe a year ago or some months ago, and I just couldn’t remember his name. I was busy during this event where he fitness cane so I never had a chance to talk to him, but after everyone left I remembered him and I just couldn’t remember his name. I remembered his little brothers name, but when I tried to remember his name, all I could think of was another friend’s name which was almost similar. For context, the person who’s name I was trying to remember was Rohan and my friend’s was Rohail, and it just really agitated me that I couldn’t remember, so I searched up named that start with Ro and when I saw it online I remembered it. 

I’ve also felt like I’ve been forgetting words, for example I was talking with my friend about a celebrity and he said homosexual instead of homophobic, and I tried to correct him but I just couldn’t think of the term homophobic, I was thinking that it was homophist for a second because we were recently talking about the word cancerist (probably not a real word btw, we saw something online of someone discriminating against people with cancer and made that up— unless that’s a real thing) 

I also meant to say encourage, but I couldn’t really think of the word and I said incentivize instead until I searched up synonyms for incentivize and remembered encouraged. 

Then, I was trying to search up is something was accurate, but I couldn’t think of the word accurate and I just put correct instead until the first page suggested used the word accurate.

I know these may sound silly, but I just feel like I’m forgetting things I should know like the word encouraged or accurate, and it doesn’t help that I’ve been googling what I’ve been feeling and I’ve seen stuff about Mild Cognitive Impairment and stuff like that :( 

I just really need reassurance, I feel like I’m forgetting easy things—things I should remember.

I am a Computer Science Graduate student at Georgia Tech. As part of my coursework project, I am conducting a survey that explores the implementation of **Emotion-Aware Mental Health Wellness chatbots.** In this study, I aim to design a prototype of a mental health chatbot that integrates principles of Cognitive Representation Understanding of Mind (CRUM), and emotional intelligence to offer empathetic and supportive interactions.  
My goal is to understand how incorporating CRUM principles can enhance the emotional intelligence of mental health chatbots, allowing them to better understand users' cognitive states, emotional needs, and conversational context. By fostering personalized and effective interventions, I aim to improve the overall user experience of interacting with mental health chatbots.  
Please provide your feedback based on your personal experience with a mental health chatbot and expectations for its functionality, I offer the following feedback and insights.  
Based on the feedback received, I will proceed with the development of the prototype. Your input is invaluable in guiding the design and functionality of the chatbot, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs of users.

214,"Got brain fog randomly during antibiotic treatment for infection. Literally, no cognitive issues in my life up until right now.","Will try to concise this as much as possible.

Started with food poisoning, first few days, I had nausea and chills, they subsided. About a week after I had a numbing left abdominal pain that would hurt if I sat for a long time and light-headedness. Ended up in urgent care and was given antibiotics (metronidazole) and had gotten papers for a stool test. Finished first round of antibiotics and then got the stool test back and it said I was h.pylori positive. Was given the ""gold-standard"" triple therapy of two antibiotics, a PPI(omeprazole) and Pepto. Everything seemed fine until 7 days into the treatment, brain fog hits me out of nowhere. The cognitive dissociation, the lack of focus, blurred vision etc. Had to drive back up to my parent's house and have been here since because mood swings have been hysterical. Up until now, never had any sort of mental issues whatsoever. 

Its been 3 weeks since then and the fog is still here. Of course, I've researched the crap out it and have cut out all of the foods that supposedly make the fog worse. Eating clean and been taking all the supplements (i.e fish oil, turmeric, manuka honey, mastic gum for the infection, multi-vitamin and probiotic) meditation, light exercise and all that jazz. Had gotten blood work done from my gastro doc and my general care doc. Saw a neurologist and a neuropsych. Apparently, have high bilirubin levels in my liver. Waiting to get results from the MRI and Neuropsych. 

Some days it's better, other days it's terrible. No existing signs of depression or severe anxiety. Anybody you talk to can talk about how extroverted, bubbly, and outgoing I am. My job situation is fantastic. Recently had a break-up but honestly felt like I was handling it pretty well and was very vocal about my feelings with friends and family. 

This ""fog"" is just a complete contrast of who I am. I'm depressed and moody NOW because of the fog, had mild ADHD but I feel like its just become so bad. Seriously, what gives and where did this come from? I've heard about antibiotic use causing Candida, I remember having the most absurd sugar craving one day during the treatment and bought candy. Could that have contributed?

TL;DR 

Took triple therapy for h.pylori, got brain fog 7 days in with no previous sign of mental problems. Been watching my diet and doing literally everything to fight infection/brain fog but it doesn't seem to be getting better. Is this candida?

215,How to challenge unhelpful thoughts/beliefs,"From my experience this is not easy to do alone and usually requires help from someone such as a cognitive–behavioural therapist. The ability to generate an outside perspective on something I strongly believe is challenging, but not impossible, and I have made some progress through trying to rationally dispute thoughts/beliefs on paper.

216,How do you signal you have trouble with your cognition when you're out before saying a single word? How do you maintain basic dignity when you're down and out in life?,"I've basically become agoraphobic over the years as my brain and life have deteriorated. I realised, if I could go to the pub and socialise without anyone worrying about my forgetting what I was saying mid-sentence or about my not having a job, I'd go.

I've found a large component of my avoiding going out is having to get people up to speed with my cognitive difficulties. Either through explanation or growing awkwardness as I stumble through social encounters. It's difficult, embarrassing, and cuts into opportunities for substance in conversation. 

And, trying to navigate conversations in such a way I maintain a basic level of dignity while alluding to my lack of job, reliance on welfare, and general struggles in all ways day to day. It's all but impossible to be an interesting, charismatic person when others don't see any value in you. As society places so much value in our job, how much money we have, and essentially how much we fit the common experience.

How do you inform others you want to interact with of these things in the most efficient, effective, dignified way?

217,I'm in my 20s and have memory loss problems.,"I have serious memory issues. For example, I keep forgetting my phone and even forget what someone had just said to me the other day. I have lost so many items due to my poor memory. Surprisingly, I've had this problem since I was a kid. My friends will reference major events from our school days, and I look at them blankly. It's agonizing because I'm constantly trying to hold onto snippets of memories and important key moments from my childhood. 

For some reason, I can still recall some of the painful moments from my past. They're scattered like bits of paper in a well, but I can piece them together as a string of single instances — disconnected from one another and in no particular order. It's messy and somewhat meaningless, but it's what has stuck with me as I've grown up. Thoughts enter my brain and swim away faster than I can catch them. I forget what people tell me. I have to take meticulous lecture notes or I’ll forget what’s been covered. I forget what I've read, what I've seen, and what I've done. It's awful. It's like my brain is constantly out of focus. It picks up some details, but everything else is blurry, disorderly, and confusing. Honestly, my memory loss is one of the most complex parts of my life, and it’s started to make me feel helpless. 

I looked up several journals online and also posts/blogs, and they had similar conclusions about how [B Vitamins and Omega-3s Could Prevent Cognitive Decline](https://nad.com/news/how-vitamin-b-omega-3s-prevent-cognitive-decline). So I’m wondering if I would actually see some memory improvements if I simply started consuming more vitamins and omega-3s.

220,Do you think I should switch therapist?,"Hi, I hope you’re all doing great. Let me start by saying I’ve been seeing a psychologist since february this year and we’d been doing ERP and in yesterday’s session she refused to do ERP because she said we needed to do what’s called “Cognitive Restructuring”. However, she figured it out I tend to blame other people for my actions/and or for the things that happen to me instead of taking responsibility for it myself. She said I needed to change some negative thinking patterns and that there were many factors both internal and external that contributed and triggered my OCD, such as certain beliefs among other factors.

On the one hand, it was frustrating to hear that for now we are going to pause ERP, as I feel it’s essential. On the other hand, she also said the only thing ERP is going to do is desensitize me and that I needed some cognitive restructuring in order for it to be more effective. She said that if I really wanted to do ERP, she could refer me to another therapist, but for now we had to do some cognitive restructuring first before we continue with ERP.

I really need your advice, I don’t know what to do.

Do you think I should switch therapist?

I think that by any means ERP should be paused and tbh I don’t want to waste more time. I’m 31 years old and I just want to overcome OCD as soon/fast as possible.

In fact, I’ve been struggling with OCD myself since my teen years and it ruined my twenties. Nowadays OCD is between mild and moderate according to her.

What should I do guys, I really need your advice.

Thanks in advance and have a good day.
