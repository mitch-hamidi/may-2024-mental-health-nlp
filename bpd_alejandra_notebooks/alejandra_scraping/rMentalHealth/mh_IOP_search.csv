0,Are PHPs and IOPs worth it?,"Long story short I am trying to take mental health leave from work for severe depression and anxiety and it looks like for that to get covered I have a serious treatment plan that goes beyond what I've been doing (which is psychoanalysis 3x a week). That leaves me with an IOP or PHP. The reason I'm in psychoanalysis is that I don't really believe in behaviorist methods. I don't want to learn coping strategies; I want to get to the root problem. I also understand that these programs are primarily group work. The social element does appeal to me but I have a hard time believing group work will be genuinely helpful as far as getting to root causes. I'm just curious about people's experiences with them, especially those who are skeptical of behaviorist therapy.",1716223328.0,False,1,0,brasstiddys,None,1cwk1tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cwk1tu/are_phps_and_iops_worth_it/

9,"In IOP, and it’s not helping","I’ve been in IOP once before when I was in 5th grade, it supposedly helped, mainly because I didn’t need the help they thought I did.

Now I’m back in it again, I tried getting into inpatient but because I didn’t express I was suicidal at the time, I was put into the least urgency program, IOP, intensive outpatient.

I go there 8:30-11:30 every day, not on weekends, and at first it was helping. Then I realized the thing it was helping with wasn’t my issue, anger issues.

I’ve still been hurting myself while in the program, but apparently it’s minor enough (like only once every few weeks I act on the urges) that no one seems to care! I’ve literally expressed the fact I am suicidal (I wasn’t before, but I quickly became suicidal) and that I have all this SH urges, but whenever they ask if I plan to act on them I say no because I don’t want them telling my mom.

Mom, for context, does not want me in this program because she thinks I’ll say something wrong, CPS will be called, and I’ll be taken away. She only gets mad at me instead of comforts me if I have negative thoughts.

I want to go inpatient, or partial, because I think they’ll help me more. But I can’t get that point across.

Another thing real quick, I got put on anti anxiety meds before and it made it worse. Then anti depressants, and it made it worse.

Any advice?

10,"In IOP, not working, need help","Throwaway account.

I'm an adolescent, was prescribed Cymbalta but stopped taking it very shortly afterwards. Started the new schoolyear right after I stopped taking it, long story short I'm in IOP (intensive outpatient care) right now to get me new medicine and work on suicidal thoughts, as well as manage my long-term intense anxiety.

It's not working. I'm having more panic attacks and general anxiety about the program since I've joined, and I genuinely don't think I can take it for the 1-2 more months it'll take to get discharged. I don't want to go inpatient, because I'm worried the anxiety I'm having right now will end up being amplified and I'll have to spend a long time in the hospital. Without getting too specific, I know what problems I have but I'm not getting the support or help I need from the fellow adolescents in my group. I'm getting the same support from them as I've been getting from non-mental health professionals for years. There's nothing wrong with them, but the only moments of actual help I'm getting is with 1-on-1 chats with the adult in charge (which I'm not supposed to do).

I was supposed to go to inpatient care today after telling my school therapist some of this, but my parents are very hesitant in taking me. I don't know what to do. If anyone can shed any light or provide some advice, I'll be grateful.

14,"My psychiatrist recommended me to a iop, but I don’t have to go right?","
I feel like I’m gonna throw up. I’ve never taken any of the antidepressants she prescribed because I’ve been scared of them, but I take the xanax she prescribed as needed. I missed work for about a month, and I needed them to do the leave paperwork so I don’t get fired. I told them I’ve been feeling anxious and depressed, which is kinda true, which is why I missed and they recommended an iop. They said they’ll see me again after the iop and they want me to call them today. 

I don’t want to do that, and I don’t think it’s necessary. The idea of it makes me incredibly anxious. They asked me “have you had any suicidal ideation”, and I said no. Then they said “yeah then that’s my recommendation for now”. I realize they tried to trap me there which is horrifying. I just wanted my leave paperwork filled out. 

If I tell them I don’t wanna go and I’m gonna see another psychiatrist from now on could they 1013 me then? I think all I need is therapy and maybe something for anxiety as needed. I was stupid to exaggerate my condition as much as I did, but I didn’t do anything that implied I was a danger to myself or others.

Spent 2 weeks inpatient, 3 weeks in PHP, and this was my second week in IOP.  Everything has been helpful and I'm  doing great.  Monday was a very productive day.  

This past Tuesday, I was seated at a table, using my laptop to participate in a ""virtual IOP"".  I was writing some notes and suddenly, my field of vision telescoped into a small point of light.  I started to fall forward and thankfully came back awake before my head even hit the table.

The IOP therapist called me an hour later when the group session had ended.  I told her that I have had this happen many times, I've already been tested and all my physicians know about it.  

On Thursday, an hour before the next IOP group was scheduled to start, she called me again.  This time, she told me I need to have my medications reviewed before continuing the program.  I immediately messaged my doctors, asking if they thought it might be a medication issue. 

It's not.  I've already been tested for everything.  The last time I had this same blackout experience was in the days and weeks before my hallucinations.

I'm not sure if I should I try to continue this process, or take a break.  Whether or not I continue IOP, I also have my weekly CBT therapist to help me.  And... I'm also on the waitlist for EMDR.

I live alone and I'm retired.  My fear is that I will ""lose my head"" again and may end up hurting myself.  Not sure which is the greater risk:

1)  Continue IOP online, hoping that the therapist will call me if I blackout again.

2)  Quitting IOP and just follow my treatment in weekly CBT.

TL;DR Is it possible I was misdiagnosed with BPD if I've been diagnosed with ADHD and C-PTSD, and suspect I have the 'tism?  
I was diagnosed with ADHD last year by a psychiatrist, and it fit perfectly in every way, I literally have every listed symptom and mannerism, as well as nuanced experiences that are a result of the functions of ADHD. Even the weird shit like needing to have a visual checklist plastered to the wall by my front door for every time I leave my house.

  
I have been exploring on my own whether I have autism or not, and it fits very very well in a lot of ways that could just be confirmation bias but evaluations are expensive and I have decided to look at symptoms and tools rather than fixating on \*this\* diagnosis.

  
I was diagnosed with C-PTSD by a therapist two years ago. I have plenty of trauma and plenty of flashbacks - my research suggests this is accurate.

  
I'm attending an IOP right now, and when I saw my intake paperwork it had listed on reasons why I am here: BPD, among other things with which I was already familiar, such as Generalized Anxiety and Massive Depressive Disorder without Psychotic Features, ADHD, and PTSD.

  
Sticker shock is the only term I can use to describe how I felt.

  
I was married to a man who I believed with all of my little research-goblin heart was a pwBPD. It fit perfectly, literally all 9 symptoms to the MAX. In the foreground of those symptoms: yelling and throwing things, sometimes bashing his head into walls or desks or tables. He never sought help. But I went down the rabbit hole, for my own sake and for the sake of the kids. I learned a lot from the perspective of a loved one, I'm on the subreddit r/BPDlovedones and everything haha.

  
I always empathized very heavily with my ex-husband's experiences of paranoia surrounding others' thoughts, the pervasive emptiness, fear of abandonment by anyone and everyone, and the explosive emotional reactions to things. My self-image always suffered as a result of what other people said or did, but I always thought it was just people-pleasing. I'm very impulsive with money and activities, but that could be attributed to dopamine seeking behavior from ADHD. I was going down the road that led me to believe my depth of emotion was from autism, and that was the explanation that made the most sense to me. I can't hold back tears when I see emotion on television screens, when I read about it, when I see it on someone's face I'm sobbing instantly. It's a visceral reaction. The hyper-empathy is detrimental at times. I have an intense rejection sensitivity, to the point where I will erase my own boundaries into oblivion at the slightest delay in text messages or tone inflection. I am incredibly good at pattern recognition, to the point where my attention to detail often surprises others. I've self-harmed, I've had weeeiiird adult relationships, and I'm susceptible to being offended by a small action of someone else and holding a grudge for years. Not a grudge that alters my behavior toward them - if anything I fawn and overcompensate to cover for how much I hate the person. Especially fixate on what people say that ""means"" something super hurtful to my self-image or the story I tell myself about what my reality is.

  
All of this culminated when I went for a knife because of career pressure, and subsequently entered into IOP.

  
I don't know what to think anymore. Maybe I do have BPD. Maybe I'm autistic and just really good at masking or whatever. Maybe I should try to get it off my chart and just do the research on my own.

34,I’m that mentally messed up??,"I just had a meeting with a new therapist today and when I told her I had some suicidal thoughts a couple weeks ago and have a eating disorder she told me she agreed with the other therapist I had 2 years ago that referred me to IOP. 

Even though I told her I've tried it in the past and didn't like it and i work better in one on one sessions. I was in  disbelief when I was told this and can’t believe that I’m not normal and so fucked up mentally that I’m getting told for the second time that iop will be a better option. 

Then I met with my phycologist yesterday and told what I just told y’all and she agreed also and said for her to keep working with me she feels that would be the best option right now. IOPs do take a lot of time during the week and I work a full-time job which I told her and she said I haven’t been going because I’m struggling which is true but girl that doesn’t mean I don’t go at all cause I still got bills to pay obviously and I don’t have someone to lean on to help me when it comes to money. 

Personally for me I would like to be independent like have my own apartment and learning how to budget my money. What was y’all experience with IOP and how did it help you if it did?? Can IOP teach me and help me with my goals I want to achieve and possibly get my mental health and cptsd under control to the point??

35,Will IOP do me any good if I don't really want to go?,"I've had a drinking problem for about three years now. On Christmas Eve, I have an evaluation to enter into an IOP program for my alcoholism. I have been drinking before work, during work, after work, and basically every second that I'm not asleep. I'm in a constant state of tipsy and have been for about a month now. I know that I should actually consider inpatient because I might need it at this point.

But for some reason, I just want to keep drinking myself to death. I don't care if I ruin my life. I don't care if I'm alone forever. About a month ago, I just stopped caring about anything. The only reason I am doing IOP is because my therapist was being really pushy and I can't say no to her without feeling guilty. 

But is there a point? If I'm feeling so apathetic about my own well-being, will IOP even help me a little bit?

It's gotten to the point where it is significantly impacting my life everyday, almost every minute of everyday--I'm constantly lethargic, usually high on marijuana, overeating, not moving from the couch all day, not motivated to do anything that would move me forward in this life. I try really hard everyday, but there is so much inner resistance that I feel like I am forever drowning. Lately, I've been thinking about other treatment options, like a short-term residential program or an IOP (intensive outpatient program), but I am feeling really discouraged with no support system and scared about the financial implications.

39,I don’t know if I can do this anymore.,"I’ve tried everything and I can’t do this anymore.

I’m 23, non-binary. In 2022 I left college due to mental health (eating disorder but also significant depression and anxiety and found out I also have ADHD).
I don’t even really have the motivation to write this post so I’ll try to give all relevant info while still keeping it short. 
I’ve been to inpatient, residential, PHP, IOP, and I’ve had periods where I was just seeing an outpatient team. Right now my ED (anorexia) is not super bad (basically I’m still struggling but I’m maintaining a healthy weight) and I’m in IOP in an ED program.


I’ve tried so many meds. Like almost everything I’ve heard of, I’ve tried. I’ve done TMS (regular and deep), intranasal ketamine/Spravato, and I’ve had 2 rounds of acute ECT (bitemporal). ECT was initially helpful but fucked with my memory so bad and all the benefits seem to have worn off.
I just don’t think I can do this much longer. I don’t have the motivation to get out of my bed most days but I have to either because my parents make me (moved back in with them when I had to leave college) or because I have IOP/some kind of appointment. I need to get a job and submit all my re-entry stuff for school so I can get my degree. But I just simply can’t. 


I have a lot of bottles of meds and I can’t seem to get any definite answers online which would be most likely to kill me. I’m not planning on doing anything tonight/in the near future but like if I just literally take every pill I have and wash it down with some liquor that’s gotta work right? I’m really scared of not dying and being permanently damaged in some way bc of a failed attempt.
I am just really struggling and my therapist doesn’t even really know what to do with me. I don’t want to hurt people but that’s basically the only reason why I’m alive (besides fear that it won’t work and lack of motivation to do anything including writing notes to important people in my life and making sure someone will be able to take care of my cat)

41,Terrified that I'm going to crash and burn,"Last year, I was hospitalized six times for SI and various comorbid conditions. I had to take the Fall semester off of school, postponing my graduation by a year, and after my fourth hospitalization I started a partial hospitalization program where I went to a group therapy place 6 hours a day, five days a week. And it worked! That was my second IOP/PHP clinic, and I really did well there. I had 2 hospitalizations while I was there, but those were triggered by a med problem, and they were back to back because the first place really messed with my meds (withheld various non-psych meds with no tapering because they ""made me impulsive""). So really it was just one slip.

I got dropped down to IOP (3 hours a day, 4 days a week) at the end of December. And now I just graduated the program entirely. I do outpatient therapy once a week for a bit, then every other week, then once a month... Until I'm done entirely.

And it feels good, yeah. I'm proud of myself for coming this far, for all the progress I've made. I technically did the PHP program twice, but I only did 8 weeks of a 16-week IOP program, so it kinda adds up. I'm not nearly as suicidal now, which is awesome.

But mood wise... I don't feel much different. I'm struggling to manage all aspects of my life, and it's not even that hard - I'm taking a reduced course load, I'm only involved in one extra curricular that meets weekly and doesn't require more than 30 minutes of time each day, I have loads of time to spare. And yet I'm always behind on school, I lose track of time and can't do what I need to for the extracurricular, I don't have time to practice any self care beyond brushing my teeth and washing my face and maybe taking a shower 2-3 times a week. I'm not happy, I'm stressed but also numb to so many things, I don't get actual enjoyment out of anything anymore. 

I was just diagnosed with ADHD and I'm starting meds for that soon, so I'm hoping that will help some. But it won't make me any happier. I've tried so many meds and mood stabilizers, I have adverse reactions to most of them and the ones I don't, well, they don't really work all that well. If anything they make me worse; the lithium and Seroquel have slowed my processing speed down, I'm tired all the time, my appetite is all over the place, some of my therapists think that it's made me too numb now. The only benefits have maybe been with sleep because without them I do frequently pull all nighters, but it's an overcorrection because now I want to sleep all the time.

I dunno. It feels like I'm still on the edge. Yeah, I don't have one foot hanging off anymore, but I'm still only one or two steps away from that. And I keep telling myself, just make it until next semester when I go in person and can join more clubs and do more stuff, but I know I'm just avoiding being home alone with my thoughts, much like I am now. My friends from IOP are all doing things, clubs, school, hanging out with friends. They're too busy to talk to me most of the time, but they're the only connection I have. I'm just barely hanging on, and yet I still have six months before I can do all the stuff they're doing. At the very least IOP gave me something to get up for everyday. Now all I have is classes that I'm always behind on and one extracurricular commitment that somehow seems too overwhelming. No friends, no one to talk to my age, at least not in person. No place to hang out at. No experiences or memories being made.

And yet all it takes is one slip, and back to PHP I go. 8 weeks of that, then another 16 weeks of IOP. Worse, if that happens, I can say goodbye to a good first semester in the Fall because I'll be spending essentially 5 hours each day unable to do school or clubs (factoring in driving time). My mental health issues have fucked up a whole year of my life already, and here we are on year 2, just waiting to see if things will be as bad. Or worse.

I had all these dreams and expectations for what it would be like post-graduation. I thought I would feel at peace, or kind of happy. I guess I feel stable, but stable in the sense that I feel shitty all the time and it never changes. The only motivation I have right now is hope for a better future, but I start to wonder if that'll be disappointing, too. I'm taking it day by day but everything blends together because it's always the same. The most exciting part of my week is going to the grocery store and buying things that I won't ever eat. I live off of cereal, Oreos, and the occasional bagel (if I'm out of milk) or yogurt. I know, I need to eat better. But why waste time eating stuff that I hate the taste of when it probably won't make that much of a difference in the long run?

I've promised myself, just make it 10 years and if things are still shitty, and they've never gotten better, then I can consider other options. I'm going to try my best to make it those 10 years. But I'm scared nothing will change. Or things will change for the worse. I'm scared I'll relapse again, and again, and again, and I'll never really be out of this depressive hell hole. I'm scared my life will be forever postponed because of treatment that won't make any improvements overall. I'm scared of so many things, and yet at the same time, nothing scares me. If those things happen, will I even care? Will it even matter? Will my life make a difference anywhere at any point?

42,Question about outpatient,"I’ve been in a rut for a really long time and it’s just getting worse. My therapists have mentioned IOP and my parents want me to try something because they feel like they can’t help me anymore. I’ve also had difficulty with medication and feeling hopeless at the moment. I don’t need over night stay but soemthing everyday. I think it would be good to because I can tell them exactly what’s going on and the psychiatrist is well trained to know what can help me the quickest. I have so many issue atm ocd intrusive thoughts, depression, anxiety, panic disorder agoraphobia, gad, and when I don’t think it can get worse it does. Is there a way to do outpatient without the group stuff but get the therapy in and the med situation figured out?

48,I think my depression is getting worse,"2023 has been an absolute shit year for me. In February, a friend that I’ve known since I was 3 y/o suddenly passed away in their sleep. It was absolutely gut-wrenching because they were one of the kindest people I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. They were a senior and didn’t even get to graduate high school. When I went to the viewing and saw their body I felt like passing out. The funeral was even worse. I balled my eyes out and felt so sick that I begged to be taken home right after. At the same time I had recently been enrolled(idk if that’s the right word) into an IOP program and was forced to go the same day as their funeral and you could probably guess how that went. My mom threatened to get police involved if I didn’t go and eventually I did, but I was so upset that I absolutely refused to talk at all or get out of the car. My IOP therapist had to come out to the car to talk to me, but I refused to talk, make eye contact or even acknowledge him. It took almost an hour to get an actual response from me and then they finally let me go home. I was so fucking pissed that they forced me to go the same day as my friends funeral. I wasn’t even spoken to about it, and since I was given the day off for the viewing I assumed the same for the funeral. Imagine my surprise when I was told I had to go. I still haven’t forgiven my mom (the IOP staff were just doing their job so I can understand) for it and I don’t think she even realized how shitty that was and how I’m still upset by it to this day (though to be fair she’s done a lot of things that she hasn’t realized affected me). Anyway, I was in the IOP program for about 4 months and my grades took a serious toll. I usually get As, Bs and the occasional C but my grades were one B and the rest were all Cs lower. I even nearly failed a class. The reason my grades suffered was because being at the IOP program took up all my energy (I’m autistic) and left me none to do much of anything else, especially school work. It helped my mental health but fucked my grades in the ass and I’m already really insecure about my grades and my ability to do school work in general. I thought maybe life would improve a little when summer came around but it hasn’t. Now that I have no structure to my day I have little motivation to do anything and started struggling with hygiene again. Life just hates me or something because a couple weeks ago my mom informed me my grandpa is dying of lung cancer and doesn’t have long to live. Another gut punch. I didn’t visit the first weekend I was informed, but the second weekend (which was last week) I did. Being in the house was suffocating. So depressing. Seeing my grandpa in such a sick state was terrible. He could barely walk and speak. I hated seeing him like that so much. The day after we left my mom told me that he passed in his sleep next to my other grandpa. It was bittersweet, absolutely heartbreaking obviously but he was at peace and no longer in pain. And fast forward to this weekend, we visited again and it was still suffocating. My family is planning the funeral and all that and it’s just so depressing. I think this is the final straw because for multiple days my head has hurt from sadness? I don’t know how to describe it, but it feels like when I’m off my meds when Im most definitely taking them. Idk just that headache feeling you get when you’re really depressed. Today was definitely the worst of it, I was so agitated and the humid weather definitely made it worse. I’ve just been feeling so unhappy lately that it’s started to become a problem. Processing my loved ones’ deaths is just so hard when my brain already processing things differently (again, I’m autistic). Sometimes I cry and sometimes I don’t, sometimes I feel sad and sometimes I don’t. I just feel so shitty, the most shitty I’ve felt in months. I just want to enjoy the days off of school but nope another person I love dearly has to die. With all this combined with what I’m already dealing with (parents divorcing, financial struggles, and unresolved trauma) is really making my life hell and I’m worried I’ll start getting suicidal thoughts again. I’m already having subtle, passive thoughts and I really don’t want to go through IOP again. I’m just so sick of everything. I don’t understand why life can’t just give me a break.

53,"I think I have residual trauma from my 3 months spent in a long-term mental facility as well as my last attempt, but my therapist ruined my chances of being able to talk about it","So after I got out of said facility, I started an IOP program. This facility was actually insanely traumatizing and I have kind of blocked a lot of it out, but every once in a while I’ll see a face wash I got in there or a worksheet I did and..I’ll feel like I can’t breathe. Toward the end of my IOP term last summer, I decided to bring this up in group. However, that particular therapist absolutely went ape shit on me, telling me I need to “look on the bright side”, that there’s nothing I can do about it now so I need to be positive, etc etc. He’d never done shit like this before, and it got so bad that I stormed out halfway through when I got fed up with his insanely condescending attitude (he later said he was thinking as a parent and not a therapist and putting his own thoughts above mine because he was having an awful day..). After lots of tears and him apologizing and the last few weeks of agonizingly awkward interactions, I’m now in just individual therapy but I’ve realized I can’t bear to even BRING UP that time in the facility, or my last attempt which was awful and I think I would benefit from going through it in as much detail as I can, but after IOP… I just can’t make myself start either of those conversations. The thought of being judged so harshly or being viewed as whiny and dramatic like I was in IOP… and why should I need to go through either of those anyways??

54,Is it worth continuing to try to find the right meds?,"I just need to vent.

&#x200B;

Right now I just feel so beaten down, exhausted, and hopeless about my medical future.

My whole life I have struggled with my mental health in a number of ways, but I'll start in 2021 when I started therapy again after a break for depression and anxiety. Did that for a year, no improvement, so I saw a psychiatrist in Dec 2022 primarily for anxiety. I also got on the waiting list to be tested for ADHD.

She started me on buspirone- it made me cry every day on the floor. At this point, I had my ADHD test and they ruled that although I have every symptom of ADHD, I am in the top 1% of intelligence and because of my high intelligence I was diagnosed with ""low tolerance for boredom."" Wtf even is that. At this point, my psychiatrist switched me to Zoloft for the anxiety. 25mg worked well for me and made me feel good, but after going up to 50mg I had a lot of intrusive suicidal thoughts for about 2 weeks. I finally felt like I was adjusting to the med. At this point, I had my weekly therapy session where I happened to speak really fast and talk about the shopping spree I went on that weekend (this is somewhat normal for me, I have compulsively shopped a lot my whole life but it has never been financially disruptive since I earn a lot of money). Because of the shopping and fast talking (another train I have done my whole life) she told me I was manic. I pushed back- I was sleeping fine, I didnt feel elated in any way, I wasnt unsafe in any way. Honestly my mood felt like a 6/10 that day but she told my psychiatrist that I was manic. Because of this, my psych took me off of Zoloft and put me on an antipsychotic (Latuda / lurasidone).

This made me feel horrible. I didnt have anxiety anymore, but I also didnt have any thoughts or a personality. My mood stayed between a 40-60% all the time. I didnt feel joy or motivation ever. I asked to come off and they wouldnt let me because of the chance I could possibly be bipolar (even though I didnt meet clinical qualification for bipolar). At this time I felt really hopeless and had daily suicidal thoguhts so I started an IOP program. In this program, I got to see a different psych who transitioned me onto Lamical/lamotrigine and I got off of the latuda which helped bring my mood to a more normal place for me. I felt more like myself and generally stable. My anxiety was back but I didnt really care because at least I wasnt depressed. While in this program, my IOP therapist and OP therapist met to discuss me, and came back that they thought I had Borderline. I asked them to explain why, and they literally couldnt. I could see on their face that they didnt even believe this diagnosis, but it was all they could offer. Right after this, my therapist left me so I started searching for a new one.

During the intake for a new therapist, I explained all of this. She screened me for borderline and said I only met 2/9 criteria so that didnt make sense. She said she thinks I have ADHD (I'm thinking yes, finally sees!). Because of this, she talked to my new psych and they put me on ADHD meds. First I tried Vyvanse and it was like my world changed- I could finally read 1 full page of a book for the first time in my life in a single sitting. But it made me fall asleep the whole day on it, so then we tried Ritalin, which was fantastic. Worked perfectly and I felt productive, organized, calm, and present. At this point, I got discharged from IOP and back with my OP psychiatrist.

Then I started getting energy crashes so I switched to Concerta. Bring on the brain fog, inability to focus, and unproductiveness. I have had some god days and some bad days on it. Until this week where every day has been anhedonic and apathetic. I had a breakdown friday night and had to text the crisis hotline.

I am exhausted. I'm tired of trying meds and still feeling like shit. Right now I have no motivation, nothing brings me joy, I am canceling all my plans with friends, I can't do anything except play sudoku and count down until I can try and go to sleep.

This whole experience has brought me to a point where I feel like nothing is going to work. I finally was in a good place and then it all went to shit this week. Part of me just wants to scrap all my meds and go back to just being anxious. Anhedonia is killing me and I don't know what is causing it.

55,Should I quit school?,"there’s a brief mentions of SI and SH

I’m currently a student at a university in my state and I’ve not had an easy time with education. For background, I suffer a lot from mental health issues. I have been in hospital for SI five times (four of which occurred with a month between each visit). Three of my visits happened during my fall semester which is what led me to drop out of the semester. The most recent on led me to drop this spring semester. I’ve been in residential treatment two times, and in PHP twice, and, after four months, am finally in IOP. I still am struggling with thoughts of sh and si too. I manage it better and have come to terms that those thoughts will never really “disappear.”

Recently, as I near the end of my treatment, I’ve been looking a jobs. There’s just so so so many things that I feel I would enjoy so much more than going back to school. But I also want to be a therapist one day too. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m seeking momentary relief or if I should take a different path since school depleted so much of my mental health.

58,Partial Hospitalization Program,"Hello, my therapist wanted me to do IOP over this summer cause I’m out of school and such. However, during the initial consultation, the people who run the program suggested I do PHP instead (partial hospitalization program) which is essentially just longer and more “intense.” Has anyone, specifically teens (im a 17f), had any experience with this program?

60,I feel so unworthy of being helped for my suicide ideation,"Backstory: my therapist is making me go to an intensive outpatient program (IOP) in hopes I find support & validation for my struggles, especially with suicide ideation, in a group setting with those who feel similar. My family's supportive now, but they used to be incredibly judgmental and have never been able to validate me the way I need.

Recently, I've been in crisis situations more and more, feeling like I can't keep myself safe to the point I need to go to the hospital. My therapist told me many times in the past I need to go, but  I never did is b/c I still live at home & fear my family's judgement, so I always have to be the one to get myself out of the crisis no matter how bad. However, the one time I had the courage to tell ask my mom to take me to the hospital is when an ice storm hit, so our car started to slide on ice when leaving our neighborhood & my mom turned around to go home, saying she's too afraid to drive to the hospital.

Present: I just had my 2nd day of IOP & I asked the group how they tell ppl about their struggles. While everyone was supportive, one person made a well intended comment praising me about how ""I'm getting help in IOP & telling my mom without ever being in peak crisis mode where I need to be hospitalized unlike how many others in the group went through inpatient first before getting to IOP.""

While ik the comment was meant to be supportive, the lack of validation now and when growing up causes me to compare myself to everyone & minimize my struggles. Now I feel like I don't deserve IOP b/c I wasn't hospitalized. It sounds sick, but I want to quit the program, get admitted to inpatient, then rejoin just so I feel worthy enough to be in IOP. But at the same time, I've convinced myself that if I'm in crisis mode again, I can't go to the hospital b/c I'm just being an attention wannabe trying to get into the hospital so I can ""fit in"" with the other group members. I hate myself more than I could've ever imagined for thinking/acting this way.

And I'm so angry that the person made an assumption so quickly despite not knowing anything about me or about the many times I was in peak crisis mode. I feel like no one believes my struggles anymore b/c the one place where I thought I would be fully supported and understood is through this group, and now I feel like all of that has been taken away. I've always been willing to do a voluntary admittance instead of attempting suicide then doing involuntary b/c I don't entirely want to die. I just want someone to take me seriously. But given everything that's happened, I feel like the only way people will believe me and validate my struggles is if I actually attempt and die. I think that's what I'm set on doing now.

61,Do I really need to go to a partial hospitalization program?,"3 years ago I had a bad “trip” on weed and it triggered intense feelings of derealization for me. Since then, I’ve been having extremely short (literally like 2 seconds) but almost daily episodes of feeling that derealization feeling. Nowadays it’s worst when I’m trying to sleep - I’ll experience it really intensely and snap awake before trying to sleep again. The feeling that my surroundings, memories, or even myself aren’t real causes me to panic and I’m frequently tense worrying that it’ll happen again. I’ve been prescribed a ton of meds throughout the past 3 years, including Abilify for a few months and an entire year of taking Klonopin. Currently I’m just taking Buspar and Elavil. I’ve been to 3 different counselors since this all started. The Klonopin did help, but I don’t want to go back on it because of its dependency-causing nature. My current counselor suggested I get assessed by a nearby mental hospital to see what they think I should do moving forward. Earlier today I got assessed and they recommended a PHP. I was surprised because that seems even more intense than an IOP. Fortunately, the PHP is 100% covered by my insurance if I do decide to go.

64,I’m so defeated an mad at myself for failing another class ,"Last semester was my first full semester living on a new college campus as a transfer student, and ngl I didn’t do great. The past 2 years have been rough as I left my first uni due to wanting a major change which took away my major specific scholarship, so I was no longer able to afford going there and had to leave. After leaving my first uni I spiraled into a deep depression bc I’d never felt so welcomed and involved like I did there, my social anxiety was SO much better living away from home and I finally felt I had a good friend group and I lost that going home. My parents immediately signed me up for community college and I attended 1 class before having a breakdown.

About 3 months into that depression I got a part time job and that distracted me for a while, then I started community again the next semester and this time I made it through(although towards the end my anxiety started getting bad again and I missed some school due to panic attacks). I was hoping after that semester I’d transfer to a state school and live in a dorm there but the deadline passed so I’d have to wait till fall 2023, so I signed up for community college classes for one more semester.

Then for some reason I went into a deep depression again(exactly a year after me leaving my old uni, maybe that has something to do with it), I didn’t attend a single class and my therapist recommended a virtual IOP which I got kicked out of bc I was too depressed to even get up and click on the zoom link. After that I was admitted into an inpatient facility bc that was the only way I could get better. Post inpatient I attended a different in person IOP and that lasted 4 months. I finally was able to transfer to a state school in the Fall 2023 session and was so excited.

That first semester I started out good but then I began to fall into old habits of putting fun before school and I’d miss class often and it caught up to me, long story short that led me to being put on academic probation this semester. This semester I’m ngl I’ve been bad with attendance as well but for completely different reasons, said reasons being one of the following:
- it’s a bad body dysmorphia day and I feel hideous 
- my hyperhydrosis is making me feel self conscious 
- I’m so depressed that I just rot in my room

Obviously those reasons are the initial ones usually but typically they’re followed by me then avoiding the class out of anxiety over the fact that I was absent the previous day. 

This semester I think planning and depression have been the biggest obstacles to overcome as I still haven’t yet, I even had a project fully done but didn’t submit it on time because I was just exhausted. Two of my classes in particular Im worried about, one is half a semester and my prof already told me I won’t pass, the other is just a difficult class. Im freaking out about officially not passing that one class tho bc even though it’s not many credits I’m on academic probation and don’t want to be kicked out, also I need a certain amount of credits to maintain my financial aid so idk what I’ll do without it. I hate myself for letting this happen again, idk why I let stuff get to this point, my therapist thinks I might be self sabotaging and I agree w/ that somewhat as after my mom told me she didn’t believe I’d pass I felt horrible and thought whats the point in even trying if I’m just gonna fail anyway, the thing is I didn’t necessarily feel that way until my mom said that.",1711465159.0,False,1,0,ohnevelmynevel,None,1bo9zc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1bo9zc5/im_so_defeated_an_mad_at_myself_for_failing/

68,Frustrated with myself,"39m with heavy autism, but fully functional in terms of surviving in this world. My struggles are mostly internal. I'm not one that suffered with depression my whole life, although I probably had anxiety as a kid and didn't understand it. Nothing debilitating. I don't have issues with addiction or anything.

Ten years ago began a catastrophic set of events in my life. I strongly held it together for six years... But when life threw me the hardest one it ever has, it was too much. I fell apart and let my life go to hell just like all of you already understand. When I completely stopped functioning, family got me into a group therapy that was so good it changed my life. 3hrs per day, 5 days per week, for 90 days. If you miss an accumulated 20 mins you're out and have to start over.  But this IOP was incredible. I had some positive moments after that, but has now faded. The things I fought for a decade for, I lost miserably, and that's been hard for me to accept. Giving up on those things has been even harder.

I was a FF/medic, and three years ago I got hit by a car on the highway while executing a roadside rescue. I was alone up against five victims, three critical, two immediately life threatening in implausible weather/traffic conditions. I did save all five; unfortunately, I took a 70mph hit to accomplish that. It took me four months to take my first step. Took six months of learning to walk again before I could leave the house. Took a year and a half before I was physically functional enough to be on my own.

Among many injuries, I've been struggling with focus and memory. Doctors all deemed it to be neurological injury related. But now, after three years of tests/scans/appts/referrals, etc etc etc... I had a followup on my neuro psyc exam. Everything neurologically is sound. It's clear that it's impacted me neurologically, but my scores are on the lower end of acceptable.  Then he moved into discussion of my depression. He painted a picture to me as to how he came to the conclusion that my neurological symptoms are depression; and he was so right there is no arguing it. I asked then why did it just happen at the accident timing? He believes that was just one mental trigger too many. I'm buying into his answer, he's been thorough, and it makes sense to me. I see the same path he does.

Which leaves me so damn frustrated with myself. I've done therapy, groups, IOP, one 24hr hospital visit for psyc. I've done really well capturing the lessons, tools, and information. I seem to always know the right answers, even if I'm not applying them to myself. Point being, I dedicated my entire being to mental health after that group, and I feel I've become incredibly great at understanding the mental healthcare game. So much so, that I'm currently volunteering in a facility where I host an emotional support group of a dozen or so people. I'm really good at this...

... Which brings me to my frustration. It turns out the answers to resolving all my memory and focus issues has been on my side of the fence the entire time. I am an amazing level of good at mental healthcare now, and I completely missed that I'm the one holding the magic 8 ball. I know this, I understand this, and I identify this in other people - but I completely missed it on myself. I feel like I've spent the last decade suffering unnecessarily. Like I've been holding the magic pill this whole time, and didn't even know it. I'm so upset with myself, so angry with myself now. I didn't have to go through most of this, and this could've been over years ago if I'd just somehow found a way to get better at therapy/mental healthcare, had I known. I feel like I completely let myself down and just allowed this suffering by choice.  I have never, in my life, been more disappointed in myself than I am right now.

I dont know if this is a rant, or seeking advice. Maybe I just need assurance... I don't know.. But I know I'm alone, upset, and self hating... And despite knowing all the right answers in my head, I just don't feel it.

I was always the problem that needed to work on self. He’s very mentally troubled himself but told me he was too narcissistic to get help. Last July I found out that he had cheated on with an alleged 15 year old girl. We of course argued, I lost my shit, and he ended up putting bruises on me. I have a past of attempts and self harm so I ended up going to inpatient to residential to IOP. All totaled to 6 months. Cops picked me up that day so I had to report the assault and have an ongoing case with him (trial was supposed to be on Valentine’s Day lol how ironic but got postponed) I shouldn’t have looked but I saw a Valentine’s Day post of him and his new girlfriend he has been with for a few months. I just can’t wrap my head around it. I don’t miss him, I’m not jealous, I just don’t understand how he can be in love with someone already after the insane shit that’s going on. I am doing a lot better and I want to focus on that. But I can’t help but wonder if his life is good, if he has a job and isn’t an alcoholic anymore and can love properly. He seems happy but I know I can’t judge it off that. I can’t even consider dating any time soon because it fucked me up so much meanwhile he moved on in 2-3 months. It’s not even that I don’t want him to be a better person than he was. I just hate wondering if it took fucking me up as much as he did to be a good person.

My mental health has been a serious issue for me for probably 10 years now. I'm suffering from diagnosed ADHD, depression, and anxiety, as well as potentially non-diagnosed autism, cptsd, and other issues relating to severe traumas that I've experienced. I've been on different medications but all I've ever gotten is medicine management and even when I was in therapy, it was never enough for me to even begin to tackle all of my issues. I'm becoming desperate and considering admitting myself into the hospital but I'm so close to finishing my degree in college, I'm looking into IOP options. My issue is, I'm scared. I'm scared to commit to a program just for it to not help. I'm a broke college student and I'm scared that I'm just going to waste my time and money because I've never had a successful experience with mental health. South Carolina is notorious for being low ranked in everything good and high ranked in everything bad.

I guess what I'm asking is: what do I do to actually get the help that I need? I don't want to give up my degree, but even if I go into the hospital, who says it'll help? It didn't last time, it made me worse. Are there online resources that might be better than what I can find near me? I can't find any reviews for anywhere near me or I just don't know how.

77,AITA for not forgiving my parents for inflicting trauma on me?,"My mother and father (who are conservative boomers) refuse to accept that they seriously damaged me as a child and as an adult. They constantly misgender me, deadname me, and regularly violate my boundaries as a person. I should explain that as a child, they also refused to allow me to be diagnosed with ASD and/or ADHD, claiming it would “negatively impact my development”. They also regularly hit me and limited my social contact as a child to stunt my social development. Fast forward to 28 years later, I am in an IOP program to deal with severe social anxiety, PTSD, major depressive disorder, and a litany of other mental health issues that plague me almost every day. Even as a whole-ass adult, they continue to infantilize and demean my gender, my sexuality, and my very personhood. And they NEVER apologize for misgendering me or deadnaming me: they will often cite that they are “old”, “forgetful”, and that my “choices don’t align with their beliefs”. My gender expression is not a choice. Neither is my queerness. 

And I cannot leave my house. I have no money available to me (as it’s being held by my mother for “safekeeping”) and very few resources to escape the place that is causing me so much mental anguish.

82,Addiction treatment is ruining my mood disorder treatment progress on boundaries and self esteem. Has anyone else dealt with this?,"I was in an IOP program with an addiction focus, and now I'm in AA. Addiction treatment seems to focus on not being selfish and manipulative, plus taking full responsibility. My treatment for BPD and PTSD focuses on setting boundaries, allowing yourself have self care, and removing shame. But in addition treatment, I'm ""called out"" and told I'm selfish for leaving the room to calm down when I'm triggered because it's not fair to the person talking, told I only think about myself because I talk when no one else is talking (practicing taking up space), and my sponsor said that I need to take responsibility for my rape because I was drunk. An IOP facilitator said I was a narcissist for saying I will not let him keep me from using the restroom because I was taking meds for a kidney infection, and on an AA sub a few people told me that being scared by sponsor's comments on my rape was an excuse to drink again. Both IOP and AA have continuously stated that you can't just disregard things you don't want to hear because it's not taking responsibility and you're not willing to get better. I am. But if I need to go pee, I'm peeing.

I gained so much empowerment after PTSD and BPD treatment, and now I'm back to feeling like a horrible person. All because I set boundaries and critically evaluate things before I believe them. This crap has happened both in actual treatment and AA, so I don't know how a person with a substance abuse problem can maintain their self esteem and boundaries.

83,I can't find a therapist,"I can't find a therapist. Around January, I noticed I wasn't feeling like myself (to be honest it was building over the last 9 months). There were nights I would act manic and just ruminate on stressful thoughts. I just couldn't seem to find a therapist who I trusted or thought was listening to me. My general practitioner wasn't even much help (in his defense he knew I needed better help).   


On March 13th, after weeks of feeling suicidal and having a plan I called a hotline who convinced me to go to the ER. I did. I was hospitalized for a week.   


I'm grateful I went to the ER that day. I felt like I saved my life.   


After the ER, I was in an IOP for 3 months. I graduated from it 2 weeks ago.   


This all happened to me during COVID. Nothing about my treatment has been routine. I sat at home alone while being told a depressed person shouldn't isolate themselves. I did an entire IOP over zoom. I didn't have any other choice. It's not my fault this has happened to me during a global pandemic.   


To top it off, I lost my job 2 weeks ago (the morning after I finished the IOP).   


I'm now trying to find an outpatient therapist. I've talked with two so far who after I explain the last 6 months of my life tell me that I need a therapist whose more available or could give me more individual attention.   


What does that even mean?   


I appreciate their honesty but I'm starting to get fed up. I can't keep retelling my story for the last 6 months and be told they can't help me. It's making me distrustful of therapists.   


Also, am I that screwed up in the head that nobody thinks I'm worth helping? I'm just that damaged ...

Prior to being hospitalized, I was living alone, working full time, and had a pretty good social life. Since I was discharged from the hospital, I have been living with family. Initially it was just a temporary safety precaution because (understandably) no one was comfortable with me being alone. But because I’ve been in intensive treatment for so long, I haven’t had an income and can’t afford to live anywhere other than with family. 

I feel like I’m missing out on so much. I’m 26, and feel like I completely wasted my 20’s. The first few years of my 20’s I was in an abusive relationship. When we split, I finally started living the way I wanted to, going out and having fun. Unfortunately, there was just a lot of trauma that was building up in the background and became too much. 

I regret getting treatment though. I functioned for such a long time having SI but still going to work and acting normal. I feel like I outed myself by getting hospitalized and letting my family know about it, and now I can’t get out of treatment because too many people are involved and concerned for me.

I know that quitting before I’m stable wouldn’t work out well for me, and it isn’t sustainable for me to try to go back to “normal” life yet when I’m still struggling so much… I just feel like I’m watching everyone else still living their life and I’ve been on pause for a year and a half with no end in sight",1704160911.0,False,2,0,Mountain_Opposite659,None,18wdi56,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18wdi56/i_feel_like_im_missing_out_on_life_because_im/

89,SOS - Extremely Depressed,"Hi,

I have bipolar 2, bpd, ocd, adhd, and c-ptsd. Last June I had a major manic episode in which I was almost in a sleep walking state and everyone found out. I left my phone sitting on top of my car with my car doors open, only gone for a couple hours. Someone called the cops when they saw it and they started calling my friends on my phone, so everyone found out. I’ve been the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life since then because of being treated differently with that mental health stigma. I don’t know how to become interested in activities anymore and how to relate to people. There’s this overall feeling of it being unpleasant and difficult to converse with others. Getting distracted constantly is definitely contributing to feelings of self-doubt getting sidetracked from job hunting. Isolating is unusual for me as I’m an extrovert, enfp to be exact. I have scheduled extensive therapy sessions multiple times a week, so I’m getting the help I need. I initially wanted to do an outpatient IOP program because I’m not suicidal, but my insurance doesn’t cover it, therefore I can’t afford it. Also down on myself because I’m unemployed due to bad health that’s improving with my arms and clotting and the programs expressed they wouldn’t be flexible with interviews throughout the 8 week program. I can’t still be unemployed on the other side of this because I’m financially struggling. Desperate here, so asking if anyone has any advice on how to get by without losing my mind in the meantime. By the way, I’m on 300 mg lamictal, 1.5 mg of resperedone, 150 of lyrica for nerve pain, pristiq for depression, and 10 mg of vyvanse for adhd. I’m 27 and I feel like my mental health has steadily gotten worse and worse. It’s hard to live in my own head.

98,Question about therapy [US],"I have been going to a therapist weekly for almost 3 months now and I haven't really noticed improvement like I have hoped for. I'm 16 and I'm wondering what options there are for group therapy with others my age, I talked to my current therapist about this and she suggest a IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program) through a local psychiatric hospital.

I went in for the first evaluation and it felt all way to hospital-y if you kinda get what I'm saying. It didn't feel like what I was expecting in the interview but I am going to one of the meetings on thursday to try it out. 

My question basically is: is there such thing as group therapy like what you see in the movies. For example The Fault in our Stars had the group therapy scenes where they sit in a circle of chairs and talk about how they felt and what not. Is IOP exactly that or should I look for something else? I guess on thursday I will find out what it's like and I'll come back here and give an update. Thanks

Update - turns out the IOP session isn't covered by mom's insurance so I'm going to be talking with my therapist/psychiatrist about other options that would still be a group environment for me.",1517377175.0,False,1,4,Dyekaj,None,7u7pxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7u7pxg/question_about_therapy_us/
99,Psychiatrist reccomended Intensive Outpatient. Is it worth it?,"Long story short im 18 and Ive been suicidal+self harming since I was 10. Ive struggled with trauma, disordered eating, skin picking, anxiety, etc you get the idea. I feel bad like 90% of the time and its been this way as long as i can remember. Ive been on meds and therapy on and off (currently about to start meds, seeing a therapist)

So basically I saw a psychiatrist and she said that from my ""levels of distress"" i should really consider Intensive Outpatient Programs.

I'm good student who always shows up to class and gets A's and B's only, I work part time and am always reliable. I've learned how to dissasociate myself from my emotions so I can easily calm myself down and stay safe when things are a lot. I don't intend to kms in the near future.

102,"Depressed? Feeling down, blue, worthless, guilty, etc.? Here are some steps that might helps.","
I'm noticing a trend of lots of people having depression or symptoms of depression. I wrote this in a reply but this might help others. These are just OPTIONS. I'm not a doctor so follow these steps at your discretion. 

Most people think depression is being sad but it's actually a lot of different feelings and behaviors:  loss of interest/motivations/energy, feeling worthless/ guilty or helpless or both, sleep and eating change usually happens, feeling numb, sometimes anger, feeling tired (like bone weary), mind feels like there is cotton or molasses that makes concentration and memory hard (DSM-5). 
So here are some first starting steps that might help:

 1. Seek a therapist. Usually you can do it on psychologytoday.com. if you don't like your first therapist KEEP LOOKING/TRYING. you're probably not going to click with everyone and different therapist have different t personalities and approaches. There usually many private practices and one main local community mental health. Try to find one that specualizes in your symptoms (e.g. depressive, eating disorder etc)

2. Anti-depressant and anti-anxiety. Lots of different views on pharmaceuticals I know. Again. This is just different options that people can take. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL OF THEM. Consult with you PCP/Doctor/Psychiatrist  and be HONEST.  Your symptoms do not make you ""crazy"". But I must underline, should you choose to take this route be open and honest with you doctor and ask questions. And sometimes meds can take up to a month to start taking effect.  I would emphasize a psychiatrist consultation in case theres other mood dysregulation going on (e.g. bipolar, trauma, OCD etc.) but I know psychiatrist aren't always easily available in all areas. 

3. Anxiety and depression go hand in hand. Your brain sometimes gets exhausted with over thinking and worrying all the time that it goes in shut down mode. 

4. Take a look at these negative thought patterns and see if you are doing any of them. It's hard for your brain to get better if all it does is beat itself up.  Hopefully you'll become self aware when you do start thinking that way to stop it before it gets worse.  https://www.thebestbrainpossible.com/negative-thinking-depression-mind/

5. Make a list of your support people. Have it handy always. These are the people you can 100% lean on for crisis and emergency and you know they will handle it in an appropriate manner and won't escalate the situation.  Crisis puts a lot of people in fight or flight mode so of you need to plan out with them a crisis plan so they know what to do that may be a good idea.  Should major emergency happen ER or police can be an option. Also, you may need to remind yourself that these people will NOT BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU.  That is a lie that depression tells you. You. Are. Important. 

6. Suicide hotline 1-800-273-8255.  Have it in your phone. You never know when an SI (suicidal ideation) can hit or what could trigger it. Even if its passive ideation it can snowball quickly. USE. IT. IF. YOU. NEED. TO.  It's FREE, it's CONFIDENTIAL,  and it is 24/7.

7. Any local 24/7 crisis assessors in the area? A lot of hospitals and local community mental health providers have them. They can assess and get you referred to the appropriate services. They can also cert it with insurance. 

8. There are different types of mental health services. The usual is outpatient. It's usually once a week for an hour. 

There's IOP which is usually 9 hours a week. Most people think of IOP as substance abuse but it can also be for just psychiatric concerns (psych IOP and CD IOP). 

Partial Hospitalizatuon program (PHP) is a step up from IOP and a step down from inpatient. ~20+ hours a week.  Its ""day hospital""  you're not living in the hospital but your there for most of the day.  You don't need to be medically monitored 24/7.

Then you have inpatient acute- where you are IN the hospital to just STABILIZE overnight. This stay is usually 3-7 days average but it depends on severity and insurance. This is where your safety or safety of others go.  You are monitored 24/7 by a medical staff (they usually do rounds at night) 

Rehab- in the hospital for substance abuse concerns. 

Residential- long term. Most cases a person will have many failed treatments or long history of treatments. Foe kids (under 18) social service usually needs to take custody for an adolescent to be in residential but NOT always. 

9. Carry your insurance card on you. If you are fearful of losing it have a copy. Facilities need the card to cert for services or else you will have a HUGE bill.

10. Financially strapped? Some places have a sliding scale service. Call and ask about it. Worse case scenerio, go outpatient session once a month. Something is better than nothing. 


Hopefully this helps.

105,I don't know what else to do,"It's been 8 months since my (20F) attempt. I was inpatient for 6 days then released to IOP where I went for 10 weeks (6-4 weeks longer than usual). I was then admitted back to inpatient and was there for 2 weeks, and of course, released into IOP for a few weeks till I finally got a bed at a residential treatment center. I lasted 5 days there (2-6 weeks shorter than what might have been necessary for me) before voluntarily discharging myself because I felt it wasn't the right fit. Currently, I'm noticing myself slipping once again and now I blame myself for the mistake I made when I signed that paper to go back home.

I live at home with my family right now. Growing up, my parents' relationship was abusive so I've witnessed things, heard arguments, yeah yeah. I haven't talked to my biological dad for 10 years after something he did. My relationship with my siblings (we are all close in age) also isn't exactly what I'd hope for. I've been put through a lot by one sibling in particular when I was younger (physically and emotionally). My relationship with my mom is also nothing close to what a relationship with a mom should be, and she has also and continues to put me through hell (physically when I was younger and emotionally to this day). None of it can come close to what others have been through, but it's taking a toll on me.

When I attempted, my at-home environment was terrible. I had no friends to talk to, no support whatsoever. I was completely shut down. I was facing comments all the time from my mother regarding me staying in my room for multiple days straight, not talking or eating or drinking. The majority of these comments were about me not taking part in chores or looking after our dogs. Making me an inconvenience. I, in a depressive state, was an inconvenience to her. Now throughout my treatment, her support was never there. She played a big part in why I was admitted for the second time within 3 months of my initial attempt. The home environment didn't get any better, and she continued to yell at me for unnecessary reasons, cuss, and show me how much I was an inconvenience to her when I needed to attend IOP (I don't have my license). I was back in inpatient for 2 weeks, because my doctor there didn't feel comfortable sending me home after family sessions went terrible. My mother would make them about her or about how I needed to be more productive, when the initial conversations were supposed to be making my environment the safest it can be (all of these precautions she was told to take to keep me safe, she would listen, agree, but never follow through). When I went back home, nothing that was supposed to be done (storing medications away from me) was done. She never listened, she never supported me, she only ever complains.

Now, along with being diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I was also diagnosed with ADHD back in April. I've always struggled with getting tasks done, getting distracted, and not processing things fast enough. But even now, knowing this is why, and I have still been doing my best, she's threatened to kick me out multiple times because I'm still struggling and everything isn't being done on her time. Because again, I'm still an inconvenience to her.

She told me a while ago to apply for disability when I wasn't working (I've recently got a job, but in my state now, I don't know if I can handle it) and the process is still ongoing. Today I asked her to deliver papers that are due to help my case, which she was also sent papers to do but never touched because she said ""what's in it for me"". I'm desperately wanting to move out before she gets the chance to do it herself. I'm doing what I can, and at the same time, she continues to contradict herself, confusing me, and leaving me feeling worse every single day. I feel like if all this continues, I'll end up back in the hospital which I don't want. I have countless medical bills and no money in my account right now. It's like the most amount of weight and more is on my shoulders, and I have no bit of support to get better or leave on my own from my mother who refuses to genuinely care or help. My sisters also do not help the situation with the endless comments they make to me, about me, and so on. I've had multiple breakdowns since being home from residential and they're becoming more frequent, which I know is a sign that I'm getting worse again.

I am scared about cost and it affecting my schooling, since I am currently (hopefully since my academics plummeted because of it and I am somewhat behind though there is a shot I can graduate on time). I  would like advice on what to pursue that may be most effective. The most severe things that are probably happening are:

\- Semi-regularly self harming (While out of schooling it tends to happen once a week to twice a month, but while in school it occurred as frequently as twice a day at it's height). Usually just give myself bruises and  petechiae (little red dots) but a couple times I have accidentally drawn blood, but no more than one would from a paper cut. I also have recently begun slapping myself in the face if I am about to cry since my family does not handle my crying or any strong emotional responses well. My self harm is for self regulating or as punishment when I do something bad.

\- I have been hospitalized once for said self-harm by my boyfriend's prompting because I was attempting to make my self harm draw blood. I was not put in residential or anything, and was discharged with the expectation I would pursue IOP (which I did not). Since I self-harmed without the intention to die and I wasn't able to draw blood they kinda let me talk my way out of being admitted with the excuse that I wouldn't be able to complete my finals and that my family would be unable to pick me up and take me home if I got admitted (I am an out of state college student, and the school is close enough where a plane would be impractical, but driving is still a major hassle, so pickup plans can't be changed on short notice) . 

\- I frequently have suicidal thoughts, but with no plan other than vague ideas of getting someone mad enough to kill me, though recently I have begun to consider throwing myself down a flight of stairs, but without the intention of dying

\- While I still eat at least one meal a day, I feel very guilty about it, try to avoid eating around others, and on bad mental health days I get really picky with food and if I can't have those I won't eat until I become too dizzy or in pain that I need to.

\- I recently began age regressing to cope, which causes me to sometimes go nonverbal in intense moments of distress and more prone to crying than I used to be, which can cause issues around family or in public

All of a sudden something snapped and I lost all of that confidence. There was no event that happened other than school starting up again but I lost my composure and just felt like a wreck. I would do things to try to feel better and I developed an OCD-like mindset of trying to fix myself. I would try to be mentally strong and think positively but it didn't seem to have any effect on anything.

Usually just give myself bruises and  petechiae (little red dots) but a couple times I have accidentally drawn blood, but no more than one would from a paper cut. I also have recently begun slapping myself in the face if I am about to cry since my family does not handle my crying or any strong emotional responses well. My self harm is for self regulating or as punishment when I do something bad.

- I have been hospitalized once for said self-harm by my boyfriend's prompting because I was attempting to make my self harm draw blood. I was not put in residential or anything, and was discharged with the expectation I would pursue IOP (which I did not). Since I self-harmed without the intention to die and I wasn't able to draw blood they kinda let me talk my way out of being admitted with the excuse that I wouldn't be able to complete my finals and that my family would be unable to pick me up and take me home if I got admitted (I am an out of state college student, and the school is close enough where a plane would be impractical, but driving is still a major hassle, so pickup plans can't be changed on short notice) . 

- I frequently have suicidal thoughts, but with no plan other than vague ideas of getting someone mad enough to kill me, though recently I have begun to consider throwing myself down a flight of stairs, but without the intention of dying

- While I still eat at least one meal a day, I feel very guilty about it, try to avoid eating around others, and on bad mental health days I get really picky with food and if I can't have those I won't eat until I become too dizzy or in pain that I need to. I feel gross when I eat, regardless of the food and how healthy it is, and I have really bad body dysmorphia already 

- I recently began age regressing to cope, which causes me to sometimes go nonverbal in intense moments of distress and more prone to crying than I used to be, which can cause issues around family or in public

There are many other things but those are the main things that cause the most physical harm for me. I have done telehealth therapy through video calls, group therapy for improving of social skills, in-person individual therapy, and used wellness apps. Thank you.

119,A fucking mess,"Today is not good. The doctor at my IOP program brushed me off completely and said all my feelings were anxiety caused from smoking pot one time 4 days ago. That the anxiety was causing my destructive impulsive behavior, lack of sleeping and not eating for 2 days.

122,I'm getting worse the more I explore. I'm afraid I'm slowly losing control,"Hi, my name is Phil, and I have schizoaffective disorder, bpd, ptsd, and general anxiety. I've had a few breakdowns in my life but have always been able to flip and switch and carry on to be ""normal"" - working, socializing, dating, exercising, etc. Unfortunately, it always comes back to the breakdowns, and they get worse each time.

This current patch I've been going through had me realize that my state of normalcy has always been repression. The lack of emotions, apathy, sociopathic behaviors, etc. are all ways for me to unhealthily cope with my conditions. As I recognized this, I decided to explore on trying to open myself up to emotions this time around.

It's not going well. My mood is unstable as hell. I'm impulsive as ever. I can't hold a basic conversation in person. I haven't worked in over 2 years. I have no friends irl (tbf I do have a few online friends). I feel like I'm slowly losing control of myself. This isn't for a lack of trying though. When I got out of residential last year, I started going to meetups, played rec sports, joined Discord/gaming groups, went on dates, practiced my skills, went on hikes, joined a gym, picked up an instrument, trained to be a volunteer, joined support groups, and so much more. Of course, I continued to see an outpatient therapist and a psychiatrist. Yet here I am. Alone and insane.

After my recent hospitalization due to mania, my therapist has suggested that I go back into higher care, but I already know what to expect. Higher level of care no longer does anything for me other than provide structure and imprisonment. Rogers, Sheppard Pratt, or any other hospital program will regurgitate DBT (rarely RO-DBT), a little CBT, and exposure work down your throat as if it's the cure-all for everything. If you're not familiar with skills, yes, these programs can be helpful. However if you've already been through these multiple times via inpatient/residential/php/iop, it simply becomes a waste of money. Then of course there are things like TMS, ECT, and ketamine that can relieve symptoms temporarily from time to time. Unfortunately, nothing has worked for me.

So, where do I go from here? Keep trying while I see myself slowly deteriorate into an uncontrollable thing? Maybe flip back into repression mode again for things to get even worse later? I guess I'm just tired. I want to live but don't care to live if this is what I am destined for.

124,Kaiser Lost My Psychiatric Report,"About 2mo ago, I wound up in the Kaiser ER for psychiatric reasons. Earlier in the day, I had received the official results of a psychiatric assessment (via another, unrelated, organization). I was distraught, and the other organization recommended the ER. I brought the diagnoses from the other organization and provided them to the doctor - I can't remember if they were a psychiatrist or a psychologist - who saw me. I wasn't hospitalized, and left with an intake appointment scheduled for Intensive Outpatient Therapy (IOP). I went to the intake appointment, but haven't been able to start the program.

Today, I went to see my regular psychiatrist, talked about starting the IOP, discussed adjusting some meds, etc.

This is the first time I've seen him since going to the ER. He had no clue about the report from the other organization. When he pulled up Kaiser's report from the ER visit, there wasn't even anything listed that the psych doctor saw me, just a note from the ER doctor that I'd been at the other organization first and that they requested for me to see the psych doctor before leaving the ER, in case I needed to be 5150'd. My IOP intake appointment was a different day and had its own notes.

My mental illnesses do not involve visual hallucinations, and my fiance - who was with me - confirms that I saw a psych doctor and gave her a copy of the psychiatric assessment. I have already requested that the other organization send over another copy, but I'm upset. I feel like I shouldn't have to be the one to tell him what my diagnoses are. I know I have him the right info, but how does HE know that?

What happened to that report? Why are there no notes? Don't they have a legal obligation to keep my info for a minimum period of time? 

This was one of the worst days of my life and it was absolutely terrifying being trapped in that ER room with a guard to keep me from leaving. It was HARD. And yet, it's like that doctor didn't care enough to write up notes and include that report? I can only hope that it was shredded instead of randomly ending up who knows where...

I feel disrespected and like they didn't care. I'm angry and hurt and, while I know that the intensity of my reaction is in part due to emotional regulation issues, I can't help but feel that they fucked up, and I'm going to file a complaint in the hopes that this doesn't happen to someone else. I'm choosing to do it online because I can better control what I'm saying by text than by calling or in person.

I've struggled for a long while with my mental health. I was to the point where there literally was no point. Nothing could shake me out of it. Almost nothing anyway. I got myself into iop and I started medication for the first time in my life.

I'm learning how to deal with my diagnosis's and learning how to be kinder to myself, something I can't remember actually doing ever.

Changes I've noticed. I actually took my youngest on a play date instead of freaking the hell out and backing out last minute. I've been more social. I LOOK different. I mean I really look different and other people are noticing. I go running every night now, instead of hiding in my house.

I've quit smoking, which was something I never thought I could do again because it was my stress relief. My marriage is improved by so much.. None of these changes happened over night and I'm still struggling to stay steady but it's getting better. It took some playing around with my meds before I really started to switch to healthier mindsets and even now, I'm fighting my intrusive thoughts, learning to redirect them.

Tonight at the grocery store, I had an embarrassing moment and someone noticed and made a joke. Before I would have abandoned my groceries and left. Tonight, I joked back and actually laughed with them. I'm still in iop and will be for a few more months.

129,Need advice/reassurance,"I’ve always struggled with my mental health, specifically anxiety & depression. I tried begging off of my antidepressant a few years ago & was off of it for about 5-6 months. I slowly started to feel worse until I had a moment of extreme panic & what I think to be derealization. I felt like I had no control over my thoughts & would very quickly panic and sometimes have to go to the ER. I don’t recall ever feeling like that up until that moment 2 years ago. Now I feel it semi often unfortunately. After my dad passed away in December I’ve been trying to find a medication that works for me. I used to be on Zoloft for 7 years then switched to lexapro. Lexapro did not work for me & when I tried to get back on Zoloft it unfortunately did not work either. I am currently on Prozac 40mg. For the most part I do think I felt/feel an improvement with the prozac but I still have awful moments, like right now. I’ve been sick & going through a lot of stressful situations which I’m sure isn’t helping, but right now I feel off mentally. I feel very panicking, obsessive thoughts, and overall mentally I just feel empty & very low.

131,Having trouble finding a doctor who can support my mental health leave,"I reached a point where my mental health just prevented me from working. Fortunately my employer offers a short-term disability program that covers mental illness. I talked to coworkers who said people do it all the time. You just need a doctor to sign off on it, and any doctor can do it.

At this point all I needed was a doctor to sign a 3 page form and to adjust my medications.

But...

1. My therapist is supportive, but they're in another state and don't have a doctorate
2. My primary care physician says it's a ""niche area"" and requires a specialized doctor. I know this is false because people get a regular PCP to do this all the time.
3. My psychiatrist said that I said I was fine during my last few appointments, and that she wouldn't sign the paperwork because I hadn't been hospitalized and wasn't in an IOP. I've been told by people they've done this at multiple companies, and this has never been a requirement.

Literally all I need is a medical/mental health professional to fill out a 3 page form. But that seems to be a tall order because apparently I had a mental breakdown at an inconvenient time of year.

So here I am with paperwork due in 4 days (two of which are holidays) that determines whether I'm going to get a month's pay or keep my job, and I have no doctor I know I can go to for support. I'm anxious and despondent, and if I have to go back to work, I'm going to quit because I'm just unable to work at this point.

My mental health is worse than it was when I started, *and* I'm without a psychiatrist or doctor I feel I can trust. What started as just needing some time to recover and an adjustment to my meds has now turned into a full-blown crisis. Having my own psychiatrist essentially say ""You haven't been hospitalized; you're fine"" without so much as interviewing me is incredibly traumatic. I feel like I need some time to recover just from the process of taking time off to recover.

This is the lowest point I can recall my mental health ever being, and I'm including having lost 3 cats and painfully ending 2 long-term relationships. And it was entirely preventable just by having responsive medical care.

I don't know what to do at this point. I feel like if I go to another psychiatrist and tell them where I'm at, they're not going to believe me either, particularly if I tell them my previous psychiatrist thought I didn't need leave.

137,how do you move forward after something unhelpful,"I’m getting ready for my third round of psychological testing. The first two times I was frankly in crisis with my anxiety. I was pursuing an ADHD diagnosis and both times I was told I had all the adult symptoms, but not enough childhood symptoms. The second time I got this answer I had a breakdown that ended with me in the hospital. (I wasn’t admitted and I took all the steps I could to keep myself safe). Now that I’m going to finally do a complete psychological evaluation, I’m scared it’s going to be the same answer. I’ve been talking this through with my partner and my therapist, and I’m still scared to death. Am I about to waste money? My insurance likely won’t cover it, but finding a place that will take my insurance means waiting 6-8 months and possibly not as in depth and not as good quality/treatment. 

My therapist posed this idea that maybe I can be grateful that at least knowing it’s just anxiety/depression means it’s treatable. And my issue with that is, my breakdown was triggered because I felt hopeless that I had tried everything to “fix” the anxiety and depression and it didn’t work. Looking back, I had done everything I could have done for myself. After that ordeal, I went to an IOP for my anxiety and got on different meds. And that worked. 

Until it didn’t. I’m going to therapy every week. I’m doing med checks. I’m practicing my skills everyday. And I’m still not able to live life without feeling like I’m behind and wrong. My time blindness has me late to anything I go to at least ten minutes late. Work. Social activities. My sensory issues have been just increasing. And I’m trying to prepare myself for the possibility that it’s “just anxiety and depression” again. But I just don’t know if I can handle it again. Hearing that answer in both stable and unstable states of mind. It just feels like being stuck. Like I’m never going to able to accept my progress if it can be “cured” or “managed better”. 

I don’t want to sound ungrateful or like a bitch about this. I know that I’m fortunate to even have this opportunity and the money to do it. But people in my life have said things that imply that I’m doing this unnecessarily. People being my own mother. And usually my dad is the one who shoots me down about everything.

138,"Went off my meds (with psych's permission) so I could go on a different med. Now I'm really, really depressed, and I don't know what to do.","F17. I've been on 6 or so meds in the past year and a half. Prozac, Mirtazapine, Buspirone, Paxil, Lexapro, and now Effexor. 

I've had anxiety my whole life, depression for the past few years, all that jazz. Been suicidal for a while, did an IOP program, started Lexapro, got better. Or so I thought. 

The lexapro worked for my depression, but now anxiety. But it stopped me from being suicidal (for the first time in like a year and a half) because it helped with the depression. I was having some arm numbness and extreme lack of appetite that I thought was from the it, though, so I went off of it. It's out of my system now, I still have no appetite, and my arms are still kind of numb. 

I started Effexor two weeks ago, and I'm still depressed, PLUS now I can't sleep. I'm at 37.5, planning to go up to 75 tomorrow. I've been suicidal every other day, easily triggered, crying a LOT, irritable, yelling at people. 

My two options are to go back on the Lexapro, which won't help my anxiety, or keep going on the effexor, but in the meantime, be doing really badly. 

I don't really want to go back on Lexapro, even though I really really miss not being depressed. If I stay on the effexor, I feel like I need something to take the edge off, but I don't know what I could suggest to my psych. 

Or, I could suggest another med entirely. Does anyone have any suggestions?",1610499579.0,False,3,18,unknowncalicocat,None,kw5akd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kw5akd/went_off_my_meds_with_psychs_permission_so_i/

148,"My Thought Loop feels like a Problem that Needs to be Solved, do I Ignore or Solve?","For a while now (two years eight months) I've had mental health problems. It started very suddenly in September of 2020 for what I assume was me lagging behind on schoolwork because I walked into the lions' den by starting to play video games during breaks, which then little by little grew until I was faced with more assignments than I was used to (in retrospect it was only like 3 late ones which to me feels pathetic now lol but it was so overwhelming at the time that I avoided it and it grew exponentially). Ever since that relatively small event I felt like there was something wrong with me, like something clicked. 

I searched and searched until very recently I became self aware that there wasn't really ever a problem, or at least I think so. SSRI's didn't do anything and I never presented real symptoms of chronic depression or anxiety and only had these cursory anxious feelings that felt like they came from a bigger source (diagnosed with MDD and GAD for some reason). Now I'm pretty sure these  issues have grown into an obsessive thought loop, which may be OCD, as my new psychiatrist prescribed me new meds for it but it's not diagnosed yet so I won't say I have it. I constantly have a recurring thought of this weird mental image of the past, but nothing in particular. Almost like I pause time and ask myself ""Am I good?"" constantly. This mental image of a static timeline and concrete past nearly instantly spikes my heart rate and my heart flutters, so clearly there is a subconscious fear of something, most likely failure.

Now that we have a background, I'd like to ask, should I ""ignore"" the problem by widdling away the thought loop until it's gone, or try to tackle it head on like I've tried for so long to no avail? For the former it feels more realistic and sensible but the latter idea gnaws away at me, the idea of it just being fixed. I know it's possible for it to completely go away since I've never really had symptoms of any mental illness before September 2020, but I'm not sure about my path. I was an IOP for a while because I was so immersed in thought I didn't want to go to school, so outpatient was just a good temporary alternative, but I returned recently and will be seeing my normal outpatient provider tomorrow just so y'all don't ask me to get a therapist (I know it's good intentions tho).

149,Keep hitting a new rock bottom ,"The last few years of my life have been horrible and every time I think I’ve hit rock bottom and go “The only way is up!”, something else happens that brings me down even farther. I feel utterly hopeless about life and sometimes genuinely wish I weren’t here anymore. 

Starting from the end of 2021 to now, I ended a 4.5 year relationship, had 3 terrible moves, lost my dad to a stroke, almost died in a firework accident, got into another relationship that was fantastic, but I totally self sabotaged - which for the past 7 months has lead me to a deep depression and a dark pit of regret. She started dating someone else right afterward and boasted about it online. This lead me to a mental breakdown of uncontrollable sobbing, which lead to involuntary laughter. Had to go to the ER. I thought that was the lowest. I was wrong. 

The industry I’m in is falling apart at the seams and there is currently little to no opportunity for upward trajectory toward the goals I’ve had for years anytime soon. 

I figured I’d take some time to travel to places I’ve always wanted to go, so I subletted out my room to go explore Japan and South Korea, work remotely, and get back in touch with my creativity. Initially I was excited, but I’ve stopped caring about that too. Granted I haven’t gone yet, but the spark isn’t there anymore. 

My second ex posted about how great her life has been for the first time in a while, all with her new bf and new friends. Then right around this time, I find my best friend unknowingly started dating my ex’s new best friend. I got to the point where I didn’t want to live anymore. No concrete plans to do anything, but I just felt trapped. Like there was no way out. Tbh I looked up the most peaceful ways for self deletion, but found that pretty much any method had risk of a brutal survival & permanent damage. That deterred me. Then I thought of all my friends and family and that deterred me more. Had several meltdowns of uncontrollable sobbing again. Destroyed my tv out of rage (granted I was throwing it out soon anyway). Then I just shut down. Ended up staying overnight at a mental health urgent care and started antidepressants. 

I planned to visit family before my big travels, but on the plane I had a full on panic attack before it even took off. Never had one before. I thought I was dying. Had to be let off the plane, but my subletter just moved in. So now I’m staying on the couch in my own home and have no idea when I’ll be able to actually do my trip. I’m completely adrift, still heartbroken, still grieving. I’m depressed, hopeless, passively suicidal, have anxiety, I guess panic attacks now?, and grieving multiple things at once. There is zero stability and there is zero passion to trade it off with.  

Now I’m at another low. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve tried multiple therapists, coaches, groups, etc. I keep reading books, listening to podcasts, but I just don’t know if I give a shit anymore.  Going to try an IOP and maybe a spiritual retreat, but it’s hard to find more strength. I don’t want to end things right now, but I’m just so exhausted. I don’t really want to exist either. I never expected my life to feel this miserable.

I started yet  another antidepressant, third or fourth since starting outpatient in march 2021 and I don't feel any different, just like with previous ones. I don't even think I'm actually depressed but she keeps stuffing me with that shit, without any results.
When I asked her what she's hoping will happen on this one she said that Zoloft didn't work because I'm not trying to get better hard enough.

At one point I gave up all my hobbies just to study and get better with school and studied for 3 hours minimum. I gained weight, lost it all back cuz I was borderline overweight.

If that's not enough I feel like im not enough, and there is nothing I can do about it. I already runned out of ideas. 

My therapist said that if I'm already blaming myself it doesn't matter what my doctor says and it's not about her at all, but I don't think that's right.

Also, I have had a hard time getting a therapist in my new city/state and when I went to see my dietitian, she brought me over to patient assistance and helped me get in contact with the programs they have (not therapy, still on the list though). I just got the call to come in for an intake for either IOP or PHP before my shift starts.

I've had a tough year last year. I moved in January to a place with a racists/homophobic jerk.

152,It gets better :),"Hi everyone, 
For over a year now I have been in treatment, ranging from residential treatment where I lived in a treatment center for 93 days, to inpatient stays at the hospital, to php, and iop. A year ago I had just been diagnosed with depression and now I am diagnosed with bipolar, severe depression and anxiety, and anorexia. On top of that I struggle a lot with addiction which is 50% of why I’ve been to residential. I also struggle with self harm pretty bad, I’ve cut burned scratched, anything I could do feel pain. I thought my life was never going to get better, I couldn’t stay sober no matter how hard I tried I gave up everything and It still wasn’t enough. As my use and self harm got more and more severe I reached a point where I woke up in the hospital because I had overdosed and was told I was going to treatment. After treatment I relapsed on cocaine ketamine Xanax and I self harmed worse than I had ever before. My anorexia took control of me and I could go 4-5 days without eating until my iop made me or else I would get sent back to rehab. I reached my rock bottom. The longest I had been sober was less than 2 weeks and same with self harm. But when u r at rock bottom you can only go up and I am happy to say i have gained 2 pounds I am over 2 months sober and almost 40 days self harm free. To anyone reading this who is in a horrible place I know that life feels like it’s not worth living and it’s never going to get better but please don’t give up.

153,BPD or gaslighting?,"I hope this is ok to post here, I just can’t get this experience out of my head. Sorry in advance for the long post. About 6 months ago I requested my medical files from my former HMO. When I got them, I found a BPD diagnosis no one had told me about. It made a lot of things click, not about how I personally feel but about how I had been treated at the time and since. 

I’d been recently discharged from a residential program for anorexia, and I was arguing with my providers over the fact they wouldn’t authorize or recommend PHP as a step-down from res. I’d gone straight down to outpatient because I refused to go back to their IOP program since I felt it had been traumatic the last time I was there (Only serving then vegetarian food then not believing me about my migraine triggers when I told them I can’t eat cheese, telling me it was all in my head and they couldn’t provide any other food options that didn’t have cheese as the main protein, kicking me out of program daily because I couldn’t finish lunch in 30 minutes before the timer went off and then sending me out to drive the 2 hours home sobbing daily while telling me I just needed to try harder, telling me it was all in my head and I should just stop when I started first gagging and then involuntarily vomiting during meals, and then sending me home again because it’s really hard to finish a meal in under 30 minutes when you’re forced to leave the room because you started dry-heaving and weren’t allowed back in until 5 minutes before the timer went off.... I could go on) and they wouldn’t provide another option other than their IOP. 

I eventually had to go back to the IOP after I immediately relapsed in outpatient and was once again told it was the only available option. While there, apparently my therapist diagnosed me with BPD. Her reasoning was that I was paranoid that all the providers were out to get me and I was overreacting to small things and causing scenes. The thing is, I really do think the providers were out to get me! They wouldn’t medically recommend PHP even though it was covered by my plan because the HMO would have had to pay for it out-of-network and didn’t want to. The residential place I’d been at tried to tell them it was entirely medically necessary, as evidenced by the fact I relapsed without it, but they wouldn’t listen and I just got marked down as attention-seeking. My therapist said I was acting out on eating disorder behaviors purposefully to get to a higher level of care because I just liked being taken care of at residential. I felt more like I was terrified of relapse and wanted to get out of it/prevent it in the future, but ok. 

The thing is, now that I know about my BPD diagnosis I can’t help but wonder if they were right and it makes me feel so guilty and embarrassed that I was trying so hard to get support when I didn’t need it. My current psych NP says I don’t have BPD, but I worry that I’ve fooled her since she hasn’t known me long and maybe I’ve just kept it hidden. I originally felt like I’d been gaslit by my therapist at the IOP program, I ended up feeling completely ungrounded and like I didn’t know what was true or false. I was constantly being told how I felt even when I didn’t think it was how I felt, and I ended up feeling so floaty and disconnected from reality. 

This was 3 years ago now, and finding that BPD diagnosis brought it all back. Ever since, I don’t know what’s real or what’s fake, or if I’m manipulating everyone around me and then lying to myself about it. I don’t think I fit most of the BPD diagnostic criteria, I’ve only ever had two relationships, both long-term, and Ive never broken up with anyone or felt like my relationships were unstable. I spend too much sometimes, but otherwise I don’t think I have any reckless behaviors. I don’t really identify with the idea of splitting, but I do sometimes see concepts in black and white especially when it comes to my eating disorder. I don’t think I’ve ever done that with people though. I don’t have mood swings and I don’t get angry or irritable often. But I did start mildly self-harming around the time this was all happening, and I have started to realize I have symptoms of depersonalization. I don’t know what’s true or not, and I hate knowing that I could be hurting other people by not acknowledging the diagnosis and getting treatment for it. I feel like I have that therapist’s voice in my head, overanalyzing and asking if everything I do is just for attention, and I don’t know anymore! I don’t feel confident about anything I do. Maybe posting this is just looking for attention and manipulating people into feeling sorry for me! I don’t think it is, but can I really trust myself when the professionals said I was attention-seeking and overdramatic? Probably not. I don’t know anymore. I just want to stop feeling so disconnected from reality and I don’t want to feel so confused anymore. 

Thanks for reading, I hope no one is offended by this, I really don’t want to buy into the stigma around BPD but I am scared of it since I feel like I experienced it at this program and since (I kept getting bumped down to outpatient because they “didn’t want to validate my eating disorder” even after leaving the HMO and hitting a new low weight. I was really struggling and kept being told one therapy session a month was enough to handle it. I realize now I gave them access to my old files and that BPD diagnosis. Or maybe they decided the same thing and also didn’t tell me). Please let me know if I’ve offended anyone and I can delete my post. I don’t know what I’m even looking for from this.

154,Dealing with my mental health,"The hardest part about dealing with mental health is that there comes a point in time when I’d it goes unchecked you just stop giving a fuck about everything. I’ve reached this point many many times. At least once a year since I was 15. 

For years, I thought I had major depressive disorder with psychotic features. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and whatever the term is that mixed with psychosis. The IOP program I attended this year where I got this diagnosis was so awful that I turned off my brain 95% of the day so I forgot the medical name. 

But Maybe it’s because I work in retail now but its become difficult to keep control of my emotions, and my paranoid thoughts and delusions exacerbate that even more so because I’ve always felt like everyone is out to get me. 

I’ve learned all the coping skills. Meditation, reality checking, deep breathing, you name it I’ve been taught it but that all only goes so far and don’t get me wrong, it has helped me so many times in my life, but no therapist or psychiatrist is going to ever help me I feel.

It's not just a momentary thing I have moments or episode when things get really really bad, but otherwise I live with this 24/7 voices and seeing things that arent there hallucinating seeing what seems like a clip of terrible things happening to myself or people I love, I have this chuckle that comes and goes as it pleases I've had it since my first real breakdown years ago my wife hates it, it makes her nervous I get it I laugh when I get really stressed so arguments are hard because it usually winds up with me laughing even though I dotn really mean to, it's just how i Express not knowing how the fuck to Express myself. It's not a joker thing I've seen the movie it's not like that at all for me.

I could literally go on for days talking about the fucked up shit I've done and dealt with but I dont wanna hold anyone up, I guess the point behind all of this was just I really wanna fucking blow my brains out but I won't so dont worry! I have my first psychiatrist appointment in a really long time today I'm pretty nervous about it but I need help because I cant keep doing this anymore.

A recent traumatic experience has flared up a lot of memories and feelings and reactions in my body which I’m guessing is just part of my situation right now because I know I have ptsd and I don’t have a therapist and I got kicked out of my iop group essentially because I wasn’t going and there’s just so much and I hate it…I don’t feel safe after what happened last night and I haven’t cried yet and I’m just reaching out into the void of the internet because of the lack of faith in the relationships I do have or lack of faith in myself or lack of desire idk I’m scared to confront this, but  I got out of treatment almost 6 months ago and I’ve just gotten so off track and i want to pick myself back up but im so tired, why am I so afraid?

I don’t need the program because I feel fine now!

This feeling is starting to fade away and today has dragged on. I have been evaluated by a psychiatrist and they do not diagnosed me with anything new but I feel so out of place. I feel so high during those days I feel great. Maybe I am just not used to being happy or maybe I am just overthinking. Has anyone had this experience with feeling stuck in their recovery?

I have been told I have Schizoaffective by 2 facilities, and a facility along with a transitional living, both from another state, have both said I have PTSD and listed so in my medical records. With inpatients and residentials included, I've been in institutions around 19 times since I was 18. That's NOT including outpatient programs such as PHPs, IOPs, therapy, psychologists, and different organizations. I've also been in 4 different states away from home for treatment. My mental health care experiences and treatment has often felt like tag or that I'm the hot potato, being thrown and shooed around. I've made a list of medications, it has 27 that I've tried since I was almost 18; It doesn't include medicines I may have forgotten let alone unconsciously forgotten whilst having them given to me while in institutions. I firmly believe, even still in my reminiscence, that I have medical trauma; due to neglect, minimizing, dismissal, and the ignoring and stigmatizing of me. I even found out recently, despite all the doctors who were supposed to help and educate me, that some of the psych meds I've taken while on birth control, that I still could've ended up pregnant. Not to mention, I also have hormone issues (still) due to some of the meds. My memory is horrible, I barely remember things from the past couple of years, let alone my teenage years, (and OF COURSE NOT) my childhood, or even from within the recent month or EVEN week. I've wanted to die since I was 10 or 11, with such obsessions and thoughts monopolizing my growing up. I'm an adult as well as childhood survivor of domestic violence and abuse, been bullied, and been an ugly outcast of society and of the world since childhood. My childhood, my whole adolescence, and even in adulthood, there's been too much pain. Having SI, body dysmorphia, self harm since childhood, the crippling anxiety, self-deprecation, feeling like (and seemingly becoming) a menace, everywhere I go-- the pain of not being able to do things functionally, feeling like I was generally more functional when I was 8 (despite family issues) than most of my teenage and even adult years... like, why should I be here? It's my life, my body, my choice, my brain as well as my soul and even my body has rotten here for too long, the atrophying of depression-- chronic fatigue where there's too many times where I sleep 12 - 24 hrs for sometimes weeks, being unable to care for myself let alone objects nor living things. It's difficult to concentrate, to maintain any presence let alone awareness, I already feel like a ghost, empty, a shell which is a sack of a body trapping me. My primary emotion(s) I carry for myself is shame and guilt, which is truthfully hate and anger that's developed over years for myself and general existence. I have no care in myself. It hurts to try; you mention insanity, I've lived it, from speaking up and out, suffering in silence, surrender, to literally losing control- it's been hopeless for me. I've known of euthanasia for a while, and euthanasia has been my dream for a long time. I think it would not only ""save"" my pathetic existence, but I would be free, and most importantly, able to carry out my dream of making the world a better place, as I wouldn't be taking up resources, I would save time, and as someone who not only feels horrid but has become so and a waste, it's how I would not only get to conserve my existence, but also the world’s. 

Any happiness I've had in my life has been either through trauma bonds, through addiction, or falsified trust.

* Do you accept my insurance? 
* What is your treatment philosophy/approach?
* What are your office hours and the length of sessions?
* What is your education, training, licensure, and years in practice? 
* Do you specialize in trauma/mood disorders/anxiety disorders?
* Are you accepting new clients?

I'm on 7 medications for my mental illnesses. I've been in the hospital over 30 times and every IOP/PHP they have. I've had ECT which has damaged my memory.

167,(USA) Is there anything like adult day care for mentally ill people and/or young adults? Looking for structure.,"Hi Reddit! I had great results coming to you in another mental health subreddit last year, so I'm trying again :) My wife is in her mid-30s with Dissociative Identity Disorder and Schizoaffective diagnoses. Bipolar 1, psychosis, plenty of paranoia, depression, PTSD -- the works. All from some extended childhood trauma. 

She's been in and out of hospitals for the last few years as needed, but she also gets steady treatment from a therapist and psychiatrist. PHP and IOP are great for her, but they're really limited in terms of time. They're over in a couple weeks, and she needs much more than that. The programming is definitely helpful, but the daily structure is the biggest help we think.

Her condition has worsened over the last few years, and part of what we're learning with the hospital visits is that with structure, her life and wellbeing are far better. Her therapist recently mentioned adult day cares, but they seem mostly targeted toward seniors. She's somewhat interested in trying one out, but here's my question. What are the best options for adding structure to a person's day? I'm lucky enough to be able to afford to hire somebody to help around the house with some things, but it doesn't solve the issue of structure. 

A job is out of the question for her right now, even part-time. And trying to maintain a self-structured day has failed (we've tried many approaches for this). We need a system and support, and I'm happy to pay for that if it helps her maintain focus, happiness, balance, and allows her to ultimately work on improving her mental health and get back to doing what she loves, which is painting (she's incredibly talented!)

I am convinced that the best thing is for me to just go away but I get emotionally destroyed every time I think about losing my wife and kids not to mention that if seek more intensive care for my mental health that I would be barred from a career that I have put half my life into making a reality.

(18f, USA)","Yesterday I got a letter from my psyhiatrist's office saying that they were terminating our relationship and would no longer see me, due to their belief that I need a higher level of care than what they can provide in their clinic.

I'm not on antidepressants anymore as they caused so many side effects and just made me feel shitty. Personally, I have a ton of trouble with pills, so when I last talked to my therapist, we talked about bringing up alternative med routes, such as IV or injection options. So I did just that at my last psychiatry appointment and I guess after that that's when they decided they couldn't put up with me anymore.

So now I'm at a complete loss. I can't get a ""higher level of care"" as my health is to poor physically (was literally denied residential twice for this reason), and I had tried to look into virtual IOP, but was told that they wouldn't allow me to do their programing, as they said I was to mentally ill and needed residential.

What are some alternatives to psychiatry that are good ways to get help for BPD? Holistic medicine maybe? 

I'm honestly so sick of psychiatrists. I've been through quite a few, and it's nearly always the same thing. \*Medical history, ""mhm mhm, here's your pills, bye"" \* Rarely am I asked what I think would help me, or given the light of day. They often make me want to die more because of their invalidation

My big issue right now is that I'm currently going through the process of trying to get SSI, primarily due to the fact that I can't work due to high fatigue levels and other symptoms from CFS/ME (my primary physical chronic illness), which is not at all easy. The government wants to see proof of ""real, by the book"" treatments. So going the holistic route may end up damaging the probability of winning my case.

my best friend, who we'll call hornet for the sake of anonymity, just left. she told me i'm too much and what sucks is that she was nice about it. she told me i deserve people who are more patient and understanding and that fucking sucked. for context, i've been diagnosed with BPD (( basically i feel emotions a lot stronger than other people do )) and she can't handle it anymore. i've been a burden to her for lord knows how long and i'm destroyed with guilt. we'd been best friends for six years and she sprung this on me out of fucking nowhere. 

i'm so lost. i know i'm the problem and i've been the problem for years but i don't know how to stop. i make too many sex jokes, i cope with humor over my mental health too much and make people uncomfortable, i'm too emotional, too clingy, and i literally can't help any of it; it's in my nature. i make sex jokes bc i was groomed during my time frame of developing social skills so that's what i'm programmed to consider normal; i cope with humor because everyone else does but mine is, admittedly, a bit worse than a few of my peers, so no one NEVER knows how to handle it // respond; im overly emotional because of my BPD; and i'm clingy because i need reassurance and i'm always scared people are going to leave me, again, because of my BPD (( desperate attempts to avoid imagined or real abandonment )) and also just trauma in general.

everyone at my school dislikes me because of who i am. i'm different; i like weird shit that other kids my age don't, i'm openly nonbinary and queer, i have pretty strong morals that i let dictate my friendships (( bc i'm not abt to be friends w/ some homophobic, racist piece of shit )) and bc of where i live, that limits me a lot and i'm just so fucking bad at making friends.

if anyone has any advice on how to fix this shit please feel free to leave it here because i'm so sick of being a piece of shit friend that causes more harm than good no matter how hard i try. how to turn off my emotions and be emotionless, how to keep my shit to myself and stop oversharing, how to actually fucking heal, if any of y'all got the answers leave me an essay and i will read all of it i am desperate to change. i'm sick of being abandoned and i'm sick of losing soulmates.

174,On the edge of involuntary commitment,"Tw: suicidal thoughts and ideations

Background, I’m in Pennsylvania, USA. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety disorder, PTSD and OCD tendencies. 

So, these last few weeks have been in a crisis, with passive suicidal thoughts, and we have been safety planning and doing all that and I’ve been spoken to about going into the hospital voluntarily multiple times or doing php/iop. So far I’m just out here vibing with my depression but now it’s turned a bit more active so of course therapy last night was a train wreck and I almost got 302’d. 

My therapist, wife and I did come up with a safety plan for the night, and she did tell me I almost got 302’d which is literally the last thing I want. My whole care team want me to go in voluntarily but honestly I’m scared and don’t know what to expect. I took off work today with my last sick day of the year, and my therapist set me a goal of calling HR to find out if I can get disability so I can get more intensive care for my mental health. She is going to be calling me tonight so we can discuss what I found out and safety plan for tonight, then tomorrow I meet with my psychiatrist, so I’m still not out of the woods of getting 302’d. 

If I go into a psych ward is rather go on my own but I’m terrified. I guess what I’m asking is - what’s it like? How long did you stay? Did it help? What do I even take with me? What happens after?

175,Can’t control chronic muscle spasms/tension. At my wits end and desperate for answers.,"29M diagnosed with:
Severe Chronic Anxiety
Panic Disorder
Major Depressive Disorder
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
PTSD
Fibromyalgia 

I am in Therapy, Psychiatry, AA & NA meetings, and soon to be IOP.  I’m almost 6 years sober but my body has virtually never stopped feeling like hell. 

Desperately looking for help from other professionals or anyone who has gone/is going through anything similar. 

My anxiety triggers terrible muscle spasms throughout my body and vice versa, but my muscles tend to stay knotted up unless I repeat the movement. Almost like the way a snake squeezes tighter the more something fights it, but in my case I’m trying exercises and tools I’ve learned from physical therapy/psychotherapy only for it to make it worse. The feeling is from within and is as if it’s pushing up outwards.

It became overwhelming to the point where I’ve hardly been able bathe myself in the shower, have to force my mouth open to eat/brush my teeth, or even wash dishes. Mortifying. I haven’t been able to hold a regular job for longer than a month or two after all these years. 

I used to think it was just poor mental health but a few doctors/therapists I’m seeing have said that this may not just be psychological. 

Physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga and chiro did not work. CBD, hot/cold water therapy, and stretching/breathing exercises don’t work. 

MRIs of my entire spine and head were clear except for very mild DDD in lumbar and nasal polyps/sinus inflammation. But my neurologist said after a year of appointments he does not think it’s a neurological issue but maybe a neuromuscular disorder/disease. I was tested for Lyme disease and that came back clear. 

Does anyone else deal with this potential spasticity? I’m currently seeing my PCP, neurologist, pain management doctor, therapist, psychiatrist, and just started seeing a podiatrist and cardiologist. 

I’m currently taking:

Paroxetine 40 mg once at bedtime
Seroquel 200 mg once a day a bedtime 
Buspirone 15mg 3x a day 
Hydroxyzine 50mg 3 times a day or as needed
Ativan .5 mg as needed (only have 1 of a 7 day trial left) 

The couple times I’ve gone to urgent care I was given 5 days worth of prednisone and that helped a decent amount short term. Tried gabapentin and topiramate with my pain management doctor but the side effects were too much. Chlorzoxazone and baclofen didn’t really work either.

176,"Infertility grief is making me sort of toxic, help","I (35F) learned at 33 that my fertility is drastically limited due a genetic mutation that has been quietly running in my family until I uncovered it with testing during my unsuccessful fertility treatments.

I have been in a state of continuous, looping grief for about 5 years of fertility treatments and I’m hitting a low right now. I feel like I can see my thoughts and behavior as toxic but I feel powerless to act that differently because I’m SO sad.

Things like - 

- ghosting friends and family who have children or are pregnant because it’s too painful to be around them, wishing they would stop getting pregnant so I wouldn’t feel so alone. I don’t think much about dropping a friend at this point because as soon as they have children I know we’ll never understand each other. That’s obviously not healthy 

- not wanting to see sisters in law or nieces and nephews - the pain is bigger than any happiness I get from being an aunt. My husband is very close with his family and is sad that I don’t seem to care for these kids.   He has to choose between going to family events alone or not going. I’ll go sometimes, but I might cry all day after we get home and then he has to deal with me 

- bitterness over how arbitrary this is - one gene can wreck everything for me while my peers happily go along building families, complaining about valid but very normal stressors of parenthood. I’m so bitter and after 5 years of heartbreak I’m starting to believe that optimism and hope are only for privileged and oblivious people. Pre infertility me would have seen this as a red flag, or at least thought “hmmm this person is a little negative for my taste…”

- I sometimes feel like it’s a cruel joke that I even exist.  A person with a built in time bomb like this.  I don’t understand how I’m supposed to survive a lifetime of this loss. I say things like this to my husband or close friends, even though I know they find it upsetting. So yeah I’m a really toxic person to be around now.

My poor husband (34m) is very kind and supportive and we do our best to communicate well and respectfully, but I know my sadness and anger is dragging us down. All my attempts to control my surroundings and be “safe” from children are going to impact our relationship. It is not cool to have an aversion to all the parents and soon-to-be parents in your spouse’s family.  

I’m not the partner I want to be, but it feels impossible to be the person I want to be because of my situation.  The pain is so huge and visceral that I don’t feel like I have any option to be some other way.  The person I want to be doesn’t have grief or infertility. It’s like I was chosen in the genetic lottery to suffer (and suffer, and suffer) when life is moving along with average ups and downs for everyone else. The arbitrariness is devastating to me. I feel trapped and like I’m self sabotaging. I’m very afraid of wrecking my marriage. I don’t want to be my wonderful husband’s toxic ex.

So… is this complicated grief? Disenfranchised grief? Ambiguous grief? How is a person supposed to heal from this or at least live through it and not destroy all their relationships?  Can someone recommend resources that might make sense for me? Or if you had the same experience, how did you keep the dark side from taking over?  I go to therapy but I basically just say everything I said here. I’m wondering if I should be seeing a specific grief or trauma therapist instead of my general women’s health/fertility therapist.

I even think about doing IOP for grief sometimes but will the people who lost living family members think I need to just get over myself?

177,I feel like there's been something off with my personality for years.,"Hi, all. I am about to confess some things about myself that I have never told another person before.  
I am 23F. I am an elementary school teacher, I am in a relationship and overall live a very happy life. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and bipolar disorder type 2 because of my unstable mood, obsessive thoughts and constant fear. But for years I have felt like it's something deeper than that.  
I have never had a hard time MAKING friends, but I have always had a difficult time KEEPING friends. At first, people usually perceive me as very outgoing, smart, bubbly, funny, and generous. People who have ended friendships with me have told me that I am self-centered, I act like the world revolves around me, I am annoying, extremely argumentative, and needy. The longest friendship I have maintained is over 10 years, but even that friend and I have had some bumps in the road and this person has expressed similar opinions about me.  
If I am describing my positive traits, I would say that I am talented, witty, creative, great with kids and animals (I LOVE taking care of animals and children),  
My INTENTION is never to hurt, offend, or lose someone because of things that I say. However, I do have a VERY short fuse and can get offended easily-- I am quite sensitive. I can be very sexually provocative and promiscuous-- I am in a relationship now, but even currently I still find myself being flirtatious towards other men and women (not that I would act on it but the thought of being desired is really appealing to me). I tend to look for arguments when something does not go my way and I can be very, very verbally (and sometimes, even physically-- shoving and pushing at MOST) aggressive during arguments. I tend to threaten things, such as breaking up and blocking people to get my way, although I have never and will never threaten to kill or hurt someone.  
The worst thing about me that I have not been able to get under control is my compulsive lying. Sometimes I find myself lying about very serious things to get attention, status, or sympathy. For example, I have lied about things that friends have said or done to me to make myself look like a victim in a situation that I caused. The worst thing I have ever lied about is being r\*ped. I was SA'd, but I over-exaggerated the story to make it sound worse than it was in order to get sympathy from people. I feel so guilty about the lying, I KNOW that it is a serious problem, and an absolutely awful thing to do to people, but in the moment I am so out of control of what I'm saying.  
I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type 2 when I was 20, and again when I was 22 during a PHP/IOP program, because I had exhibited episodes of both mania and depression ( STRONG EMPHASIS on the depressive episodes). I have attempted once, but have threatened to do so many more. With the (hypo)mania, though, I don't think my episodes were really MANIC episodes. Sure, I have felt strong grandiosity, had periods of neglectful sleeping and eating patterns, high productivity, etc., but they didn't last WEEKS or MONTHS like typical mania does. I for sure have anxiety, specifically social anxiety disorder. My current therapist things I have OCD. I have moments where I love myself, and moments where I LOATHE myself-- I will tell myself I am worthless, better off gone, incompetent, fat and ugly, and useless. I take Lamictal and Zoloft, which have been helping with my mood and anxiety, but this weirdness with my personality hasn't seemed to go away or been helped.  
Now, not that anyone here is a psychiatrist/psychologist (unless you are, hi!), so I am not expecting an accurate diagnosis, or even a diagnosis at all, based off of this post. I am trying to see if anyone here has ever experienced, done, or felt anything similar to what I have mentioned here, and what that means for you. I have never confessed these feelings to a therapist, a friend, a family member, a partner-- I know that I should, but it honestly feels so embarrassing to admit all of this and face reality of what I really do and feel. I really feel like there is something wrong with my personality and I want to face it head on and get the help I need.",1704043742.0,False,1,0,Additional_Career874,None,18vckn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18vckn8/i_feel_like_theres_been_something_off_with_my/
178,Very scared to bring up hearing voices to my therapist,"I don't really know why I'm posting, I think I need advice or maybe just encouragement. I won't get too deep into it because there is a lot to unravel about my mental health and most of it doesn't even make sense to me. I am not a danger to myself or others I'm just getting overwhelmed

I got assessed recently at a local hospital and did an out patient program for 2 months (I discharged 2ish weeks ago) I initially went in because I was having panic attacks caused by the voices, but I couldn't talk about them. I went in telling myself that I will tell them and get help for them but I could only talk about the panic attacks being random and about my trauma. I feel like I wanted to talk about the voices but they would tell me I am going to be put away for life or that no one will believe me and I felt like I physically couldn't talk about them. 90% of the time they're just there and not threatening but with this isolation and quarentine its getting overwhelming even when they're just talking to me normally. The IOP program helped quite a bit with processing my trauma so that's what I made myself focus on while in the program. I've seen therapists most of my life for depression and anxiety but I can't talk about the voices (I told 1 therapist when I was around 15 and she immediately told my mom who said I was saying this for attention) I see an individual therapist and psychiatrist now but I can't tell them about it. I don't know if any of this even makes sense I feel all over the place, I need help I want it to stop. I am really really scared no one will believe me.

180,I Can’t Remember Being Happy,"     I 18M don’t know how to express to others how I feel, I don’t think most guys do well with emotions, but I, in the most recent series of unfortunate events, I have to go through withdrawals because apparently everyone is out of the anti-depressant I need.
     My parents had me when they were too young, all I remember of being young is being hit and crying while locked in rooms, by the time I was 8 I realized the way I was living was not how people normally lived, I think that’s when the depression really started, when everything began to come into perspective to myself. My mom is bipolar and probably a sociopath, grandparents were weird on her side, they weren’t bad to me but I think my mom is the way she is because of how they treated her. As for my father by the time I was 3 he was essentially out of the picture for 9-10 months of the year. Had a late growth spurt (16-17ish) and was bullied for my size basically up until that point. Years of being beaten, some of the most brutal being used as a bowling ball down a driveway into trash cans (chipped my tooth, luckily not an adult), and being beaten with metal poles (the ones that hold up a stereotypical backyard trampoline. All ambitions were crushed by my mom or stepdad (drill sergeant; figures) because they weren’t big enough, from Youtube, to Software Engineering, to Game Design, to fucking Cybersecurity, all because they wanted me to inherit my grandpas (mom side) construction company, or join the army. Grades were never good enough, if they’re weren’t A’s and B’s they had to be, if not all A’s they had to be, have all A’s? Well A-‘s don’t count, besides physically abuse throughout my childhood I also received disproportionate punishments, say I disobeyed one order, even if I did not disobey I just didn’t execute in a timely manner, I could be grounded for upwards of 3 months. From everything, I would lose power to my room on dozens of occasions, WiFi most certainly was nearly 50% of the time disabled, toys were donated away. We weren’t poor, possibly upper middle class, but no luxuries were allowed, take a shower for more than 5 minutes a bucket of ice would be dumped on your head. Naturally I attempted to reach out for help, but then my mom would make up lies, tell one sided stories about how awful other people were. She convinced me my father didn’t love me or want me, that my grandma was a pedophile, that she wasn’t the manipulator but actually everyone else was. I’d have lulled myself by now, but when school started (high school) I moved schools essentially at the start of the year and I discovered wrestling, hate it, think it looks stupid or what, but my team and my coach saved me, not that I didn’t still get bullied or hazed, but I always had 20-25 brothers or sisters who would step in front of a gun for me. When I took my chance to escape junior year and come live with my dad the only thing I regret is I left the only people who I ever felt like were my family. Shortly after leaving one of the only people I care about in this world, besides probably my dad, my aunt/nephews (moms side), and sisters killed himself, I was already depressed but for the last year it has been eating me alive every waking moment that I should have been the one to die and not him, we were the same me and him, always laughing the loudest, doing goofy shit to get others to chuckle, taking center stage for the dumbest reasons. I should’ve known he had the same problems I do, I never got to say goodbye because I left so quick I couldn’t even go to his funeral because in order to do so I would have to spend at least. 1.5 weeks with my mom, my dad said he wouldn’t take me otherwise.  The day he killed himself is coming up, and even though I’m free I feel lost and like I dug through rock bottom and found hell. I don’t even have the roadblock of the antidepressants anymore so I feel this all magnified. I don’t know if I want to kill myself but I want to die. Oh yeah I had a therapist, but a couple of months ago she tried to send me to IOP with the hint that it could lead to hospitalization. One of the things she told me that sticks with me is she told me that when I was talking to her it felt to her like a game of cat and mouse, like almost telling her about myself but then stopping thrilled me and all I got out of the therapy was self satisfaction. I think I do it subconsciously, but sometimes I think I’m just as manipulative as my mom and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. No one know this whole story, I can go deeper in details but  I don’t see the point this is already long enough.

181,Compulsive faking of mental illness,"I can’t live like this anymore. I have this compulsive need to make myself seem sick. I don’t think I’m really bipolar—I think I have exaggerated things in order to be diagnosed. I take meds that I don’t like and don’t believe are good for me just to validate to myself that I have this disease. I also feel like I have exaggerated symptoms of ptsd. I have exaggerated my trauma, although I do have an extensive amount. But apparently not enough. And I’m pretty sure I deliberately looked for and put myself in abusive situations because I wanted to be sick or to be able to say I’ve been through it, to decorate my ego. I have been in treatment an inordinate amount of times and I feel like it was all on purpose and for attention. 

Recently I went to rehab after people in my life held an intervention for me because of a situation I contrived. Yes I’ve drank and used drugs lately but I exaggerated the amount I’ve done, made it look worse than it was, and I even planned it. I wanted to be struggling with drugs so I’d have a reason to go away for a while in a cushy treatment center where I just got to talk about my feelings all day and ignore the world. That’s where I feel comfortable. 

I feel the urge and have even sort of started planning going out and doing heroin or meth or crack—which I’ve never done—literally because I know I’ll get addicted and have to go through hell and then end up in an AA or NA meeting, and then I’ll finally belong somewhere. Straight up wanting and planning to get addicted to drugs. Apparently cocaine wasn’t bad enough. Today at my IOP program, a therapist told me that my patterns remind her of a heroin addict—and I took that on with a sick sense of pride. I would literally risk my life—and have—just for attention and a sense of belonging. In high school I used to cut myself, and even attempted suicide once for attention and just to avoid my very ordinary problems, like school assignments.

This problem has put me in terrible predicaments I never needed to be in, and yet I can’t seem to stop. I feel like nobody will ever understand or be able to relate. If you can, please help me know I’m not alone. I’m in so much pain. I feel completely disgusted with myself and completely unlovable.

183,Frustrated & hopeless - I'm not sure of what to do,"So... I've been diagnosed with anorexia, anxiety, OCD and depression. I'm also nonbinary, have misophonia, and I'm too probably getting a diagnosis for autism soon too. (I personally don't think a diagnosis matters itself, but how it explains things and if it will help me understand myself. Just wanted to include them for background?)

All of my symptoms combine and it feels so shitty. I just feel so lost and hopeless, because I just keep feeling worse and nothing seems to help? I've done OCD PHP and IOP, and eating disorder PHP and outpatient therapy for multiple years, but I'm just really struggling.

In those groups, a lot of it was just facts about OCD/eating disorders and exposure/CBT. What frustrates me is I know everything they are talking about and what I'm supposed to do. I understand it, but it's like something doesn't click? Also with my OCD, so much of it is mental and automatic, and I feel exposures just are hard to tailor to the way my brain works. So it almost seems like a waste of time trying to get those modalities to ""work""

Another part is I feel like I just can't connect or providers/other patients don't understand me - some of which is probably logical (like being NB and having an eating disorder) but I also understand how some of it isn't. 

My therapist and I have been talking about doing a residential program and I'm really not sure how much it would help (I'm not sure how much of this is the depression talking and how much it's actually me). A huge problem either way is that I feel like I won't get anywhere if I'm not ready to accept my thoughts and myself, and be okay with me being me. I know I want to get better/feel better, but at the same time I'm worried I almost want to get worse so that I can ""prove"" something (I don't know what?) or just get the courage to end this pain.

184,"Wish me luck guys, I’m trying one last thing to beat my battle with depression.","Sometimes I sit here and wonder how I got to this place. A place of loneliness, sadness and constant obsession with my own death. I’ve watched videos of myself as a child, I was Lively, Courageous, Social and Proud. I’m not that kid anymore, I haven’t been for a long time. I struggle to figure out where everything went wrong, why I am the way I am today, but I’m at a loss. 

I’ve tried counseling, medication, IOP treatment. But nothing seems to stick. I figure maybe I’m just so used to being down that I being up and better makes me uncomfortable. They do say that if you’re not uncomfortable, you’re not progressing. 

My next effort for my mental health is truing a change of environment. I’m moving from my hometown of Milwaukee to Houston. I can admit part of it is me trying to escape all the people who know me here. For some, I’m not a nice person. For others, I’m just weird. For some, I’m a nobody. Oddly enough, I think it’s that last one that hurts me most. I come from a huge family and I find myself drifting away from my family in my room at family events. I’m not sure what’s worse feeling lonely in a room full of people or feeling lonely while actually being alone. 

I think I go through severe Psychosis when I’m alone though. I talk to myself. I’ve even developed another life in my head. I find myself physically talking or at least mouthing things as if I’m talking to a person right in front of me. I can’t stop it. It’s how I cope with the loneliness. So maybe that one’s worse.

186,First flashback has me shook,"It’s been about three years since my mental health took a significant turn and put me through serious treatment. The signs were always there that my mental health was shit through childhood, but 2017 I battled with multiple suicide attempts, an eating disorder, and really got a diagnosis. I was hospitalized multiple times, did a long term ED inpatient/residential stay and spent months in a PHP/IOP program. In the end I got a handle on my BPD and PTSD from childhood trauma and have been putting the skills I learned in treatment to good use. Since then, I’ve been stable. Like, really stable. No medication changes. No real need to see a therapist on the regular. Aside from meds at night, things felt normal. I was managing all my symptoms and really happy with how my life was doing.

Until the other night. I think I had my first real “flashback.” My husband was amazingly supportive through it, but it’s left me shaken. It’s a new one for me. It’s thrown off my confidence in my mental health. It’s sent my anxiety into overdrive cuz now I worry I could have another and because it’s new for me, I only know what triggered the one, but not what could trigger another.

I dunno, I felt like I needed to get it off my chest to help with my anxiety. My family seems to freak out if I so much as share mental health awareness posts on social media, so I didn’t wanna talk about suddenly having a flashback with them and I don’t have a lot of friends I really share in mental health struggles with. I’m trying to decide what I want to do moving forward.

187,How do I file a grievance with the county/state authority against a place I recieved treatment?,"I went to an IOP/transitional living facility in July, and I lost so much progress due to irresponsible group therapy, family therapy, and facilitators openly picking on me in group. Also, it was a sober living facility in which hardly anyone any intention of staying sober, so I was surrounded by people relapsing or planning thier post discharge parties while trying to surround myself with people who could actually respect my desire to stay sober. It was   like this facility wasn't designed to help you help yourself, it was a test of how much in-group humiliation, pressure to drink, and insitgation from therapists designed to pit us against each other and our families we could handle. My primary  therapist told my parents they should not contact me because I was moving out of their house to get away from them. I didn't want to lose my parents; I just wanted to be in a home with less dysfunction. But when I tried talking to them, they said ""the herapist said yiu don't want us in your life so don't expect to be."" Took a month to get my parents back.

They don't have a patient advocate system from within, but I wouldn't trust it anyway. Is there a way to file.a grievance with their licensing board? I just want a complaint to be on file. As a mental health patient who has seen it all, I don't expect to be taken seriously. But also as a mental health patient who has seen it all, I know the treatment practices there were not really good.

188,Seeking strong sleep aid.,"I wake up in the middle of the night almost every night around 2AM, and again at like 5-6AM and I’m sick of it. It takes me forever to fall asleep and get tired. It takes a heavy pharmaceutical substance to knock me out and the ones I’ve been on before don’t work anymore. Thorazine was what I used before and it used to work really well for a while, even though it’s for schizophrenia, and severe manic episodes. I thought 300mg was a pretty high dose, and for normal people it is, but I guess it’s safe to take up to 1000mg but that’s for people who are hospitalized and under supervision. 
I have a medication hyposensitivity and it takes higher doses to help me with anything. Thorazine not typically used for sleep. I just need something to knock me out, man. My brain won’t shut off. I ruminate a lot and toss and turn for hours. 

Trazodone doesn’t work anymore and higher doses can cause serotonin syndrome, which I had recently and it was awful. 
I’m not willing to try over the counter sleep aids because of the weird side effects, and antihistamines don’t work on me either so Benadryl, and Atarax don’t do shit. Not even for panic attacks. 

Melatonin is weak and extended use can damage the body’s natural ability to produce it even at normal levels. Wish doctors would prescribe a strong medication with the end of the name being “-epam” but that’s hard to get and can be damaging long term since it’s a controlled substance. But I feel like I’m in need of something like that. 

Things like ambient noise, white noise, waves crashing at shore, thunderstorm sounds and music help slightly but not well enough. 
I sleep to thunderstorms and rain sounds. 
I find it hard to sleep without. 
Sometimes I listen to Ghibli music if my brain needs something to focus on until I can get tired enough to sleep. 

Exercise may help but I’m usually in too much pain (fibromyalgia) or too depressed to be active. 

I don’t feel tired but I’m tired of this. 
I need a normal sleep schedule for when I start classes. 

I have a psychiatrist office I’m going to work with on this, and have new patient paperwork to fill out before my first appointment but I don’t know if they’ll jerk me around and only do monthly appointments when I need weekly/biweekly until I’m more stable, instead of once a month. 
I wanted to find an IOP/PHP program but there are limited outreach opportunities in Alabama. I can’t find one. I frequently have suicidal thoughts and am not as stable as I’d like to be. Especially with sleep and sleep is so important for people with illnesses that I have. I can get really sick if I don’t sleep enough.

189,I have an assessment for an intensive outpatient program tomorrow.,"Bit the bullet today and called the most promising looking place in my city (i.e. doesn't have a ton of reviews all over the internet talking about the terrible conditions and lack of treatment like the majority of mental health facilities in my state do). I like their holistic approach  and the price isn't that bad after insurance ($1200 at 21 sessions, 3 sessions a week, hell that's cheaper than any therapist I've ever been to that wants friggin $100+ for each weekly session, sliding scale MY ASS)

I'm super nervous but also know this is something I need to do. Never done group therapy or taken psychiatric medication but I am very nonfunctional at adulting so I'm taking my hard to swallow pills that whatever I get on isn't going to fuck up my brain chemistry beyond repair (because I've already done that myself!)

Also don't know if I should do the IOP focusing on mental health or the dual diagnosis one. While I do have a substance abuse type personality my main and pressing problem is weed addiction, and I feel like it will be hard to talk about comfortably when everyone else in the group will likely be dealing with ""harder"" addictions (which I technically do as well, but have been clean for almost a year from hard shit)

190,Lack of support over the past week or so starting to take it's toll...,"Last year was the worst ever. I had 16 hospital admissions. I was on life support 6 times after suicide attempts.
Then I finally started to get my feet under me. I got a therapist that I like and trust. I got a new med prescriber who is willing to give me the meds I need and want, knowing that I now myself best. The pharmacist delivers my meds to my apartment weekly. I got into their Intensive Out Patient program and got a case manager that I really clicked with.

In October I was sexually assaulted by a stranger in the parking lot of my apt, and that set me back a little but I already had so much support, it didn't send me completely off the rails. And I got moved into a lovely new apartment in a really sweet neighborhood.

So now, I haven't seen or talked to my therapist for 3 weeks. I saw my IOP case manager once last week, and from now on we're on phone calls only. I have a counselor from my local sexual assault services, she usually comes over once a week but again, now it's phone calls only.

I understand why we need to take these precautions, obviously I don't disagree with any of that. But I can feel myself slipping. I don't know if even 3 or 4 phone calls per week with different clinicians will be enough. And I know I can't go to the hospital if I feel suicidal. I cant stop thinking about suicide and self-harm, which is normal for me but not to the degree of the last few days.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here but I needed to say this somewhere that people aren't going to freak out because I used the word suicide. I'm not actively suicidal, I'm just having more thoughts than I had been.

191,"So many issues, I don't know where to start...","Hello all, first time poster to this sub. (scroll to bottom for TL;DR)

**I am a 28/F. Lately I have been feeling very hopeless about my situation and wishing I was not a participant in life.**

&#x200B;

**HISTORY** \- I have chronic pain related to a spinal fusion almost 10 years ago, as well as anxiety d/o, major depressive d/o, PTSD from some sexual trauma \~6 years ago and ADHD (diagnosed <2 y ago). I have night sweats that soak my pajamas, sheets (top and bottom) regularly, and severe nightmares for a month or two now that I wake up crying or yelping. I grew up between two households: one that was strictly religious (enough to put locks on every window and door in the house and pull my out of public school all for sneaking out once), and one that was with an absentee parent who was almost always on substances and alcohol (often had to go buy my own food at a liquor store at the age of 8 onward, etc). I have gone through 4 different jobs in the last two years (healthcare), needing to take months off in between to recuperate. I should also mention I am in a slew of student loan debt (mostly private loans $125,000+) so not working isn't exactly an option...

&#x200B;

**Rx/TREATMENTS** \- I am on a slew of medications: Buspar, Adderall, Wellbutrin, Baclofen, Cyproheptadine, Tramadol, 600mg Ibuprofen tabs, Sumatriptan, Lorazepam nightly. I have tried therapy a few times (one for over a year), and recently (end July/beginning August) found a psychologist I liked... but then, 3 sessions in, was told my insurance wasn't accepted. Currently I am looking, reached out to someone on Monday and was told Wednesday (day before appointment) that my case was too severe for her and she cancelled the appointment. The psychologist recommended IOP however my insurance ends in less than two weeks because I had to resign from my job in the beginning of August.

&#x200B;

**CURRENT SYMPTOMS** \- Loss of appetite, weight loss (hence the cyproheptadine Rx), nightmares/terrors, moderate-severe memory issues, anxiety at the slightest shift in anything (example, partner walks by room and I tense; no abuse or anything here), lack of interest/pleasure/desire to do things or find a job. Mood swings and immediate anger/frustration/overwhelm at little things like ads or notifications that pop up on my phone/computer, hair touching my face, noises amidst silence, dropping things; also have been \*extra\* clumsy lately, more-so than my usual. Some risky behaviours. No sex drive.

&#x200B;

**Mental state nowadays:**  I feel like everyone is after money. Consumerism runs wild and is present in what feels like *every* aspect of life. Everyone is trying to make a quick buck, without regard for other humans. There is so much judgement, lack of empathy, lack of care for others outside of oneself or immediate family. Also, is it strange that I am severely peeved by the number of people who are engrossed in TikTok or Instagram and who are making a living by being ""influencers""? I only see the future of humanity declining.

\---

***TL;DR -*** lots of mental and physical health history, on many medications, out of a job, no income, lots of debt, and the idea of hopelessness for a different future being repeatedly reinforced by media/social platforms/the trend of society. I feel like I am stuck in a loop and destined to be defeated and can't find a reason to want to do ""life"" and cant find help/treatment due to lack of insurance (again) and lack of finances to pay for things.

192,I just got out of a Partial Hospitalization Program and all I can think about is harming myself to find a way back in.,"I am going on 30 but I have had major depression and suicidal thoughts since I was about 15.  I've spent my entire adult life ""managing"" my depression by suppressing all emotions under a cloud of ""I don't care"".  Not just happy or sad but really anything in life.  If you asked me for my opinion on any topic I'd probably say I don't care.  Naturally I've completely isolated myself from any real human connections on an emotional level, even my family.


So, I start PHP and opened up a lot to the therapists there, and surprisingly in the group therapy settings as well.  After holding every thing in for so long and lacking real emotional connection it makes sense that it would feel really good to open up towards people who seem like they care and or people who can relate with me.  I would say 2 weeks of PHP was life changing for me, the entire experience of therapy as well as everything I learned CBT/DBT wise and coping skills, etc.


Now, I am about two weeks out and I have continued going to IOP as well as seen an individual therapist but it's all at a different facility, different staff, and I'm just not feeling the same connection here.


I think what I have realized is I didn't learn coping skills in PHP.. they WERE my coping skills.  I am craving that feeling of being able to talk to them again.  I am having increasingly frequent thoughts (fantasies even) about how awesome it would be if I killed myself so I could go back there and see them.  Which, if you stop to think about it for even more than half a second, doesn't even make sense lol.  I don't feel like I have any intentions of actually hurting myself right now but I spend most of my days lately daydreaming about how I can go back.

193,How do I get my family to take my Aunt’s mental health crisis seriously?,"Early this year I (26F) was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety that was brought on by a devastating health diagnosis which is a life-long disorder. I went into an Intensive Outcare Patient Program to manage my issues and I’ve come out with some amazing tools to help my personal mental health! This has been wonderful, especially since I can more easily relate and understand others around me who have struggled with their mental health much longer than I have. My aunt for example, has bipolar disorder: and has been diagnosed for as long as I’ve been alive. 

The issue is that recently she’s been talking to me about being on and off her meds, and asking intrusive questions about my IOP journey and experience. I know she’s depressed since she has several life events going on that would make anyone stressed and anxious. Ive helped her look at a few programs (upon her request) but unfortunately we couldn’t find one to take her insurance. I’ve been very casually worried about her, but the events of what follows has left me wondering if she needs serious professional intervention.

This weekend was my father’s birthday and as a part of a b-day surprise my aunt asked all the family to make creative sweet videos wishing my dad/her brother a happy b-day. My partner (29M) and I sent in short and sweet videos: 1 of us together, 1 of me solo, and 1 of him solo wishing my dad well. Each was under a minute. The film my aunt made ended up being 27minutes, with many sweet,nostalgic, but blurry photos of my dad and lengthy stories from my grandma, grandpa, mom, and aunt. To “cut for time” she completely removed my partner from the film in any and all traces that weren’t of him attached to my hip. His bit was 17 seconds and “cut for time” which we both thought was strange and targeted. On the ride home my partner made me away of other behaviors my aunt exhibited against him that made him uncomfortable: like cornering him at the party to ask him about his abusive-family life, why he won’t consider taking my last name, and then at desert blaming HIM for not being in the video more claiming that he didn’t have enough photos of him and my dad. I was livid and sent her a message asking for an explanation and apology. Neither myself nor my partner thought it was malicious, just very strange: and wanted to establish a boundary about communication going forward. 

In return she told me to “go kick rocks” and sent me a 5 page triad of unhinged language. She called my partner antisemitic, emotionally abusive, and a walking-red flag. She also called me a push-over, a freeloader, and ungrateful. Several things in her letter stated conversation that never happened, facts that were easily proven wrong, and conspiracies about my partner that were severely concerning to me. She then told me I had ruined our relationship by requesting an apology and that “I did this. Remember that. You’ve ruined everything.”

I alerted my parents of the messages (with screenshots) and they instantly messaged my partner to apologize for my aunt’s odd behavior and inform him of her prior/current mental health struggles. While they seem concerned that my partner and I are hurt and offended, they are treating this like her behavior is “par for the course”, and that once her manic episode has passed she will forget about the fued. 

But I will not forget. How can I forget someone that I’ve looked up to calling my partner an antisemetic abuser? (Which is beyond untrue!) I and my partner feel unsafe.

She has a history of being obsessed with me/showing obsessive tendencies. E.g. showing up at my school unannounced, being overly touchy with me, commenting how “sexy” and “hot” I am on socials, and even naming her dog after me. Her messages to me came across as a jealous obsessive letter tearing my partner down because I tried to stand up for him/put my relationship with him above my relationship with her. I’m seriously concerned for not only my safety and my partners, but mainly hers. I worry she will act rashly since our close relationship has seemingly imploded; and I’m worried she isn’t getting the help she needs. 

I want to call a family meeting to discuss her behavior and discuss getting her some more intensive help…. But I know they won’t take me seriously. She has always been manic-depressive on and off. She has a history of not taking her meds, and my family seems to have gotten so used to  this that they don’t see this as seriously as I do. 

What can I say or do to get my aunt the help I believe she needs?",1684813293.0,False,1,2,BaeTheFae,None,13pcxqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/13pcxqi/how_do_i_get_my_family_to_take_my_aunts_mental/
194,Constant pain and depression for 15 years. Tried everything. At the end of my rope.,"Well, as it says-- I'm 30 and I've been in constant pain since I was 15, and nobody's ever figured out why. I have mental illness in my family and have been struggling with depression and anxiety ever since I basically had to drop out of high school for a while over these health issues. In terms of psych, I've had... something like 7 shrinks over the years, mostly because I've moved a lot., cycling me through the typical glut of meds, some of which worked and some didn't.  I've done proper talk therapy four times. I once did a full pain medicine program with OT and group and all that. I've done acupuncture and yoga and biofeedback and hypnotism and cupping. 

I'm already mostly a shutin, and I think more and more that all I'm facing is 40 years of pain and loneliness. And then think about what choice I could make to make sure I don't have to suffer through that. 

 What do I do? I don't feel like a new therapist would be much different than the others. I've looked at IOP programs in my area and they don't seem to address chronic pain, which is a huge part of things, and.... I just don't know. I don't know that group with people not suffering like I am is what I need.

 I want someone to tell me to try something, I don't care what it is and how much it costs, tell me SOMETHING to do. Deep brain stim? ECT? Tell me some crazy shit, any straw to grasp, and then tell me how to find a doctor that will do something about it. Tell me a program that has some experience with chronic pain-- I will fly there.

195,Celebrating My One Year Anniversary Of Starting My Mental Health Program,"One year ago yesterday I (F, 30, 29 during the story) ) started what would be the most emotionally intensive ten weeks of my life. The first two weeks it was just me as I was the first adult patient in the brand new program. There was one teen girl for the adolescent program the first day but she was quickly joined by other teens. The teens had their program in other rooms across the small facility. I only saw them in between sessions and during lunch where they chatted and gossipped amongst themselves while I quietly observed from the couch or the puzzle table. I quickly bonded with a quiet but moody boy who had a fantastic drawing talent and could create realistic portraits on the thirty minutes we got for lunch. I hope he continues to pursue his art. I feel like he could really go places.
 
Those two weeks I endured intensive one on one therapy sessions for six hours a day, switching between four of the five staff whom I came to adore and admire for different reasons. T was the program director but tried hard to be relatable with all the patients. My intake was with her and K, my actual assigned therapist. She was a certified art therapist which worked well to provide me a creative outlet with someone who could help relate to the work I was doing on the program. She was great at interpreting my art and helping me understand how it relayed to my trauma. She had no patience for the kids though and being very pregnant, the stress of a new program weighed heavily on her. She was only a year or two older than me and sometimes I found myself intimidated by the vast differences between our situations but I appreciated her all the same.
 
A was the other main therapist there and was so very sweet. She was also young but she was great with the kids. She was quiet but firm and they respected her in ways they didn't with the others.
 
H was by favorite but she ended up leaving before my ten weeks were over. She was Haitian but grew up in England and had a delightful accent that was a blend of the two countries she loved. She broke her leg two weeks before the start of the program but she still managed to show up everyday with a good attitude. I will admit, there were some sessions we just sat and chatted and didn't do much therapy but honestly, some of those heart to hearts were the most beneficial of the whole program. 
 
H had some personal issues that came up and unfortunately had to put in her resignation but she and I are now Facebook friends (I looked her up) and she offers me words of encouragement from time to time. She was the person who really believed in my art for the first time, encouraging me to express myself in art rather than words. My ex husband took away my love for writing and I am working very hard to get it back but it is a slow process. Art has become my creative outlet and therapeutic tool in its place and I have this program to thank. This is the longest personal writing I have attempted since I left him and I thank you all for letting me use this excuse to do so. 
 
 Y came later from the residency program I refused to go to when I was first evaluated. She was the tech and was crazy about concerts which was convenient because the big local concert stadium sat across the street. Pitbull even played there towards the end of my stay at the program. There was also a psychiatrist who came once a week and his only job was to monitor our medications. He immediately declared that my psychiatrist of a year was giving me all wrong medications and switched up my prescriptions from mostly antidepressants to antipsychotixs which led me have some unpleasant fogginess and general zombieness. When I left the program, my psychiatrist scoffed at his recommendations and made me switch as soon as she deemed it safe. 
 
Those first two weeks it was just me for six hours a day and it was exhausting. I was majorly depressed and a suicide risk and didn't want to have to sit and have therapy for six hours by myself but I had already jumped through all the hoops with work to be able to work only four hours a day with the rest being covered by disability. My manager and team lead, main clients and HR were aware of my spiraling mental state and there was no way I could face them having done less than two weeks of a 4-6 week (I was told initially) programmental health program. Despite being ""partially hospitalized"" I was free to quit whenever I wanted. In fact, one girl ran away and H refused to go after her.
 
""Let her go!"" she huffed. ""There's no way I'm chasing her with a broken leg. They don't pay me enough.""
 
Still, my pride refused to let me quit. I'm glad I didn't, but at the time I couldn't see how those two weeks were a secret blessing as without those intensive one on one sessions, I may not have healed the same way. 
 
Week three, R joined me. He was in his fifties and was there for anger management. He was always super cryptic with the details of what led his job to ""volun-tell"" him to go, but it had something to do with his temper. He ended up being the sweetest guy, quiet but after a week or two was actively participating. He had a collection of face mask scarves (I don't remember what they are actually called) from all the national stay parks and they had mountains and maps on them and he was very proud of them.
 
N came a week after R. He was trans but hadn't transitioned yet and poor H had the hardest time remembering his pronouns to the point where he complained to T. N and I clicked immediately being close to the same age and into the same nerdy things. When I left was the middle of Ren Fest season and he even gave me his very nice dress for me to have since he was not going to wear it.
 
""I want it to go to someone who will love it,"" he said when we did our final goodbye hugs.
 
The program was far from perfect. Group family therapy hardly ever happened because schedules or technology got in the way. As my assigned therapist, K was supposed to handle my personal family therapy and because I didn't feel comfortable with my parents knowing about my going to the program and I was closer with my poly couple I was with at the time (whom I still live with and consider family. Life is complicated and housing is expensive.), I had them attend family therapy with me but K was not really prepared for that kind of dynamic and when I transitioned from PHP to IOP, the family therapy sessions just stopped, no transition, no ending exercises, nothing.
 
They were also understaffed and with H having to take time off and eventually leave, they were strapped thin even when Y got added on. The program is actually nationwide, but this was the first one opened up in our state. It was based out of California and the tream over there was awful. I actually ended up attending with the amount my insurance wouldn't pay completely comped because they messed up my on-boarding so badly.
 
Still, that time in the program, ten weeks in total, (6 weeks PHP and 4 weeks IOP) was beneficial in ways I still am discovering. I was able to find hope in life again. It was months before I felt the urge to self harm and at that point, I had the tools I needed to keep myself safe. I now paint or draw nearly everyday becsuseand it helps give my brain a way to break away from all the noise in my head. I can process my husband's abuse and imprisonment in healthy ways. I have a long long way to go, but my therapist is fantastic and is one of my biggest supporters.
 
I guess all I'm saying is, don't let the stigma of mental health programs keep you from getting the help you need. I almost did and I don't think I would be here today if I didn't allow myself to be vulnerable and get the helo I needed.",1658894592.0,False,1,1,GrimmsicalCreations,None,w94iox,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/w94iox/celebrating_my_one_year_anniversary_of_starting/
196,“Break Ups”: a story told by Borderline Personality Disorder,"
29yr old F - bipolar 2 with BPD. there’s posts out there about people dealing with the borderlines in their lives. there are very few posts out there from the borderline’s perspective.

here’s what it’s like: my boyfriend broke up with me after a year of your typical bpd lying, manipulation, and extreme emotions. i struggle badly with dissociation and half the time couldn’t own up to doing these things because i genuinely don’t remember it. anyways, he gets tired of it and bails. everything shatters. and i mean everything. i am completely broken. i am drowning.

switch now i’m full blown manic. two days later i download tinder. try to find his one friend who i know is on it, this is the best idea i’ve ever had. this makes so much sense. i should fuck his friend, i just want to hurt him because he hurt me. match with his friend. get a text from the ex about it. now he’s just mad and i look crazy. he proceeds to take the day shouting at me for downloading tinder so soon and for trying to fuck his friend. i am malicious. i am manipulative. 

my cousin’s girlfriend, sets herself on fire in a hotel parking lot. i get scared because not much separates me from her except one extreme emotion. i’m full of extreme emotions. i begin an IOP, start lamictal. 4 days of therapy 7 days of meds. i can’t tell if i’m starting to get depressed or if this is just how normal people feel. i have no mood fluctuations, i just exist. i text my ex this. “IM CHANGING” i internally scream. he just wants his stuff back.

i go to drop off his stuff. purposely wait until after 11pm so i can try and plug in a “can i stay over, it’s too late to find street parking by my house now.” we have sex, i stay the weekend. he makes me breakfast and i go to rite aid to get us drinks. i know his favorite morning drink, i don’t even have to ask. i am truly the only person capable of loving him this good. i am elated. i am back baby! i am the king of new york! literally no one in human history has ever been this good! he tells me i have to go home because he has a show to go to. i cry. i cry several times. i physically can’t let go of him. i am clinging to him. if i step foot outside this apartment i know i will never be let back in. i am malicious, manipulative.

i ask him to go ice skating the following day. no response. ok that’s fine, i’ve been practicing mindfulness. i got this. people get busy. i text him again the day after that. no response. i go up a dose on lamictal, i stay up later each night. sending a single text. checking instagram every 3-5 minutes to see if he’s been online. if he’s been online, then why can’t he answer my text? whose this girl he started following on instagram? she’s cute. i’ll check her profile every 3-5 minutes. oh she posted a story? it’s her and my ex playing games at dave and busters. what the fuck. what the fuck. 

i start to not eat much, i don’t need it. i’m psychically not hungry. i order mozzie sticks at work during my 11 hour shift, i have one. i’m full. i start to panic. so begins lamictal induces mania. i text my ex “if i get off this couch right now i’m going to kill myself”. it’s true, i will do it. he doesn’t respond. i stay on the couch for 3 full days before taking myself back down to my original lamictal dose. i keep checking her instagram for more stories of him. i am malicious and manipulative. 

a day or so later, coworker texts me a screenshot of a tinder profile. “isn’t this your ex?”. sure is. after he gave me shit for having a tinder so many moons ago, i am enraged. i search instagram far and wide for the girl of his dreams. i download tinder. armed with another beautiful girl’s photos i swipe furiously until i find him. “super like”. we match. or should i say “ellen” and him match. we talk. we chat. i ask him all the things i’ve been dying to ask him since seeing him last. we set up a date. a dive bar by my house. after a few days of talking he has softened me. i’m no longer angry, i want to be his savior. i’ll show up to the dive bar. after he gets stood up, i’ll be there. to take care of him. i am the only person in the world capable of loving him. he ends up bailing on my catfish date. i am broken. i am shattered. i am malicious, manipulative. 

my IOP wraps up. i’m left alone. from 4 days of intensive therapy to being completely alone. over this 2 month journey i’ve isolated enough to convince myself that my ex is the only one i can depend on. no one not a single soul will ever love me like he did. despite the texts i receive throughout the week of people checking in on me. i tell him i say “i can’t set this boundary, i need you to set me free. i’m not strong enough to do it”. he tells me “i have no intention of getting back together with you”. i am broken and incomplete. i am drowning and i am scared. my chest hurts. i am physically shattered. but taking my therapy seriously. i need to respect him. 

it’s been 2.5 months since the breakup and i still have to repeat out loud to myself every single night to leave him alone. to not check his instagram. to not text him. to stop manipulating him, whether for good or bad. i do my DBT workbook. i bought an indoor exercise bike. i’ve been trying to find the good in it. to focus on me. 

but fuck, finding myself will never feel as good as finding someone else.

197,I don’t like my therapist. Long post sorry. I want to change my therapist.,"I’m in the US. 

TL:DR- I want a new therapist but I don’t want to make her feel like a bad therapist... it’s just her style of therapy doesn’t work with me. 

So I have been in therapy for almost three years and I’m on my third therapist. My first therapist... my god was AMAZING. I loved her, she was so helpful. She specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy, and it worked out so well. Every session was so structured and I really felt she was trying to help me understand what was going on and how to fix things. 
She went to work somewhere else, for victims of sexual assault. 

My second therapist was a bit shit, she moved to Alaska. 

My current therapist is sooo annoying, but she is a very sweet woman! (She is a child’s play therapist?) I knew her previously as she was one of the leaders in my IOP group I went to and I didn’t even like her then.  And BAM now she is my therapist. I’ve been seeing her for maybe six months and I hate it!! Every time I try to talk to her about thing she just sits there and stares at me and when I’m done she goes “...ah.. I see..”. There is no level of structure in my sessions and it is driving me crazy. It’s almost like I just sit and ramble for 30 mins. I have problems that I need help with and she isn’t helping me in anyway.  She is never willing to work with my schedule either which is a bit of a hassle at times. 

My last appointment was 1/04/18 and I have been trying so hard to get an appointment scheduled with her for the past month and she finally replies telling me she is booked and cant see me. THEN I get a letter in the mail saying if I don’t get an appointment by the end of the month, my case will be closed. SHE IS THE ONE WHO WROTE THE LETTER. SHE IS THE ONE NOT ANSWERING ANY OF MY CALLS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. WTF.

198,Weighted blanket for couples,"My wife had a mental breakdown at the end of January, which resulted in an 8-day hospitalization.  From there she has been on Partial Hospitalization, Intensive Outpatient, Residential, and is now back to an IOP.  She self-admitted for all treatment, and is fully med compliant.  Her diagnosis is Bipolar 2, PTSD, Anxiety, and Major Depression.  I personally have depression, and probably undiagnosed anxiety and PTSD, so the last few months have been a whirlwind for both of us.  She has a team of therapists, psychiatrists, medical doctors helping her, and i've got my own team of professionals and support groups to help me.  We have a large family and friends support network that I tapped when this whole adventure started, and they have been wonderful for us.  In short, we are doing everything we can and should be doing in this situation. 

As we move forward together trying to figure out what our new normal is, we're looking into helpful tools.  One of the suggestions is a weighted blanket, which has all sorts of benefits for people with sensory and emotional issues.  I can recall when I lived in the northeast US, and during the winter months I would pile the blankets on, 2-3 thick.  This kept me cozy warm but also had a noticeable weight, and I always felt snuggled up and safe.

My stepmom is a wonderful person, and just sewed a 20lb weighted blanket for my wife, and she loves it.  Problem is, the blanket is only big enough for one person, and I can see myself getting benefit from it as well.  

I am looking for a queen sized weighted blanket that we can both sleep under and enjoy the benefits of it.  Problem is, all blankets I see on the Internet are for children or single adults, never couples.  Plus I think a blanket that big would have to be at least 40lbs just so we each have enough weight on our respective sides.  Does anybody know of a website that sells weighted blankets for couples?  Would a blanket of sufficient weight and size even be feasible to create and go through general wear and tear?  Is this even a good idea, or should we stick to individual blankets?

199,What should I expect if I'm going to be inpatient?,"I'm 26, live in Michigan, and have never been hospitalized before. I've been diagnosed with MDD and GAD since I was 15, and I think there's an incredibly strong likelihood that I have PTSD but that's not been officially diagnosed.

I'm not worried about work -- I gave all my bosses and my coworker a heads up about the possibility of needing to be AWOL for inpatient psych care, and every single one of them were compassionate, understanding, and assured me that I'd have a job when I came back. So that's a huge relief.

I have confidence in the mental health professionals I've been seeing -- they've also all been compassionate and understanding, and are clearly competent. I wish they'd help me figure out if this is PTSD or something else, and what to do about it, and tbh maybe that'll be a thing that gets figured out inpatient if it has to be. But they're good people.

But there's still a lot I don't know. I'm sure it varies from hospital to hospital, but I'd like to know/hear your experiences with:

* Should I pack some clothes and toiletries, or will I not be allowed those?
* If my psychiatrist tells me I have to go to the hospital, will I be allowed to go home and gather my things/tell my family/call my boss quickly? Or do I have to go right to the hospital from their office?
* What's the check-in procedure?
* Am I correct in guessing that I will not be allowed my phone or laptop?
* Would I be allowed to bring other things (e.g. knitting, art supplies, radio) to help pass the time?
* Are rooms/wards usually separated by gender/sex? I'm trans and have been presenting as male for the better part of a decade, but all my legal documentation still says female and I've not had any surgeries.
* Are hospital staff likely to accept my being trans as just a thing that is, or might it be treated as a mental health issue?
* Are hospital staff likely to acknowledge/accept my being on the autism spectrum, or would stuff like stimming and not making eye contact be treated as mental health issue?
* Is there any chance in hell that I'll still be allowed to use nicotine? I know the local hospital system is tobacco-free, but I vape, and that's not strictly speaking a tobacco product like dip or cigs.
* If nicotine is a no, might I be able to get help quitting (permanently or otherwise) with something like a nicotine patch? Quitting cold turkey has historically been less than good.
* Would voluntary (or involuntary) hospitalization show up on a background check? I'm a school custodian, and had to pass a background check to work around children. I anticipate needing to pass further background checks as I advance in the field, or if I work in other fields that interest me.
* About how long might I expect to be in? Will the hospital staff give me an estimate of how long I'll be in, or is it kind of indefinite detention? If I go in voluntarily, but don't find that hospitalization is helpful, would I be able to check myself out?",1455337655.0,False,1,8,plaid_banana,None,45ipqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/45ipqz/what_should_i_expect_if_im_going_to_be_inpatient/
200,I got back from ed residential but all my work is going to waste,"I'm an almost 16 year old trans male. Last year I went to a general php. There I was diagnosed with an eatting disorder. They misdiagnosed me with anorexia even though my eatting habits have nothing to do with weight. They told me I should go to residential. My mom was against it, but me and my dad convinced her that I need it.

The php was a short time one(about 2 weeks) but I was there for a little over 6 weeks and than went to a iop while I was waiting for a spot.

Near July I got in and things were going ok. My ed was getting better and some other things as well. I wish it focused on other stuff and not just ed because ed is, by far, not my biggest problem. The place did make some things worse, but for the most part I was healing and on my way to recovery.

Less than a week ago i discharged. On the way home I asked my mom when I'll start an ed php. Thats when I received the news that they didnt except me and said im not ready to leave res. That would be fine but insurance olny cares about physical health not mental for res, so I didnt have a choice to leave or not.

The php said I wasn't ready because I couldn't hold a conversation and I was suicidal. I couldnt hold the conversation because the questions were hard, i didnt know how to answer them, and I was tired. As for being suicidal, I want to die, but I dont want to unlive myself, so im not really that.(right?)

So I was left with nothing. Just got out of residental, with no outpatient providers(my theripist moved.) I had nothing, and my family isnt very supportive.

My mom said how I didnt have ed at all(which I do) and that my habits were fine and normal for being deppresed. Which made me feel so invalid and not sick enough. I dont eat because of how it feels, not because im sad and i dont think 0 meals a day and binging once a week is healthy.

I thought that at least my parents would help me with my meal plan, but they didn't. They left me on my own and wouldn't help me plan or prep. My dad was better at it, but still I was relasping faster than I thought it would happen.

Also, I didnt try much becuase I have no other comfort other than an empty stomach.

While at res i noticed my dad was trying. (My parents just separated.) He took my ed more seriously and tried to become a better dad. He got understanding for mental health and my deppresion symptoms. When I came home he yelled at me for not cleaning my room even though I'm unmotivated and tired. He yelled at me for other dumb things to. Than he called me my mom even though my worst fear is becoming her.(she has bad anger problums and I have anger issues too) he called me ungrateful for not wanting to shop even though I was in pain.(I had my period and he knew that.)He also triggered my by yelling and banging.

So now im back to the start were both my parents dont care and I have no one to help me.

I dont know what to do. Res really helped but I know my mom will never let me go back becuse of how bad they are. Also even if im in a worse spot she will NEVER send me to inpatient.(she is a nurse and both) so I am stuck and need help. I dont think I can take 2 more years of this.",1632096729.0,False,2,2,Kokichi_Oma_Redriot,None,prjooa,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/prjooa/i_got_back_from_ed_residential_but_all_my_work_is/
201,PTSD has become a part of who I am.,"I was 19 years old when my grandfather was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  He was my entire world.  He was the only father figure/male role model I had growing up.  Rather than having his family see him suffer, waste away, and die in such a terrible way, he chose to put a bullet in his brain and end his suffering.  I found the body.  I still remember how he looked with his head slumped over covered in his own blood with the .22 rifle leaning against his legs.  Although I have never been professionally diagnosed, I know that I suffer from PTSD.  I still have the nightmares, the sounds of gun shots or loud noises send me into panic attacks, and every February 10, the day he died, I spend the entire day majorly depressed and crying.

Part of me wants to seek professional help to deal with the events of that day, but after carrying around the emotional baggage for almost 20 years, I feel like the damage caused by that day have become a permanent part of my personality.

202,"I take every single thing I've been told in therapy seriously, and I don't know how to disregard what therapists say. When I get conflicting advice in therapy from what I learned in therapy years ago, I can't process it.","FWIW, I've been told I have a very rigid thought process and have been diagnosed with Asperger's as a child (though it was never addressed and the diagnosis has since been dismissed numerous times). I also do not know how to form my own views and opinions based on things I'm told and things I read - everything is taken in its entirety or completely dismissed. None of my therapists have seen this as an issue and therefore I have nowhere to turn for help with it.

I've been in DBT, a residential treatment center, intensive outpatient, AA, and outpatient therapy. Because I've dealt with abusive family members completely dismissing anything a therapist told them that they didn't like, I feel like I have to take everything seriously, otherwise I'm wasting both of our time and not willing to get better. Unfortunately, I don't filter ANYTHING and that means I have to process what I heard in therapy for MONTHS. Whenever I attempt balancing what I've learned in multiple places, it doesn't work because I'm still giving ideas value that I probably should drop. 

DBT says that volunteering is a way to build positive experiences and self-image. Intensive outpatient said volunteering is a form of narcissism because we do it to feel good about ourselves, and is therefore not healthy.

Residential treatment taught me that participation by listening is a healthy boundary when you're too tired or not in a good mood. Intensive outpatient says this is selfish and if you're choosing to be in group therapy, your peers are entitled to your feedback. Outpatient therapist says some things aren't even worthy of a response in the first place.

DBT taught me how to get my needs met by setting boundaries, since most relationships with people we have issues with need to stay in our lives (bosses, parents). Residential taught me that no, you actually don't need to have those people in your life - quitting your job and cutting off your parents IS an acceptable boundary. Intensive outpatient took it a step further and said that if you don't do this, you're choosing to stay stuck.

Residential and DBT talked about how it's okay to slip up, acknowledge what you did wrong, forgive yourself, and move forward. AA equated self-forgiveness with a lack of accountability - if you slip up once, you're back at square 1.

My IOP facility in particular set me back several notches - I had only just gained a shred of self esteem at residential when a therapist (note: not MY therapist) told me I had antisocial personality disorder in group therapy and lead a psychoeducation group on how to get your needs met by ""a person like me."" I do feel like some of it was helpful, though. I wound up asking my friends if they thought I was selfish and every single one said I was either selfish or inconsiderate. Since I went there, my relationships and friendships are 10x better - but I don't know how to let go of the toxic shit I was fed there without also letting go of what's helpful.

203,How do I deal with intrusive thoughts,"I need to say something

**The Problem**

I really need to say something, it is about intrusive thoughts in my head ( I call them voices). So I am dealing at the moment with a Pro-Russian voice, that says I worship Satan, I want to hurt myself/kill, want to do fucked up things to people, I am aganist G-D, and I love Nazism, and it also repeats Pro-Russian talking points I hear, ( I do not believe them because they are bullshit,Nazism, Biowepaons, Ukraine created by lenin, etc) because I am Pro-Ukrainian. I know I would never do this thing, I love G-D, I do not want to hurt myself/kill, I do not want to do fucked up things to people, I want to be religous, and I do not love Nazism, I am Jewish. It is gotten to really bad point, although I have optimism, I can beat this thoughts like Ukrainians beat Russians in real life.

**The effect on my life**

Now because of these thoughts, I no longer attend physical school I went online, hard to focus in school I act weird, for example to prove I do not want to hurt myself I put my hands in the air, spread my legs apart, and sometimes do not anything involved with the possibility of physical risk, I ask questions like how do I make sure I do not hurt myself , where do I put my tounge so that I do not hurt them by biting them, where do I put my head so I do not hurt my neck. My parents are pissed at me, my dad even took away my phone and my mom is sometimes kinda of disappointed in me. My parents are trying to help, they did give me therapy and consulsing, but they are pissed at me, that I am acting kinda of like a madman, my dad is extremely angry when I do this things. But I think my parents are just concerned for me, so do not say they are bad, they might not know the best way to react but, they are just concerned for me.

**The history**

Now I am going to tell you the history of my voices( intrusive thoughts). So It began with a Pro-Palestinian voice, that woud say I am evil person beucase I support Zionism and Israel, Zionism is making suicdal and wanting to hurt myself, Zionism is a evil it is the 7 deadly lettlers, you should become Pro-Palestine and Anti-Zionist, and also would repeat Pro-Palestinian talking points ( Israel is Aparthied state, a settler colonialist state, Israel is against Judaism) . Now I did not have a good way with dealing with this Pro-Palestinian voice, I would hurt myself and then blame on the Pro-Palestinian thoughts, but the plan did not work well, I eventually lost to the voice, because I had destroyed my argument by hurting myself, and proving the Pro-Palestinian voice, that Zionism is bad for me, and also because I heard a Pro-Palestinian agurment that was preety strong. So I lost the battle to the voice and gave up alot of my Israel passion and I hate that fact. Then the voice changed to the Pro-Russian voice, this time I deiciced that I wanted to win and would fight like hell, so I came with a different strategy for fighting the Pro-Russian voice, called doing the opposite thing, where If the voice said I want to hurt myself for example I would do the opposote and not just not intentionally self harm, but to be extremely paranoid of everything to make sure I do’nt even get hurt even once by accidnet and also puting my body in weird positions ( hands in the air or down my side, puting my back so my teeth do not it, etc. I do the opposite thing, It is better and I have not lost to the voice, I have stood my ground, but sometimes doing the opposite thing, makes me look crazy, I have done it even in public. I also researched Ukraine, to refute any Pro Russian taling points I had heard because they are pretty much bullshit, they are not hard to agure against. So I dealt with these thoughts at school, it was hard, hard as hell, school became unbearable, I had academic stress alongside this stress. I had to leave, I joined online education because of this, I though that would fix it, It did not really, then later these thoughts started claming I worship Satan, or I am aganist G-D. So here I am today dealing with these thoughts. I have now had to go back to a placed called imgaime, my mom thinks it will help me, It is a IOP progam, intensive outpatient.

Please Help me, what should I do, I want to win, I can’t let intrusive thoughts/voices win, if they win this war, then they will go after other things, I want to be left alone, I am not losing, but I need to win faster, I need to liberate the Crimea of my mind.",1673246495.0,False,2,4,Medium_Watch_323,None,10777jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10777jo/how_do_i_deal_with_intrusive_thoughts/
204,Does anyone else not answer texts from your best friends? Why? And how do you stop?,"*tldr and just a note: this is mostly just me kind of going into details of what not answering texts looks like for me, why I think I might be doing it, etc. You don’t need to read the whole thing if you don’t want to. My main questions are:
-Do you also put off answering texts? How long do you usually go without answering?
-Why do you think you do it? (Ex: Drained social battery, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, etc)
-What do you tell friends when you apologize for taking so long to respond? How do you explain it to them?
-Has anyone been able to curb this or bounce back from this habit? Do you have any tips? 
Feel free to answer any or all of those questions, that’s what I am really curious about!

-

I have been in a bit of a rut with my mental health the past 4 ish months and I am REALLY struggling to respond to people, more than usual. I haven’t responded to my best friend (who doesn’t live near me, it’s not like I see her regularly) in over a MONTH now. And it’s about the same with about 4-6 of my other closest friends at any given time.

I feel awful. And I don’t understand it or know how to explain it. This has been an issue for me in the past, but usually it would just be if I got too overwhelmed with the amount of messages I had, especially if I had a lot going on that week, and I would maybe not respond for a week tops, maybeee two weeks if it was really rough. Or my socially battery would just be too drained. And I think that makes sense.

But this is different, and I’m not sure how or why. I’m not doing anything at all, I’m not in school and I’m not working (had to pause all of that due to my mental illnesses so I could get better treatment and focus on that). I haven’t been working or been in school since like mid October now. So I’m not sure why I can’t respond, it’s not like I am super busy all day and just too socially-drained to answer.

I love these people so much, and I feel awful. Every once in a while I’ll catch up on some of my texts and I profusely apologize, explain I’ve been going through it, I’ll try and do better going forward, I promise I won’t do this forever and I’m just in a rut right now, etc. But then I keep doing it!! I just don’t know how else to explain it to them so they at least know where I’m coming from, because I don’t even understand it myself.

And honestly it’s like I’m sabotaging my own support system, because now  I don’t feel like I can reach out to them when I need support because I haven’t answered their other texts!! I’m afraid they’re going to stop being my friend (or at least back away) because I can’t be a good friend and communicate. I’ve even ignored texts asking if I want to hang out on a specific date. Like :( What am I doing :( I want to respond I just, idk.

The only thing I can think of as why it has been worse for me is maybe it’s OCD-related. I have OCD, and have had a significant increase in symptoms the past few months (to the point where I am looking into an IOP program again). My main theme is “just right,” and so have a lot of obsessions and compulsions related to that theme. I often have an extremely hard time going out of order, not following directions if they’re given to me, etc., and I noticed that I have a really strong feeling that like I HAVE to answer the person I have been ignoring the longest before I can answer anyone else. But the person I have been ignoring the longest has sent me a lot of really long messages that will be time consuming to answer. So I think it might be a mix of that anxiety/too-drained-to-answer thing as well as my OCD.

I don’t know lol I am just grasping at straws. I just don’t know how to handle it, I’m so embarrassed and ashamed.
And to be clear, my friends all know about my mental illnesses and are very kind about it. I just feel like that isn’t an excuse for being a bad friend but I also don’t know how to fix it. And I want to try to explain it to them so they don’t think I’m just pulling shit out of my ass :/ because I’m literally on my phone all the time. I’ll send them tiktoks but not answer their texts. Tiktok just takes my brain off the sad and doesn’t require thought :/

206,I'm so tired of dealing with health issues ad life in general... I don't know that I'm going to get to a point where I'm not stressed all the time,"It's been over a year since I started having health issues. They were slow to start, at first, just daily stomachaches, and then at the end of August it was like they just exploded all at once. 

It was utterly exhausting. I was suicidal then, and though I did an IOP program which stabilized me, things were still pretty shit. In December I saw an internist, who ran lots of tests: ANA, rheumatoid factor, HIV, Lyme, mono, etc. At that point I was in daily chronic pain, it was hard for me to use my hands, and I was having excruciating gastrointestinal flare-ups. Nothing came back positive. I'd already been to the doctor like six or seven times that year. I still had high hopes, though...

January, I saw a gastroenterologist. She did a second celiac test. Negative. Started physical therapy, which was cool. February... Honestly I can't remember. March, started birth control because I realized my gastro issues were connected to my period. Had terrible mood swings, my psych wanted to put me on mood stabilizers but I didn't want to do that, so I switched BC in... April? Beginning of May? 

And then I was utterly clear for a few weeks. I had motivation. I had drive. I wasn't depressed, I was handling my stress well, I was improving my relationship with my parents. Then I got my period. Which I'm not supposed to get because I'm taking BC continuously. 

Now things are fucked up again. I'm exhausted. I don't want to have to deal with my stupid fucking ovaries making my life a living fucking hell. I just know I'm gonna miss so much of my senior year because I'll be stuck at home from my gastro issues. And I just got diagnosed with a nerve condition. At 17. And none of the treatment options are good, it's like I have to pick the least worst one. 

I'm tired of being on antidepressants and antianxiety meds that don't work. I don't want to pump my body full of unnecessary chemicals when I'm pretty sure my ovaries are causing my depression. My anxiety, though... Fuck. I'm 17, and I'm so fucking stressed that I can't think straight, and I'm probably going to die of a heart attack or some shit by the time I hit 40. 

And everything in my body is getting worse. The gastro issues, the fatigue, the weird feeling in my hands. For the past two weekends it's just felt like I was hit by a bus. I cannot keep doing this. I can't. 

Tomorrow is my last day of my junior year of high school and I still need to write two essays. I'm dreading the summer because everyone wants me to get a summer job and I'm just so tired. I already got rejected from two places I applied to. 

I can't really think of anything right now that I want to do in life. College sounds... Meh. I don't see how I'll ever get to travel. It's unlikely I'll ever be able to publish a book considering I haven't had time to write in months. 

I just don't see it ending. The stress. It always comes back. And it sucks even more because those few weeks when I started the new BC, I got a taste of what it's like to not constantly feel that way. To be content, to be optimistic about the future. How am I ever going to get back to that point? How the fuck am I supposed to go to school tomorrow like everything is fine when it feels like my body is falling apart? How am I supposed to get a job and go to work and pretend like I'm okay when it feels like my future is crumbing before my eyes?",1623383470.0,False,1,1,unknowncalicocat,None,nx6mfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/nx6mfs/im_so_tired_of_dealing_with_health_issues_ad_life/
207,"Is my psychiatrist acting reasonably? Trigger warning: self-harm, violence","My psychiatrist started me on Lexapro a month ago when I first saw him for depression and anxiety. I told him my brother had tried Lexapro before and that it helped him at first and then he started having increasing suicidal thoughts so he had to stop taking it. I was apprehensive to try Lexapro specifically because of this, but doc said it was a good option for me, so I decided to give it a shot. 

Turns out, Lexapro works the same way for me as my brother. Worked great for about a week, helped my anxiety. But then the suicidal thoughts started and all I could think about was slitting my wrists. I have no history of self-harm thoughts or behaviors. At this point, I sent a message through the portal to my doctor and his assistant's response was to keep giving Lexapro a chance and go to the hospital if my symptoms got worse. I was like okay, whatever, it's early in the game, maybe this will turn around. 

So a week ago, I go in for my next appointment and explain that I'm still having all these side effects and that I'm also going through trauma therapy for PTSD with my therapist, so it's important that I can be stable on my meds to continue that. 

I also asked him for his opinion on EMDR since I was considering starting it with my new therapist but wanted more opinions on it. He went into this detailed account of a patient he had who had been tied up and raped/brutalized for weeks and how she did EMDR and it helped her. I was so triggered by this story I just wanted to get the hell out of there at that point (my PTSD stems from domestic violence history/sexual assault). 

In the end, he said he wanted me to keep trying the Lexapro and that the side effects might get better. So with him unwilling to change the med, I just went home feeling pretty helpless. I had a panic attack and dissociatove episode that afternoon that lead to me giving in to the self-harm thoughts and cutting my wrist for the first time. That night I started weaning myself off the Lexapro because I was terrified I would escalate further and actually kill myself on this med. 

I have already decided I don't want to see this doctor anymore at this point, but the new psychiatrist I'm trying to get in with has a waiting list situation (will likely be doing an IOP through them) and I'm stuck in this spot with no meds to help me really manage my anxiety other than the occasional xanax for panic attacks. 

I sent one last plea for help to the original psych doctor yesterday. The MA messaged back and suggested I just completely stop the Lexapro and see if my symptoms resolve over the weekend and that she would talk to the doctor on Monday about it. This is dumb as hell and also dangerous, because I know for a fact you don't cold turkey quit SSRIs without a replacement because the withdrawal effects can be horrendous. And even if I did just abruptly stop, Lexapo is not going to magic its way out of my system in a day or two. So my symptoms won't just disappear over the weekend. 

Anyway, this rant is long but I was just curious what y'all think I should do because it's like pulling teeth to simply get a different SSRI and the people at my current office are being irresponsible as hell about all of it. I hate to go to the hospital for something that should be handled outpatient, but I don't know if it's safe to keep waiting for this new psychiatrist to call me back. I've cut myself twice more this past week and this whole thing is frankly scaring the shit out of me because I feel like I have no control in this situation.",1571413211.0,False,4,13,anxiouspigeon_ta,None,djp9hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/djp9hq/is_my_psychiatrist_acting_reasonably_trigger/
208,[Happy Post] My Alcoholic Father is Finally Getting Help,"Hello,

So I am diagnosed Bipolar II, GAD, PTSD, and we (my therapist and I) are looking at maybe BPD. I have been working on my own issues now for over three years. Supposedly I inherited my Bipolar from my dad, but I don't really know. All I know is that he didn't really believe in the whole mental health ""mumbo jumbo."" And resorted to alcoholism to deal with his problems instead. Until three years ago....

He divorced his now ex wife and has a lovely SUPPORTIVE woman in his life and has for over 2 & 1/2 years. During that time, his whole demeanor changed. He was happy, there for me when I needed him, open with his feelings, allowed himself to break through the ""hardass"" dad he thought he had to be.

Well I have a 14 year old half sister (they live in Texas, btw). This is his first time actually really raising a teenager. Currently while talking to me refers to her as, ""Satan, but I love her anyway,"" as in, that's her new full name (lol). So he has been overly stressed. I guess about 6 weeks or so, he had a mental break and admitted himself to the behavioural hospital for the first time in his life. When he got out, he continued the IOP program and finished it last week.

Yesterday his girlfriend left for the week to visit her family here and I am going to Texas with her for about a week to spend time with them before my dad flies me home. He called me around 8pm, just to talk. Once we got through small talk, he started talking to me about his therapy. He told me that he has stopped drinking (his girlfriend verifies the story) and this is his first time being alone for so long and by talking to me, he was keeping him out of the trouble he used to engage in. I've drawn two and two together and I am 98℅ sure I am in his support system. I could tell he was really working on doing the right thing and he made the right call, literally, by calling me. Then we talked about therapy and how his was going and how mine is going and how we both really look forward to seeing each other next week. He told me one of his biggest fears right now is that his ""baby girls) are at the age where were could make him a grandpa. Not because he doesn't want grandkids, but he is frustrated because he isn't ready, he doesn't have property like he thinks a proper granddad should have.

I am just so proud of him. He makes me smile and I think is a really sweet family man. We just never got to see it before. He asks me if I have any regrets about him being my dad so I told him the truth. The only thing I regret is that I wish he would have been this happy sooner.",1471652553.0,False,26,6,Mrssomethingstarwars,None,4ym8xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/4ym8xc/happy_post_my_alcoholic_father_is_finally_getting/
209,"Emory Healthcare has an awesome FREE program for Post-9/11 Vets battling PTSD, Sexual Trauma, and other Invisible Wounds.","Hi everyone. I’m Shaun with [Emory Healthcare’s Veterans Program] (https://www.emoryhealthcare.org/centers-programs/veterans-program/index.html). I know this isn't a military-specific sub, but there have to be a few Vets here, and several that know Vets.

Our program offers post-9/11 veterans expert and collaborative care to heal the invisible wounds of war. Our comprehensive approach combines behavioral health care, including psychiatry and neurology, rehabilitative medicine, wellness, and family support to help you reintegrate and reclaim your life.

The best part is that it is at **absolutely no cost** to Veterans (or Active Duty or Drilling Reservists). We cover transportation, lodging, meals, clinical care, and other ancillary costs. And we can serve Vets anywhere in the U.S. and it’s territories. We’ve had Vets from Alaska to Guam.  

Right now we're hovering around 50% capacity. There are a lot more Veterans we could help. So if you're a Vet who's struggling please reach out, or if you know someone who is, send them our way.

Our focus is on treatment for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Military Sexual Trauma (MST). We also provide treatment for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Anxiety, Depression, and Moral Injury.

All treatment is tailored to the individual needs of the patient based on a comprehensive assessment and may include:

•	Psychotherapy

•	Pharmacotherapy 

•	Cognitive rehabilitation

•	Stress management skills

•	Sleep training/education, sleep studies

•	Integrative medicine for wellness, such as acupuncture, yoga, and nutrition

•	Family counseling

•	Employment and financial education and resources

•	Assistance with navigating the VA system

•	MRI

•	Physical, speech, and occupational rehabilitation 

The heart of the program is a 2-week Intensive Out-Patient (IOP) program onsite at the Emory Brain Health Center in Atlanta, GA. We fly you out (or pay mileage if you're in driving distance), put you up in a hotel across the street, and for 2 weeks you will receive treatment from a world-class team of doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and fellow Veterans. 90% of the care is one-on-one, not a bunch of groups sessions, holding hands and singing kumbaya. We do a weekend outing and some other fun stuff, too. 

After the 2-weeks, a Case Manager will follow up for the next 12 months and coordinate follow-on care as necessary in your local community. 

Most of the Vets who go through our program are prior service. But we’ve helped several Active Duty and Drilling Reservists who didn’t want to seek help through the military for fear of harming their careers. The services here are completely confidential and will only be shared other agencies like the military or VA with the patients written consent.  

**If you have any questions**, put them down below. I’d be glad to answer what I can. I’m not a care provider; so I can’t get too in-depth on clinical stuff. But I can provide general info about the program, how to sign up, answer logistical concerns, things like that. Or you can reach me with the contact info below.

FWIW, I’m an Army Engineer with 3 years Active duty and 13 years of Reserve Component (both Guard and Reserve) service. And if this program isn’t for you, but you would like help with other issues, let me know. We work with a lot of other Veterans Service Programs and non-profits. I might be able to refer you  to someone who can help.

210,"Feeling like I’ve been backed in to a mental health corner with pandemic. [NV, USA]","This is a bit of a vent, as I feel like I’m ready to pop. Apologies in advance if this is jumbled, the brain is racing, lack of sleep, mobile user, etc etc. 

Times are tough for all of us, and I’m hoping that I’m not breaking any rules with this vent. If not allowed, please delete. 

I have a hx of anxiety, depression and PTSD, and “anxiety induced insomnia” (this is how the pulmonologist explained it to me). I’ve lived in Wisconsin most of my life, but my fiancé was given an amazing opportunity in Las Vegas, so he and I made a choice to move here. We’ve been since October, and it was great until recently. 

I’ve been compliant in all of my MH care, and actually had an intensive inpatient stay followed by IOP after, in June. I add this as context for the severity of my symptoms, I guess. I did a LOT of work and genuinely felt better about myself than I have in 15 years.

When I informed my psych and therapist that we were indeed going to take this plunge, they were supportive, and my psychiatrist gave me a script with 6 refills for all of my meds. 

I didn’t have a job lined up by the time we got out here, and it was tight for a little while, which we expected. We were able to make ends meet while I found a job. I was able to finally get an opportunity at the end of December, but it would take 90 days for my insurance to kick in. I wasn’t able to afford refills regularly, but used GoodRX when I could. I could feel myself backsliding on some of the things I’ve worked my butt off to achieve, but I figured I was close to the finish line, and just tried my best to use the skills I’d learned to cope.

My insurance became active on March 1st, and I’m sure you can all guess where this is heading. ...

I attempted to refill my meds, excited to be able to maintain them regularly. Apparently NV laws for controlled substances are different than WI, in that they apparently expire after 6 months here. So I just lost out on 3 refills for the two meds I’ve been most worried about. I sent a message to my therapist, who I’d been meaning to catch up with anyway. My old office is closed due to the pandemic, although he stated that he would try to get in touch with my Dr to see what he could do, as he was “concerned” that I was without meds. That was last week, and I know things are crazy everywhere, I’m just panicking. 

Since the pandemic fears were already in full swing, I haven’t been able to contact a new psych to try and establish care yet. I know that meds like these aren’t prescribed without a solid hx in med records, and we all know how trying to establish care will go: no openings until August? Sure. In addition, 2 weeks ago, my fiancé and I both came down with symptoms that fit the Covid requirements for testing. We weren’t able to get an appointment until yesterday. (The test sucks, btw). I’ve also been furloughed until May 1st, and have made dozens of phone calls to try to start unemployment benefits. Since I am from out of state, I am *required* to call in and have someone review my case before it can be processed online.  The phones don’t become available until after 11, and they have limit on their voicemail telling you to call back the next day, then it disconnects. Obviously, going anywhere is not ideal, and going to the ER is a waste of resources especially since Drs do not like to write scripts for something that is easily abused. I understand that. I don’t know if a televisit would help me in the interim, but sight unseen, I dunno. 

I’ve been out of my sleep aid for a few weeks now, and have been awake today for 24 hours. I have one emergency med left that I am saving for, well.. the apocalypse. So I’ve just been sitting in our tiny 1 bed apartment, ruminating about lack of meds, lack of money, no immediate family near me and a lack of professional support (especially since my therapist was probably one of the most positive male influences in my life, so there was a sense of security having a great provider in my corner. 

My anxiety is through the roof, and I’m slipping in to the hole I crawled out of. I just don’t know how to get my mind to stop racing. I know things will turn out alright in the end, but in the meantime there seems to be no end in sight. 

I’m sorry, I realize this is a massive post, I just needed to write these fears out, and I thought that maybe this sub would be understanding (especially with my med concerns) and remind me that it’ll get better. 

I mean, it WILL get better, right?",1586361622.0,False,0,2,Caustique,None,fx92mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fx92mg/feeling_like_ive_been_backed_in_to_a_mental/

TW: drugs, sleep paralysis (I think???) anxiety, sexual assault. idk I just don’t want to make anyone unhappy

Im in a hotel with my dad right now. I’m going to rehab tomorrow morning. No idea what time. They’re just gonna call after 9am. Last minute thing.

I’ve done Intensive Outpatient (IOP) twice this year and been to this same inpatient facility for a weekend cause fuck insurance. If I’m not constantly having seizures or overdosing or literally dying I’m not enough of an addict to get help I guess. Different insurance now. I’m scared. Between now and last time it’s gotten so much worse with frequency, quantity, and escalation of types of drugs (weed to alcohol to Xanax to meth now j think I’m addicted to coke too)

I just tried to go to sleep. Had the most real dream. I put on some mac miller before I went to sleep cause that’s the mood rn. Slept through about 6 songs. Starting with Come Back to Earth if anyone’s interested. The dream was the kind where you can physically feel things. My [youngest sibling] year old sister was here. I just lived with her for the last 2 months and my mom and my [older than sister] younger brother. I’ve lived with my dad mostly my whole life. I dont care if this gives away my throwaway account I’ll delete it or something. I just needed this out of my head before I try sleeping again. When I left the house earlier irl I told her I was going on a trip and have her a hug and told her I loved her. Same with my brother. He’s autistic and he usually doesn’t like being touched and stuff but I asked and he gave me a hug. And said he loved me too. I told him I’ve loved every moment of the last two months I’ve gotten to spend with him. God I love him. He’s such a jerk sometimes it’s hilarious. It breaks my heart I spent so much time doing drugs and not seeing my siblings. I’m a shitty older brother. But they love me they were always asking my mom about me. Sorry this post is gonna be all over the place I’m freaked. In the dream my sister took me into the bathroom of the hotel room for some reason. I don’t remember what she said but she was happy and smiling. I was scared cause she shouldn’t be here and see me feeling like this and going through withdrawals and sneaking into the bathroom at 3am just to silently cover my finger in coke and shove it up my nose and rub it around before bed. And hide the bag. I know that sounds gross but I think other addicts might understand. That part was real life before bed. Then the bathroom with my sister was dream. Then the bathroom light in the dream suddenly turned off. She stopped talking but j knew she was there. I slowly ran my fingers across the wall for the light switch. Found it. Walked back to bed. Got in bed. Now it’s real life again. I think. Probably not. Inbetween.  I’m scared. I can’t move my body. Except my fingers. My whole body feels paralyzed. I can’t open my eyes. I can just barely barely barely mutter out “Dad...” he’s asleep I’m unable to talk loud enough. But I feel a hand grab my fingers. Dream/hallucination I guess. I try again to call for him but I can’t get any words out of my mouth. I can’t move. I need to sleep. I’m gonna try again. I’m scared. And no it wasn’t the tiny tiny amount of coke I did prior. If you’re unfamiliar with cocaine the amount was like taking a few sips of beer. I’m going to try to sleep again. I want to cry. This is the last chance I get. This is he last time anyone’s gonna help me get clean. This is the last time the girl I want to marry will watch me do this. If I fuck this up my entire life is over. The weight of my entire future is on my shoulders and it’s entirely my own evil doing.

Sorry for the wall of text. I don’t know where to break things. If you took the time to read this I appreciate you. If you didn’t, I appreciate  you tooSocial media means nothing snd no one is obliged to care about what I say hahha.

I know I wrote about drugs the whole time but I’ve had mental health problems for a long time depression and anxiety and having to learn how to manage ADHD. Drugs made everything worse and yet I couldnt stop.

To Reddit,

I can't go to a therapist, doctor or tell my parents. I know there is something wrong with me but I don't know what it is, so I'm just going to rant here and see if someone can give me an answer. Please let me know if I need to add more information. I had to go to a therapist, my parents often told me that my problems were stupid and I didn't need a therapist. They would always try to deny my therapist claims about me having depression etc. They yelled at me a lot too when I had suicidal thoughts and stuff. I don't think it's necessary to add the stuff in between this time and when I had an eating disorder. But my therapist told my parents that we needed to see a different professional because she wasn't trained to deal with patients in that field. My parents were a little more scared at this because I was sort of successfully avoiding food and loosing weight until they found out. 

Once my parents found out about my eating u first appointment itself they were pushing my parents to join me in group therapy (IOP). My parents eventually agreed and sent me there. I ate my food the first time but the next time I saw a kid not eat their food so I didn't eat mine. (Also, I was always insecure about my body but I started to starve myself when i heard that my friend was sort of doing it, and my doctor repeatedly made my feel scared of my weight even though I was always at a healthy weight, my family is also big on losing weight). This pushed my ED (eating disorder) therapist and dietician to convince my parents to move me to php. i was frustrated at this point because everything was happening too fast and we weren't working on why I wanted to starve myself in therapy, she just tricked me into giving more information on what I was doing to keep doing my ED. 

I blocked myself out and completely starved myself. My parents didn't know what to do and my therapist and dietician told them that i had to go to the hospital. My parents instead sent me to a residential house for ED. The kids there were sweet but I saw and heard a lot of things there. There was a kid with a big bandage on her arm and she told me she self harmed with blades and when she scratched the wounds there was a lot of blood. I was raised in a house where this behavior was unheard of. I was horrified. i heard stories of suicide attempts, ed behaviors like purging etc that I didn't do. There was a lot of screaming there too and (this part is hard to explain) their behaviors made me realize that my problems were truly not as bad and i wanted to be able to say what they said in terms of the horrible things they went through. (Some of the counselors would make faces to each other as the children cried).

 I only starved myself and barely lost weight but these people self harmed and attempted suicide. I felt out of control-kind of like a chained animal being poked with sticks-. I couldn't bare hearing these things so i started to self harm. The therapist was trash, all we did was her threatening me with higher care if I basically didn't stop feeling suicidal, nobody helped me fix the way i felt and gave me good coping skills, they just put me in an environment where i could not engage in the behaviors that made me feel sane (I am not exaggerating when i say sane) I just followed what people did and was very competitive (I know this is sick). My parents realized this place wasn't helping so despite being warned that i was a danger, they took me out. My parents put me back in the old place before residential (I was thinking that my problems weren't big enough to deserve happiness and to
 deserve happiness i needed to get even worse). 

My ED therapist kept telling me (i was in php) that i was a danger to myself, they made me sign these papers saying I wouldn't self harm (i had to sign papers saying i wouldn't self harm or attempt suicide) : im lucky to have a loving family and live a good life, so i feel ashamed for feeling like this. I also try to hope for bad things like me getting raped so I can say that i have been through enough and can be happy. I also hate therapists because some have told me to my face that I wasn't bad enough and others have made me feel like I am hopeless, worthless, a danger, and insane. I also hate when they trick you into giving out information and confront you on what your hiding instead of helping you solve the problem. Can someone please tell me what this is (and there is absolutely no way i will go to a therapist).

213,They're closing the only inpatient psychiatric hospital in a 75 mile radius. Help!,"On August 7th, officials at Ohio Valley Medical Center and East Ohio Regional Hospital announced plans for the permanent closure of both community hospitals located in the Upper Ohio Valley. The anticipated date of closure is October 7th, 2019. With only weeks left to act, the community joined together on social media to explore options for preventing the closure of these desperately needed facilities. *Join us on Facebook and Twitter @ Save Hillcrest/OVMC/EORH and #warr;ors.*

Together, the 1,200 employees of the hospital system facing imminent unemployment and the thousands of local residents who depend on OVMC/EORH for emergency, specialty, and primary care services have engaged in a coordinated campaign urging WV and OH politicians to intervene by any means necessary to save our local economy and preserve access to vital healthcare services in our area.

West Virginia Governor Jim Justice made the following statement in light of the announcement: 

“I have directed members of my administration to dig deep to see what kind of help the State can offer to try to stop Ohio Valley Medical Center from closing. We need to be willing to do everything we can possibly do to help, because 1,200 jobs are on the line. We would go to the ends of the earth to bring a company into West Virginia if they were going to provide 1,200 new jobs for our hardworking people, so we need to be willing to scratch and claw just as hard to protect and keep these crucial jobs at OVMC. . . I am actively talking with Congressman David McKinley and the two of us are working as diligently as we possibly can to try to find a solution. I have also put Secretary Bill Crouch with our Department of Health and Human Resources in touch with hospital leadership to see if there’s anything he can do to help. Saving these important jobs has to be a top priority.”
Indeed, the economic impact of these closures will devastate the area. At a time of revitalization in downtown Wheeling, losing one of our largest employers will negatively impact not just hospital workers suddenly scrambling for work, but small business owners throughout Wheeling whose livelihood depends on the patronage of downtown workers at larger organizations such as OVMC and The Health Plan. 
Further, local healthcare and social service organizations are ill-prepared for the sudden influx of residents in need of services ranging from primary care to emergency mental health treatment. Wheeling Hospital, located nearby, is already burdened with high patient loads and extremely long ER wait times. Wheeling Hospital, a Catholic facility, offers limited women’s healthcare services and has absolutely no programming available for patients seeking mental health or substance abuse treatment. 
Debbie Clark, Nurse Manager at Hillcrest, OVMC’s inpatient psychiatric facility, shared the following, emphasizing the dire need for mental health services in this area: 
“As you are all aware the announcement of closure to both OVMC and EORH came as a shock to those of us who work within these facilities. Hillcrest is a specialized acute psychiatric unit contracted with the state to place involuntary patients as well as voluntary patients in need of stabilization of symptoms to include psychosis, addiction, suicidality, dementia and PTSD. This client base counts on our staff to care about them and for them until such time that they can care for themselves. . .
Hillcrest is the only state diversion facility for psychiatric care within a 75 square mile area. . . Our facility has an average of 100 adult patients and 50 adolescent/children admitted each month for acute psychiatric care. On a regular basis hospitals across the state refer patients to our facility due to lack of bed availability statewide. As we have 54 adult beds and 32 youth beds, imagine the strain on the system to house these individuals. Often there is a critical need for beds/care for our adolescent population resulting in children being transported from hours away to seek treatment.
I don’t believe that our communities, schools, other hospitals or police are properly equipped or trained to deal with the increased issues that will be faced as a result of the Robert C Byrd Child and Adolescent Behavioral Center and/or Hillcrest closure. . . Suicide rates, overdoses, elder abuse and child abuse are but a few of these issues our community will be facing. . .
[Patients] have been calling the unit after the announcement with genuine fear and concern, some in tears, about where they will go for treatment if we were to close.”
In light of the opioid crisis and a nationwide shortage of both inpatient and outpatient mental health providers, allowing the closure of the only inpatient psychiatric facility in the area (with robust outpatient and IOP services available under the direction of Hillcrest psychiatrists) is undoubtedly a tragedy in the making. Without the specialty care of the physicians, nurses, techs, therapists, and social workers at OVMC, lives will be lost. 
Recently, WVU has partnered with both The Health Plan and Wheeling Hospital. In public statements, WVU Health System President and CEO Albert L. Wright, Jr. stated that the collaboration with THP will “deliver better outcomes to the people of West Virginia” via a focus on population health and wellness promotion. Now that the Northern Panhandle is facing the loss of a significant portion of providers offering preventative care, residents are calling on WVU to further their commitment to improving outcomes in WV and consider an agreement with the owners of OVMC/EORH. A fully-integrated health system could transform healthcare in WV, but faces an uphill battle with increasingly limited access to qualified providers. 
It’s no secret that rural hospitals are struggling nationwide. However, we believe that there is a unique need for the services provided at OVMC/EORH and that the hospitals could thrive if given the opportunity. Under the right management or as part of a larger health system, we could continue to serve the Ohio Valley. Help us meet the needs of our community. Help us save lives. Help us save our hospitals.

214,"Sometimes I just need to let this out. It’s long and I have to put this out just because, *trigger warning*","I often will get in this sort of mindset that something about my life isn’t right, and then I remember all of the hell ive been through. I’ve been seeing therapists on and off for majority of my life (I’m 18). I’ll go in order. When I was about 7 or 8, I was at a family friends Christmas party, they had 2 boys, 4ish and 2ish. The 4 y/o met up with some of his friends and tried to touch me and some other girl’s around my age inappropriately. They were successful. No one knew until about 4 months ago. Even I had forgotten about it. 
When I was 11, I had a friend with a sister that was mentally disabled. She had a service dog, and had a hard time speaking. My mom always explained it to me like she had the mind of a toddler, though she had the outward expression of a toddler, internally she was still her age, just with some difficulties. I was going to spend the night at their house but her sister and I got into a mild argument, she wanted me to sit down, but I didn’t want to. This went back and forth until she grabbed the skin on my throat and twisted. 
My entire life my dad had been an alcoholic. He attempted suicide before I was even born. He didn’t continue therapy when he felt uncomfortable with the therapist the hospital had assigned him. For years my father would talk to me like I was still a little child but have very adult conversations with me. Usually about politics or religion or that he “would break his back to get me what I wanted” that phrase still haunts me. He would forcibly hold me down so that I couldn’t go to bed and so that I would have to listen. Half of the time, we would sit in silence because his brain was so clouded. He never physically abused me otherwise. It was a lot of emotional abuse though. Through the years his drinking got worse, he broke ribs because of it, he got in fights, dui’s. Until Veteran’s Day, 2016 my mom, my brother and I moved out. He left terrible messages to my mom and tried to contact me. I couldn’t bear to talk to him. Slowly my parents started to talk again, we got a family therapist that we each would see individually. I had to stay home for thanksgiving due to a school event, my mom and brother went to my grandparents house and I stayed with my dad. I had to go get something at the apartment we were staying in, he saw the inside, and broke down hours later at the football game I had to attend. Hardly made it past halftime while I was performing with the band. He cried and apologized to me for hours once I got home. It was traumatic to me. We moved back into the house soon after Christmas. We got a dog, and life seemed to be going smoother. Dad wasn’t drinking, he was sort of going to AA meetings, but he eventually stopped. He didn’t like the group aspect and began drinking again. My mom warned him that if it got bad again, we’d leave for good. He stopped. But on April 24th, 2017 I had just gotten back to school from spring break, first day back. At around 8pm, my dad leaves without letting anyone know. Dinner still at the table, tv still on. Just my brother and I home. My mom gets home later and asks me where he is, I was going to ask her the same thing. We figured he went out to a bar once it had been more than an hour. Before that we figured he went for cigarettes. 11pm rolls around and I’m procrastinating homework. A knock on the front door and a police officer asks if it’s the residence of my father. He said that my dad appeared to have a self inflicted gunshot wound. I immediately broke down. I told a couple of my friends and then went into complete shock. They started calling me and texting me. Asking if I was sure that it was true. I didn’t respond for almost 30 minutes. My mom cried on the police officer, she thought I didn’t hear any of it. The next day, I wake up late to hear the priest at the church in our house, my brother assumes it was a heart attack. He found out later and went through all the stages of grief again, just a little easier. I spoke at his funeral, I don’t remember much of what I said. I was happy for a week but I didn’t know why. I felt great, and then everyone left and I didn’t know how to feel or what to do. I needed to back to school but I just couldn’t. My school counselor was insensitive. My friends turned on me. My life was falling apart and before all of this, I was just trying out different antidepressants, prescribed of course. I cried forever. I didn’t get my license until almost a year later. My mom now drives his car. 
In February of 2019 I ended up having terrible panic attacks, it lasted so long, that I had to drop out of high school just months before graduation. I still graduated, with honors, but I had to take online classes in order to even think about making it. I had to stop driving, I had to go to therapy multiple times a week. In July, I almost killed myself at my cousins house, but she and her mother helped me tell my mother that I needed help. I needed to go to the hospital, and that I am bisexual. About 4 weeks later I got into an institution, I planned on doing residential, but they didn’t have enough room. I went with PHP, made wonderful friends, got my meds adjusted and found out that I have voices in my head. I was put on meds for that. I have since left that institution after going through iop as well. I made wonderful friends, got a tattoo, and found myself a little more.
I couldn’t go to the college I planned on for the first semester, and just a few weeks ago I decided not to go for the second semester. It looks like I will be attending my university of choice in fall of 2020. 
I have talked to a lot of my family, I love them, I don’t want to hurt them or for them to go through the same pain again, but I didn’t have the support I needed at the time. Majority of the family doesn’t know the full extent, I learned the hard way that people aren’t as accepting as those in a mental hospital. 
So as far as I know, I have ADHD, ADD, Recall Disorder, Severe Anxiety, SAD, Severe depression, PTSD, and Schizo-affective disorder.
I’m sorry this was so long, thank you for reading a chapter of my life. Here’s to a better year than this bullsh*t excuse for one.",1577349381.0,False,4,1,thatshortgurl,None,eft2og,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eft2og/sometimes_i_just_need_to_let_this_out_its_long/
215,Where to go from here?,"So to jump right to it: I have self-admitted to the hospital twice in the past three years (basically a year apart, and I am due to go back any day now at this rate). I was misdiagnosed as depressed when I was 13, then I went to college and was diagnosed with ADHD with a secondary as depression. Then I was hospitalized that year and got the diagnosis of Bipolar (2--although now it's more of a spectrum than a binary diagnosis) and GAD. Last year's visit resulted in PTSD being added to the mix and this January it was discovered by a blood test that I have hypothyroidism as well (which causes similar symptoms as depression and I a medical issue which is usually 100% manageable).

So this time of year is always bad for me and I think that I'm about to peak into my major cycle as my history would indicate. My delimma is this: I am no longer able to function at work, but I am not having suicidal ideation nor thoughts of self harm or doing harm to others so I don't know what to do.

These are my symptoms:Symptoms: apathy, outbursts of rage, crushing despair, paranoia, speech impairment, inability to focus, fleeting thoughts, easily overwhelmed, deficient time management, frivolous spending (poor money management), nightmares and terrors, excessive need for sleep, migraines, flashbacks, panic attacks, constant anxiety, loss of energy, trouble sleeping,Poor hygiene, loss of appetite (extreme aversion to food), nausea, dizziness, vertigo, uncontrollable crying andLoss of balance.

I am still high-functioning, just not in a work environment and I know my grasp on things will quickly be out of my hands. I have already filed for FMLA at work, gotten new blood work for review with my primary care doctor (appt set for Wednesday), went to the county's mental health clinic who set me up with a psychologist and therapist.... In two weeks. I need an immediate action plan, so that's not soon enough.

I don't know how to take care of my mental health and keep my job at this point... I can file for short-term disability, but it's very difficult for that to last and I have to have documented proof that I am working on my issues and show progress of improvement. I won't be able to provide that. I could use my FMLA time but the papers aren't finalized yet and I don't want to ""abuse"" it in case I am denies for some reason. I do not need in-patient care because I am not suicidal or what-have-you. I have also gone through IOP before and I am to the point where DBT/CBT is not enough to subside my ailments. I don't want to change my meds because that could be a very long process--in which case I should not work because I would be unstable and unreliable--more so than now. I obviously do need to change them though because they aren't working properly. I have virtually no resources available to help me keep this in check before I get to the critical stage.... So what is the best step I can take right now to preserve my job and still take care of myself? I have honestly considered filing for long-term because this is chronic enough that damages my ""work ethic""and therefore my ability to provide stability for my household.


as a very alternative view on what's going on... The first year I was hospitalized, a dear friend--basically brother--was killed in a DD accident. Almost a year ago-ish (so a year after his death maybe) I had a ""dream"" that he was on life support and suffering in pain in an empty hospital except for me on the other side of the glass. In my gut, I know this was more than a dream, it was more like a visitation. That really had me shaken because if it was truly his spirit, he was in agony. Well earlier this week I had another one of these ""dreams"" except this one he was alive and well trying to convince me to believe him. My first reaction was to recognize I was dreaming so I did a few ""tests"" by checking my location and I even hugged him and he felt real I'm my arms. My whole family was also there to plead his case with me. He apologized for being gone so long, he was fighting in court over the accident for almost a year and a half, and that it was reality. I finally started to get accustomed to the idea of my new life with him still in it... Then I woke up in the middle of a panic attack. As if it was the day I was told he was killed. From my research, visitations are supposed to either contain a clear warning or some sort of positive reassuring feeling of love and peacefulness. I absolutely did not feel that when I woke up, even though it was a warm ""friendly"" dream. Also in my research, demons tend to prey on vicitims while they sleep with false visitations and lies.... Such as it was recommended my first encounter was. Well I believe it to be the same entity as the one in my second dream. It was a lie that my friend was alive and demons thrive off of the misery they cause, and I definitely felt miserable and in agony myself. So I have begun to contemplate that perhaps I am plagued by a negative entitiy not of this world.... But I would like a better understanding of what these dreams could be because I could very well be wrong.

216,"What John Coffee, Forrest Gump, and B-Rabbit All Have In Common With Me and My Self-Esteem. Long AF","An Open Letter on My Unique Mental Illness


To whomever may be reading this, may it serve the purpose of giving whoever reads this and whoever see’s this some sort of clarity to my unique self.

A little bit of background, I’ve been working in various kitchens since 2016. In fact I should be working right now but I got myself, like I did predict coming into work today and very unsurprisingly to me, sent home.

This whole experience of what some may call a career isn’t like what I saw on tv even though it is stressful. People aren’t shouting at me constantly, they’re not hurling curse words at me nor pots and pans. 

In all honesty, I really wish it was and I’m greatly disappointed that it’s not. Like if I had someone like Chef Gordon Ramsey I’d feel in Heaven. Yeah, the guy comes across as a dick but I assume this is part reality, part tv, and part my own romanticization. 

I’ve never really considered myself a “lifer” in the field of culinary arts and I wish the place that I work at currently would cut me loose; the same outcome I’ve faced at like the five other restaurants I’ve worked in for various reasons. 

I don’t say this because of the fact that I honestly don’t feel like a lifer or that I know I probably can’t actually handle the stress of being in a kitchen, I can’t, let’s be honest even though my being able to handle the stress has gotten better over time.

No, I say this because I just absolutely can’t stand the fact that everyone is so nice and nurturing. And I can feel my face twist up as I write this.

I know that living in an adult world people go out of their way to be nice, kind, and thoughtful; and being a part of a team people need to get along but I’m just not used to this. Even at 31 years old. 

Kindness to me is just not an endearing feeling. It just makes me want to crawl out of my skin. I’ve never been able to just say thank you. I’ve never been able to take a compliment. I’ve never been able to feel just deserving. Not feeling deserving was just gorilla glued into my wiring and I remember the first instance of this feeling at 4 years of age over having been given 5 dollars while at the beach on vacation to use at the arcade. The same looking 5 dollar bill that’s now on being used as my cover photo on my Facebook for those who don’t know.

I know that this thought, this feeling, is not normal. So many times I’ve brought this situation up to my family, my friends, and my therapists over the years but none of it has helped over the years. It’s the one thing, the one thing, that even being aware of it in my own conscious mind I can’t shake.

I feel as though I’m like the character, John Coffee in the Green Mile, where he wants the electric chair because he feels like everyone is so mean but I think the opposite. I believe strongly that everyone is too nice and it, excuse my language please, not only confuses me but it fucks me up constantly.

Also, my favorite movie of all-time, Forrest Gump. I feel like I’m “in search of my own Jenny.” It’s incredible just how much I think about this movie and how many times I’ve seen it at home, on tv, and in the theater once when it came back out for it’s 25th anniversary. If you hate Jenny just know that she was only mean to him because she didn’t know how to accept someone being so selflessly kind to her and that feels like my relationship to my job and in a way, my life. 

Furthermore; he, Forrest Gump, say does say “life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get” but I like the mandolin effect version better of “life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get,” because to me that simply represents his life with Jenny who he would always bring a box of chocolates. It’s like me. I never know what I’m going to get, in both work and life.

Last movie I bring up the movie 8 Mile even though I have my own negative feelings of it’s star Eminem not for reasons as of late but for things that are irrelevant to this letter.

To those who haven’t seen the movie, I guess  it’s loosely based on Eminem and it shows him in a “freestyle competition.” The end scene and spoiler alert, involves him in the finals of the “competition” and I don’t recall if it was luck of the draw or set up in a way where he got to go first. He would’ve been screwed on his material if it wasn’t him going first but obviously he did and the freestyle he prewrote was, as far as I remember it, was just him ripping on himself and taking the power of the other freestyler away and him winning in the competition. 
 
I bring this up to say that I am so very capable of speaking with such belligerence, with not self-hatred, but self admonishment in such a demeaning fashion. And I do speak this way to myself so openly that people just don’t know how to react so their only response is to laugh awkwardly and look at me like I’m a nut job.

No one brings this self commentary onto me rather I just do it myself and I don’t know why but it makes me feel better. Really though, what I’d really like and what hasn’t happened in more than 3 years is to cry. I haven’t cried in so long that I don’t know what it even feels like in this moment but I know it would cause a healthy release and I do believe and have said that “it takes a stronger person to let it out than it does to hold it in.” There is no shame in shedding tears but I can’t though I wish I could.

I acknowledge that I am a good candidate for therapy and I’ve been somewhat pursuing it but money’s absolutely tight and my motivation hasn’t been there. I’m someone who has been given medication starting at 6 years old and I’ve been on it since as an adult routinely. Just Abilify at a dose of 10mg’s since I was 15.

I acknowledge that I took myself off by choice at age 21 for reasons I can’t recall for a span of 3 months and it was a bad decision. Furthermore; I do acknowledge that I have run out of my current prescription for 3+ weeks. The reason I say all this about my medication is, when I was 21 I didn’t have the tools in my toolbox to do something as extreme as just take myself off my medication like I feel as though I do now even given the words of this letter. I’ve been through AA, Rehab, Intensive Therapy, and IOP.

Right now I just look at my medication as something that I absolutely do not want to define me nor do I want to rely on because of subtle intrusive thoughts. I look at it the same as when I, again, by choice took myself off of Adderall XR 20mg’s during community college in 2012. I told myself that I can learn to cope with whatever was the reason I was prescribed the medication, that I honestly don’t really know. 

I have had conversations about my medication and it just makes me not want to take them even more. It makes me want to will myself to succeed even more and to live in spite of my depression that comes in the form of intrusive thoughts.

But I’ll just end with this. There’s nothing to worry yourselves about in regards to me right now. I promise I’m safe and my mission on earth is not over yet.
