Perhaps the police/the system needs to be assessing who needs involuntary treatment differently. Maybe some of these patients are able to appear fine under brief observation despite acute illness.",jwpete27,1bdpgmr
1,"This really is terrible. NPR has an article about people hospitalized against their will because they called a hotline. That kind of thing tends to make the condition worse.

All I can say is that it's important for people to know good coping methods during and after the hospital experience. Because of the financial hardship this imposes and the high demand for therapy, it's also good to know about the self-help recommended by therapists.

A good substitute for the hotline - a warm line -

Things I often tell people -

Depression is like a pair of glasses that make everything look worse.

A lot of things can help, mostly things that are easy.

The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.

 Simple distractions can help - anything that changes your mood like beautiful music.",RWPossum,1bdpgmr

3,was inv hospitalized by my employer. I was having a panic attack. My employer told me to go to hospital (just wanted to go home) or they’d have the police arrest me!!!  I had talked another employee thru a panic attack weeks earlier. He was back to work the next day.,Mamey12345,1bdpgmr
4,"My spouse can switch in about 10 seconds from psychotic ranting about computer implants in brains and telepathic commands from secret agents to appearing completely sane when the doctors show up.  (In fact, hiding the illness may be part of the delusion in the case of my spouse.  If you are working for secret agents, you need to be able to hide it.)   The illness is not always evident.   

>I occasionally come across people who have no idea why a loved one, friend or even neighbor has called the police and insist that none of the stories of them being suicidal or acting irrational are true.

I am not a doctor, but I believe this is often actually a sign of the illness.  I once watched a psychiatrist ask, ""So you know why you are in the hospital?"" to someone who was arrested after domestic violence, breaking and entering, and trespassing.  The patient had zero idea why they were in the hospital.   

Try this the next time you meet someone like this: ask the patient if they've been hospitalized before.  If they say yes, ask what for.  When my spouse is well, the answer would be, ""I feel so stupid.  I ran out of one of my meds.  I already had an appointment with my doctor in two months so I figured I could go that long without. Ended up in the hospital after doing embarrassing stuff.""   When my spouse is ill, the answer would be, ""Because, uh, I guess I had a disagreement with the neighbor?""",wordsaladcrutons,1bdpgmr

1,"Hi I’ve been a pt and now I work in a psych ward. I don’t recommend it unless you are unable to keep yourself or others safe. It isn’t a traumatizing experience for everyone, but it was for me. But really the point of inpatient hospitalization is crisis intervention and stabilization when you are a danger to yourself or others (actively suicidal or homicidal). If weekly or twice weekly therapy and monthly or twice monthly med management isn’t enough for you right now, I would suggest trying to get into an IOP (intensive outpatient program) or PHP (partial hospitalization program). You get treatment almost daily and you maintain your freedom and autonomy. Again I would literally never suggest an inpatient psych stay unless you were going to hurt yourself or someone else.",big_boi_goose,w6ypkd

5,Depends on the situation. Maybe the time will come when you have to be hospitalized. I don't live in the US. But I did make an attempt on my life. From a very young age I have believed that this is the way I should die. The psychiatrist at the hospital where I was going for therapy asked me if I wanted to be hospitalized. I told him no. Maybe it wasn't the best option. You should first talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist.,Blue_berry1945,w6ypkd
6,Being hospitalized made things 10 times worse for me. It felt like a bunch of therapists gaslighting me and telling *me* when I'm ready to leave. I was fine after a week but they literally held me against my will and wouldn't discharge me. It was like a goddamn prison,i-commit-armchoppy,w6ypkd
7,"I had no attempts but I was hospitalized because I had suicidal thoughts time by time and they failed to adjust meds. Sometimes it is easier and faster to find meds in a hospital. In general, they admit in ward in cases when patient is dangerous for him or others.

8,"Yes it is helpful if you are aware of your needs and goals. I was 7 times in a psychward since 2015. When you are going freely then you can take your time and just working with the help you will get there.  I was mostly there for calming down my mania and it really helps because wihout it wouldn't have awareness of it or boundaries. Also for depression it was very helpful, for findin a good sleep pattern or a structure. I started to exercice with the psychward and learnt a lot of interesting stuff. Also to take medication its a good place because there is time to find the right medication. Don't take medication without knowing what you are take, ask the nurses and get your informations.

12,"Hello, tbh I can’t tell if hospitalization helps because it depends on a lot of different factors: the gravity of your case, your diagnosis and the people who work in the hospital. In my case, it helped me. I found faith, some friends and a treatment for life. I’m diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. It’s pretty different from bipolar disorder but it still a mental health issue. If you think that you’re dangerous for yourself or for anyone else you can consider to go in a psych ward. In my case, the hallucinations and the voices were scary and very loud so I took the decision to go in a psych ward. If you consider to attempt suicide, don’t do it. You only live once, and your problem is temporary. your mental health can improve if you ask for help and you tell your triggers. I wish you good luck, and God bless you.",FeistyFlight6547,w6ypkd
13,"The hospital exists (in theory***) to keep people from acutely hurting themselves or others. If you feel like you are going to kill yourself, then yes it could be helpful. If you just want help, try something else.

14,ive been in inpatient programs twice. and a partial once. honestly what helped the most was the group setting. the other patients really helped me get out of my own head. the counselors/social workers/psychiatrists were meh. out of all the staff it was actually the nurses i felt safer with bc it felt like they actually cared.,soislifee,w6ypkd
15,"I had voluntary hospitalization twice last year, it helped and saved my life. I understand how involuntary hospitalization could be very traumatizing, specially for a teenager. But if you find and choose a hospital with professionals that you trust, it can be very helpful. 

Overall, I’d recommend it if you fear you could harm yourself. It’ll help doctors adjust your meds and you get a calm, isolated environment where you’ll be kept safe.

23,If you are attempting/actively suicidal or have already attempted suicide you should go inpatient. Otherwise outpatient usually provides everything you are needing.

24,"Research the fuck out of your local wards if you really want to go, you don’t want to get screwed over and then get locked for weeks in what I personally would describe as Satan’s personal torture-house. There are some amazing psych wards out there that will really, truly help you. But there are just as many that will mess you up worse. 

Best way to know is to look at the ward’s online rating. People take hospitalization far too lightly in my opinion, if you end up at the wrong hospital it could actually be dangerous for you because you lose a lot of your patients rights AND your credibility. If someone mistreats you or abuses you, it could easily be swept under the rug as you just being crazy and untrustworthy, I mean just look at the amount of horror stories online. 

You have to research the hell out of wherever you want to go so you can end up at a place which will actually help you. Look at their Google reviews, read what people have to say.

I say that to say, read the room with your daughter. Don’t assume she does or doesn’t want to talk and if she seems like she does, a little encouragement may be welcome. Don’t assume is all I can say, I guess. She might want you as a support more than you’d think",WumboJumbo773,1cgjqbl

2,"It does depend on the level of trust you have with her, if you believe she is willing to work on her mental health (hopefully the fact that she is coming home is because she's ready to). 

Something I've implemented with family /friends due to my own experiences not being able to effectively ask for help is a code system. Check in by asking for a colour/number on a scale, with easy to remember/understand references. For us, red is ""I am feeling very unsafe and am at real risk of harming myself"" (in which case my response is to wrap up or drop whatever I'm doing and let them know how far away I am, ask them if there's anything in the house I need to hide when I get there and if they want me to alert the troops (the rest of their support system)), orange is ""it's a very hard time for me right now and I need some compassion/support"", yellow is ""things are okay but a bit dicey"" and green is ""I'm okay/at baseline/no cause for alarm"". 

This has been incredibly helpful for us because when you're the orange/red stage, finding the energy/capacity to even articulate it to someone can be impossible. And knowing my friends and family have a way to tell me how they are without a lengthy check in/conversation makes me worry less about them struggling in silence. 

From there you can develop plans for each colour/stage. But be careful not to overload your daughter with plans. Start with the code system and build from there over time once you both get your footing.",skittlesallday,1cgjqbl

0,"It's completely normal to feel apprehensive and anxious about starting a new treatment program, especially something as intensive as a Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP). It's a big step towards healing, and it's okay to have doubts and fears about what's to come. The fact that you recognize your need for help and have taken steps to enroll in a PHP shows a great deal of courage and willingness to work towards your mental wellness.

Feeling uncertain about your readiness for help or questioning your worthiness of the investment in your own recovery is not uncommon. Remember, your journey to wellness is unique to you, and it's not about meeting certain standards or timelines but about making progress in a way that's meaningful and beneficial to you. The staff in the program are there to support you, and their perception of progress is meant to be a guide, not a judgment. It's important to communicate openly with them about your goals, fears, and what progress means to you.

Facing financial pressures while seeking treatment adds another layer of stress, but prioritizing your mental health is crucial. It's the foundation upon which you can rebuild your life, including your education and career. Try to focus on the present and the support the program offers, rather than the pressure to rush through it.

You are worth the time and energy it takes to heal. It's okay to be scared, and it's okay to have doubts, but try to hold onto the hope that this program is a step forward. You've made a brave choice by deciding to pursue mental wellness. Allow yourself to be open to the help and support available to you, and remember that recovery is a journey, not a race.

I suppose long story short, I don't want to be bothered or watched. I just want my space and not have to justify or worry about anything I feel like doing. I also just want to know I can get a break from everything, go home to somewhere comfortable and cuddle up with my cats.  

I suppose that's a good point that it would be different facility to facility.",Asch_Lavigne,pvku6s
7,"Haha, yeah all my questions/concerns were in the post. I wanted to know basically what to expect and how I'm supposed to ""instantly"" open up and trust people I don't know, as opposed to my regular therapist who earned my trust over time and we built a relationship. As well as group woes, as I have never done those. What if I just don't care about what anyone else is saying, want to yell at them, or just don't feel like saying anything?",Asch_Lavigne,pvku6s

Keep in mind, that unless it is drop-in/drop-out, that they are going to fully expect for you to be cimmited to it. Also, they will very likely have this ""all inclusive"" policy, even if the accomodation is ludacris! Some groups will be what is called processing groups. While others will be relaxed fun, or art type groups instead. That is the best that I can tell you for now. If you have any specific questions, then please let me know. Thanks!",Bablyon,pvku6s

Try to practice self control as often as possible of course.

In regards to how to open up so suddenly - just try not to overly invest in the thought of it. You’re almost definitely never going to see these people again, so listen to what they have to say, share what you can if you can, and take things with a grain of salt.

When I asked what kind of group therapy topics I had to ""attend"" they said something about ""oh one about this and one about that, etc...""

I hated 1:1 therapy.  I hated inpatient treatment.  But the IOP that was 9-1 was the best thing I went through in my mental health journey.  I was also worried about it, like you are, but to be honest with myself, I needed it to get through.  Nothing else was working.

I was hesitant, but it really did help me to just open up and try to gain something from it.  It was difficult to share with a bunch of strangers, but it was necessary, because nothing else was working for me.

2,"Hey, if you check some of my posts I’ve talked about how I got rid of my dp/dr and it was very chronic and intense and took a lot of work. I personally think it’s great that you can do a hospital programme and derealisation is definitely a worthy reason. You might learn a lot of new ways to overcome it and learn to not be afraid of derealisation. 

I’ve done so much research on derealisation and depersonalisation and the main point that a lot of people speak of is “acceptance”. Once you start to accept the derealisation and not be scared of it, it slowly goes away. I would say I’m fully recovered from it but I do have my moments during the day where I think “is this real?” But I slowly draw myself back and just accept it and then I proceed with my day.

If cannabis is what triggered this I hate to say it but it's not the cannabis' fault. It just brought out something hidden. It doesn't cause these psychosis breaks and pull them out of nowhere, it picks them out and unmasks them prematurely. If cannabis hadn't done it, a severe trauma event could've done it too.

If a bad trip on cannabis can cause you enough stress to trigger that disposition, imagine what any serious trauma mightve done?
Or still might do. You're aware of it which is what rules it out of being a psychosis yes. But you're in denial of its severity and possible progression. Professionals have given you warning you need help, that's what they trained to do. It's better to learn the skills that'll be offered now before it possibly does worsen.

The tricky thing about family history is a surprising amount of people don't ever get diagnosed and therefore there's no history. In lineage probably only a few Gen back in your family it wouldn't have been uncommon for the aunt who heard and talked to birds that weren't there to not be mentioned, or to be made light of...
If I relied on my family history it would look like my dad developed BPD out of nowhere.
I'd have developed so many diagnoses out of nowhere with no possibility of getting based on history. because its only genetic or triggered by brain damage (which i do not have). Some of which turned round and made me see symptoms I was missing, and exactly which family member needed a visit too. My grandma was diagnosed with anxiety after years of insomnia only because I finally found a GP who said ""I don't think it's your insomnia as a root issue, I think it's your anxiety"" and I told her about my own visit.

Idk how much time you've spent researching cause of mental illnesses or who all you've spoken to. I've spent 10yrs doing so daily. Because no family history so how could this have possibly popped up without trauma related to it that i may not have acknowledged as trauma?
I don't see why you need to fight about this at all, you asked for advice and opinions on going to treatment. I gave you that opinion and then you started to argue about cannabis being the cause instead because you didn't like that part of mine. I'm sorry we see different research, but with cannabis it's underesearched and as someone who has spoken to doctors for and against it and had my medical marijuana licensing for years (meaning I have had doctors and NPs who specialized in medical cannabis to give me my facts) I know all the research is biased or not done in control set ups on both points of view.
As a teen I was convinced my mental health problems were a direct relation and caused by cannabis use. Until I quit for 2 yrs and things got significantly worse. It wasn't until a doctor took a real good look at my history and suggested cannabis wasn't the cause but over consumption of it may have been what triggered  something.

I never said it wasn't a possibility your brain wouldn't manage coping, I also said there are other things in life that could trigger it too.
These issues are never not going on through the entirety of everyones life and everyones degree of severity is different. Some brains just manage to cope better than others.

Couldn’t it get worse as time goes on because you formed the initial neural connections due to the weed and then rumination and worry caused those connections to get stronger despite quitting weed years ago?

27,"Yeah they are. I never said all side effects are long term. You're putting words in my mouth now. The side effects you're referring to are not from the cannabis, they're from what was triggered by it. Again some brains cope better than others.

You didn't form those initial connections due to weed, you merely opened them or worsened them.
The older I get the more little silly things and even one time events I look back on I see patterns that were so spread apart and just went unnoticed that if they'd grouped together and been recognized my diagnoses could've come before the breakdowns. It's really hard to appropriately assess family or even individual history to determine these things that don't show up on lab tests. There's so much that's easily missed or pushed off because there is such a broad range of symptoms and the similarities in cases can only ever be generalized. 
Yes that is exactly what's happening. As I've tried to say. This is the concern of your professional and why they suggested this treatment, you have progression despite stopping consumption. You are at a critical life stage being in uni, I think you underestimate how easily stress can cause another break for you. Your professional can see a note signs you won't. And they won't always tell you what they are, especially if you're iffy about accepting help offered.

I’m also wondering if they’re biased in favor of recommending more intensive treatment to make the facility more money. I’m not sure. Joining the program would mean letting my employers know I can’t work for 3 weeks, abandoning my responsibility to watch my sister, potentially missing out on important school assignments and lowering my gpa, and committing to being in therapy for 4 hours a day 5 days a week.

A jump like that is only made when it's likely needed. I'd be more concerned that I think I'm OK but after talking to a professional for 30minutes, they don't think I'm receiving the help I need. This person sees people all day every day with issues like yours.",ConfidantLacking,sv3r39

0,"Everyone's experiences from mental hospitals tend to differ from each other, but a couple of common themes I've been noticing is that staff there tend to gossip about their patients & lack of funding/lack of training. Sometimes, it can be understaffed. 


There's also a lot of forced forms of being restrained, meaning none of the patients provided any sort of consent into doing it whatsoever. Staff can also get shitty with the patients by yelling or screaming at them; which can be traumatizing and scary.


On the other hand: I feel like you would have to do an extensive amount of research on which hospital you'll be going to. A lot of them may be poorly rated, but some may or may not offer the resources you're looking for. ",Eastern-Policy7643,1ap8h6f
1,"People's experiences vary because of differences in staff and also differences in the patients who are there at the time. 

Even so, when somebody says that his experience was hell, I'm inclined to think that this reflects not only the patient's condition - which was obviously unhappy - and how good the patient is at getting along with people. Some staff members are disrespectful of patients, but the reverse is also true.

A hospital is great for making people safe but it's not the ideal setting for therapy. Going to a therapist's office is generally better for therapy.

A lot of things can help, mostly things that are easy.

The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.

 Simple distractions can help - anything that changes your mood like beautiful music.",RWPossum,1ap8h6f
0,"To answer your question they only drug test people who are on medications involving  antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti anxiety, etc.
You’ll be safe if your not prescribed on any medications for a mental illness. The partial hospitalization program is pretty lockdown they take your belongings and your phone when you walk in, they also check your shoes to see if your not bringing any drugs and dangerous objects that could be cause self harm. I’ve been in the partial hospitalization program when I was 15 and it’s not fun but not bad either. My program ran from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm and is structured like a school only with less people. This involves a daily schedule with periods, each hour/period involves activities and lessons which consists of coping skills, mindful thinking, reframing, self reflection, and learning/understanding yourself. Most of the lessons are boring as I remember spacing out and learning nothing but if you want to better yourself, I recommend paying attention and contributing with the lesson. If you stay engaged and ask questions not only will the lesson be helpful but it will make time go by quickly. I remember some kids would run away as soon as they were dropped off near the entrance of the building but eventually they would get caught and brought back to the hospital with nasty attitudes. The staff are kind and willing to teach and engage with everybody although that may depend on the place you go to. The staff in my hospital loved to socialize and were friendly which made me feel much more comfortable being there. I remember there was a girl who was suicidal and was brought to a safe room (always with her consent) and while she was in there staff members would talk to her kindly for hours without leaving her behind. They were passionate to help us and are there for you whenever you need to talk or have any questions. The program also has lunch time and breaks where you have the opportunity to socialize and engage with your peers. I highly recommend that you socialize and make friends so that you can enjoy going and have another reason to attend the program. I had a hard time making friends due to my paranoia and the day felt like an eternity. I loved the lunch as we were given two good options which consisted of a salad meal and a regular meal (sandwich or pizza, juice, beans, and a snack). During lunch we would either talk about how our days are going or watch a movie. During break everyone played card games, board games, and video games. Near the end of the day we would go to a classroom with a teacher who will teach basic school subjects like math, english, history, etc. During this time I had an opportunity to finish all of the school work that I missed during that school year. Once the lessons are over you will be able to get your belongings including your cellphone back and leave the building. It may be a locked environment but it’s not bad when you have caring staff members and peers/friends who want to watch you succeed.",Particular_Tadpole27,vi7wz5

2,"Our PHP is 18+ and we don't do any of that shit. Hell, that sounds more like when I was in freaking jail! In our PHP, we come and go as we please, and if we want to leave, we can. We just have to sign ourselves out and tell the counselor we are leaving. I spend most of my 2 days a week there (thank you COVID for knocking me from 5 days to 2 days (and then no days when the Center was closed), which they never changed back after re-opening ahahahha lucky me!) wandering around the hallways, or going downstairs to visit the pharmacy staff, or sit outside for a while. I have ADD (just found THAT out) and am autistic, so it is safer for me to be able to go outside if I need to, especially with my main disorder. Sometimes it flairs up really bad (I will have BAD impulses and urges) so I really need to be away from people and chill out when that happens. It happens more than I would like to admit, so I am always wandering the hallways or outside. I, truthfully, am only in the PHP because the court ordered me there as part of my Probation once I had been released from jail, where I had spent a year. Once I am off Probation in December, I really don't have to go anymore if I don't want to. Only 6 more months to go! I think I might just stay in it, even though they can't do much for my main disorder there anyhow, and they know it, so I am just left alone a lot of the time. We do worksheets and talk about stuff in Group, and we watch a movie every Friday. We do a lot of work with anxiety, depression (I am dx'ed with both) and coping skills, self-image, stuff like that. I will admit that some of the worksheets catch my interest, and they often are very insightful. They get ya thinking that's for sure.

I get along with everyone there (one guy creeps me out, but he is just a creepy kind of dude and has NO filter...yikes) and with all the counselors. It is a nice place to get away from home for a couple days from 9am-3pm and it is nice to be in a place where you feel you belong. It is very comfortable and pleasant, and I will admit, I don't mind going there much at all. Just getting up at 7:30am to get my van at 8:30am SSUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKS. I am lucky that transportation is provided! :D That is the worst of it though.

That's my experience, as an adult in PHP, which isn't much different than a juvenile Program would be (I don't know if our counseling center has one), content-wise. Good luck!",SadAndAnxiousBean,vi7wz5

Granted, a hospital is there to assist, but they aren't a catch all system. Unless the hospital has a dedicated mental health wing to direct people to, a hospital isn't actually equipped for therapy. 

What was your friend realistically expecting the hospital staff to do? They aren't licensed clinicians and could become liable for legal consequences. Unless your friend had a medical emergency, they aren't equipped to negotiate / navigate suicide.

At most they could refer a psychologist, but that requires it's own rigmarole. 

Especially during a pandemic, hospital staff are battle weary and less sympathetic. I would dare say, hospital staff themselves might need a suicide prevention services as well.

I'm not saying I'm uncaring for your friend's crisis, but that a suicide hotline might be a option, OR a mental health institution?

92,"thank you very much for your kind and thoughtful message

im really glad you had a good experience and were able to find the help you deserve. i only wish the system could produce more of that. 

theres been days im so depressed i cant even roll over in bed. people truly don't understand that at all",WishingYouBetter,rlkzeu
93,but there's actually measures in place to help keep them safe. are you really suggesting there is no issue with them denying her the help she needs and asked for?,WishingYouBetter,rlkzeu
94,"im sorry to hear that as well, i sincerely hope your friend is okay",WishingYouBetter,rlkzeu
95,"Honestly, thank you for being a support for your friend. I only got through my battle because of my support network (family, friends, family clinic) otherwise I would certainly not be here. 

I understand completely what you both are going through, and it's completely fair to say people don't understand. Not always due to lack of trying, but it's like trying to interpret the feelings of grief when you haven't lost someone close to you. It's almost impossible. 

Keep fighting and making your voice heard. You are the best champion of your own mental health and you are worth fighting for.",jnolsen94,rlkzeu
96,There are alternatives to hospital. People can be managed in the community by a mental health team doing daily visits. Research has shown that people in their own environment recover better then being in a hospital.,TraditionalGift6141,rlkzeu

98,"i would absolutely do anything for this friend. theyve done so much for me and i owe them the world, they deserve the world

id hate to see them lose their battle because of an incompetent healthcare system. so i'll absolutely do my best to be there for them, always

and you are right, some people do try to understand. i just wish more people could find that empathy for those who are struggling

thank you very much for your kind message. i appreciate it",WishingYouBetter,rlkzeu
99,there wont be any recovering if they kill themselves first because they were and are in immediate danger. nor did they make any attempt to set them up with any community resources. they just sent them away,WishingYouBetter,rlkzeu
100,"Idk what research you've found that provides this, but usually the reason people are sent to a hospital is because their environment + mental health is killing them.

I finally ran away from my abusive adoptive mother five years ago, and now I'm sitting in my bedroom that I'm still in the process of decorating and setting up exactly as I want it, in an apartment I share with someone who was just a stranger I hoped would make a good roommate but became my best friend, their two cats following me everywhere and loving on me because they adore me, a job I'm passionate about and an even better one that I'm in the process of interviewing for, and a fiancé who has my back no matter what and who I wouldn't be where I am without. I am not yet financially stable or in a place where I don't worry about keeping my bills paid, but your story gave me a little extra hope that I too can make it there, and reminded me of how far I have come already and how proud of myself I should be. Sharing our stories helps us remember to love ourselves and that we deserve happiness and safety, and to not forget how far we've come and what we have in our worries about where we are still struggling. Thank you for this, and I pray you continue to see your life blossoming into something full of all the beauty, kindness, and safety you deserve in the world.

The main reason why I'm responding to your post is that I want to tell you about a self-help group that was designed specifically for helping people who have been released from inpatient mental health care. It's called Recovery International. It's respected by professionals. It's been helping people since the 1940s. It has books and meetings, local and online.  
  
You can get information about Recovery at their website. This news report tells you about it -  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhyq0tXtg5A&t=212s  
  
Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy (CBT) than with medicine, and some are successful with self-help based on CBT. I can show you some CBT self-help but first I want to say that recently there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing.  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
   
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
   
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
   
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.  
   
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.  
   
Video - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -

13,"I have volentarily been hospitalized, and my college tried to involentary me multiple times completely unjustifyably. I disclosed a trauma to my boss at school after being pressured to do so. My boss forced me to go to the health center. The health center was extremely rude and condicending and left me in a room alone for around an hour. Then they sent someone to talk to me who I specifcally said I didn’t want to talk to. The reason being is she was horrible at her job. She proved this by not even evaluating my sucidality and basically just threatening me unless I pretended I was ok. 

Later that day, I dissociated at work, which was totally normal for me at the time. My bosses were well aware of it and we had discussed that I just need a few minutes and I’d be fine (apperently this does legally count as accommodation but I didn’t know this at the time). I wasn’t bothering anyone, I wasn’t in anyone’s way. Well apperently the health center told my boss to call campus safety everytime I dissociate (and no one bothered to tell me this) so they told campus safety I was suicidal and campus safety got in my face and kept asking what I needed and wouldn’t take “space and a minute to myself” as an answer. They finally left me alone after an hour of this nonsense and threatening to take me to the hospital.

For the next year, they threatened to call campus safety almost constantly. Then one day, I was upset and so I went home, but apperently they still called campus safety and told the, I was suicidal. They showed up at my door and said they’d break it down if I didn’t let them in. They stayed for 2 hours. They kept asking me to “prove” I wouldn’t kill myself in the future. The only way I got them to leave was by calling my therapist and having her tell them to fuck off (I litterally had just left her office). Then they tried to grill her for information illegally because I didn’t give consent (she told them nothing thank god). 

So then I was illegally fired from that job over not being suicidal? But not to worry they sure as hell made me suicidal because I was basically harassed by administration and told everything was my fault. The head of the health center said that dissociation “scared her”, well then you have no business in healthcare lady. They tried to force me out of school, and I only lived and finished out of spite. 

I have certainly had ideation since then, but I have been really lucky that my therapist listens to me on why I am not a risk to myself. I think with everything that has happened they would be extremely reluctant to force me.",FriendlyFoundation47,1au2c12

It's to the point now that I have not slept more than 3 hours in a row in 3 years, when I do sleep it's constant nightmares and reliving past traumas, I have lost all trust in any medical professionals at all,and just am kinda here doing what I need to do to get buy , want to just end it all but I would not do that to my daughter. Somehow I still manage to hold down a good job,make it to work almost every day...there are some days I just can't and my job is accept of this....my life sense I was 17 has been an mental illness nightmare with all kinds of things like this incident happening and even worse.
I have tried to go back to the Drs to get help cause I know my mental health is getting worse, but I can't even get to their office or an online appointment without total panic attacks and I then run away to my safe space .....I have come to the conclusion that this is just my life now and I have to deal with it.

They can help you in a variety of ways with things like med management, developing coping strategies, CBT and/or DBT, group sessions, and access to trauma informed counselors if need be.

3) Does your insurance cover the PHP cost out of state? If you’re currently in treatment your psychologist/psychiatrist can help with the PHP referral.

25,"I do get like this almost once a month coming up on 3 years Sept 3rd because it will be the anniversary of the day I went into labor & had to have an emergency C-section and in the end wound up losing my son who was 37 weeks exactly. My first. And only. And ever since my depression has bottomed out badly again. — Luckily, my CPTSD/childhood trauma & abuse therapist also specialized as a grief therapist .. and, sadly a very very close colleague of mine had gone through essentially the exact same situation as I had 4 years prior with her first born. And she was my lifeline. 

But, roughly 6-ish weeks after I lost my precious angel I don’t know what caused it, or why it happened then, exactly.. (??) But, I did inevitably wind up having to check into the psych ward for roughly a month and a half .. 

I kept trying to play it off to my couple close friends that it was the same suicidal I’d felt since I was in the middle of giving birth and they lost his vitals and my life irrevocably changed - where it was like: “I don’t *actively* want to commit suicide, but it’d be freakin AMAZING to just not have to wake up in the AM” — but they kind of caught onto my change in behavior - so, they had a bit of a confrontation/mini intervention and I wound up being 100% truthful and honest with them because it shockingly meant the world to me that someone genuinely cared that much. And so the next day I checked into our Cities best hospital’s psych ward sometime around late November and I got to leave the day before Christmas Eve. 

So, can I sincerely tell you what I think is happening here, which is EXTREMELY alarming to me 🥺 and makes me think you need to check yourself in ASAP ..?? 

For me, at least, I had never once in my life thought out a plan (as to how I would execute my death & the details) .. until after the death of my son.. but once I did .. 
.. I have to be honest with you — it was exactly like someone had taken a 50 lb weight off of my shoulders&chest .. I felt very briefly like I was just about the closest thing to happy as I’ve ever been since Sept. 3rd,2019 because I had finally made up my mind and made an official decision (of which to end my life) and there is a finality to that which - for me, at least - seemed to take this massive burden off of my mind / obsessive thoughts, etc. 

And it sounds like you haven’t been the “ehh we can keep an eye on your behavior and you should definitely return back to therapy at a minimum of at least once a week!” .. because you weren’t just saying “I have been suicidal … but I don’t think I could kill myself” which - actually - is what a vast majority of people say !! 

You’ve been so suicidal and depressed that you’ve literally thought your entire suicide plan out .. in detail.. 🥺☹️🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼 And you’ve been ruminating on those detailed plans for 4 solid days .. NVM how long you’ve been suffering and how awful your depression has been leading up to this past Saturday when you finally caved and sorta said “Screw It!!” And hit your “rock bottom” so to speak.. 
… You NEED to at the BARE MINIMUM get an emergency appointment with your therapist & leave them a voice mail today telling them exactly what you wrote in this post and emphasize that you are not as bad and it’s becoming past tense but at least as long as they know they can squeeze you in ASAP I would hope!! 

You also need to speak to your close(st) friend(s) // family member(s) and fill them in !! These two things have have haveeee to happen if you aren’t going to check yourself into the psych ward today. 

As I do not know your ENTIRE story and am missing A TONNNN of details — I cannot make that judgement call .. but I wish you the best of luck sweetie & I am always here to talk if you need 💕🫶🏼",BordeuxlineBiDesign,wvwuiq

Losing the opportunities to make your life at least a little worth it in future? If you truly have no ambitions and are certain you wanna die enough to get resolutely get on with it?

Since you're here the answer is you are conflicted which means though you'll probably get close but you'll probably change your mind. If you are confident that you are capable of taking your life put yourself in care, if not you're in a bad state anyway maybe find someone to watch you if not maybe commit yourself anyway or find the part of yourself that has ambition and wants to die in a way that earns a tombstone saying, ""though they didn't enjoy life that much they went out like a complete badass and their legend will live for eternity, they truly left a legacy to be proud of"" 

In other words hang on long enough to die in a cooler way, though suicide can be reasonable, my standing is that you never know what life has in store and even if it has nothing you can attempt to find contentment.

One of the big thoughts that goes along with mental health issues is that we don’t want to burden anyone. We slowly pull away because people can’t understand why we can’t“snap out of it”. We don’t want to burden our loved ones with what’s really going on. And when someone’s younger it’s even more overwhelming. No idea of the OPs age I just had that thought pop in my head. People do need to reach out. 

My vote is go check themselves in. It’s a start to finding some help out of those suicidal ideations. And again I appreciate where you are coming from. I just hope that if you ever needed help you’d reach out. :)

But you need to consider what that means as well. You’re right, medical bills and debt are a factor. You will be forced onto psych based medicine (part of what you consent to when you sign up for it)
You don’t know how long you’ll be there. Average for a lot of folks is 3-7 days, but you’re under the “care” of the psychiatrist that is assigned to your case. You’re not coming out until they think you’re no longer a danger to yourself or society.
In most cases the staff in these facilities are terrible due to conditions and should probably been seeking “help” themselves.
This stays on your medical history forever and it WILL follow you. If you ever had an aspiration for a military or government job, that’s now off the table.
If you’re the conceal and carry type, you’ll never be able to legally own or carry a firearm of any kind, at all.
The rental and real estate world is changing fast, this can play a roll in getting accepted into these things as a tenant as well.
People are going to ask where you disappeared too.
No matter what anyone says, the stigma is there, and people will judge you and think you’re a lunatic.


This is all info I wish would have been explained to me. These places should be treated as an extreme last resort. It’s a prison for the misheard and misunderstood.",obscureproducer4725,1cubceb
1,my advice is if you truly want the cheapest way to get admitted then drive over (preferably have someone else drive you) to an er and just tell them that you’re having a mental health crisis and you feel like a danger to yourself. More than likely they’ll put you on a 72hr hold and transport you to a mental health facility.,memestar1221,1cubceb
2,"If you are sick enough to be hospitalized, then you should be good on the job front. If you have a legit hospitalization, then they can’t fire you for it. As far as debt goes, idk. Most hospitals have financial aid.

3,"In my experience, hospitals are for stabilization of a bad situation. I would go immediately if you're in a real crisis. You don't want the results from that.

4,"Well, you would stay anywhere from 3 to 10 days or so. Have you called to see if you would be a candidate for being admitted?

It’s definitely worth it if it can save your life and improve it’s quality. ",Having-hope3594,1cubceb
5,"Assuming here you're in the US:

It is so much better, you get treated better and have more rights when you admit yourself versus being admitted ""against your will"". So unless you're about to do something you'll probably regret, check yourself in as a voluntary patient instead of an involuntary patient. Telling your doctor or therapist that you are going to...yourself will likely get you committed as an involuntary patient, that should only be reserved for emergencies. It's a legal thing. As involuntary, you are not allowed to direct your care or check yourself out without a judge giving you the okay. It's similar to being arrested (unfortunately no joke). 

Anyway, there are a few options to get a stay in the mental hospital:

If you have health insurance, call who covers your mental healthcare, sometimes under ""behavioral health"". Ask what providers are in your network. If you're not currently seeing a psychiatrist, you're going to need one. Say that it is urgent and if you can possibly get a sooner appointment. A psychiatrist can then arrange an inpatient stay when you go to your appointment. If you already have a psychiatrist, you can ask for an urgent appointment, and again, they will probably recommend a place and send a prior authorization for you to go there. Insurance usually wants authorization first, because inpatient stays are expensive. The doctor has to fill out a form saying an inpatient stay is necessary. But it's similar to getting a hospital stay for anything else, like getting your appendix out. You then check into the psychiatric hospital that they referred you to.

If you're uninsured/or underinsured, look up what your county hospital/hospital district is. This is the public hospital that gets funding from grants and tax money. Sometimes you can even find the psychiatric hospital/unit that they run. Sometimes called psychiatric emergency services (like an ER but for mental health). You can either show up there and ask to be admitted, or if you can't find what their psychiatric unit is, just go to their regular emergency room. You will get evaluated by a psychiatrist on call and really stress that you need an inpatient stay because you, ""fear for your health and safety"" or something along those lines. Since you showed up there yourself, you will likely be admitted under voluntary status.

(These hospitals won't cost as much but they're also not very nice places in general). I got my bills written off in 7 years with only some dings to my credit score. They pretty much assume people going there can't pay their bills. 

Then there's option three. The nuclear option. Involuntary status. Call 911 or any suicide hotline and tell them you're ready to do it and you have a plan. Police and an ambulance will come to your house. The paramedics will do a quick check of you, and transport you to the nearest emergency room (no, you don't get to pick under this scenario). Maybe you will go in the back of the police car in handcuffs. It depends on how polite you are, and how the first responders feel that day. Ambulance rides are nicer but way more expensive. The cop car is free, but you're going to be handcuffed. Then they'll admit you to the psychiatric department through the emergency room. They're not allowed to experiment on humans, but they are allowed to give you whatever treatment they want as an involuntary patient, unless you're allergic to it. That means if you have depression but they want to say you're psychotic, they can give you anti-psychotics. If you decline treatment, they will say you're non-compliant and being ""combative"", even if you're totally polite about it. It's their word against yours, and as one intelligent nurse said to me, ""who's going to believe you? You are the patient"". Thus, you are the crazy one. This is how most people end up in the psychiatric hospital, so you're not alone picking this option. But bless your heart, it's a miserable ride. 

I've done all of these myself, and I would highly recommend the first two over the last option. But the last option is a guaranteed way to get that ""psychiatric holiday"", maybe a court mandated 90 days of it. No, they don't care if you have rent, a job, or pets to feed. They're locking your ass up with the last option, but it is keeping you safe when you are a harm to yourself. Hopefully you have a responsible person who will feed your cat and keep you from getting evicted if you pick option 3. I would totally go voluntarily. You can still stay and get help, get stabilized, get caught up on sleep, separate yourself from your toxic environment, whatever you need. A voluntary stay can also turn into an involuntary one if you say certain things (I think you know what they are- directly threatening harm to yourself or others). If you have insurance, I would start by calling the behavioral health line. It's usually answered by a real human 24/7.

12,"Most of things that you mentioned are false. 1) consenting to being hospitalized does not automatically consent to being medicated. You can be medicated involuntarily on an emergent situation or if petitioned and granted by a judge.  2)hospitalization stays vary on a case by case basis. Laws differ from state to state, but each state has its own variation of a specified timeline for voluntary hospitalizations where you must be released unless your case is going to be taken to court and the judge will extend your stay. Here in Illinois, it’s 5 days. 3) you can still join the military. You will need your recruiter to file a waiver on your behalf. More than likely the waiver will be approved. You can also have a government job as well as be a LEO with a psych history; however, there are certain barring diagnosis such as schizophrenia for obvious reasons. 4) Federally, you can buy and own firearms granted that you were not involuntarily hospitalized or adjudicated as mentally defective by a court (this is straight from the 4473 form). State laws are different and may prohibit ownership or conceal carry for a certain period. Illinois requires a firearm owners identification card (FOID) to own firearms and its also needed for conceal carry. The FOID card gets revoked with any kind of psychiatric hospitalization and there is a ownership prohibition period of 5 years from the last hospitalization. This is different in states that do not require any kind of licensure for firearm ownership. 5) it is highly illegal to deny housing or evict someone based disability including mental illness. Any fresh out of law school attorney would win the case if it ever even went to court.

17,"Don’t listen to that guy. Most of that information is anecdotal and false. If you are not doing so well that you are considering to be hospitalized then you should definitely seek treatment. You may not need to get hospitalized and can seek treatment on an outpatient basis. 

Just so you know, there is a significant difference between voluntary and involuntary hospitalization. I’ve seen commercial pilots, train conductors, police officers, and active duty military personnel who were hospitalized and continue to be employed in their respective fields. Only certain jobs require that you disclose any mental illness or a hospitalization. Otherwise, this is information is protected federally by HIPAA (assuming that you are in the US). You can request for a doctor’s note for when you miss work that mentions that you were hospitalized but does not disclose the type of hospitalization or the reason . If your employer does find out, there may be restrictions placed on your duties. These restrictions are usually temporary. Yes, mental health stigma does exist, but you’d surprised how accommodating and understanding some employers could be. It may be extremely difficult to get better on your own and you are on here for a reason. 

When you mention debt, are you referring to not getting paid while on leave? Do you have sick leave/vacation days that you could use? If you are worried about medical bills, do you have health insurance?",11Reddit22,1cubceb
18,"Uhm. Unless your career specifically ask about mental health (medical, military, pilots, etc)….. and as long as you’re voluntary (you should get notice if you’re involuntary)…. Then you’ll still be able to get a gun, etc…..

If you are involuntary (a lot of psych wards are requiring this), it is more likely to happen if police pick you up or you go to the ER…. But once you there, just ask the psychiatrist if you can become voluntary….. they can switch it over up until you get on a court order or possibly discharged first….keep asking daily… in my case over 30 hospitalizations, simply asking to be switched to voluntary works 50-80% of the time. 

Involuntary court orders are put in the Law Enforcement Information Network…. My state police will send a letter explaining that you’re not allowed to purchase fire arms. 

Another option is go to what’s called a freestanding psychiatric hospital not connected to another hospital system…. They typically do their own evaluations and let you be voluntary…. 

If you’re not a danger to yourself or others, look for an outpatient mental health professional…. Or ask your primary care for a referral.

I have a schizophrenic brother who I assume struggles with that (he stabbed my stepdads arm) so on the other hand the mental health field is overwhelmed right now and you will see someone faster at a mental hospital, since OP is having violent thoughts. The thing I would recommend is seeing what types of therapy techniques do they use? DBT? Cognitive therapy? Choice theory (my fave)? And find one you think will help you the most.

88,"Intrusive thoughts are literally thoughts about the things we find morally reprehensible... anxiety over potentially doing things out of character. The studies on patients who struggle with these thoughts consistently say they will not be acted on. I've observed the community and had personal experience with what happens when faced with a trigger (thing that could be harmed/cause harm) and instead of doing what your intrusive thoughts say you'll do you have an intense spike in anxiety and freeze up. It's possible to have a panic attack. But actually doing the thing is not the typical outcome, and I've actually never heard of it happening. The whole point of intrusive thoughts is they are unreasonable and dont reflect reality, and treating them as if they do like checking yourself into a mental facility so you ""aren't a danger to others"" is reassures the thought as having validity. Harm intrusive thoughts are the most terrifying and miserable types, but in the end, it would be insanely unlikely for OP to act on them despite how they feel, and its actually more likely they would have a bad experience at the facility. If OP meant they had violent desires that is different from intrusive thoughts and they should get help, but the symptom common in OCD... that is a completely different thing and avoidance is seen as a compulsion (which you must resist to quit the cycle of thoughts eventually)",,uhpksc

Dude, my intrusive thoughts have been about hurting other people for the past ELEVEN years. I’ve never hurt anyone and  never had the urge to hurt anyone.

The problem is that sometimes my brain asks me things like ”what if you’re capable of hurting someone? What if you’re a psychopath? What if you have hurt someone? Are you secretly a bad person?” Then I obsess over these thoughts, googling symptoms of psychopathy, avoiding sharp objects etc.

Violent INTRUSIVE thoughts are pretty common for people with ocd yet those thoughts don’t make us hurt people. It’s people like the one’s in this comment section making assumptions about a disorder they know nothing about, who make people with ocd afraid of seeking help.

1,"So once you are admitted in an inpatient facility, there are currently COVID protocols in place ( and it may depend on your state). So for a patient, you may not wear masks indoors since most in patient facilities are controlled environments and visitations are mostly not allowed in most places. So once you are admitted, you stay in. I would say don't worry about the mask aspect so much, I have seen the protocols in at least three big psych hospitals and masks, once admitted are flex or not required at all. No one wants you to suffer because of a mask, there are bigger problems to address in an inpatient facility. You can ask the particular facility and they will answer your questions about it. Don't keep guessing and freaking out.  


Regarding what they do, residential inpatient is primarily a safe space geared for safety first and foremost. So it is intended for the patient to stay and feel safe and the environment provides for detachment from your regular environment by keeping you in the residential treatment center away from normal distractions. While at the same time, if you need medication titration, a team of doctor and therapist + social worker keeps tabs on your very regularly and can investigate/prescribe medication. Since someone is looking at you every day, medication management sometimes appear faster and better, especially if you havent been on any before. So what a typical good facility will do is to have a) activities for most of the day to fill up your time b) have you attend group therapy / life skills lessons regulary c) keep you out of reach of phone, internet and the usual people. Typical stay is anywhere from 1 - 6 weeks depending on your needs. Stays top out at 6 weeks because most insurance providers don't want you to keep there due to costs and from a safety perspective, you can reach a safe state of mind to handle your suicidal thougths.  


Now if you read too much on the internet, you will find that  people have varying experiences and some horror stories about in patient care. Some tips I would give you is ask someone or do some research on which hospital you are aiming to go, prefer a hospital ( if possible) who either does not do an intake via its Psych ER ( ERs can be unsettling and may take upto 24 hours to admit you) or whose ER is not so busy.  


An example of an inpatient facility is Four Winds in NY State. You can look at their daily timetable brochure. [https://www.fourwindshospital.com/about\_four\_winds/westchester/unit\_schedules\_and\_treatment\_team\_sheets.html](https://www.fourwindshospital.com/about_four_winds/westchester/unit_schedules_and_treatment_team_sheets.html)

Check out the Adult inpatient Woodview schedule. That is typical of an inpatient facility.

1,Hey i wasn’t in partial but I was in intensive outpatient which is like the shorter version of partial so this still applies a bit I think. The first thing was our program was almost entirely based on group therapies with one individual time every 4 days or so. The group therapies that I had were two therapies based around coping skills and one open talk where you can say anything. I would say that it’s very helpful but it is time consuming. My program lasted from about 8am-2:30pm so it is a lot of time spent. If you do PHP it’s five days a week while IOP is three days. You meet with a psychiatrist to talk about meds and will have check ups also once a week to talk about them. You’ll have techs? Therapists? Ask you how you’re doing at the beginning of the day and see if you’re alright. Generally I think it’s a good idea especially if you don’t think regular outpatient is good enough. However mine wasn’t that long and I got kicked out because I couldn’t sleep at night. You’re not supposed to miss or you will get kicked out.

I would definitely look into reporting them so a supervisor/medical board of some sort. You are validated in how you are feeling and again, I am so sorry that you had to deal with such a calloused nurse. 

As for how to deal with dysmorphia, yes there is hope. I’ve dealt with body dysmorphia for as long as I can remember. I’ve gotten better at it, though some days are harder than others. Here are some thoughts that have helped me get through my darker days and helped shift my perception of beauty:

1) Beauty truly is in the eyes of the beholder. I can still recall when one time, I was talking to a guy friend of mine and happened to come across a photo of a model who I though was absolutely gorgeous. I remember turning to him and saying “wow if I looked like her, I would be the happiest person alive.” And he responded with, “really? She’s not even that pretty.” I’ve more or less been in similar situations like this where I thought a person/celebrity was absolutely stunning, just for another person to think they were average at best. This just goes to prove that everyone’s version of “pretty” is not uniform and varies from person to person. Even if I were to meet the conventional norms of being “attractive,” there would still be that one person who would say otherwise. 

2) Your perception of beauty is linked to your mental well being. I remember even at my skinniest thinking I was fat. And no matter what I did to change my face (micro blading, botox, lip injections, etc), I still found something to be unhappy about look-wise. Overtime I realized I wasn’t doing this to fix my outer appearance, but to fix how I was feeling inside. And over the years, the more I invested in my mental health, the more I became aware of this connection (e.g., being bullied as a child, abandonment issues, never having the conventional features I thought were needed to be pretty, etc.). As I’ve become aware, I’ve worked on activities that help me address these inner demons and cut out the toxic influences in my life (family being a big one). Though I still focus on my looks, I don’t obsess with it nearly as much as I did before. 

3) Beauty is not everything. Im sure you’ve heard this before, and admittedly it gets tiring hearing this time and time again. But let’s just say you’ve achieved peak attractiveness…now what? There is so much more to life than obsessing over your looks. There are so many places to explore, skills to learn, hobbies to enjoy. Why waste all of that just to be considered visually appealing to people who don’t even matter? Plus, looks aren’t everything. I can’t begin to tell you how many times I’ve gone on dates with men who were easily a 10/10, but the moment they opened their mouths and showed their true character, their attractiveness quickly deteriorated. 

4) I look like my family. I’ve always been self conscious of my nose- it’s bigger than I would like and has a bump at the top. But then I remember I have my grandpa’s nose. And I remember always thinking how handsome of a man my grandpa was, from when I looked at his pictures as a young man to his last day on earth. The same nose I thought made him look so well-defined and statuesque, was the same nose I came to hate on myself. And I know how much it would have broken his heart if he knew that. The older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve come to love these characteristics because they represent all of the people that I love and who played a role in making me. 

5) Beauty is transient. What is considered “beautiful today” will change in the next decade. One day your body type is in, the next day it’s considered too skinny, then the next day you’re considered too fat. Not only is it nearly impossible to keep up with these trends, but they were literally created by the beauty industry to make women feel self conscious and to spend more money on different products. 

I know it’s not easy dealing with these thoughts. And at times they become so consuming and can really interfere in your life. I think my biggest takeaway in dealing with body dysmorphia is that it’s all in my head. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve come across old photos of me and thinking to myself “why did I feel so ugly?” Or “why was I so hard on myself? I look so cute here!” There have also been times where I’ll point out an imperfection to someone just for them to respond with “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” The things we notice in ourselves are barely noticed by others.

You sound like an amazing person and I promise that whatever you’re self conscious about is either not noticed by others and are what make you beautiful! Take it day by day. Find a therapist that can help you work out these feelings. Pick up a new hobby. Participate in activities that help you enjoy life more. Make sure you have a solid support system around you and remove negativity from your life. Some days will be harder than others. But just know that you will come out on top, and that this internet stranger is cheering you on :)",melisssasup,17dqqlu
15,"Wtf that's absolutely inappropriate.  I understand that certain treatments might be more complex and hard for patients to understand, but I see absolutely nothing good coming from this.  Maybe if the anonymous staffers were people that your therapist secretly knew would gas you up and make you feel better and use those results for talking points at future sessions.  But not THAT.

17,"I've been in various therapy groups, and with multiple different therapists over the last 10 years. I can only assume why they may have done the questionnaire. 

Maybe the thought of intentions were meant to be good,but it's also about knowing your client.
Not to take away from you, but with me for example.

I'm a guy, I have binge eating disorder, and because of excess fat now high estrogen.

The eating disorder clinic says no intermittent fasting, diets don't work, and things like that 

My family doctor was like yeah just intermittent fast, and lose weight. Where a quick look into my health charts would show in not the person Todo that too.

When I was physically able to I was muscular and skinny. I always thought I was fat..I. That aspect I can sympathies.

But I'd say what they did for you wasn't correct, they could ha e changed their treatment plans, and accommodated you better.

There definitely is therapy options that can work,but it's specific to the person. You've said you've done them for a while now.

There are plastic surgery options that could help, but there's risks as well, and you may not like the end product either.(or you may love it). And it's expensive.

You mentioned anorexia and self harm, I'm speaking out of my lane, but continuing therapy I think would be beneficial, you just need the proper support system. Some people react well to what they did, some don't, you didn't and told them you wouldn't. 

The fact that some people rated you a 10 though is significant. It's not like it was all 4s or something like that. So maybe more people find you attractive then you think? Though I definitely understand if you don't think you are then that doesn't matter. 

Physical Appearances are always changing, getting in the right headspace is important.

22,"While I agree with the comments regarding that mental health facility, that's not what I'm going to talk about. Firstly, beauty is very subjective. I've seen people who will rate absolute 10's in my eyes as 2's. You just need to learn what works for you, and learn how to take care of yourself. 

We learn about our skin type before finding the right serum, the right moisturizer, the right scrub, face wash. We absolutely need to do the same for our bodies. Find out your body type, don't go on Pinterest or Instagram, look at the people around you. Be realistic, be firm with yourself. Do not go online. 

I can guarantee you, you're way more beautiful than you think you are. As for the body dysmorphia, you need supportive friends to guide you and be honest with you.

You get guided around the ward with a nurse to everywhere you go, I got gym time, they had a food hall, movies at night, they had art time, card games like uno and poker, we also had two/three groups a day with individual sessions with a psychiatrist weekly to see what medicines would help. We also had roommates and the genders were in the same section, but everything was separated, some of the people I was there with weren’t the greatest, but I did met some great people there and overall I enjoyed my stay as much as you can when you’re depressed. If you are worried about the patients it’s not how the movies portray it, most of the people I was with were depressed and didn’t know how to cope or anyone they could express how they feel to, but they all understood we wanted to get better and in turn we helped each other.",Medium_Ad6973,1bi9rhq
1,"It highly depends on where you are located. The typical experience for me was, I went to the ER and waited hours to be seen. They put you in a psych room where you can’t have your phone and it doesn’t have a TV so you’re just kinda sitting there staring at a wall unless somebody is there with you. There is supposed to be a nurse placed right outside your door to keep watch over you but this isn’t always the case in my experience. They put you in scrubs and lock away all your belongings. A nurse asks you if you’re experiencing SI/HI or having psychotic symptoms. They will send that off to the psychiatrist. They may also run tests (they have run blood tests, urine tests and performed an EKG on me). The psychiatrist will come see you, it could be hours and will ask you similar questions to what the nurse asked. They will determine if you are committed. The decision is based on whether or not you’re a danger to yourself or others. If you are committed, they will have security escort you to the psych ward, they will do a strip search. It can be a bit invasive. Nurses will ask you why you were brought in, they will ask you questions to make sure you’re not out of reality. Simple questions like, what’s your name, what’s the date or what year is it, who is the current president, write a whole sentence. Simple things like that. They will most likely draw more blood from you. You are then shown to your room and given your belongings that are safe to have in the psych unit. Rooms are plain. Either one or two beds. Unfortunately they are not comfortable. Mattresses are not very hard and are so soft they provide no support at all. There will be a desk just for you. Then a bathroom with a walk in shower. 

I’ve been to 6 different hospitals and all allowed:

Your own pack of crayons (brand new, never opened)
Coloring books
Books (only paperback)
Activity books (crosswords,word searches, Sudoku,etc.)
Toiletries and personal hygiene(all brand new,never opened); they will provide you with a toothbrush, comb, deodorant, shampoo,body wash and lotion if you can’t bring your own

As far as clothes go, they cannot have wires,zippers or strings. I suggest bringing a cozy pair of house slippers. It might get cold in there as it is a hospital so maybe bring some sweaters, tights, or some comfy pajamas. They will provide you with socks. 

As far as what it’s like in the ward, if it’s at all like the ones I was on, you shouldnt have to worry about patients being too loud or dangerous as the people who are like that are usually on a separate ward than the people who are just there for suicidal ideation. But this depends on the hospital. Unfortunately it’s very boring. The days run pretty slow and are on a strict schedule. I don’t know how old you are, but in the adult ward, they wake you at 5 to offer coffee. If you want,  you can keep sleeping till 6. At 6, they will get your vital signs and give you your hygiene box. You can shower or just freshen up. Then you can go back to sleep or go to the “day room” where they will be playing the TV (usually plays the news in the morning). Then breakfast and then meds. Then a couple hours after breakfast, groups begin. Again, it depends on the hospital you’re in but they will have different therapies like occupational therapy, or art therapy, recreational therapy. During recreational therapy they let us go outside (there is usually an outdoor space dedicated to psych patients). The therapist would let us throw frisbee or play cornhole. He’d let us listen to music. Sometimes he’d bring popsicles or candy.  Then lunch. Then maybe another group but usually you’d just hang out in the dayroom (watching TV, coloring, word searches,playing Uno). Then snack. Then more dayroom activities. That’s usually when I’d take a nap. Then dinner. Then they give you your hygiene box again so you can shower, brush your teeth, change clothes. Night meds. Dayroom activities. Snack. Dayroom activities. Then bed around 10pm. As far as seeing the psychiatrist, the psychiatrist runs on nobodies time but their own. They might come in at 5 in the morning, or they might not come in till 5 pm. You will never know. The nurses will never know. You should see the psychiatrist everyday regardless of the time though. 

Strict phone times. There will be at most, 2 phones on the wall that has to be shared between all patients. Calls are limited to 10 minutes each. The call times are typically around lunch and then shortly after dinner. 


Food is as you can expect. Hospital food. You don’t really get to choose what you eat (however, one hospital I did go to actually had a menu we could choose from and the selections were pretty good). 

They will most likely keep you for at least three days. Don’t expect to leave before then if you get there and decide you don’t want to be there. If you do get there and decide you don’t actually need to be there, the quickest way to get out? Participate. Do not stay in your room all day. Talk to people. Do the activities during therapy. 

There SHOULD be a social worker on site that will help you get set up with outpatient care and anything else you might need (rehab if you have drug problems, state assistance if you’re homeless or have little food,etc.). 

Like I said, not all hospitals are the same. One hospital I went to had a school, library, gym, video games, board games, a music room, pet therapy, music therapy. It was nice. My suggestion is, look up the best hospitals in your area. Check ratings. Look at the reviews.",Mandarin_Lumpy_Nutz,1bi9rhq
2,"Spent 2 weeks in a facility last year. I'm very introverted, so I understand your feelings about alone time.  Unfortunately the facility I was at checked up on us every 15 minutes. Had to learn to sleep with earplugs due to other patients screaming. Checked to see if I ate and how much. No stings in clothes at all. No pens or pencils only crayons. And I could keep going.  However... if not for that place I wouldn't be here now. I learned a lot of new coping skills. Place seriously helped me. I met people that I will always be grateful too for sharing their experiences. And yes realize that there are still others worse off than me.

If you're questioning the need, then you already know the answer.  It takes strength to admit you need the help.  Give yourself some grace and get the help you deserve.  Might not be pleasant but it could make all the difference in the world.",GoBlue2240,1bi9rhq

0,"Hey there friend,
First of all I think it's a damn shame it's been 2 weeks and not 1 reply. I don't look at this sub much - except when I need help myself(!!). Anyhow, I know you're prob in the hospital by now given the time frame you posted, but I'd just like to encourage you. I just did 11 days in a hospital where I live. They are prob all different but it wasn't what I expected. It wasn't bad at all and I was very nervous and self-admitted just like you. I ate way better while I was in the hospital. It was kind of just me and the other people hanging out trying to pass the day, with a short visit with psychiatrist every morning and one with social worker every other day. There were some younger social workers who would start up a group game or some kind of activity a couple times a day. So if it's not impossible, I want to especially encourage you to try to be as social as you can, you sound like a good person, be social with the other patients, who are prob a lot like you and suffering themselves. You already have things in common. And there is strength in numbers as we like to say in the USA (not sure if that is a worldwide cliche). The camaraderie I had with the other patients made the whole thing SO much better.

I wasn't going to write this when I figured you were inside already and wouldn't see it, because we weren't allowed to have phones or any electronics or much of anything, but if you are allowed to come and go as you please I imagine you have access to your phone. So, I hope everything is going ok with your treatment. Listen, I want you to know that I am thinking of you, and hoping for the best for you.",thekrautdog,1afnqv5
1,"Hey my dude and thanks for the reply. I’m almost two weeks in to my stay now, one week to go! It’s actually gone by much faster than I expected. Here in Norway, you sleep at the facility when you’re admitted, so that’s a bit of a change but I’ve gotten a lot more used to it now. We don’t really have restrictions on devices or social media, but there’s been a lot of activities so I haven’t really had much time to be online lol. My sleep schedule is pretty much fixed now, I wake up super early, but I feel very well rested so that’s a win. The people that work here are very nice, and they go to great lengths to make sure we feel safe and comfortable. Im in what’s called an open section, which means that I can go out and come back as much as I want. Mainly because the people that are here are not a danger to themselves or anyone else, but there is other sections where they are very isolated. Im happy to still have my freedom when I’m here, makes me feel much safer. Im actually grabbing a cup of coffee with my family later today, so I’m looking forward to that :) overall, it’s been a nice stay, sucks that the days have gone by so fast as there’s a lot I still want to talk to them about, but I’ll make the last week count!",Human-Sheepherder620,1afnqv5

The staff were overworked, but some of them were really nice and helpful.",GhostC10_Deleted,192kyui
3,"Sure thing, if you want to know any specifics lmk but otherwise...
With my legal sex not being updated I had one staff misgender me. Two outed me, so I ended up just talking about it amongst the people that were in the same unit as me during a group therapy session and nipping it in the bud. I told the group, ""If we get scientifical about it, there are females and males but people forget that intersex people are born and we see other species transition. Additionally people who are trans, typically their brain aligns with the sex they are transitioning over to."" 
Other than that the mix group of people were dealing with addiction problems and/or mental health. So there were some people needing more attention than others and it seemed diffcult for the staff to balance that.
I wasn't allowed my phone in there, as said by one of the commenters they set phones out for us at set times. We also did not get to go outside but 15 minutes 4x a day. So that part sucked to me.",local_economies,192kyui

The staff were friendly, the therapist I had seemed to actually care, the doctors were involved in our health and listened to us and our concerns. There's restrictions. For the one I went to, we weren't allowed our phones, we had fixed bed, wake, meal and shower times, as well as group activity times. Our clothes were restricted to blue scrubs or clothing brought by family/friends with no strings/zippers/metal. Most of our days were spent out in the sitting and eating area doing our individual activities, group activities or group therapy. We also had shared rooms, 2 per room, and the place was divided by patient gender.

It was really daunting for me at first in there because I really did not want to be there and they asked me a lot of questions when I came in, but it was by all means a not bad experience and I feel lucky for that.

1) General data protection policy’s
2) Privacy for others
3) This is a place of recovery, and often enough having a phone and engaging in social media is a distraction or can render recovery.

Ask about the staff and patient size, frequency of 1:1 therapy, psychiatric access, insurance coverage (who they work with and how many days are covered), and other kinds of outpatient services (family therapy, full day/half day, referrals, other kinds of support after). 

Group therapy can be very cathartic, but quiet folks can get lost in the shuffle in a large group. Sharing can be hard when you are anxious or embarrassed. Individual therapy and access to a licensed psychiatrist for med changes is critical.

I found that pre-journaling was really helpful. We usually started with a check in that was always the same: how depressed are you (0-10), how anxious are you (0-10), goal for the day, do you need meds. I’d write down my answers before the sessions officially started so I wasn’t nervous about my answer when it came time to say something. If I ever got stuck, I’d go back to my treatment plan and pick a goal from the list of things to work on. 

When you write the list of questions for you phone calls, leave a lot of space for their answer on the piece of paper, so you know you have space and time to write. I try and take my time with notes. People are usually patient if you say “thank you, give me a moment to write that down fully so I don’t have to remember it later.” Depression has turned my short term memory to absolute poop, so I can’t hold more than 2-3 things in active memory at a time. If I don’t write it down, it straight didn’t happen. 

Most importantly, it’s ok it the program you pick doesn’t turn out to be the right one. 

I’m sure I’ll think of something else... comment or pm me if you have other questions. :)",theURGENTkettle,9ugmb3

0,"Hi. It all depends on the type of hospital and program you’re going into. How long is the hospitalization? 

Most likely you won’t have access to electronics/technology other than the occasional phone call to family or close friends. That’s because they want to give you the time to allow your body to adjust to medication and introduce therapy (it’s different for everyone) without external stressors of school/work/personal life. 

That’s not to deter you from school or from pursuing help. The hospital probably deals with people in your situation all the time and will communicate w your school so you won’t be penalized. 

Try to keep an open mind and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Speak up and be honest when something is not okay. You’ll come out on the other side better for it.",failedantidepressant,g9g3jj

2,"Yes it’s possible but it’s unlikely to succeed, you should honestly talk with the staff if your having fears that she may actually go through with that.",,t17vbq
3,"I have worked in psychiatric facilities. Two state hospitals to be exact. If your girlfriend shows signs of self harm, wanting to self harm, trying to find things that can cause her self harm, etc. The staff would then place her on a range of different checks depending on what the nurse/doctor think is appropriate. Those could range from 10 minute, 15 minute, 20 minute, and 30 minute checks. All facilities will have a check system in place which will be charted every so often within each hour as well. Anyways, she could be placed on 1-1 staffing which means your girlfriend would be under 24 hour observation with staff face to face. Can she do it? Unfortunately, anyone with that much of a will can always find creative ways to get what they desire, but the likelihood of her completing the attempt if she tried is unlikely. There are many precautions that can be put in place to help prevent this behavior. I’m unsure of what type of facility your girlfriend is in so some of these things may vary, but the idea should most definitely remain the same across the board.",Rodster0414,t17vbq
4,"I don't want to cause you additional anxiety in an already stressful situation but I disagree with the people saying it can't or won't happen. A few comments were better at explaining that it is unlikely and they backed that up with the reasons why but there are multiple factors that could increase or decrease the risk. 

I have worked at 3 different psychiatric facilities, one as a nurse technician, one as a nurse, and one as a social worker (I switched careers). I also struggled with my own mental health in my 20s and have been a patient at 5 different places. So I would like to think I have some experience to back up what I'm saying.

The most important factor is how well the facility is run, e.g. what policies are in place, how well staffed it is, how well trained that staff is. Another big one is the staff themselves, whether they take their job seriously, aren't too burnt out to notice/care about certain things or cut corners.

As a previous commenter mentioned they typically have checks where the staff person is supposed to physically see where the patient is and what they are doing usually every 15 minutes for new patients (at least where I have worked). However, I knew of a couple technicians who would not do this exactly how it's supposed to be done. Some were lazy, others were floater staff who never worked in psych. While working as nurse we had a patient try to hang himself and the staff didn't find him right away because the checks weren't being done right. He survived but he did have some health/medical issues after.

Most places search patients and take away anything that they can use to hurt themselves. But as a former patient myself, I can tell you we can be creative, especially if you know how the system works. It really depends on how diligent the staff are vs. how motivated the patient is. I once managed to sneak in enough medication to OD on a psych floor. Luckily, they were doing their checks properly and I was found quickly. It's also a plus if the facility is in a hospital because then the medical help is already there and available. 

It's unlikely that your girlfriend would be able to accomplish harming herself to such a degree but it's not impossible. As others have stated the best thing you can do is be supportive and let her know you love and care for her. Also if she is able to talk to you to tell you these feelings she should be able to tell you what facility she is at. If she does you can then call them and make the staff aware of how she's feeling because it's in her best interest for them to know. That way they can keep a close eye on her, maybe offer to sit and talk with her. I know from experience that she may not see this as the best thing right now, and she may hate it there but if she's getting the help she needs then it's all worth it. Hopefully she will live a long enough life to realize that later, like I did. I wish you and her the best of luck.",PrincessDe,t17vbq
5,"Highly unlikely. They didn’t even let me have pencils with the metal back on them or notebooks with metal coils, let alone anything sharp like a blade. Chances are where she is there are cameras everywhere aside from the bathroom so even if she were to start hurting herself they’d see and stop it pretty quick",NothingButUnsavoury,t17vbq
6,"It’s highly unlikely. When you’re admitted to the hospital, they usually search you for “contraband” that can be used for self harm and remove it. The staff also interviews you to assess your suicide risk, there are groups you’re encouraged to attend throughout the day to address your mental health, and medication meant to help reduce symptoms. Her loved ones can also speak to staff to say they’re concerned and someone will do an assessment, if appropriate, they will assign a staff member to be with her at all times until she is deemed safe. There are also staff who check in on you every 30 minutes while you’re sleeping.

7,"Hi, mental health worker here. 

I’m one of the nursing staff you see on an acute psychiatric unit.
We have different levels of observation for individuals expressing suicidal ideation with intent. 

If you are concerned I would suggest calling the unit and expressing this to the charge nurse / treatment team as they may be able to implement a 1:1, which basically means that a staff member will be sitting with her at all times for safety purposes.

There are many, many things that prevent suicide in a hospital, down to safety pens and ligature safe surfaces, but at the end of the day it’s important to keep staff in the loop.
People can get creative when they’re in distress.

2,"You should have mentioned your diagnosis, medications, and safety concerns. It would give people here (me), a better idea what are the specific risks to your safety or the safety of others. Be honest with yourself and us. It's anonymous. 

🚧🚧🚧🚧
IMPORTANT NOTE
Please understand that I am not a healthcare professional and this is just my opinion. Other people will have opposing opinions. Even licensed professionals. I have found they SOMETIMES give outdated or just plain wrong advice. They may have a legal, or political bias on that advice. Your job is to take those opinions and make your best decision. It's the best you can do. Many people don't understand that and get confused—""Who do I belive?"" I understand, It's hard.
🚧🚧🚧🚧

Without all that information I will give you my best opinion as to what I would be concerned with. I realize you asked only about being fired. But, that seems shortsighted. If you don't know the answer to that, you don't know what the very long-term harm of being institutionalized can be.

📌  Know your safety and the safety of others directly around you most important. It's #1. If everything else tells you to not be put into an institution but the probability is high that you will hurt someone or hurt yourself, then nothing else matters. You go into the hospital.

With that said, have you ever tried to commit suicide or attempted or successfully committed homicide, rape, violent assault, robbery, or some other violent crime? If a yes, you go into the hospital. If you have to think too hard or are nit-picking about the specifics of the above, go to the hospital.

I would be concerned about them telling you if they say it's a rest for 1 or 2 weeks.... ""or longer."" Know that they are under no legal obligation to tell you the truth.

Are you taking prescription medications and you are having negative unexpected side effects? Is anyone getting hyper-dramatic in trying to convince you? Who would benefit from you not being treated at home?

Who is paying for your two-week (or longer) rest?
You need to know that there is a whole nationwide established system in place to provide inpatient mental health care. You and your family are giving up your freedoms and civil rights by voluntarily or mandated admission to a mental hospital. Realize It might have a sweet nice name. It could be called ""other affiliated care facility at their discretion."" 

As a part of the nationwide system. Individuals, organizations, LLCs, primary care providers, mental health care providers, Corporations, and others. Are paid commissions or finders fees, and kickbacks, for your body to be sent to their facility.
It almost sounds like human trafficking.

Yes, I'm being extreme. That doesn't mean it's not happening. It's happening and people are being investigated for this right now. 

Ask the question. Why do I need to be in a facility? Why can't I do this at home? You will be forever on a list of people who have received inpatient mental health care. Certain forms and applications ask that question. So, think about that.

Please take care of yourself. I hope you get the right type of care you need and feel better soon.",Dizzy-Job-2322,1afgl10
3,"Thanks, I’ll be honest that doesn’t make me wanna go. I’m diagnosed with depression, have a history of suicidal ideation, and take Wellbutrin daily. I see a therapist weekly. Based on some things I’ve said, and some behaviors I’ve exhibited, she and some loved ones have suggested I go because they’re concerned I might harm myself. I don’t want to go cuz I think it’s pointless.",freetotebag,1afgl10
4,"Again, just my opinion. I think people should not be forced or coerced into an inpatient mental health facility. It has long-term social implications. 

You could be put on a list agencies reference and it could trigger a certain response. It could have unintended consequences 20 years or more from now. If you own firearms they could be taken away from you. It could prevent you from passing a background check if you wanted to purchase a firearm. A simple example is you want to buy a rifle to take up hunting. It's a standard question on a background check. If you lie, in some circumstances it can be a felony.

None of this might concern you that much now. But, people's opinions and interests change over time. Being in an institution could easily take away your rights. Also, I would not tell anyone about any mental health problems you have unless you have to. There is this public trend that your life should be transparent. ""It makes a more authentic person."" They say you should share with fellow employees how much you're paid. ""That way nobody is short-changed."" ""Reveil your medical records, don't be ashamed."" ""What are you hiding?"" Don't do it. There will be acceptance, and caring from people at first. But, that only lasts a short time. Then you will start feeling the discrimination. You will see how ignorant the masses are about mental health. You will be looked down upon. If you are pulled over by law enforcement—a traffic stop. They run your name and could be flagged. You could be treated differently.

If you tell people that you will hear the response: ""No you will not. There are laws against that."" Well, that's not stopping anyone from discriminating against you. Sure, you may have legal recourse. Get an attorney pay a huge retainer fee and three or five years later you may get a payout. If you can do that, that's great. If you run out of money, it sucks.

All those circumstances I honestly say ""might"" happen, ""you may"" be on a list. It might have to do with ""voluntary commitment"" or ""involuntarily."" Also, depending on your jurisdiction. State, or Local statutes. Why risk it if it's not necessary?

Any psychiatric medication can cause suicidal ideation. Just by the way, you said it lets me know this has been discussed with you. Whoever prescribed you the medication should have personally advised you of it. It's an issue of education. A teenager has suicidal ideation and lack of impulse control because his brain isn't fully developed until age 25. Experience is much more concerning. He thinks something different. As opposed to an adult who says:

""Oh, my doctor told me this might happen. It's no big deal. It's just an expected part of my treatment.""

But, doctors are not telling patients. No heads up that it might happen. I had it happen. I was aware it might happen, and while it was odd. It was not a big deal. This was many years ago. Nothing has changed. Mental health has not gotten more accepted. There are just more children and young adults being treated.

You say you have had other different behaviors that are worrying people. Medication can cause severe anxiety. Do you know what anxiety feels like? It can make you roll up in a ball in the corner of a room. It's a horrible feeling. But, it's a side effect of the antidepressant. You may have been suffering from anxiety. It comes with depression. The medication they are giving you may be making it worse. Have they tried different antidepressants? Different types work in different ways. I believe Wellbutrin increases dopamine. Others increase serotonin or norepinephrine. Those are all neurotransmitters.

Take time off from work if you need to. Use the Family Medical Leave Act. File a Disability Claim from your employer (if you work for a larger company), State,  and Federal (I think you have to wait a year).

You want to slow things down. Make a conscious effort to stay calm. If you are feeling off, get away from people. Find a quiet place in your home. If you're still working find a place that you can disappear to. Don't lock yourself in the bathroom. People will start to talk. But, just a place to get away from the chaotic world. Mental health people call it a ""safe place."" I prefer to call it a ""sanctuary."" I wouldn't tell anyone. Nobody gets it. But, you want to sit with dim light and breathe deeply. Inhale slowly and fill your abdomen starting at the base and up to your mouth. It will take practice. Breathe through your nose. Then exhale the same way. Slowly, concentrate almost like it's an exercise. Concentrate on the form. This will increase your oxygen level.

Understand how I think. I like to. prepare for the worst. So, if the worst happens I already know what I have to do. The thinking has already been done. So, I'm not trying to distress you. Just making you aware. 

In some locations, it only takes two doctors and a judge to take you involuntarily. That's not good. I get the feeling you are still working. If you can get up in the morning and get yourself to work, you are not that bad.

I think you should get some legal advice. I know you probably are thinking about the money. You may not be able to afford it. But, you may have to afford it. If your family pushes it. You could be fighting an uphill battle.

Spouses, children, parents, and extended families may all be very well intended. 

They may be just unaware.

They may have a private agenda.

That may hurt to hear it. But, you would not be the first one to be blindsided. If you have been working hard doing the right thing for your family. You could be totally unaware.

I just wrote this off the top of my head. I may have jumped around in topics. I hope this helps.

But, you should not go casually to a mental hospital just for a rest. I have heavy corporate sales, corporate management, and small business owner experience. Convincing you by saying you need a two-week rest sounds like a sales hustle. My internal scam sensors are just giving me all kinds of red flags.

Quietly get some legal advice. Get a head of this. Be proactive.

Let me know if you need anything. I will watch out for any messages. Maybe switch to a DM if it's easy for you. 

Take care

0,Regular psych units are run by the hospital they are in. They’re typically meant to be short term(3-10 days). They are meant to stabilize acute crisis situations. They can have both voluntary and involuntary patients. State hospitals are run by the state. Patients at state hospitals are typically there on commitment(involuntary) for longer amounts of time. Regular units often don’t have the necessary resources to safely care for the patients at state hospitals as their mental illnesses and symptoms are too severe/complex. State hospitals also often have forensic psych units for mentally ill patients that have committed crimes or are considered to be dangerous.,funkysister19,179nwgx

Keep clothing items with strings at home, or if you want that pair of sweatpants or hoodie, just take the string out. If you're female, leave your makeup and hair tools at home. Just bring basic toiletries like toothbrush, toothpaste, hair brush, etc. Razors don't bother bringing. Anything that is sharp, keep at home. The nurses on the unit will go through your things as standard procedure to make sure no contraband is brought on the unit or that you would have something that could injure you or others. Anything they keep, usually is locked up during your stay and given back to you at discharge. You can wear long sleeve shirts and such to cover any marks you might not want seen. Basically, it's just chillin like you would at home but on a hospital unit. So dress accordingly! It's nothing drastically outside of the ordinary. 

Also be prepared to not have access to your cell phone. This is usually due to HIPPA laws and keeping the confidentiality and privacy of treatment compliant with HIPPA laws. Grab the phone numbers you'd like so you can call the people you'd like while you're there. But you'll most likely not have access to internet, social media or the outside world online.

I can't imagine having no family and having a baby off meds and doing it alone, the only reason it wouldn't be voluntary is because the mental illness. As a mother with depression I really wish I had an option like that.",,f6o0hk

5,"I'm gonna be real with you: being put in a psych ward against my will at 16 was slightly traumatic. BUT it was because of my personal circumstances. I was there for one week and I live in Hungary so I have limited experience and knowledge about what you're might be getting into but here's what I know nonetheless. I hope it helps. 

First of all I was already going to therapy and had a developing support system that I was taken out of. You on the other hand don't seem to have a stable support system at all and would probably benefit from the attention of professionals and people with similar issues (aka you could even make some friends although in my experience it is a hit or miss. But you will definitely benefit from hearing similar stories from people in similar but just different enough situations, trust me). ***If you feel like you need help you're probably right.*** Getting away from your parents, whatever the exact situation might be would also seem like a good idea based on what you wrote. ***In sum I definitely recommend talking to a therapist and it might even be beneficial for you to go to hospital*** although that depends on the hospital itself. Also you should definitely ask your therapist about being hospitalised, especially if you're afraid to be open because of the uncertainties surrounding it. They will have better answers suited for you than any of us here on reddit. 

I'm not sure about your local place's rules but in my experience and what I heard in other places as well they take your phone away. We had one hour daily to use our phones, which overlapped with the one hour that visitors were allowed so I practically couldn't use it at all because parents always bugged me to pay attention to them lol. Entertainment wise they provided a lot of things, from art supplies through TV to guided activities and even played with us if none of the other patients were willing so I didn't miss social media but I did miss being able to communicate with my friends.

If you get put in a hospital ***your legal guardian will know about it.*** I'm not sure if you can prevent them from visiting you as I never had an issue like that but you should talk about a doctor with it. I'm sure you're not the first one who would have an issue like that (if you even want to prevent them. That's just the vibe I got from your post). ***They will also most likely see the reports that the doctors write about you***, which can be very scary, I know. In my experience it doesn't contain very specific things, just general statements. For me these reports (or at least the parts in laymans terms) were 3-4 short paragraphs long where at least one would be taken up by my background (how old I was, what my hobbies were, where I went to school, etc). This was in every report, I assume, for the purpose of informing any other doctor or therapist that might take my case about the basic info needed about me. A report like this was produced after every one-on-one talk, sometimes including psychological tests. The 2nd-3rd paragraphs were taken up by the contents of these talks and tests, again, general tastements, almost bulletpoints about the most important things. The last paragraph would talk about diagnoses, suspected and outruled problems. ***So don't be scared because of this. Having your parents know about stuff is a necessary sacrifice for the betterment of yourself.*** This is also something I had to come to terms with and was very uncomfortable at first. But you have to understand that this is a ""necessary evil"" for things to get better.

***GOING TO HOSPITAL  WILL NOT RUIN YOUR LIFE*** */in most cases
Unless you get sent to a *very* bad mental hospital that worsens your condition, you will not really lose from this. For the duration of your stay there you will probably not go to school, unless they let you go online, however a lot of the time it's an important point to let people there take a rest from school or work. If that means missing an exam based on how severe your situation is they might just say that you'll have to take it next year. But trust me, they know what they're doing. If they say you need to miss the exam, you're probably better off missing that exam >!than killing yourself over it if you get what I'm saying!<

Record of you being there will of course be in your medical records and your GP will probably know about it. I think there are aa few diagnoses and medicines that would prevent you from driving a car for example or if you are very violent they might prevent you from becoming a teacher and prohibit you from getting a firearm. But these are ***extreme cases*** and >!unless you killed or raped someone!< getting a diagnoses will not have any serious negative effects. On the contrary it will greatly help you, your caregivers and your doctors in understanding your problem and its possible solutions so don't shy away from it. 

Also, I'm not a lawyer but to my knowledge you have zero obligation to disclose your medical history to your regular ol' job provider unless it's relevant to the actual work. If anything this will only help you with overcoming your issues and being more balanced in the future - aka having a better life. ***I can't stress this enough. If you feel like you need help, get help! It will most likely actually help!***

Throughout this comment I talked about ***inpatient treatment*** aka: you sleep there, eat there, shower there and can't leave unless they let you. Based on your specific circumstances you might be put in ***outpatient care.*** We had one outpatient girl who slept and showered at home. However from ~8-16 (I don't remember the exact time but for the majority of the day) she was mandated to be there in the hospital and follow the same rules as us aka: not leave without supervision unless allowed and follow the activities of the group. She ate with us, etc. but would go home at the end of the day. Whether you go inpatient or outpatient is based on some factors: First and foremost how much of a threat are you to yourself and/or others and how safe are you at home? If you are eligible for both inpatient and outpatient and the hospital has the capacity (aka: enough beds, food, caretakers, etc) they might let you choose what you prefer. After they let me out they said they'd welcome me if I wanted to continue this in outpatient care.

Last addendum: I saw a lot of people comment bad things about mental health care in the states. I have no experience with that and hearing about the absolute state of american health care saddens me greatly. I might be a bit too optimistic because I had - regardless of some traumas - actual positive experiences with therapists and the hospital I was in. But that's Hungary. Please, ***please*** ask a local professional - either a therapist or your GP - about your situation before getting into all of this! I'm not even sure if you're in the states - regardless, ***ask someone local about this who know their stuff!!! ***

I hope at least you get some idea about mental hospitals from this! And I really wish for your situation to get better <3 if you have any questions you can also just message me if you'd like, I'll answer everything I can(although I might not be the most experienced) I remember how scary it was not knowing anything that went on.",evet_stu,zt5phv

7,"I worked in intake in a mental health hospital for over a year. They'll only admit if you literally cannot be safe in the community. This includes suicidal thoughts with plan (method, access and time frame), psychotic to the point of being so out of touch with reality your mental status exam shows you aren't oriented to person, place, time (we use to say if we couldn't trust someone to walk across a street safely they should be admitted), and homicidal ideation (similar to SI but at least in my state you'd have to also disclose exactly who you would try to kill). As a therapist at that point we would be legally obligated to report, but we can only say the absolute bare minimum.

A big part for kids is if they can't contract for safety, participate in a safety plan, or if their parents agree they cannot keep the child safe at home. My safety plans with very suicidal people and their parents are very strict so if they can't abide by that, I'd have to admit.",AmeslJ55,zt5phv
8,"Most people are not placed into an in patient program unless voluntary admittance is met (and there is extreme need) OR the patient is an immediate threat to themselves or others.

Juveniles tend to spend less time in mental facilities and records can be sealed unless placed their for certain crimes such as sexual assault (tried as an adult.)

If you're in a mental health facility, you will likely be restricted in accessing social media and phone usage.

While in an inpatient facility juveniles typically attend inpatient school or do study from home type work. Some facilities allow day passes to school or work.

Most patients benefit from treatment and go on to live normal and/or functional lives.

Realistically, it is extremely unlikely you would be committed to or need to voluntarily admit yourself to in patient treatment based on your age and the information given.

You would likely see a therapist for stress or anger management. If necessary a psychological and/or physical health evaluation may be done.

In some, you will be treated the same as people with severe issues like psychosis or suicidal ideation, and your autonomy may be taken away depending on what you say (for example, cell phone taken away once admitted due to inflexible policies). They can be short staffed, and if so, the care is more along the lines of preventing catastrophe vs quality care. I am speaking from a brief but unpleasant experience at a low quality hospital when I was in a similar situation - I had an argument with family that they interpreted as being manic, so I was admitted involuntarily without being able to explain my side of what happened. I would look into outpatient options first if possible, those seem more helpful from what I have read for functional people.

0,"I'd recommend bringing some items from home to make it feel less 'sanitary'. I usually brought a blanket that I liked, a stuffed animal (when going to adolescent units), some books that I loved reading.Maybe a book of Sudoku, crosswords, etc. 

Usually they have some cheap colouring books and pencils, and have tv/movie nights. I'd definitely bring headphones if you're allowed to have a device. Maybe earplugs for sleeping, the units are sometimes noisy at night. 

Pictures are nice, but make sure you pick ones that don't bring up bad memories/anxiety. If you struggle to think of any, you could do some paintings you like, cute animals, favourite movie characters, etc. 

Sometimes, you can bring activities you can do in common areas (under supervision, basically) if the activity has materials that can cause harm. Like knitting or something.  

I've heard of inmates stealing others' things, so maybe don't bring valuable things or super special things. (Like, I didn't bring my baby blanket, but another one that I liked , but it wasn't my favourite) 

Usually, your belongings will be searched, so keep that in mind while packing. Also usually people wear comfy clothes, you might be looked at weird if you wear fancy clothes, but if it brings you joy, why not yk.

0,"There is always that possibility when you voice suicidal ideation. However, it’s always better to get help. If you get placed on a mental health unit it’s not permanent and it certainly won’t last forever. 
When I was in high school I was placed in a psych unit but I told the doctor that this felt more harmful than helpful and frightened me. I asked to do intensive outpatient and he let me go home under my parents care the same day. 

I did intensive outpatient therapy and it was amazing. I had to take time off school but even my teachers were great. One came to my house to drop off all my packets from different teachers and helped me with studying. I didn’t expect the support I would receive. I’m 36 now with two amazing kids but in my teens I couldn’t picture my future. 

Even as an adult I have episodes. I had severe post partum but told my psychiatrist that I was scared to be honest and placed in a hospital. Her and I made a safety plan instead and I was able to be completely honest and get the help I needed. 

You’ve been through some serious trauma that most people can sympathize with but not empathize with. It seems like an intensive outpatient program might be helpful for you. Just take things minute by minute right now, remind yourself it’s just one minute and you can get through it. Lean on those you trust.

a family member got really honest with a doctor (he was 12) and because he had a plan and the materials to carry it out, they talked to his parents and heavily recommended staying in the hospital for a while. his experience was in the kids area rather than the teens area and he had a worse time because of it. the cutoff is usually age 13.

on the other hand, when i was freshly 19 i had to stay in the hospital because if i didn’t they would make me. i had actually attempted. it was a stable environment that gave me time to adjust to new meds.

everyone has different experiences. i struggled a lot with the medical portion — my nurses were really fucking rude. once i went to the mental health area, though, i was able to read and watch tv and just rest sometimes. it was nice to destress.

In order to get admitted to an inpatient unit, you have to go to an emergency room, say you need to go inpatient, you’ll be sectioned almost definitely (necessary part of the process) once they think you’re a danger to yourself or others, and then an ambulance will bring you to whichever inpatient mental hospital that has a bed available. Expect to be in the ER for half a day at least, from my experience at least in MA. It’s a long process

You can try to request a certain one when you’re there, but usually it’s whatever’s available. So, you just have to get to the ER. But you can’t drive. 

What you can do otherwise, is call a suicide hotline in WV. They’ll section you when they think you’re a danger to yourself or others and bring an ambulance to you that will take you to the ER. I did this accidentally once, it works.

I hope this helps, feel free to ask any more questions if you have any. Best of luck :)

Edit: before you do this, pack a bag of essentials. Nothing that you can hurt yourself with (they won’t let you bring it anyways), but like coloring books, books, stuffed animal, clothes/comfortable clothes, whatever and they usually let you in with it.

I would be so worried about that and I know how hard this addiction is.  At the hospitals I have been to, they would give you the patch if requested.  That will help with the cravings.   Can you or someone call and maybe find that out to ease your anxiety over it? If they allowed at least the patch (I know it's not the same and it still sucks) I'd say it would make me feel better.  Either way... from what you explained i really feel it's time to go get stabilized.  Hugs",Nadia_Cee,188rgrj
8,"It sounds like you're going through an incredibly tough time, and it's really important that you're considering seeking help. When you're feeling this overwhelmed, and it's affecting your daily life to this extent, reaching out to professionals can be a crucial step. It's understandable to worry about how you'll cope without your vape or the impact of hospitalization on your relationship, but your well-being must come first.

Remember, the hospital staff are there to support you and can help you through the withdrawal from vaping if that's part of your treatment. They're also trained to help you find strategies to manage without it.

If the cost of therapy is a barrier, you might look into community mental health services that offer support on a sliding scale or even for free. Many areas have hotlines or services that can guide you to affordable options.

Taking that step to go to the hospital can be scary, but it can also be the beginning of getting the support you need to start feeling better. You deserve that chance. Your health and peace of mind are invaluable, and getting help is a brave and important step towards recovery.",The_Mindful_Warrior,188rgrj

1,"Unfortunately, you did meet the threshold for, ""a threat to themselves or others.""  It does seem that there should be a more gentle solution for that.

Sadly, mental hospitals vary widely in quality.  My spouse describes the ones in our area like boring hotels with arts and crafts.  They operate like converter belts.  People come in, they get prescriptions, they stay for a few days or weeks until they look calm, and get booted out usually before the medicine has had a chance to work because they need the bed for someone sicker.

And because of medical privacy laws, they can't communicate with family and make medication and stay duration decisions completely in the dark.  In your case, it sounds like you just needed an emergency visit to a psychiatrist, which in our area happens at the ER, and then in a perfect world someone *should* have called your husband to ask if family members could stay with you for a few weeks.  

Regarding the other patients looked over-medicated, people who are deeply psychotic often need a heavy dose of medication to stop the psychosis.  After a few weeks or months, the dose usually can be significantly reduced.  

Also, some of the safest anti-psychotics are very sedating until the body becomes used to them.  If they don't know a person's medical history, they will try those medications first.",wordsaladcrutons,18lazly

0,"You sound a lot like myself. I admitted myself back in April, and it was a very positive experience (for the most part). There are some things you should be aware of to set your expectations going in though. This was my experience, and it will likely vary from facility to facility. 

1. **Beds are in very short supply**. I basically went into the ER, and told them what was going on. They put me in a special ER room had me change into a gown and removed all of my belongings. The room was completely bare, to prevent any form of self harm. A social worker came down and we just talked for about an hour. We decided that in patient was the best route and they began the search for a bed. There wasn't a single bed available in the state, so I just had to wait... and wait... and wait. It took three days for a bed to open up. I spent two days in that ER room, and the third day they put me in a hospital room. I had complete supervision in the hospital room (a nurse watching me 100% of the time). A bed finally opened up, and luckily it was in town (they were possibly going to have to transfer me up to 4 hours away). I took an ambulance ride to the ward in a different hospital.
2. **You don't get as much care as you'd think**. Once I was admitted I thought I'd receive a lot more one on one care. It was not that. Every morning I'd meet with doctors in the ward for about 20 minutes. We'd talk about how I'm feeling and what the plan of action was. They reviewed what I discussed with the social worker, and possibly my therapy history (I was in the same network as my therapist) and gave me a diagnosis (Borderline Personality Disorder and Psychotic Depression) . This was the first time I had ever received a formal diagnosis. The most important thing to understand is that when you are in a hospital, you are not going to leave with your issues resolved. Your treatment will not take place in the hospital (unless you are basically in a truly disabled state). Their goal is to stabilize you and initiate a treatment plan. The doctors recommended I enroll in a specific therapy program called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT for short).  They gave me a giant packet with a list of clinics and practices that offer DBT. I spent most of my stay calling these clinics and trying to line something up. Most of them had waiting lists that were months out. I was lucky enough to find one that was only about 3 weeks out.
3. **You get little to no privacy**. When you get admitted, they take all of your belongings. You are there to get better so you have to focus on that. No cell phone. No electronics. They do allow books, magazines, or newspapers though. The place I was in allowed us to freely roam the ward, but we could not leave or go outside. It was a pretty small ward (16 beds). When we were in our room a nurse would check on us every 15 minutes, including while we were sleeping. It was not easy to sleep when someone is opening your door constantly through the night.
4. **They do rush you out**. I spent 2 1/2 days there and was released. Again their goal is not to cure you. It is to stabilize and line up a treatment plan.

Overall it was a much needed and positive experience for me. I was stuck in an endless cycle of ineffective treatment and had lost hope. I feel like the care I did receive had a much better understanding of what I was going through, and lined me up with a much more effective treatment. I wish I had done it ages ago. Best of luck, and feel free to ask questions if you have them.",theumph,188vtow
1,"one therapist i had diagnosed me with bipolar ii sometime in 2021-2022 after no more than 2 conversations. she put me on lamotrigine, but never talked about it again. she eventually quit and they gave me a new therapist who’s only ever advice was to “practice gratitude”. this same org/company “diagnosed” me with adhd, but also just presc more pills and never talked about it. sometimes i wonder if that was a “formal” diagnosis or not. i’d say by other therapists, i’ve definitely been formally diagnosed with  major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety. i’ve also tried DBT before, as well as edmr, cbt, behavior activation therapy, and acceptance therapy.

you mention that these were first introduced to you during your stay and that it was helpful. i’m not sure of i would find the same helpfulness if i’ve been exposed to a diagnosis and specialized care before. not sure what my question is here, just i wonder what the difference in our care may be, if there is any.

it sounds like you live in a smaller state also? i’m assuming by the lack of beds. i’m in nyc, idk if more people would also mean a lack of beds, or more available. again, kinda just thinking out loud here.

i guess some questions i do have, were you actively seeing a therapist when you admitted yourself? and what was the actual admission process like? and if you don’t mind me asking, how were you feeling before you decided to seek inpatient care? what made you think “okay, now’s the time”?

Also, if the accident is not your fault, then I think the other persons insurance might help you with your medical expenses, once the insurance has finished duking it out. You can call your car insurance and ask about this. There might be some kind of payout there/help with medical treatments and costs. How this works will depend on what state you are in.

Get a lawyer. I wish I had done it sooner. Most will take their payment out of your settlement award at the end. 

If you had car insurance at the time, sometimes your own policy will have a provision for your injuries. My insurance said they could help me, but that I’d have to pay my deductible.

It sounds like you didn’t have medical insurance at the time. Depending on your income, look into Medicaid believe it can be retroactive…but don’t quote me on that.

I guess one day at a time! There's a concept I find helpful which is to divide worries into practical worries and hypothetical worries.

Worrying about what will happen if your insurance doesn't pay out is a hypothetical worry, and one you don't really have any control over anyway so the best way to deal with that is just to park it.

Worrying about what the rest of your life is going to be is also a very hypothetical worry! Sure you want to keep it in mind a little bit when you make decisions but for the most part you can leave dealing with the future to your future self.

Not having enough money to pay your bills may be a more practical worry - for practical worries you can brainstorm what you can do, e.g. review your budget; look for a better paid job; continue to house share etc.

Working at a hospital in the insurance department, I have never seen charges that high to a patient directly. And I’ve also never seen insurances actually have to pay that amount. 
Though the charges could still be more than you feel you can handle, most hospitals are willing to work with you.

No. It's just that hospitals are good for keeping people safe in an emergency but not the best therapy.  
  
  
If you can't see a therapist, self-help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self-help is a way to show you're serious that doesn't create friction in the family. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior.  
  
Self-help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self-help book explains what therapy for depression is like.  
  
With depression, there's what seems like a Catch 22. People say, ""I know there are things that will make me feel better - getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I'm depressed and I don't have the energy.”  
  
Here's the thing - very important. People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.  
  
We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks.  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you our of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey.  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes.  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise. As little as 20 min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve Ilardi, the therapist/researcher who headed the lifestyle-depression project at the Univ of Kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise.  
  
If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Ilardi's book (""splendid"").  
  
Of all the traditional mind-body practices (meditation, etc.), the one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is slow breathing. It’s used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and PTSD. It's safe and it doesn't take any training.  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.  
  
It has advice specifically for depressed students, such as StudentsAgainstDepression.org.

19,"I've been hospitalized 4-5 times (Baker-Acted once), and while the facilities and amenities varied, there was only one situation in which I should have been kept on longer before being returned to the community. However, i suspect that had to do with cost (I was essentially homeless, jobless, and broke at the time), and because I had friends willing to take me in after I left.

In all instances, I was able to be transparent about how difficult it was for me to care for myself. By that I mean it was visually obvious that I didn't have the energy or motivation to shower or groom myself, but at some point - with medication additions or changes and rest - I was able to. In theory, if there is a patient who is still struggling significantly after they are admitted, that's a sign that there need to be community supports in place to ensure their well-being. 

So while you may not have the resources or know where to turn for help, the hospital might know. If you are struggling to this extent and you have very little social support at home, I would strongly consider going. Maybe do some research on your state's mental health laws so you know what you are getting into - if everything is voluntary, and you feel as though you aren't getting the right treatment, you could just leave.

It is kinda like a bath for my brain and clears stuff so I can refocus.  

It is okay to miss goals, hopefully finding a therapist soon will work out- the hospital will find one but you may not be a good match- and they can help you set some sustainable goals that are within your grasp.  

I had to learn to set goals that were more attainable. Example: clean house as a goal wasn’t realistic.

0,"On the US, hospital admissions are generally for safety reasons. If you have serious thoughts about hurting yourself or others, you can go to any emergency room (preferably one at a hospital that has an inpatient psychiatric unit) and be evaluated.  The purpose would be to help you become more safe, then you're discharged  to outpatient care.  I've found it unfulfilling at best and scary at worst. It's a psychiatric bandaid to keep you safe before the real work begins.",nite_rider_69,177j9k9

2,"Every time that i’ve been admitted (I’m a minor so my parents take me), we go up to the check in desk at the er and tell them that i’m having suicidal thoughts or i’m afraid i’m going to hurt myself and i need help. they usually get us back to triage fairly quickly and we sit in a room until they move us back to the purple zone (in my hospital we have zones, the purple zone is for patients at risk of hurting themselves or in a mental health crisis) it takes a few hours but a social worker comes to see me, they talk to me and my parents, and they assess to see wether or not i need to be admitted inpatient. if they decide that i don’t need inpatient care, they refer us to outpatient treatment centers but that usually doesn’t help and i end up in a worse place than before. if you’re afraid to ask the people at the check in desk, find someone you’re really close with who can support you through the process. it really helps to have someone with you. sadly, i’m only 17 and i’ve been admitted 17+ (i stopped counting after 17) times to inpatient centers. the only way they will help is if you are invested in your treatment. if you’re there just to use it as an escape or something else (not invalidating your feelings, i promise) it’s not going to help unless you want the help. i really hope this gives you the information you need and i wish you good luck on your mental health journey because trust me, i’ve been there. it gets better c: <3

1,"When I was hospitalised I wasn't allowed my phone. All my valuables, money, etc were handed over to staff, sealed in a bag and a list was made detailing exactly what I'd handed over. I signed it and when released, the list was re-checked to ensure all my belongings were there. 

Where are you guys getting hospitalised where you're allowed phones? I wasn't even allowed a normal bra, got watched while showering and any toiletries like deodorant were kept locked away in a cupboard and I had to be supervised spraying it under my armpits.

The differences I read regarding hospitalisations on these threads are huge. My room was locked all day and I couldn't just go take a nap or lay down when I felt like it. Nothing personal at all was allowed and rooms would be searched every morning. 

While I'm genuinely pleased so many of you have had positive experiences in hospital, be mindful that for others, it's absolute hell.

2,"When I was hospitalized, the staff took $150 worth of hygiene products of mine. Said I couldn't use them even though a lot of it was medicated for psoriasis which I have really bad. Other patients were able to use their personal hygiene products. I refused to shower the entire time I was there. (One of the reasons being, the showers were disgusting and mold growing in the grout, and they did not provide shower sandals) Then upon being released, I had all of those items missing, my new expensive make-up as well that costs around $100 it's self. I swear the lady handing me my things (or what was left of it) smelt of my expensive conditioner and her eyeliner was on fleek. Call me crazy (they did) but they steal people's shit, if you have anything nice, don't bring it to the ward to you. Dress in rags, and let a trusted family member hang on to your phone. These people treat new intakes like new free items. When I tried to open a claim, you can guess how that went. Oh she's crazy, she never came in with any of those items, and miraculously, my item intake list, adjusted and all the items I was missing was forged to say I never came in with them. 

I'm crazy and delusional, but my bank account saying I made the original purchase of the items in the first place, all right before having to be admitted, gave me peace in my own mind. I'm not crazy, the people who take advantage of mentally ill patients, they're crazy, and whats wrong with the system.

We aren't supposed to go into other people's rooms, but thieves don't care and staff doesn't notice. We can bring pens np, even mirrors, shoelaces, belts, batteries and other potentially dangerous stuff. Rooms are never locked. If someone is dangerous they officially have someone there to watch that the door doesn't open but tbh they never do. We even have access to cutlery and dishes, glasses etc. They even forget to lock the main door half the time. People go missing and police gets called (when they notice several hours later) all the time. Staff is supposed to check on everyone every three hours but that rarely happens either.

0,"I have gone to a subacute (inpatient program where you live there for a little while) when I was 14 and I had a good experience looking back on it. 

It was nice to not have many expectation and be able to be away from the world. I found it very helpful, so much so I would find myself afterwards wanting to go back. There were a few incidents such as a fight almost happening and yelling occasionally, but all the staff treated us kindly and were very helpful, especially during the tense times. I had an alright therapist and stuff, and they got my meds sorted out.

I think it can be very helpful, but it can also be a bit of a risk. I didn’t experience many incidents and the staff were I was was wonderful, but other places might not be as well trained and might not handle things as well. I like to think all places are like the one I went to, but from what I’ve heard they aren’t always.

I think if you are in immediate danger, you need supervision constantly, need some med fine tuning, and need a break from the world to recenter yourself, it’s a healthy choice. (Think of it like a vacation, but don’t use it like a vacation if that makes sense. Do it if you need it, don’t do it because it’s there. If you have any doubts, talk to your doctor/psychiatrist/psychologist, they’ll be able to advise you better)

1,"I’ve found hospitalization very helpful, but I think it is important to keep in mind what its role is. Inpatient is extremely helpful and useful for people in crisis who need a short term solution so they can stay safe and become stable enough to accept long term treatment. You won’t find long term treatment inpatient. So for example, after one of my suicide attempts I found myself inpatient for a couple weeks. It was exactly where I needed to be- a place where it was impossible for me to hurt myself, where they kept me on a reliable routine, and were able to adjust my meds to the point where I was well enough to be discharged to a partial hospitalization program. It isn’t fun, but it can be essential. 

However, if you are not in a crisis right now longer term intensive care might be a better fit for you. Partial hospitalizations, intensive outpatient programs, and regular twice weekly therapy are all longer term care plans that address the underlying issues we’re facing in a more comprehensive way. To me it sounds like putting you inpatient would be a bandaid for the long term suicidality you describe, and maybe not even worth it when you balance it against the negative aspects of isolation, boredom, lack of autonomy, and possibly a non-therapeutic environment. 

I have bipolar 1 also btw",,h9wzjs

I work inpatient psych but for 13-17. I worked at a facility that did take his age group for a short time.

Typically, for his age, he will likely be placed in a hospital with kids 4(?)-12 or all the way up to 17. Pretty big age gaps all around and it can get kinda loud and chaotic with all those age groups.  Most hospitals for those age groups allow the parents to stay with the child as well but not required. Some hospitals seperate them in groups of age and some have them all smooshed together! 

There will be groups and lots of free time and there are times when it can get kinda scary, but remind him that the staff are ALWAYS going to do everything in their power to keep him safe. He likely will make some friends, but also remind him that friends isn’t the end goal, and it’s better to be friendly in there than on the outside with them, as everyone is going through some stuff and you don’t want the others to bring down his progress on the outside. 

Also a good reminder is to stay out the drama and focus on himself. It’s very very easy for kids to get wrapped up in the drama because there is nothing else to do. there will be some behavioral cases there that aren’t so much mental health, so to be friendly but also aware :)

2,"One reason why going to the hospital can help is the opportunity to talk with people about treatments. There are therapists who specialize in pediatrics because children and teenagers present special problems. That's one reason why the lifestyle therapies, which are mostly very easy, are important.

Relaxation eases the symptoms of depression and it helps with ADHD. The Asian method with the best evidence is slow breathing. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

A good habit - always respond to a moment of stress by breathing slowly.

0,You have to talk about it. It’s a tough line of work. Mentally demanding environment. I know someone just like you. Working in a hospital while in school to eventually work in surgery. Find someone you can vent to or maybe try therapy. Remember you’re dedicating your life to helping others and don’t let it control your thoughts as much.,,1b4cxfp
0,"First, he is in the safest place for him right now. When folks get manic, they can spend lots and lots of money, get arrested, and do many other things to wreak havoc in their lives.  You stayed with him until he was brought to the hospital and kept good watch on him. 

The thing in your post that is standing out to me is the fact that you are blaming yourself. Someone else cannot control another person’s mania, as much as they would want.

 You had no way to know that the money was a lie, and how he would react.  From what I read, you handled things like a champ. Am I right to guess that you had to move somewhere new to be with him?

And not to be condescending, but 20 is still young to go through such a crisis.  I hope his parents can get to know you and support you.  

There is a Reddit bipolar SO sub. You may want to post this or something similar there.  The challenge will likely be when he gets out of the hospital.  I’m sure other partners have been through something similar. 

But you take it one day at a time and take care of yourself🙏🏼. ",Having-hope3594,1cs5dn8
1,"Not medical advice, just my two cents. This is very likely substance induced psychotic disorder. This is not your fault and it can happen to anyone. THC content of cannabis nowadays is extremely high, especially in concentrates and edibles. Having your boyfriend hospitalized is for the best and will prevent him from hurting himself or others. If you are in the US, it’s very unlikely that he will be there for longer than 1-2 weeks and most hospitalizations last 5-7 days. 

In the upcoming weeks, there will be an adjustment period for the both of you. All you can do is be supportive and help him stay on medication and ensure that he makes a follow up appointment with outpatient mental health. Additionally, it will be important to avoid any future drug use as well.",11Reddit22,1cs5dn8
2,"When I was hospitalized for a depressive episode, there was a friend I made and he has in there for a manic episode. It’s difficult bc a lot of times someone in a manic episode doesn’t really want the help. He had to be involuntarily hospitalized. Something that caused him a lot of irritation/ pain was his family not being super supportive. You being supportive is helping more than you realize. I know it can feel like you’re not doing enough, but support is so important and can help so much. It’s not your fault. These things tend to be out of our hands and I know how anxiety inducing that can be. Your partner is in the hands of professionals and they can help him. Make sure to check in on yourself. It’s okay to feel scared. He is safe and will be released when he is stabilized. I can promise you, him coming home to someone who loves him and cares for his wellbeing is already helping him so much. Don’t be too hard on yourself. It’s okay to struggle with him being hospitalized. I wish you peace and healing!! And u hope your husband is doing well :)",Bana333,1cs5dn8
3,"I currently work in an inpatient psychiatric unit and have worked at a psychiatric hospital. First I'd like to say how sorry I am that you all are going through this. I'm not a nurse or a doctor, I assist the nurses with patient care and listen to patients vent or play games with them, just make them comfortable while theyre there. Although I am in school working to be a psychiatric nurse so I try to educate myself as best I can.

 It truly is hit or miss with psychiatric hospitals. So if your boyfriend allows staff your permission to talk with him on the phone or visit do that asap. I highly suggest that as well since you both live together and his mother also has a history of mental illness. And considering she triggered this.. idk, I think it would be good to talk to a social worker if you can and explain everything to them if they allow you to. He has to consent to that as well. Which ik doesn't make sense because of the state hes in, so usually they'll ask when he's more calm and lucid if they do their job correctly. Being that you guys live together, if your relationship is healthier than with his parents, I'd assume it's better he gets discharged to you. 

Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence when someone with his family history uses substances. Like the other person said, substance induced psychosis. Especially those with or have a family history of bipolar disorder. I see that too often than I'd like. Before he gets home, I STRONGLY suggest that you keep him focused on taking the meds his doctor prescribed and moving forward from the event. And keep him away from any THC. You gotta be gentle and loving. When the meds kick in a lot of times people in his situation don't remember everything that happened during the episode. If he asks, I'd personally downplay it and try to redirect him to prevent him from hyperfixating on the episode and trigger itself once again. 

Ik you said edibles/THC is a daily thing for you guys, but in his situation this likely to happen again if he continues. THC content is way too high and there isn't enough CBD to pump the breaks on it. If he absolutely insists and fights you on edibles or smoking and won't budge I'd recommend solely CBD. I'd have horrible mini psychotic episodes as I got older when I'd smoke bc of my personal mental illness factor so I cut out completely. I replaced it with CBD vapes and whatnot. I'd personally stash all of the THC you guys have in a place he doesn't see it or get rid of it. 

This is not your fault. Not enough people are educated about substances. I highly advocate for THC but like everything in the world there's always a bad to a good and good to a bad. Every person is different and unfortunately people in his situation are having these episodes because of the high THC content. You're young. It's easy to blame yourself but no one expects you to understand the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses. You're supposed to be enjoying life with each other. 

Again I strongly recommend you make sure he's taking his meds and going to therapy to cope with this episode or any residual he might be feeling. The meds are probably going to suck at first they always do, but after they build up in his system he will get back to normal. It's better that he has brain fog and zombie like exhaustion than going through manic episodes again. I was always against medication until I saw patients like him come in in that state and leave being themselves again. That's why I want to work in the mental health field and to help out people like you. 

Finally, call the hospital and explain who you are, he lives with you, ask to speak with him or ask staff to ask him if he's willing to get you on file to be able to speak with him. If hes ok with you knowing his medical info and signs the paper ask to speak with a social worker. They take care of discharge planning and what to expect when he comes home. Ask them all the questions and all of the resources for therapy and meds. Nurses come and go, the Doctor is always busy, but social workers stay up to date with the patients during their entire stay via daily meetings with the Doctor.

Full Disclosure: Like I said, I'm not a doctor or nurse. Just a lil aid that helps people like your boyfriend get taken care of while he's there. And from time to time offer my advice on here. 

Be easy on yourself. Eat, drink water, mentally prepare for him coming home, distract yourself so you dont have a horrible breakdown. You gotta be the strong one for a bit but you can do it!

6,"This is more than just an opinion and there is myriad research on drug use leading to a psychotic break. Some are more prone than others, especially if there is a family history of mental illness.

Once i got there i def was anxious cause i wasnt sure what type of ppl id be in there with, but i shortly realized not everyone was out to get you. But then they searched me, did “scar checks”, and had me show them any piercings. They let me keep my nose studs and my post earring but that depends on the facility. They also will drug test you but you wont get in trouble for having stuff in your system. But then they sent me to the dayroom which is where everybody is and i had multiple ppl come up and ask how old i was, why i was there, and things like that. I even got some conpliments lol. Dont go in there stuck up and judging ppl. Most are cool & if u dont start no shit wont be no shit. Youll be in contact with a doctor and possibly a therapist. You will likely have a roomate unless they deem it a safety concern, and im ngl its uncomfortable taking shits and stuff with a roomate, but its better than being constipated. They have different groups and therapies, gym time, and lotssss if movies and shows. Also the food at my place wasnt terrible it was actually quite good. But yeah basically just be respectful and u might even find some ppl u connect with. But dont get too attached because leaving it and missing all them ppl is a dif type of hurt. I hope this answered some ur questions and im willing to answer any more you may have :)",hhbdcb,1bj6qe4
1,"I noticed there is a comment about someone's experience in Australia, so that's probably more useful than my experience (I'm in Norway). But either way, here's what it's like for me (I am currently at a facility due to depression):

I only experienced the pat down and confiscation of things like shoes and keys the first day when i was admitted acutely due to high risk, but the next day I was moved to a different facility. I was able to go home (accompanied by a nurse) to get some stuff, and when I came back they asked me if I had any dangerous items and when I said no that was it, they didn't check or anything. 

After a few assessments, they decided it was safe for me to go out alone, and I'm mostly able to do what I want. They have some activities that they encourage everyone to participate in, but I'm only required to go to appointments with my psychologist. Meals are served in the common area, at 8, 12, 16 and 20 o'clock, but if I'm too tired to go they'll let me eat in my room or give me food at different times. There's also always fruit, tea and coffee available in the common area and I can bring my own food as well. 

The other patients (around 5 others at this unit) are talkative but don't pry for any details. That's not always the case, it depends on the people who are here (though culture might also have something to do with it, as in Norway, we always mind our own business, lol).

They also check on me during the night, which does wake me up due to the light getting in when they open the door, even if it's just a little. 

What I find the most annoying is how hard it is to sleep in. They wake me up right before 8 for breakfast, then again a few minutes past 8 to remind me of breakfast even if I tell them I need to sleep in and will eat later. And they keep waking me up to see if I want to get up or sleep some more, which makes it impossible to get more sleep and I usually give up around 9 (even though I need more sleep due to chronic illness).

But except for the sleep thing, it's not so bad. I don't have to be responsible for everything, and I get treatment without having to leave the house for it.

Edit: I also have my own room and a private bathroom",niva_sun,1bj6qe4

The hospital will check you in and you'll be moved to their crisis unit where they'll probably ask you some questions. At that point you'll probably have to change into some new clothes and they'll secure your belongings. They won't just ""not take you"". Again, in my area it'd either be police or EMS doing it and both get sent out.

25,"Truthfully, it depends on the crisis center, but generally the philosophy is that the least restrictive form of care is always preferable. In other words, if you call a crisis center and express that you feel like you need to be hospitalized, the operator will try to talk to you first to determine if this is really necessary. I'm not saying this is the case for you (if you feel like you need hospitalization, that is certainly always an option), however, often the case is that a person just needs to talk. In my experience as a former crisis line operator myself, when I would get the ""I think I need to be hospitalized call,"" I would talk to the individual about what was going on and by the end of that conversation, they would feel better and if they still needed to go, they usually would feel like that at least didn't need to go tonight. Emotions are high in crisis, like you said, you felt scared when you made this post, and when your scared in crisis sometimes hospitalization feels necessary (you don't know what your emotions might make you do), but crisis intervention is almost always just talking things out (when preformed by people who know what they are doing). There is really no harm in calling, and you won't have the police show up at your house simply for calling.

If hospitalization is they way you want to go, then you still have options. Depending on where you are or the state, if you call and a crisis line and request this, they may dispatch a mobile crisis unit (this may or may not include a police officer, again it really varies by location and situation) which would just be a crisis worker who talk to you about what's going on and if necessary, they'll go with you to the hospital. Some crisis systems even have walk in centers where you can just go and talk to someone if that is your preference. This is all typically free of charge.

Crisis professionals don't usually offer advice, but if I were to offer advice, I'd say just give it a call and talk to the person about your situation.

1) Your insurance might not cover the hospitalization, or might not cover all of it.

3) For the days you are hospitalized, you will not be able to work.  Depending whether you earn an hourly wage or not, you would lose that income from the hours not worked.

DM for privacy if you're uncomfortable giving details to the public.

\------

Either way It'll go like this:

You'll have to ask a Nurse or Doctor to be Discharged-

If your condition is Severe enough to where it threatens your Life or another's Life, they cannot authorize a discharge.

If the Medical Team/Doctor who's residing over your care views you as Healthy enough to be discharged, they'll discharge you.\^\^But from the info you gave, they will most likely want you to stay at least 3 days, overnight in a Psyche Ward, for a psychiatric evaluation.

\-------

If you have 10 days to fly out, you should have enough time for the system to find you a Psyche Ward Room and get evaluated but I have no way of knowing that from my end (nor do I have the authority to ask for that)

Just explain to the Nurse/Doc your situation and Ask if you can be Discharged.

Your situation is pretty much a hurry up and wait situation so you gotta be patient.

0,"I had a voluntary hospitalization stay in February of 2014. I was absolutely terrified, worrying that I'd end up in a padded room or being strapped down by some sadistic nurses or something, but it was not nearly as scary as I had imagined.

I think there were only 20 beds on the psychiatric ward, which I didn't expect. The day I checked myself in, there were no available beds, so they tried to bus me to a nearby hospital (I live in NYC, so there's a ton) and, at one point, the psychiatrist on call in the ER told me I had no choice but to go where they sent me. Thankfully, the nurse told me the shrink was lying, and if I stood my ground, they couldn't send me anywhere. So, I spent Day 1 sleeping on a stretcher in a shared room until a bed freed up in the psych ward, which thankfully only took a day to happen.

After you sign some documents acknowledging that you're submitting yourself for a voluntary hospitalization, they take your stuff away. I don't know if it works this way at every hospital, but they did an inventory of my stuff and put it in a safe. I was allowed to keep my phone, but the psych staff kept the charger behind the nurses station to keep you from hanging yourself with it. I wasn't allowed to wear my own clothes until the psych staff deemed it ""safe,"" so I was stuck in a hospital gown and socks for two days (this probably wouldn't be as big of an issue for anyone else, but I signed myself in for anorexia, so it's not like I had a lot of body fat to spare, and it was in the middle of a blizzard). 

I had a roommate in the psych ward, and if I'm not mistaken, all of the rooms were two-person, with the exception of a single one-person room for people with physical disabilities who needed the accommodations. Each bedroom had an attached bathroom. Then, there was the ""dining room"" (I spent no time in here, because I refused to eat unless I was allowed to do so in my bedroom), a game room, an ""art therapy"" room, and a standard psychologist's office. None of the doors had locks, but we were allowed to close the doors at will, and people generally respected your privacy. I was *very* antisocial during my entire stay--I slept nearly the entire time--and all the patients respected that. At night, the staff does checks to make sure you haven't killed yourself while your roommate is sleeping, but they just shine a flashlight into the room to see if you're still breathing. 

I wasn't suicidal, but my roommate was, which meant that she was on 1-to-1 (she was assigned a nurse who had to watch her all the time) for the first day. I also have a lot of physical health problems, many of which are related to my anorexia, so at least once every hour, a nurse would ask me, ""Are you in any pain?"" which got really fucking annoying, but I know they were just doing their jobs.

I can't speak about the group therapy or anything, because I refused to participate. In retrospect, I'm sure I was actually such a pain in the ass to the staff: I didn't eat in the dining room, I didn't do art therapy or meditation or any of that, I didn't even get up when I was supposed to. It's not because I was against it; I was just so fucking tired and I just needed a break. I'm actually really happy that they respected that and just let me sleep.

After day 4, I think, it became very clear to me that I didn't belong in the psych ward, because the staff didn't specialize in eating disorders, which is what I so desperately needed to be treated (I have depression, anxiety, dissociation, and all that shit, too, but the eating disorder was literally killing me day by day). And this is where I had an issue: After signing yourself in, you can't just waltz out of the psych ward; the doctors can hold you for 72 hours after you request to check yourself out, and if they deem you a threat to yourself or others, they can petition a court to keep you *in* the hospital. The staff agreed I wasn't a threat, but they were hesitant to let me out, I think because I was such an outspoken pain in the ass who swore a lot and questioned every decision they made (it's my nature). Thankfully, the head psychiatrist specialized in eating disorders and very clearly realized I needed different treatment, so I didn't have to wait the full 72 hours to get out. She referred me to a couple of treatment centers in the area, and started the paperwork for me. She saved me.

I hope this was kind of helpful. I know it's scary. It's so scary. I was barely 19 when I checked myself in, and I was so afraid everyone else would be older and crazier and violent or something. But most of the people there were just normal people. They were nice. No one did anything obscene. I was just so out of control, and I needed a break. I needed to sleep. I needed someone else to make the decisions for me. 

If you have any other questions, please let me know!",daaaaanadolores,2s8o6y
1,"I was hospitalized when I was 15, so I was in the children's ward. But I've had friends hospitalized in the adult ward a few times. Where I live, if you go in voluntarily, you have to at least stay the night and if they let you leave the next day, it is usually because they have made you sign a paper saying you will do outpatient therapy everyday for two weeks. If you sign it but don't attend, they can readmit you involuntarily until they think you are ready to leave.

3,"You cannot leave whenever you want. They will usually put you under a 72hour hold, that is if you get past the pre-emergency room eval and they decide to book you. Privacy depends on the hospital or how many people are there. You can end up alone or you can end up with a roomie. They will not leave you alone on purpose. If you do get time alone you will be checked in on multiple times, this includes sleep. The hospital would provide a stable environment and could teach you new skills to help you deal with your emotions.

I personally like an outpatient center much,much, better. It is just like the hospital but you get to go home at night. You come to therapy all day, some places will also include private therapy as well but that isn't very common, they will help you get on medication, you'll learn skills, have different types of group. It usually lasts a few weeks to even a few months.

You can go to school or work if you're well enough and can go about the town, but they're staffed 24/7 and you do group, see a psychiatrist, see psychologists, social workers, and psychosocial workers. Here in Aus, we call them 'Prevention and Recovery Care' centres and they're free of charge here. If you get prescribed meds, you have to buy them yourself (unlike in a closed ward) but the staff take you to pharmacies. Ask your GP about what services are offered in your area, and they can also call an ambulance or call the ER to tell them you're coming in if you want to go to the hospital.

Days consisted of 3 meals a day retrieved from the lunch room and brought back to the main room. We had to brush our teeth after every meal to establish a routine. And we were time blocked off. Shower as soon as they do morning wake up call, then breakfast, group therapy, lunch , Personal work time for you specific needs and group work time. Dinner then free time till bed time.

1,"Legally speaking, no. Based on this post, you don’t seem to have active suicidal ideation. That doesn’t mean you’re not depressed. In fact, that’s a good thing because being in a crisis is genuinely terrible. The hospital would most likely keep you voluntary since you don’t qualify for a hold. To qualify for a 72 hour hold, you have to be an active threat to yourself or others. You seem to have passive ideation but that doesn’t automatically mean an admission to the hospital. 

Whats hard about being a minor is that parents dictate everything, even if it’s not ok. They can refuse to pick their kids up from the ER, even if they’re ready for discharge. You’re more likely to run into that situation than being legally bound at the hospital.

1,"I've been 2 separate times, and from my experience it's really not bad. Keep in mind every place is different, this is just what I experienced. (also I went once when I was a minor and once as an adult, so I was in two different units, they pretty much the same, but being around people my age vs 40 year old adults while I was 18 made for a much different atmosphere) 

For starters you'll be bringing some clothes with you, for me I was there for 3-4 days, but they also would do laundry. Before you go in, they will be taking anything that you could harm yourself with. This includes any chords, strings, pens, etc. Basically anything pointy or anything rope like. So don't take clothes have have draw strings because either you can't use it or you'll need to remove it. Oh and you can still use things like pens and pencils as long as you're in a supervised area. 

For me at least, the beds are pretty uncomfortable, so bring some things to cozy up with. 

There's a lot of group therapy and group activities, they aren't required but they are encouraged. 

Those are the main things, and again, every place is a bit different. But I never felt unsafe while there, so if that's a concern of yours don't worry, there's a lot of staff and they are there to help.  If you have anymore questions then feel free to ask! 

(also just fun random side note: first time i went i ended up T-posing on chairs with another patient named Keo who I had kinda befriended and it's a memory I look back on fondly lol)",A_Willowbean,tlzm9z
2,"Ive been to a mental hospital over 10 times and my biggest advice is make sure you advocate for your needs. The staff are neurotypical people trying to help tons and tons of neurodivergent people that they know nothing about and might not even relate to. You gotta speak up about what you need and why, as best as you can. Trust me, I know its hard, Im autistic. But you will not get what you need unless you advocate for it in a calm manner. Its shitty but you have to put in work to get what you need from the hospital. They can keep you safe, and there are certain staff that really do care and can relate, but the work is up to you in the sense that you cant change unless you want to. There will be other people that may have some similar issues, of course idk what your situation is, but 9/10 times you can find a friend who makes it a bit more comfortable. Just make sure that if you make friends, dont let them distract you from why you're there and what you're trying to accomplish. In my experience, I didnt care and was more focused on friends the first couple times, which is why I kept coming back. The sooner you put in the work, the sooner you start the journey, the sooner you felt better.

Good luck on your journey c:",,tlzm9z
3,Hey man hopefully I’m not to late I’m 14 so maybe this won’t translate as well but I’ve been to a mental hospital and the best advice I could give is just calm down and remember you’ll get out. When I was at mine I met some 2 nice people who I still talk to this day. Also you can do what you want but the staff always suck and don’t help so if you are genuinely having mental health issues just act fine and get a therapist or someone when you get out hope this helps if you have questions just ask,NightWing212DC,tlzm9z

9,"Treat it as a respite. Here in the UK, I've never been to a seriously bad place, but I have been in some great hospitals too. Psych wards are filled with a mix of people you wouldn't expect. And you will find more sanity in them wards than you will outside of them.

11,"Going to an inpatient facility for a few days really helped me. There were no real demands on my time (activities and meals, but a lot were optional), people were mostly kind because they were trying to figure out their own shit. I spent a lot of time literally just looking out the window at the trees, and that was just fine. I felt safe from my intrusive thoughts there. 
I wouldn’t say it was a pleasant experience - I don’t think anyone wants to have to go there. But for me it wasn’t a bad one either.

I've been to a fancy hospital and a run-down facility. The staff is the same at both places. They are on their phones or talking to each other. I agree, you must advocate for yourself.

The beds suck. I had to rotate my mattress so the sag hit my hips instead of my back. Don't expect much sleep unless you take the sleeping pill. I took it a few times because I just had to sleep. 

Make a friend. It helps a lot and it's pretty easy. There are no strangers in a psych ward.

19,"A friend of mine was at a mental hospital after her suicide attempt. 

She had to wake up, go to bed, eat breakfast, lunch, dinner at fixed times.
Had school, sport and stuff.
And she was allowed to leave if she requested to leave one day prior.
And she had to go to therapy 2-3 times per week. 
Nothing to be afraid of.

I don’t know what you’ve been through. All I can say is that the mental hospital is the fastest way to get better.

Bring things to make you feel cozy & maybe ear plugs—you may have a roommate or otherwise find the noises that are unfamiliar a bit hard for sleeping . Ask what they are giving you, so you can understand why. Try to attend the groups-you can learn some coping skills. There often isn’t much other therapy. A meeting now and then with doc or your social worker. Be polite to staff & the will be nice back—you can’t always tell where you go what they will be like but most want to make you feel safe. Don’t bring anything valuable. Bring soap, shampoo, comfy towels, slippers, it’s not a hotel! And they don’t generally have a shop either. You may have to give up your phone, good to find out in advance. It may vary by hospital. the point is to get better, so do what you can to engage, and rest when you need to, but don’t hide.

2,"1) Get your own criminal attorney….. especially if you’re being framed….. with arrest warrants, usually the police come pick you up with no warning…… so this public attorney might be a scam…… once you’re arrested, you have a court hearing to determine if you can be released and/or a hearing where you’re assigned a public defender…… so this sounds EXTREMELY fishy- if you know what county/court, then do a court record search for your name to see what pops up…..

2) If you think the charges are real charges, then you might consider turning yourself in……
The jail will get you mental health care if you express suicidal ideation- it will SUCK BUT it will also show that you’re not going psych inpatient to delay/avoid being arrested….. AND asking about legal issues is a common psych intake question


That said going inpatient is a good thing….

If you can do a direct admit, it’s easier….. just call local psych wards/hospitals asking about beds…. Otherwise go to the ER or Community Mental Health

In the ER, they usually….

~medically clear you which means addressing health concerns and lab work (urine, blood, COVID test)

~ take your clothes & belongings to store elsewhere giving you scrubs/hospital gown 

~ assign a patient sitter unless they have a psych area

~ assess you for the level of mental health care you need then find placement for you

Then you’re transported to the psych ward/hospital typically by ambulance….

One you get to the psych unit…..

~ you’re asked tons and tons of questions

~ they do a skin assessment which requires you to remove your clothes

~ they search your belongings 

~ give a basic overview of the unit & typically offer a snack

After that, you’ll see the following:

~ psychiatrist daily

~ activity therapy assessment once, then group activity therapy

~ case manager 

~ physical health assessment 

~ nurse assessment and they also administer meds 

~ group therapy

What's good homie g big dog dark figure home slice. I've been going through the same thing you've been going through and what helped me WAS actually going to a mental hospital. I'm really glad you're realizing that that is a step that you need to take, because once you get your mental health figured out your life is going to be so much easier. Don't be afraid of Mental Hospitals, they're definitely way better than people make them seem. It might be a little sterile and kind of . . . you know . . . not amazing, but it will help. There's probably going to be people that are checking up on you throughout the day, just making sure you're doing okay, which is really nice to have actually. They are probably going to ask a lot of questions. They are just trying to help really, they care about you just as much as you do probably. Coming from a natural born psychologist about to get his LPN and crn, we really don't want to be the obstacle standing in the way of you and your mental health. And there will probably be people your age there, and it doesn't even depend on how old you are. Point is you have nothing to be afraid of except boredom. Unless you like reading, then it's going to be an amazing transition for you. But yeah they don't like to have phones or TVs or any like recording devices in there because of security. So that's kind of fucked but otherwise it's pretty chill. Trust me though you'll go in there like a scared puppy and come out like a fuckinf superhero. I'm not even kidding, I am in a treatment center right now and I'm on my second stage. I get done in a month and a half and I feel more powerful than I ever have in my entire life. For once I feel like I can actually use my skills emotionally to pursue a financial career, and I can further that knowledge and go on to do better things, I don't just feel stuck in a box anymore. I think going to a mental hospital is probably going to be good for you and I don't even know you but I just feel like addressing mental health is very important right now. Just in society like look at where we're at. The fact that you are addressing your mental health as a problem is the first step to getting better. I promise you once you get out of here you will feel a million times better about yourself. Good luck, stay safe, stay sober, have fun.

5,"Hello. I spent the majority of my teenage years (11-16) in psych wards. My first hospitalization I was there 9 months. I did a year at a Christian based inpatient in Waco, Tx which if I'm honest was my worst experience . I also had to do inpatient  treatment as an adult more times than I would  care to admit.  Avoid Spring Shadows Glenn in Spring Branch. If you are ready to make some changes it can be very beneficial.  Just be aware you know your body better than a doctor,  the least amount of medication is better and if you if you feel off or doped up it is your right as a patient to take something else. In my experience most psychiatric facility doctors drug the fuck out of you. You are supposed to feel better and be able to function.  Also seeking help might put you in a better position with your legal troubles.  You can receive medication, therapy, and you would be in a cell block with other people with mental illness. You would more than likely receive liency with whatever charges are brought against you.  In my case my felonies were reduced to misdemeanors because of my mental unstability.
