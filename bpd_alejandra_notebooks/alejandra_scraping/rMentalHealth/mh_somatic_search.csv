1,Somatic OCD is destroying me,"Im having some kind of full body panic attack and I feel like Im like losing control, losing sapience or something, like Im just an animal with no intellectual awareness.  Also weirdly I feel like I cant hear out of my right ear.  I keep putting my phone speaker up to it to see if I can feel the sensation of hearing in that ear and I can tell what the words are but I cant feel the sensation.  The latest in a very very long list of super weird obsessive somatic symptoms I've felt.

 I feel like this is something you're not even supposed to ever consider because who thinks of the sensation of hearing?

but I do

and not being able to ""feel"" the sound is making me feel insane.

I tried to talk to my mom about it but she just got annoyed. The look on her face was so sour like ""More of this? Im so tired of this,"" and I cant blame her for that but it still hurts.

Ive lost everything; my job, my creativity, all of my real life friends, my closeness with family, appetite, my sexuality. Now my OCD is attacking my basic senses and its going to destroy me.

I just wish it would hurry up and get to its end game already.  Like am I gonna live through this and get better, or am I just going to fall into oblivion? Cus playing tug of war is getting really fucking difficult.  Its been 6 years since my mental illness went from a moderate problem to a very severe one, yet someone Im still pulling on the rope.  Me, alone, against an entire team of bodybuilders.  ",1715394585.0,False,1,0,PressYtoHonk,None,1cp702o,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cp702o/somatic_ocd_is_destroying_me/
2,Somatic Symptom Disorder - Coping Mechanisms?,"I believe Somatic Symptom Disorder is what is going on with me right now and it's driving me crazy.   
It all started in December when I had mild pain in my hip and didn't think much of it (back when I was normal) until it got pretty painful and I went to the doctor. He had me do an MRI on my back and after finding out a bulging disc he all but told me I was crippled now and should not go back to the gym because it would aggravate my sciatica. This created a spiral in my psychological state and when I got to PT I was told that all people can have bulging discs but no symptoms and told me I had hip burstitis instead (which was true and it actually got better). BUT I was so fixated on the back thing I actually manifested tingling sensations until I got an EMG that was clear and it magically stopped. Even discovering a tiny spider vein would send me into a mental breakdown that something is wrong with my body and it's breaking apart. 

  
It has been 4 months during which I go to have an examination every single week. I have seen nearly all types of doctors, 3 different orthos because I didn't trust them and I've had MRIs, Xrays, blood tests, EMGs, cortisone injections etc. Not to mention the amount of money spent on all that.  
I had intense groin pain that I was convinced was osteoarthritis until I got the most pristine MRI the world has ever seen. That was the point I realized this was no longer a physical issue but a mental one. I have started therapy because I don't feel like a real person anymore. Every day I wake up to a new ""sensation"" I have to Google and label myself with Achilles Tendonitis, Plantar facilitis, frozen shoulder, rhematoid arthritis, Ovarian cyst pain, PCOS only to name a few.   
  
I think Googling is what did it for me and I don't know how to get out of this loop of feeling pain all the time and assuming that it's something serious, a ""condition"" I have to live the rest of my life with. I cannot stop doing it too!   
Perhaps the hardest part is the fact that once I fixate on the pain long enough, it just gets stronger because my mind thinks that it's under threat. As of now, my heel hurt me a little yesterday (adding that I was on the treadmill walking for an hour) and I went into a spiral about having Plantar Fascilitis or Morton's neuroma. I was considering going back to the doctor to have my feet checked but I think this is my anxiety all over again.   
I am trying to think ""what would a normal person do?"" but I somehow feel like, ""they are not like me, what they have is simple but mine is a condition"" or something along those lines. It's ruining my life. How do you cope?",1712400774.0,False,2,0,Rapladaka,None,1bx8pzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1bx8pzq/somatic_symptom_disorder_coping_mechanisms/

7,Somatic ocd becoming hellish state,"
Man. I’m trembling like crazy as I write this. I’ve dealt with this subtype for almost my whole life and recently (3 days ago) it took a turn for the absolute worst. My intrusions with this one-*trigger warning: about to name my Intrusions*-typically revolve around stuff related to my thinking and concentration. That’s the most precious thing to me I suppose. I have the ones most of us experience too like with attention to unconscious body processes, but there’s something about my thinking that just gets to me the most. 
So what do I mean by my thinking and concentration? I get intrusive what if’s that revolve around-“what if I can’t focus on my studies? What if I can’t day dream anymore? What if I can’t stop focusing on my peripheral? 
So basically anything that will make it so I can’t properly use my mind.
And it’s so frustrating because I’ve known about this disorder and that I have it for about 8 years now, and I’ve learned so so so much. I understand now how to beat it for the most part as well-but there are these super ultra micro processes happening in my mind that I just cannot seem to get a hold of.  

  The other day I started practicing Erp and Act on my own in a way more committed way, and my god I was getting so much better. Ocd didn’t like this. So on the second or third day it hit me with nearly everything it had. A “what if” popped in my head that may have scared me a bit more than usual, then out of nowhere-BOOM-a million intrusive thoughts absolutely flooded my brain. I could not navigate it, I could not “control” it, hell, I could not see. I was totally disoriented and trying so hard to fight tears and panic. My mind was spinning with the most horrifying prepositions related to my thinking and concentration. After that my mind naturally cooled on its own and I had returned to a better state. But from then on, my mind begin to take a lot more control over me and my reality becomes more and more hellish with each passing day since. Right now, and for the past few days, my mind has been in a state where I’ll be able to drift off and think of something else, but then every few seconds to every few minutes it’s like a reminder notification is going off in my mind. A reminder of everything I’ve been worrying about. All day long. I don’t engage with the thoughts, but they’re there, and they prod at me and mess with my concentration-which is the very thing I’m freaked out about. Then for a few minutes or longer, I’m doing what I’m doing with half my brain overly concision about the intrusions, and the other half attempting to do other things. Yesterday though, I hit a very impressive record of 10-15 minutes of uninterrupted, normal functioning (clap). 


  In my opinion-based on what I’ve learned-your emotions are the most important thing to monitor and regulate when ocd is messing with you. If you show it no fear, the intrusions will naturally dissipate with time. We humans don’t usually waste time thinking about things that we don’t care about after all. So that’s what I’ve been working on. Sometimes, of course, I have to fake it, telling ocd that I’m not afraid or that I don’t care, when I most certainly do. 
But I’m having a really hard time dealing with the “associations”. By that I mean, when intrusive thoughts attack something that matters to you, you may now have an association directly related to it or a trigger, so anytime I try to day dream now, I’m reminded instantly of my intrusions. Any time I go to study, immediate bombardment, and many others. I’m trying to calm my emotional relationship with these intrusions so I can weaken the bond between my fear and these things I want/need to do. 
Something that is tripping me up bad is that; I know that these intrusions are silly. I know that they are absolutely ridiculous and deserve zero of my mental energy or consideration, but for me it’s the part where it happens anyway that kills me. The fact that even though I’m treating these intrusions like passing clouds like I should, that still doesn’t stop me from being unable to concentrate as I study, or being unable to stop staring at my peripheral instead of what’s right in front of me. I think I get urges to egg it on too. Feels like my mind forcibly hones in on the intrusion and my inability to focus. This throws me off track. I also get so mixed up and confused and sometimes cannot tell the difference between letting it pass, engaging, or avoiding. I don’t try to ignore the thoughts, I allow them to be there, but sometimes when I’m trying to actually use my damn brain, I have no choice but to attempt to forcefully grab my attention so I can actually do things. But I know that force is bad here. So I’m unsure of what to do. I’ll have moments of trying to fight back tears, and the urge to just absolutely explode in a crying fit allowing these obsessions to totally swallow me.


  Anyway, the reason I even started creating this post is because, about an hour ago now, I woke up and it was as if my intrusions were sitting pretty in the corner, no, at the forefront of my mind, waiting for me to awake. They were just…there, and it felt so different and so so so much worse than before. I was in this constant, very linear/unmoving state of hyper awareness. I can hardly explain it but it felt like I was being tormented. I was conscious to a level that we aren’t meant to be, my thoughts and my mind, I could feel it, I could feel everything. I could not focus on anything beyond that. It was as if I could physically feel my brain short circuiting. I started to panic and tremble and tried my best to deep breathe and ground myself. Now thankfully getting into the groove of typing this post out has helped to shift my focus a bit and now I’m just back to where I was yesterday mostly. But I notice my mind literally forcing me to check and see if it’s still capable of getting to that place again, forcing me to feel hyper awareness. This is where I try to counter that and shift my attention, but again, I cannot tell if what I’m doing is wrong or not. My mind is a horrifying environment right now. Any insights, experience, advice or anything else would be much appreciated.",1690743639.0,False,3,2,ahuman996,None,15dtdds,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15dtdds/somatic_ocd_becoming_hellish_state/
8,Is it possible for Psychosomatic/Somatic issues to be brought on by physical activity?,"Hi, so my life was going on as normal. I've had depression/anxiety etc for many years, which had a numbing effect on me mostly, but I was able to function ok, just with a limited amount of life satisfaction for many years. I did therapy and have done meditation and healthy eating etc for years now.

**But all of a sudden around 7-8 months ago I started to get unexplained symptoms -**

* Exertion bringing on feelings of being unbalanced/lightheaded (For last 6-7 months)
* Walking and any physical activity, sometimes even just 5 minutes of walking, making me feel more depressed, anxious and irritable). If I stop physical activity of any kind, the symptoms calm down quite a bit.
* Random bouts of tinnitus (Started around jan)
* Occasionally I'd get weird floaters/static in my eyes, although this doesn't often happen
* Shooting pains in my abs, ribs, testicular (since around nov/dec)
* If I try to do any serious exercise now I will get mid panic attacks hours later
* Rapid heart rate and significant increase in baseline heart rate (up from 60 to 75-85).
* GI discomfort. Dioreah and really, really bad farts lol. (Since around december/jan)

It's taken me several months to accept they may well be psychosomatic problems, because it wasn't just mental exertion that brought them on, it was primarily physical exertion.

I had to stop hiking, which I enjoyed doing, and now I have to keep myself down to 30-45 minute walks, which still brings on the symptoms, but they don't get too bad If don't walk much more than this.

I also have had to take time off work as mental exertion/concentration also brings the symptoms on.

WHen I noticed it wasn't just exercise that brought it on, but mental exertion, that's when I realised it may well be psychosomatic.

14,How do you know if you have somatic symptom disorder or a real health problem?,"For two months I’ve had constant nausea that’s worsened by eating, shortness of breath/feeling of restriction on my chest, I’ve been on my period the whole time, and neck and back pain (which especially bothers me because I popped a disc out of place or something and was in crippling pain for almost a week a year ago and I don’t want it to happen again).

I paid no attention to it at first, but when my psychiatrist prescribed me vyvanse my stomach got way worse and with her permission I stopped taking it. But it never got any better after that and has only gotten worse. 

I went to urgent care and after me saying I was waking up at night gasping for air unable to breathe they prescribed me melatonin, which made me incredibly mad. They also gave me tums and zofran (nausea med) which I tried hopefully but didn’t help. They said it was just anxiety.

They lied to me about getting me into primary care at their medical center and they were booked until January, so I went to a pcp out of town. His nurse only took my pulse and blood pressure and the doctor talked to me for about five minutes before telling me that it’s probably just anxiety and to exercise and it’ll help. He prescribed me Prilosec to essentially test for an ulcer or acid reflux and it hasn’t done anything yet. 

My psychiatrist briefly mentioned meds for anxiety after I told her what the doctors said, but she dropped it because she doesn’t think I think it’s just anxiety. 

How do I know if it’s somatic symptom disorder or not? I wasn’t any more anxious than normal when the symptoms set in. I got anxious after I had been having them for a few weeks.

Nobody will draw blood or X-ray or do any “tests” so there’s no evidence either way. My doctor (probably trying to scare me) told me that the next step if the Prilosec doesn’t help is to put me under anasthesia and look down my throat with a camera.

17,"A must read for people with health anxiety and GAD. Psycho somatic symptoms, anxiety experience shared and anxiety explained.","Hey people!

I thought I would post my experience as I think it would be massively beneficial for people suffering from any type of anxiety especially health anxiety. Be prepared this is a long post. Please, please read as I honestly believe if I had a post like this to read it would of helped me.

Before I start I am a 38 year old male from England. I am 5ft 11ins and weigh around 88kg. I live a healthy and active lifestyle and exercise 3 - 4 times a week. Previous to this experience I had never suffered from any major illness or had any previous mental health issues. I have always been very relaxed and laid back.

So in October last year I had a weird cough for a couple of days. When I coughed I felt a slight strain just below my Adam’s apple. I had a feel of my neck and I noticed a small soft lump the size of almond on the lower left side and inflammation in the centre of my neck directly above my collar bone. 

I made an appointment with my GP and upon my visit he stated he’d like to take some blood tests and have me booked in for an ultrasound. He reassured me that he thought everything would be fine as I’m relatively healthy and only in my 30’s. 

After that appointment I did the worst and started to Google my symptom’s and went down an endless rabbit hole of possibly diagnosis. All the while constantly touching and prodding my neck every chance I got. Everything I read pointed to Thyroid cancer and for 2-3 weeks straight until I had my blood test and received my results I wasn’t getting more that 2 hours sleep a night as I was constantly worrying. Around this time I started to notice my vision blurring and my eyes twitching.

The bloods came back all clear, liver and kidney function all good and no inflammation. FBC also good.

This was good news however, I still had to wait another month for my ultrasound. I have a family so my worry escalated. Still no sleep, constantly touching my neck and in that time I had two panic attacks resulting in two trips to the hospital (where they done multiple blood tests on both occasions) and more visits to my GP asking questions for reassurance. 

I was finding any bumps and lumps I could over my body, usually smaller than a pea convincing myself these were inflamed lymph nodes. I was finding them in my neck, groin and under my armpits. In these areas I started to have sharp pains. Again I had more GP appointments asking them to examine my lymph nodes. From October to December I had visited the GP 13 times. Every time telling me I was just being anxious.

The results of my ultrasound came back which showed I had a goiter, two slightly enlarged nodules in my thyroid gland but with no signs of anything ominous. 

Although good news the way I was feeling I couldn’t accept that I was in good health. 

Because of the lymph nodes I could feel I had read up on lymphoma and honestly thought I had it or another type of cancer. 

I was constantly taking my own temperature, getting short of breath, checking my own blood pressure. 

I was told by my GP this was all because I was worrying too much and had anxiety. I couldn’t accept it, why was worrying making me have all these physical symptoms?  -

Pains
Loose stools
High temperatures
High heart rate
Shortness of breath
Blurred vision
Twitchy eyes
Dizzy spells
Fatigued 

The doctor prescribe me 50mg of Sertraline. The first or two weeks of taking Sertraline made every worse. All symptoms increased. 

I also had multiple ultrasound scans on my lymph nodes for reassurance. Again all came back fine.

A few weeks later I went on holiday to an all inclusive resort, free food and booze which I took advantage of. Turned out mixing my Sertraline with alcohol was not the best idea as I started having diarrhoea on a daily basis, usually two to three times a day. Again, I thought this was a result of me having a serious illness and not mixing the meds with booze.

When I returned home I made yet another appointment with my GP. The downfall with the NHS is that you never get the same GP, so who ever you see needs to familiarise themselves with all your medical history to date before or on the appointment. 

I told this GP what I had been experiencing over the course of the 4-5 months and the symptoms I had. Straight off the bat she said,  and I quote “it sounds like HIV, you should have a test, and while we’re at it we’ll test for diabetes and do another FBC”.

So I’ve been with my wife for 16 years, married for 12 years and had my son in 2018. I new during her pregnancy she was tested for HIV as standard procedure which came back negative. I have always been faithful and trust my wife completely. Although I knew it was highly unlikely I had HIV, once again I googled the symptoms. Not a good idea. I then convinced myself I had not just HIV but full blown aids. This sounds incredibly stupid but this is where I was at. 

The symptoms I didn’t have on the AIDS list I started having, everything but rashes and legions. I even lost my sight in low light on occasion. The 2 weeks it took to get my bloods taken and the results back were the worst I had ever experienced in my life. No sleep, constantly worrying, breaking down in tears daily and checking glands every moment I could. Reading up on Google and Reddit about people living with HIV and AIDS.

Again it may seems extreme and ridiculous but this is where I was at. To my suprise yet again all bloods came back all clear. I broke down in relief. 

It was at that point I decided to increase my Sertraline dosage to 100mg and seek help for my anxiety through the NHS using the well-being centre. 

The mental health unit done an assessment on me at the end on January this year and decided it would be beneficial for me to have six to eight session of CBT. As this was through the NHS there was a four week waiting list for me to start my therapy. 

Four weeks? I couldn’t wait that long and I didn’t really want to pay private prices for CBT.

I decided to take matters into my own hands for mine and my families sake.

It was a tough road but I started working out again, acting positive, reassuring myself nothing was wrong and I stopped checking my body for lumps and bumps. 

It wasn’t until someone I met at work explained what anxiety was to me and the physical effects it can have on the body when I really did start feeling better. 

They put it to me like this -

Every one get worries in life. The more you worry the more that worry turns into stress. That constant stress and worry then takes its toll on your mind and on your body, leading to physical body changes. Psycho-somatic symptoms, especially in health anxiety. 

Now the NHS had been superb, seeing me countless times, sending me for many tests, some at my request. Their downfall is having no real knowledge or explaining to patients thoroughly what anxiety is and what it can do.

The term “anxious” is thrown around to casually on a day to day basis, people have something important to do for work they’re “anxious” people have money problems they’re “anxious” people have an interview they’re “anxious”. I feel the word “anxious” is used in a way that just casually indicates that someone is worrying about something no matter how small. Where as real anxiety is crippling and can have a powerful effect on your mind and body. 

Again no GP or doctor explained to me what an anxiety disorder entailed. Just every time I went to the GP they said “you’re anxious”.  

The other major flaw is the NHS’s mental health and well-being service. I was on a four week waiting list to be treated for chronic health anxiety with CBT. That was at the end of January, I wasn’t contacted by a therapist until late May (four months after my initial assessment), at which point they done another assessment and stated I didn’t need any CBT as I had self treated myself and am now in recovery. Ridiculous! Absolutely distrusting!

Obviously I thought my situation was bad, the worst, it may seem like an exaggeration but I really thought I was going to die. But think about the people who have it soooo much worse, people who on top of anxiety slump into depression. People with no support of friends of family, or people with anxiety who find it hard to talk to people. The NHS well-being and mental health service need to step up and take action! 

Anyway, for all of you who are suffering  and do need help I’m here to talk, any questions please feel free to message me and I’ll get back to you asap.

All the best and keep strong and positive. You matter, your life matters and no matter what type or whatever level of anxiety your are suffering you are just as important as the rest. We are equals!

20,How can I help my husband with somatic delusions,"For the past 2.5 years my husband has been convinced he has bowel cancer. He is diagnosed with bipolar and is currently on medication (anti depressants and anti psychotics).

This isn’t the first time he’s been worried about having an illness. In the past he has been worried he had aids and liver failure amongst many others, but this time is different. It’s lasted much longer and has been much more persistent. 

He is so anxious and depressed about it and is constantly saying he Is going to kill himself as he just can’t take it anymore. 

I don’t know how to help him. He sees a doctor (very sporadically) for his bipolar and has had many med changes in the last 2.5 years but nothing has helped and he has given up on it.

I can’t get him to see a doctor to prove he doesn’t have cancer as he says that won’t help and refuses to go. 

I try to use logic to show him that he doesn’t have it but I just can’t convince him. 

I’ve tried being calm and supportive and reassuring him.

I’ve tried passing it off as a joke to show how ridiculous it is.

I’ve researched it and shown him the types of symptoms he would have if he did but he dismisses it. 

I tried to get him into therapy to talk to someone about it, but he doesn’t believe ‘talk therapy’ could help him. 

I’ve considered trying to get him admitted to a psych ward but I know he won’t go willingly and it feels like such a betrayal to force him. 

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I want him to be happy more than anything and it’s killing me to see this break him. 

He has put knives to his throat, tried to take pills and just threatens he will kill himself all the time. I have Had to physically restrain him from hurting himself before.

I am so worried one day I will come home from work and he will be dead.

Please, please, please some body help me help him.",1565097263.0,False,2,4,SmallBear91,None,cmqfli,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cmqfli/how_can_i_help_my_husband_with_somatic_delusions/

23,"5 Years ago I had debilitating somatic symptom disorder and panic attacks, today I am completely free from unhealthy anxiety. I wanted to offer some advice on what worked for me.","I know anxiety is different from person to person. What worked for me might not work for you but when I first started getting anxiety, reading people's triumph stories on the internet really did help me a lot. It gave me hope to keep going and i made me feel connected to others.

I wrote up my story over here: [How I Left Behind Unhealthy Anxiety and Started My Life Again](https://markelrayes.medium.com/how-i-left-behind-unhealthy-anxiety-and-started-my-life-again-5c99cce2bd15)

I will gave the key points below and if you want some more details I write it all out above.

1. Admit It & Then Show Up For Yourself

Claim power over your struggle by admitting you have a mental health and allowing yourself to feel  whatever comes up. Love yourself, struggles and all and show up for  yourself when you need it. I literally would look in the mirror and say, ""Hey Marky, you have anxiety and i love you. We are going to get through this together, and we are going to be okay. We got this!"" It was an act of love I was giving myself.

2. Seek Help in Your Own Way

Define  your path of healing. Speak to yourself and decide what you know will work and what won’t. In saying that, also stay open to try new routes.  Strengthen the core of your identity allow some flexibility on the  exterior. I had a list of rules for my how my healing was going to go. When I felt in charge of what was going to work for me, it empowered me.

3. Check In and Adjust Often

Have honest conversation with yourself. If something isn’t working, adjust  it. If you made a pact before that no longer serves you, throw it away.  This is a journey you are on and you have to adapt to what comes up. Like I said above, I had rules and one was No Medicine. After a very large panic attack, I realized I needed to change that rule. I adjusted to the moment and it paid off hugely. For me, medicine gave me a chance to see the anxiety and work on it.

4. Change Your Environment

Look  at your life and what is serving you and what is toxic. Shed that  toxicity every single day. Force your anxiety to birth itself in an  environment of love and personal growth. My environment was inside and outside my mind. I was able to physically move to get rid of external toxic pieces but I also changed my internal state. I was convinced I was going to heal completely. It might look different for you but make sure all in your life serves your happiness.

5. Do the Work, Give Yourself Grace

You  are on a road that has fallen trees and bandits. You have to keep doing  the work, you have to fight sometimes. I promise you it will get easier  and I also promise you that you will lose some fights. Tell yourself  it’s okay to lose sometimes. Give yourself the love you would give  others. I had rough days, even towards the very end when I saw anxiety getting smaller and smaller. It was the grace to say to myself, ""it's okay pal, you are doing great. Today is just one day, we'll try again tomorrow."" that pushed me through on my own terms. It gave me flexibility to live how I wanted to.

\--

Well, I just wanted to share some of the tips that I found. These were just some of the things I did but I each point I can say drastically changed my life. My relationship with unhealthy anxiety is completely gone. I don't take medicine anymore.

I would be wrong to say my somatic symptom disorder is completely gone but how i greet the worry is absolutely different. Now if I fear something is wrong with me physically I basically say hello and invite it to sit with me. It feels healthy now. It just feels like normal worry that I can look into and put to the side. If you are going through something right now, I really hope one day I can read your recovery post one day.

24,My Interesting story with Illness Anxiety Disorder (Hypochondria) and my somatic (physical) symptoms,"Hello everyone on reddit, I have have anxiety for most of my life with extreme bouts of depression and hypochondria. When I was in grade 10, 2013 i all of a sudden lost sensation on the right side of my body, and then eventually (a few weeks later) spread to the other side.  This really freaked me out and I thought I was having a stroke or cancer. Almost everyone who has illness anxiety disorder has a few of death. I then made constant visits to my extremely patient doctor who believed me and gave me so many different types of tests: blood tests, thyroid checks, lower back ultra sound, and brain MRI, and a nerve conduction study. I did almost every test in the book, I also get a burning pain in my left scapula and sometimes weakness in my left of right side of my body but will then go away. Recently I have felt it's gotten worse and I'm feeling in a constant state of worry as to whether I have a tumor on my spine or some auto immune disease. I'm constantly thinking about it no matter what is going on. I have times when I dont think about and I  feel pretty good although I still feel the physical symptoms. I dont know if I will ever feel the same, but I am totally fine living with this, becuase I am happy when I'm not in one of these moods, and I will be moving to japan next june for a teaching job. I just wanted to share my story, and see if anyone else ever felt like this. My doctor doesnt know what it is and it makes me feel nervous.

25,If you have a pinched nerve (in your neck) do you “know it?”,"You know people say like “if it was broken, you’d know it.” 

Could this be applied to a pinched nerve?  I have somatic OCD and have felt weird things involving the right side of my neck and down into my right arm.  I went to a neurologist and he… spent all of like 5 minutes poking me with a safety pin and pressing on the backs of my shoulders.  I did wince at one of the presses and he was like “I think you have a pinched nerve. Bye.”

But like everything I’ve read about a pinched nerve in the neck describes sharp pains and numbness and pins and needles feelings.  I havnt felt any of those things… just an occasional ache in my right arm and in my neck.  I dont know if this is a somatic symptom of OCD and anxiety or if it’s a pinched nerve…

I wanted to ask more questions but this neurologist was a jerk and clearly wanted me out of his office.  So honestly if I’m having doubts that I have a pinched nerve, would that mean I probably don’t?

I should also say I’ve been dealing with this thing/pain for about a year now… but historically I hang onto my somatic OCD obsessions for very long periods of time.

28,"Hypochondriasis, factitious disorder, somatic symptom disorder, or is she just sick?","I'd love to ask a professional this question but since I wouldn't be the patient/client, I'm not even sure how that could take place.  The issue is with my mom and I live out of state and even if I were near her doctor's office, I'm guessing they couldn't share information due to confidentiality.

Anyway, I'm hoping for help here or at least the chance of being pointed in the right direction.  My mother is in her fifties and since my siblings and I left home for college when she was in her 40's, she has had numerous surgeries and received many medications.  I, along with other family members, suspect that she has in the past, and continues to, exaggerate or imagine symptoms to justify all of this medical treatment and that it is caused by attention seeking behavior.  However, I don't think she is intentionally creating or causing symptoms as I've read those with Munchausen Syndrome do.  She is just obsessed with illness and medicine.  Every weekly phone conversation with her is about either her ailments or those of some friend or family member.  She's had multiple orthopedic surgeries, a few GI, many many mental health prescriptions (unclear if these came from a psychiatrist or PCP), and one diagnosis from an oncologist that turned out to be false.  The write up of the lab work and tests done to reach this diagnosis were ambiguous at best.  When she broke the news of the diagnosis to me and my siblings, she seemed genuinely happy about the possibility of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant.  

Besides her medical problems being the only thing she'll talk about and the problems that could stem from unnecessary surgeries and medications, I'm also concerned with the financial aspects of her obsession.  My parents aren't well off and have no savings for retirement so all of the co-pays and coinsurance for doctor's visits and prescriptions and procedures are adding up and hurting them financially.  Her obsession with health also seems to be spreading because now she's sure that my dad has an issue that is treated by a $36,000 a year medication, all without him ever seeing a specialist. 

That was a long preamble but finally here's my question.  Is she a hypochondriac; could this be an actual attention seeking disorder and if so, which one and how do I intervene to make sure she gets help; or are me and my siblings just overreacting to a woman that seems to be exceptionally sick at a young age?

Turns out our body does an amazing service for us, which is holding the emotions we couldn’t properly process at the time we were experiencing whatever felt traumatic enough to be currently imprinted on a cellular level.
As I made more and more research, I started trying different methods and exercises to decrease the amount of anxiety and depression I was experiencing (yes, both at the same time) despite all the path I had already made on therapy. 
It’s currently been over two years ever since my life has changed drastically, but in the most amazing way. Learning how to help my nervous system regulate itself has brought me back to life, and my relationship with my body has changed forever.
Somatic exercises and conscious breathing have helped me move past addictions, trauma and lots of heavy grieving.
There are many things I have learnt in the past 9 years, and among many amazing benefits, I have collected a good set of tools that have helped transform my relationship with myself, my past, my body, my family, and many other things.

34,How to deal with triggers?,"I hate the word 'trigger' because of its overuse and heavy social connotation of people who cannot deal with even small annoyances. But there really isn't a better word to use.

I'm tired of being emotionally triggered by the same things over and over again.

42,Anxiety is a spiral; it causes you psychosomatic symptoms (usually in the form of something the person is prone to worry about); which increases the anxiety due to the presence of symptoms/sensations; which increases the symptoms/sensation; and around you go.,"You don't have to feel ""anxious” either for these symptoms to arise. Anxiety is a disorder that can come in many shapes and sizes, the symptoms and intensities will vary. However, the most commonly associated sensation is ""uncontrollable worrying"" and ""distress"", but a lot of people get the wrong idea that this means a conscious sensation. 
  
Anxiety (and related conditions) usually manifest themselves sub-consciously and cause bodily symptoms, e.g: breathing difficulties; chest discomfort/pain (that can mimic the sensation you'd expect from heart failure); numbness (static) sensation in the extremities (hands/feet); and dizziness/light-headedness/confusion.
  
I've explained anxiety and panic related conditions to a lot of people over the years, and the most frequent symptom (or sensation) people report is psychosomatic (somatic conditions being ruled out by medical tests) symptoms relating to their worry/distress, e.g: chest pain (which is arguably the most common symptom due to a fear of a heart related condition).
  
When you experience the symptoms/sensations: try inhaling slowly and fully (fill your lungs) through your nose, exhaling slowly and completely (empty your lungs) through your mouth, repeat 7-8 times. This breathing technique usually helps you calm down and can alleviate anxiety and a range of other psychological and emotional conditions (it will require some practice).

44,Tips for getting out of the freeze response/dissociation,"

hi guys! i'm a 24 y/o student and i have been diagnosed with ocd. we are still debating what my second diagnosis is since i recently changed therapists. 

i'm cureently on meds and that's working great, it has helped me a lot so far, but one thing i seem to be struggling most with is VERY frequent freezes and moments of deep dissociation, as well as nervous overwhelms. 
this stops me from executing my everyday tasks (despite my immense motivation and wish to do them) and while i have communicated this to my current and past therapists, i haven't found something that works yet

so far i've tried many things, from meditating to body scans, somatic movement, moving/walking, touching cold stuff, writing (i have unfortunately developed hypergraphia due to my condition), listening to agressive music/earplugs to 'silence out' the world and my brain, telling myself positive affirmations (they seem to work only for a couple of days and then my brain kinda resets n i gotta find smth new that sticks), and really it's an everyday battle of trying to find something that will work more quickly and longterm. 

currently i've been hyperfixated to find a solution cuz i have a bunch of projects coming up and i'm running out of ideas, and wasting even more time thinking about solutions and looking for them.

45,therapists should not list ptsd and its suggested modalities if they dont use those modalities routinely,"
Im so sick of “trauma informed” specialists or therapist who specify they work with people who have ptsd who also list therapy modalities that are designed to treat ptsd when it just turns out to be general talk therapy. It should not be this hard to find a therapist who treats ptsd takes my insurance/ isnt insanely expensive and actually specializes in trauma. The amount of times Ive been told “i dont think were a good fit/ i dont think i have the expertise to treat your extensive trauma history.” SO WHY ARE YOU ADVERTISING  YOURSELF AS A TRAUMA THERAPIST. Its pretty common knowledge that traditional talk therapy about traumatic events can re-traumatize you. If you do not routinely use somatic/ ptsd related modalities just dont list ptsd as something you treat.also therapist should be more honest in intro sessions about how they run their sessions and what level or experience they have in your diagnoses I understand wanting clients but it just seems unethical to say you use those modalities or treat ptsd and then the sessions just turn out to be vent about your trauma or your trauma responses abd theyll say “that sucks” or “you dont deserve that”. it just sucks going therapist to therapist and many of them i feel like i have a deeper understanding of trauma responses than they do just from my own research",1707669767.0,False,1,0,sombody_el-se,None,1aoc8tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1aoc8tl/therapists_should_not_list_ptsd_and_its_suggested/

48,Wellness Retreat for Senior,"My grandfather is 86 and has been fighting MDD and GAD most of his life. He is having another depressive episode, and honestly his doctors don’t care about him. He’s in his second round of ECT. He’s been in therapy before for years, but my sense is he needs some retreat style interventions to do some deep inner child work. 

I’m pretty convinced that the origin of his mental health struggles are just straight up childhood trauma rooted in the body, and talk therapy isn’t going to touch it. He’s been on loads of medications for over 60 years and none of them work.

 If I could design the perfect environment for him, it would be:
2-4 weeks of intensive emotional healing work- somatic work, energetic work, IPF stuff, Internal Family Systems. There would be a medical staff to help him since he does need some medical support.

 I also think he would majorly benefit from psychedelic therapy with a talented guide, but that’s a little more out there, and yet frankly there’s not much to lose- nothing works anyways, and he’s spent almost none of his life actually living- he’s not actively suicidal but he wants to be free of painful feelings, of course, and so he’s stuck. 

Does anyone know of some kind of retreat/program that could handle an elderly man who really needs deep transformational support? I think he would be willing to try anything at this point, and deep down he wants to really live, I know it. He might as well have the chance with the time he has left. 

I’m probably not fully articulating just how much he’s tried- but anything in the medical model, consider it tried. ",1709365562.0,False,1,0,renaissance-maker,None,1b4iu7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1b4iu7i/wellness_retreat_for_senior/
49,PTSD and light xanax addiction,"Hi! I've been using xanax on and off for 5 years now, I started self-medicating while quitting anti-depressants, I had almost unlimited access to this shit at the time bc my ex gf was prescribed this for continuous use but never took the med. When we broke up I still had a huge stock of pills and kept taking it, and I still take xanax, with an occasional prescription now, using like a box every 3 months. It's a kind of controlled use even if quite over what is advised but i don't think it's very healthy on the long run and I relapse everytime I consider quitting. Idk like life is really tough lol. I tend to somatize when I'm stressed out, my muscles get tensed, I get headaches, my jaw tends to clench... I'm in a sort of precarious situation in my life, I have a degree but can't really find a skilled job, can't afford therapy, while it looks like what I actually need to stop worrying and work on passed traumas. I tried a few free therapists in public centers but they either are very reactionary and don't treat me well bc I am transgender (yeah I do have a lot of complex issues lol) and they typically offer 30mn sessions with no direction which is definitely not enough to work in depth.

52,Quetiapine tappering and manic state resurgence risk,"Hi,

For the past 6 months I've been on Quetiapine for what was a psychotic episode, induced by a hellish amount of stress and benzos withrawal, which also seemed to have activated some sort of bipolarity. I started with 300 mg and 2 months ago I agreed with my doctor to take me off it. His schedule was: 150 for 1 month, 50 for 1 month, 25 mg for 1-2 weekes and then cold turkey for 1 month till my next appointment, to see how I feel. I'm now in the 25 mg phase.

I hade no negative effects from quetiapine, except some weight gain and a few eyesight issues. It helped me go over that phase, clear my thoughts and sleep.

The moment i started to tapper it off, i started to feel more energy, more range of emotions, motivation. And my sex drive is back! It was basically dead or latent in past 3 years!

At 25 mg everything seems peachy for me now. I never felt so happy, never had so much energy and optimism for my own life. I don't have delusional thoughts, I just feel optimistic about the things i can acomplish now realisticaly in my own life.

I know that Quetiapine blocks dopamine and once you quit it, we become more sensitive, which can be a recipe for manic episode.

The way I feel now is pretty new to me. My whole life I've felt in a damn hole, stuck, unmotivated. And out of the sudded I'm hit will all this energy. I use it to workout, write, plan, work on my career and finances. I'm also trying to wind down by relaxing, meditating, somatic therapy and yoga, which help. I'm vaping a bit too much (with nicotine), i drink coffee almost daily, which i should probably quit, since both are excitants. Manged so far to quit sugar.

So my question, from your own personal experience. What the hell is happening? Is it Mania? Is it a healthy way of being? Any advice?

54,Benzodiazepine advice?,"I have had debilitating somatic anxiety for 15 years (I’m 23 now) it started out when I was a child and I would feel nauseous, then in my teens, after two friends passed in one week, developed somatically and I would experience chronic stomach pain; multiple times daily I would have flare ups so bad I’d have to call ambulances, so I was eventually put on tramadol daily. I was on 6 tramadol a day for 5 months, but managed to come off them by myself. 

At the beginning of last year I started smoking cannabis for reprieve and it worked super well, until I was smoking all day everyday and costing me hundreds per week. After this I had a psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with severe ADHD and moderate autism, which wasn’t a surprise as my half siblings and our father has them both too.
Ritalin has worked fabulously without any negative side effects.

My anxiety was still terrible and rapidly declining, so the psychiatrist put me on 2.5mg of clonazepam 2x daily, that psychiatrist ended up ghosting me so I ended up having to go through the public system and they’ve switched me onto the equivalent dosage of diazepam. So I have been on a relatively high dose of benzodiazepines twice a day for almost a year. 
My mental health is rapidly declining and the psychiatrist keeps giving me different meds for my anxiety and major depressive disorder, but I can’t help but feel as though the benzodiazepines are causing my excess anxiety and depression; due to the fact that they stop working after a while and then you need higher doses.  

My team don’t want me to come off the diazepam yet as I’m not in a good mental state, but I just can’t help but think that the benzos are causing majority of the issues.

Do you have any experience or knowledge with this? 
I take two diazepam pills day and night and without telling them I have started to take 1 & 3/4 tablets at night instead of 2 tablets, because I feel like I might not need all of these excess meds if I wasn’t on them. 
I’m on day 3 and can’t tell a difference (yet)

- medications such as Prozac, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Lamictal, two MAOinhibitors at high doses, some adhd related meds, and more
- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (three rounds)
- Mindfulness, Zen, guided, group, and Transcendental meditation
- exposure therapy in the hopes that I gradually feel more comfortable around large groups of strangers
- blood tests for possible thyroid problems
- diet and exercise regimen in a vain attempt to transform into more of an upbeat go-getter
- journaling
- Landmark forum
- psychics and astrologers
- people’s advice to “just relax, be happy, go easy on yourself, might as well enjoy the only life you get”

61,"Need advice on understanding these symptoms and if anyone could relate, please help","I'm a 31-year-old male, and back when I was 25, I moved abroad. That period was marked by intense loneliness and a long-distance relationship with my then-girlfriend, leading to a very stressful year for me. It was my first relationship, and it lasted the entire year of 2018, during which I isolated myself and had little to no social interactions outside of this relationship. Most of the time was spent in my room hardly going outside. Our communication was fraught with arguments, exacerbating my pre-existing OCD symptoms, which became extremely pronounced with numerous rituals centered around our relationship dynamics.  
  
In early 2018, I started noticing unusual symptoms that puzzled me initially and led to receiving strange, often disgusted looks from people in public. It took me a while to realize these were due to involuntary movements of my head and eyes when I was in places like restaurants, buses, and libraries. Efforts to control these movements only made them more pronounced, attracting more attention and causing significant anxiety. I never had anything like this before in my life.  
  
After several months, I saw a neurologist who prescribed sertraline. The medication brought immediate relief after 30 mins of taking it, feeling as though I had regained my sense of awareness, though we needed to periodically increase the dose as symptoms would recur.  
  
Several years on, the severe symptoms have subsided, but I still face challenges:  
  
1. Involuntary eye movements in social settings or meetings.  
2. These symptoms are particularly triggered by lack of sleep.

3. When I a having some personal stress/problem./issue symptoms reappear. 

4. Whenever i have to appear in public setting, symptoms reappear

5. When I see someone noticing me, again awareness loss starts happening.  
6. Alcohol seems to reduce/eliminate these symptoms, while caffeine worsens them.  
7. The symptoms involve brief moments of disconnection from my surroundings, a significant change from my pre-2019 confident, and social self. I never had any such symptoms or anything close to it before 2019.

  
Despite these challenges, my neurologist suggests an anxiety disorder, which doesn't fully explain the tic-like symptoms I've experienced. I'm reaching out for insights or advice from anyone who might have experienced something similar or knows what this could be. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I have researched on ayurveda, somatic exercises, yoga, exercises, could any of this help?

62,"Need help on finding resources for friend with ""school-anxiety""","hello everyone, will be making a short summarized post   
a friend of mine (who i'll name X for anonymity) seems to have an awfully dreadful time with school. the gist of it is that they constantly feel the need to work / study, and if they do anything else they start feeling awfully guilty. X confessed that they worry immensely about failing and fear disappointing themselves, so they don't make time for anything else like a hobby for themselves, and studies consume X.  
i was looking into different ""research-backed"" therapies and ways to deal and cope with anxiety in general, by googling it and looking up on those subreddits. i want to do this to help guide them towards a therapist who could help them with it, and give them resources on understanding how one type of therapy could help them.   
from my research, I have noted down talk-therapy, EMDR, CBT and its offsets, ACT, DBT (being an offset of CBT), exposure therapy and somatic therapy. i've also noted down a few notes from my little research ; they have to \*decide\* they want to get better was a big one.  
my feelings are that the best ones for X could be a mix of, by order, DBT to help ground things and have a way to reduce harm and stress. then, CBT to deal with the source itself. exposure therapy seemed interesting but mainly because of my lack of knowledge on it i'm (ironically) a bit scared by it. if the source of the way of thinking of it was trauma-related, maybe EMDR would be needed. then, of course have some additional support by way of being with friends, mindfulness, ways to cope like breathing exercices, etc...

63,Looking for Mental Health Resources,"I am clinically diagnosed with the following mental illnesses: bipolar mania and depression; general anxiety disorder; anti-social personality disorder; and I have suffered severe trauma.

I have also suffered through the following experiences: passive and active suicidal ideation; hallucinations; self-harm; and I have been hospitalized at a mental health facility twice.

I have a great support team, which took many years to acquire: a loving wife and family; a great therapist; a psychiatrist; and a general practitioner to connect me to the strict biological side of things.

I am ultimately my best advocate. I read constantly on all areas of life, have a college education, and have acquired many different coping techniques and skills through my studies and through trial-and-error.

In keeping with the r/mentalhealth rules, I am not asking for direct medical advice. But where I really need to up my game is in keeping updated with the latest neurological, psychological, psychiatric, and somatic literature. I have enormous resilience, and am a strong auto-didactic: essentially, I am prepared to do whatever it takes to be the best person I can for the sake of myself and my family.

Please let me know of any and every reliable books, academic journals, and web resources that would pertain to my condition. I am also into alternative forms of medicine--Eastern forms of medicine, avant-garde and experimental techniques, etc--so I would be willing to accept advice in these areas as well.

67,"Many diagnosis, but none matches...","Hi,

I got a lot of diagnoses from different therapists: depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, somatic symptoms disorder, BPD, PTSD.

But my main problem is not a symptom of any of them. I am having a lot of moments that last about 2 to 3 hours, sometimes more, sometimes less, where I feel overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and anxiety. It happens twice a day to twice a week. Physical symptoms are: freezing, nauseous, tingle on the whole body, tension, and flat breathing. Often, I end it by going to sleep.

My thoughts in these moments are: ""I am a helpless case. I will never be okay. I will never get rid of these feelings. It will ruin my life. I will not be able to go to this meeting when feeling like this. I will lose all my friends. Nobody can help me. My friend will leave me. I will lose my job. I will constantly feel so bad that i will lose more weight and starve to death. My only option is to commit suicide."" 
I do not have memory's to traumatic moments in my childhood. Therefore, I do not think it is some PTSD flashback.
I am not at all afraid to die in these moments, I think I would be a relief if I would, and it lasts way more than a few minutes. Therefore, I do not think it is some sort of panic disorder.

Today I decided to finally put my two weeks in/resign over text. Before I do that, I wanted to solve something within myself.

I was stuck in my room all day facing a screen talking to people online and honestly I hated it. Once I got my job, it gave me some purpose in my life.

75,Trying to find the name of my condition,"All right, I am suffering from some kind of weird condition where my body is able to fake allergic reactions, muscle injury and all kinds of other weird stuff. Because of this, I never know whether I am actually sick/suffering from something. This is infuriating.

It will usually start out with some kind of weird pain. If the pain persists, I will then try to find out what is causing it. However, and this is where it gets interesting: The pain is real, but the pain doesn't always make sense. In other words, it is sometimes faked by my body. For instance: Headaches when touching certain materials (allergic reaction) but no rashes, nor any positive allergy tests for that material. Or immediate reactions (within 0,00001 seconds of touching the material). Like, immediate headache. Even thinking of touching the material will cause symptoms to appear.

My body has already fooled me once. I was suffering from RSI for at least six months. I went like, wait a minute, I've already rested for 3 months and the pain is still here. This is nonsense. And so I ignored the pain. Eventually the pain went away. BUT, this isn't always the case. Sometimes, I am actually suffering from something real. I was well on my way to severely injuring my tendons (weightlifting) This time around, my body wasn't faking it. This sucks, because I can't trust my body.

I don't want pity points. I just want to know where to look. I've looked at stuff like hypochondria, somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder etc. but they all don't really seem to 'fit' the bill.

Of course, only a doctor/psychologist/psychiatrist will be able to provide a diagnosis. But I'm not looking for a diagnosis. I am looking for a lead. Cuz this is some weird shit.

76,I don’t want this. I feel so defeated.,"Okey, this gonna be way too long but... I’m so sick and tired of having everything and nothing. I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was 19 after one long year of a lot of hospital stays and tests. They initially thought it was “just” psychogenic seizures since my dad have bipolar and my uncle have schizophrenia and we have a ton of psychiatric and psychosis disorders in my family. But they found out I have both epilepsy and functional seizures as it’s called. A couple of years later I got diagnosed with bipolar 1. I went through years of being very unstable, both with manic psychosis and depressive psychosis. Then they figured that all my issues couldn’t “just” be explained with bipolar so they gave me bpd as well. The results from my SCID evaluation also said I have tendencies to schizoid, schizotypal, obsessive-compulsive and dependent. Tho the people who assessed me the last time explained both bpd and the schizo-types giving results because of my bipolar. And they said that overall everything was a result of me being institutionalised and the way that I behave and communicate is a result of that, that it works fine in an institution, but not so well in the “real world”. This behaviour can also be explained by autism, so I’m getting assessed for that. I also have ocd tendencies (which I’ve had since early childhood along with depression and psychotic-like symptoms). I also struggle a lot with anxiety and insomnia.. which ofc makes everything else worse. I’ve been on a lot of meds and I always get the bad side effects so I either have to stop taking them and try something new or just “suffer” for a while. I also need high doses for them to work so they really sedate me when I get really sick. And because of my epilepsy things can get really dangerous when I get too mentally unstable. As I said the meds gives me bad side effects and also being mentally ill can give you psycho-somatic issues. The issue is that I get thrown between all the doctors and “departments”. The people who think I’m “just” bipolar blames everything on that. The ones who think I’ve only got bpd blames that. The psychiatrists sends me to somatic doctors because they’re afraid I’m physically ill and vice versa. 

But, lately I’ve lost a lot of weight and have no appetite. Been really nauseous and vomited a lot. I myself initially thought it might be the new medication I had started. After a while I became a bit worried, but my psychiatrist told me not to bring it to my gp since it would only complicate things and it probably was caused by meds and anxiety. The last 3 weeks I started developing a lot of bruises and I decided to go to my gp after all. He took a lot of tests and was a bit worried. They called my neurologist who is the kindest person, she called me back, concerned, and told me the issues couldn’t be explained by meds, but she would call me every week to keep a track on everything. Today I got a message from my gp saying he already referred me to the hospital to a specialist on blood disorders. I’m a bit concerned ofc, but trying to not overthink it. Even tho my arms were fine two days ago and now they’re covered in bruises and they ache. I weigh as little as I did when I was about 17 years old, I’m 27 soon 28 now. I have no energy due to not getting the proper nutrients, probably. I also have epilepsy as mentioned and my gp told me to be very aware of head injuries (I’ve stitched my head together four times the last three years and that’s only a few of the times I’ve hit it, just to get an idea of how easy it is for me to avoid injuries).

Well, I guess my point is that I’m so sick and tired of hearing one thing from one doctor and another thing from another doctor. Or nurse or psychologist.. At this point I really don’t care what I have as long as I know what and that I know how to preferably treat it. I also hate that I’m gaslighting myself in the sense of imposter syndrome and thinking I overreact or something. And that all of the things all these healthcare professionals say are churning around in my mind. I try so hard to be “good”, get better, be “enough”. The psychiatrist making me feel bad for being physically ill and the other doctors for being mentally ill. Always hearing the “you’re a hard nut to crack” or “this is a difficult case”, “never seen anything like it”, “don’t know what it is or how to treat it”. I want to be okey, get the degree in programming I really want, get a job, maybe a family. I use this platform mainly to get a grip on the things that might or might not be the issue so I can learn and get well or better at least. But I just feel so defeated now. Especially since I no longer feel the best physically either. I don’t know what I want with this, just needed to get everything out so I don’t explode inside. And this Monday it’s five years since my best friend died, I want her back so badly. She would make everything okey.

77,I’m only 17 and everyday is TORTURE. I feel so close to giving up,"TW: mental health problems 

Hi! I’m 17m and autistic. 

I think I just need a hug or some sort of support? 

Right now I cannot move out of bed, I am fully tensed and feeling unwell because of anxiety. I’m used to this, I’ve always had this, and it’s never gotten easier to deal with. Im also in the dredges of a bad depressive episode which is making basic things 1000 times worse.

My family is a dysfunctional mess. Im a child of divorce and have always felt unwanted and not part of anything. 

I’ll be honest, right now it feels like my world is falling apart. I’m losing my ‘therapist’ (support worker I speak to twice a month) because I’m turning 18 very soon and will transition into adult mental health services (if I’m even lucky). ALL my friends are leaving to go to university at the end of this year, while I’m barely able to leave the house. I haven’t got a job and I’m not in education. I don’t feel like I’m going anywhere, and it is a massive struggle for me to do anything. I know there’s ’no rush’ and I just have to ‘give it time’- but when everyday is hell to get through, that advice feels like a stab to the gut.

I binge eat a lot, and worry that I’ve developed an eating disorder. 

My sleep is erratic and bad- I struggle with insomnia and other sleep issues. 

I also have aches and pains that are really hard to cope with, but the doctors think they are psycho-somatic and it’s taking ages to come to any sort of diagnosis. 

I also struggle with panic disorder- staying in a car or being outside is a battle and a half. I couldn’t even dream of getting on a train or going out for the day.

Right now I feel like I’m in the most uphill of battles. I cannot see myself returning to any sort of normalcy. I hate that I need so much support. I hate that my ‘victories’ are brushing my teeth and getting out of bed, while my friends are travelling the country getting uni interviews and offers. 

On top of that I am obsessively checking the news and terrified for the future.

What can I even do right now? Where do I begin? People tell me to get a therapist, but I’ve been begging and trying for YEARS but there is scarce support where I am. My ASD isn’t supported which is awful for my mental health.

I want to be positive but frankly I feel doomed! My mum and stepdad joked when they found out I was self harming. 

What reason is there to go on? How can things get better when every aspect of my life is so hilariously bad??

79,Options when talk therapy doesn't work,"I hesitate to even post right now - I'm gunna be weening of my ssri (pretty sure it's making things worse at this point -increased misophonia, decreased libidio) and focus a bit more on fitness and meditation. Also got a referral to a psychiatrist again to do an evaluation cuz I'm pretty sure there's some undiagnosed neurodiversity.... so things might get better without/after this post but....

I had a pretty rough childhood/teen/ya life. Victim of verbal abuse and emotional neglect, with just a touch of physical abuse (spanking when young which i know effects the nervous system, a slap up the head once that i recall..) and witness to a lot of verbal and physical abuse...things were just chaotic and unsafe, unsuportive...

And a six year relationship where they were also pretty unsupportive, like I'd complain about work and he'd just say ""thats the job, you took it on..."" and otherwise not really seeming to care about my comfort or standards in the house or what I needed to feel loved ...

Fast forward to now, about three years later, I've done alot of reflection, meditation, journaling, etc and grown alot. But there's still those more deep rooted patterns, lack of confidence, and insecurities that come up sometimes, specially if I'm stressed or pms-ing and my current partner keeps suggesting therapy. 

But the most common type, which is just sitting and talking (i would include cbt and dbt here - i dont need a therapist to tell me a thought is 'catastrophic' or whatever,  i have enough awareness to recognize these on my own and it doesnt really result in long term change for me), hasn't really worked for me and there doesnt seem to be other options where I live and it's expensive regardless, or would probably require I use more pto which I have such a limited amount of ... 

I want to try shrooms, lol...
And maybe bring in some more somatic type things -dancing etc. 

I'm not opposed to professional help I just don't see how it's possible atm and I doubt that it'll help that much.

80,"If you have experienced multiple years of being better, I would love to know that you exist. Need words of encouragement.","I survived an abusive childhood.. my older brother and best friend is a heroin addict of 20 years and is currently homeless. I haven't spoken to him in a year. My mom is trapped living with her abuser. Many of the most stable and supportive members of my family are now dead. I am a yogi, a major proponent of therapy, plant medicine, Journaling, somatic experiencing.. all the things. I am 28 years old and I have been depressed since I was 11. So far in adulthood, I have had two years (about five years apart from each other) where I felt normal and happy. Every other year is a struggle. Every other year, things that I try, which I see other people enjoying and succeeding in, fall apart. I'm not pointing the finger. I know that a lot of it stems from me.. the trauma I have experienced, my avoidant tendencies and my intense sensitivity. 

2021 was a great year for me. I felt like I was finally getting some things figured out, so I took a leap of faith and moved to California, which has always been my dream. It lasted about four months before the friend I moved in with and I had a serious fight and I came crawling home with my tail between my legs.. then I tried to move to Oregon, and I became so tense and full of fear that I got sick. 

I have been in therapy.. I'm self aware. I can tell you they why's of everything. I just want to know If I will ever get better.. if I will ever not be guarding a broken heart. I know it sounds corny, but I've seriously had my heart broken so many times since I was a kid, I can't currently recall what it feels like to be romantic or optimistic about anything. I excel at work, I have healthy friends, I take decent care of myself.. and yet I still feel so desperately lonely and other. I don't dream anymore. I talk myself out of my dreams regularly. I have even found ways to spiritually justify my own self sabotage. It just seems like I will never have the capacity for anything more than the bare minimum. I am so tired of trudging.. and not believing in myself.. of feeling like my spirit is a boundless bird, but I'm being held down with black sludgy oil. Four years ago, i still cried about it.

I had episodes where I would obsess over stuff like climate change, state of the world for a few months. My life was a nightmare during those times. But I always somehow bounced back. But I still would be depressed and anxious without any reason (generalized anxiety disorder). It got so bad in 2022 that I ended up in a psych ward because of severe suicidal thoughts and self harm. 
I was in a relationship for 5 years and he was always there, for good and for bad. He was the absolute best thing that ever happened to me.  He was my biggest support. After I got out of the psych ward, we broke up because of different plans for the future, absolute dealbreakers that were haunting us but we thought we could survive and make agreements. After breakup, I wanted to kill myself (funny, huh? dealbreakers but i didn't want to continue living without him). Ended up in a mental hospital again. I was there for over a month. I moved out of his flat and came back to my hometown. I'm moving to Stockholm in a few days to start new life. But I can't. I just fucking can't. I have such a severe anxiety and I'm in such a big depression I can't even wrap my head around it and use my words to express how much it hurts. I miss him so fucking much.

86,Life Advice for Mental Health and a happier Life,"I wanted to share my knowledge and experience in the hopes it helps someone. Some of which i will write here is result of a lot of time I invested into self improvement over my life. Even if im not that old, 25. You could say i dont do that much besides this for like 6 years, i will work also in this field very soon to support people. If someone has another opinion about some things, thats fine. I dont want to dogmatice something in this post.

I did a lot of emotional/trauma work and many other stuff to be this confident and happy in life as i am now. I recommend most people like 99% actually to do something for their mental health which fits them. It will improve your life quality MASSIVELY even if you think you are fine with your mental health. There are many more ways than a normal therapist for that. I can only encourage to explore some of that of the ones following. Many people didnt have good experiences with standard therapy, but PLS dont think you cant be helped. Most of the time its just the wrong person who escorts you or the wrong method for you.

I name you some that i find very effective and i like: Breathwork when you want to work over your body, also with body - somatic therapy, art therapy, family constellations (my fav it changed my life), a competent shaman if you are very spiritual. Also i can recommend systemic and gestalt therapy.

It must be said that for many people who dont like normal therapy with a lot of talking often get a good experience with body focused therapy. 

Breathwork can be combined very good btw with cold showers (looking at you Wim Hof). Can improve your life massively too. But also there are more intense and trauma focused breathwork workshops like holotropic breathing, i recommend it also for beginners but beware its very intense and be sure that the people who lead it are experienced with trauma reactions (which they normally should)

Please understand that it is not you. Maybe you are doing the wrong kind of therapy. I urge everyone to do some homework if something is not working for you.

91,Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies Have Taken Over My Life,"To give some background I'm in my early 20s and I've never been professionally diagnosed with OCD 
but I strongly suspect I have it. The obsessive compulsive tendencies started in 2016 and have gotten 
progressively worse every year to the point where I can't function anymore. I know the online tests 
aren't very accurate but they all say I have moderate to severe OCD. Also I was diagnosed with ADHD 
at a young age and I believe my difficulties concentrating and making decisions feed into the OCD.

I have a long list of obsessions and ways of thinking that would seem unusual and/or irrational. 
Some of them have become severe enough that I've given them names like the title, vision, and 
number obsession. I won't go into too much detail but the title obsession involves having to re-read 
certain things over and over again, the vision one has to do with an obsession about comparing my 
eyesight with and without correction, and the number obsession involves my avoidance of even numbers. 
All of these have at times made it difficult or impossible to function on a day to day basis and have ruined 
the things I used to enjoy. 

Lately I've been struggling with what I've called the time obsession. It's the most recent and worst one 
I've ever dealt with. Any time I check to see what time it is I have to tie that back to memories of things 
I did in the past around that time. Most of the memories are from five to ten years ago but if I don't 
engage in the thought pattern I end up feeling like I can't ground myself in reality, and made sense of 
what the clock actually means. It causes an anxiety spike and I don't feel like I can continue with whatever 
activity I'm trying to do unless I think back and sometimes even visualize the memories associated. I 
have certain memories tied to almost any time through the day that I must recall. I would say I spend 
around half and hour to an hour per day having to think back to those memories. 

I've been putting some thought into it and I believe the only way to completely recover from my mental 
health issues (especially the OCD) is to gradually change my life around, and start doing several things 
that I'm not doing now. The specific list includes getting out of the house, socializing, regular exercise, 
long term therapy, and possibly going on Adderall again. This is all easier said then done but if there's 
anything that can fix my issues it's not one thing but a bunch of changes made over multiple years. It's 
tough because it feels like I'm so far gone and that I have a huge amount of progress to make to even 
be able to function at a basic level, but things only keep getting worse and there are no other options. 

I'm not sure what the point of this post is but I wanted to rant about things and maybe see if anyone 
can relate to having certain obsessions that have consumed their lives. I struggle with other things but 
these days my obsessive compulsive tendencies mess with my life more than anything else. Thanks for 
taking the time to read this! 

TL;DR - I've never been diagnosed with OCD but I have a bunch of obsessive compulsive tendencies that 
have been taking over my life for years. These include things like an obsession with my eyesight and 
avoidance of certain numbers. The most recent and worst obsession involves having certain memories 
associated with specific times throughout the day, and not being able to spend time on things unless I 
first think back to these memories. If I look at the clock and see it's a certain time I must think back to 
the specific memory I have tied with that time of day, most of which being from five to ten years ago. 
If I don't do this it feels like I can't ground myself in reality and make sense of what the time on the 
clock actually means. I can't engage in pretty much any activity throughout the day unless I first do this, 
and it takes up anywhere from half an hour to an hour per day. I don't have a specific goal with posting 
this, but I just wanted to rant and see if anyone else can relate to having specific obsessions that have 
taken over their lives.",1673894287.0,False,2,2,RandomCanadian001,None,10dnkkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10dnkkr/obsessive_compulsive_tendencies_have_taken_over/

It eventually escalated so much that I couldn't imagine living anymore, I attempted suicide (age 14) and during hospitalization was diagnosed with depression, anxiety adjustement disorder and disharmonic personality developpement. They started perscribing me with benzodiazepines which I started to overuse and ended up in children detoxification unit (age 15). After that I was slowly getting better, I totally recovered from depression (thanks to AD) and almost from ED, but my anxiety is still very bad, I developped panic attacks (age 18) and stayed away from severe forms of addictions, but I am still using kratom everyday (already +- 3 years) and nicotine pouches (I have it in mouth mostly all the time).

Anyway, at one point, I couldn't get any refills. So I got angry because they're life altering meds! To me it was a very serious matter. The doctor was on vacation and didn't add any refills. So... I became even more depressed and quit them all cold turkey.

WORST DECISION OF MY LIFE!!!

So... relapse psychosis. You should look it up and check it out. It can happen to anyone who suddenly stops taking psychological medications. And it's exactly what it sounds like. Psychosis. 

Within that year, I became *TRIGGER WARNING*

Insanely impulively suicidal, paranoid, developed an eating disorder where I lost 50 lbs in a month, delusional, had hallucinations, paranoia and serious suspicions, I wouldn't sleep or slept 15 hours out of the day, increased anxiety, cognitive inefficiency and incapability, hostility, somatic symptoms, delusions, thought disorder, inappropriate behavior and increased depression. 

I am STILL suffering the consequences from the year I ruined my life, 4 years later. What sucks is that everyone thought I just randomly flew off the handle and didn't give a crap anymore. They thought it was ME!!! They had absolutely no clue that something was very wrong. I was being the polar opposite of what I usually am. And no one suspected. 

Moral of the story: PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT TAKE YOURSELF OFF MEDS. You could ruin your life.

97,don’t want to ruin my relationship with my mother but I feel stuck,"After a lot of growing and self discovery, I have now become too self aware and try to intellectualise all my feelings. I’m pretty sure I’m aware of the root cause of my mental health issues, but don’t want my mother to feel guilty, yet I feel I need more understanding. 

I’m in my early 20’s, am living on the other side of the world from my family, and have struggled with mental health since early adolescence. I have been to therapy lots throughout my life, and 2 years ago I finally  found a therapist who is really actually helping, who I am now currently doing somatic therapy with.

Throughout my teenage years I was extremely depressed, s*icidal with one serious attempt, and I was always confused as to why, as I had what I deemed as a perfect childhood, loving parents, stable home, nothing eventful. Yet I have also always been incredibly anxious, being hypervigilent of other peoples emotions and thinking everyone hates me. 

My current state now is I am pretty healed from my depression, but that anxiety is still there badly and it’s affecting my life. I only recently learned about attachment styles, and definitely fit the anxious attachment style to a t. 

The only thing that I feel that makes sense that could have caused this all, is that my mother had postpartum depression, and was very depressed until I was about 7 and finally got help. I wasn’t aware of this until I was older, has only ever been brought up a couple times many years ago. I’ve had a few therapists who have said they believe this is the root cause for my issues, but I didn’t fully understand it until now, especially after doing a lot of my own research. One therapist did bring my mum to a session many years ago and brought it up yet she got very defensive and I didn’t see that particular therapist again. 
She didn’t have the depression after my older sibling was born, and they have had no mental health problems. 

My mum and I are super close, we tell each other everything. She is so loving and supporting, she offered to pay for my therapy as I had stopped seeing him a while back as I couldn’t afford it, so I’ve finally started going again. I’ve only had 2 sessions yet she has groaned a bit when sending me the money for it, and implied that I’m seeing him too often, which has been once a fortnight. I don’t know how to feel as I’ve never brought up with her what I know, and it made me feel angry hearing her groan, even though I’m so grateful for her spending the money. I don’t believe I would have had these mental health issues if it wasn’t for her.

98,I got diagnosed today.,"After meeting with a psychologist and psychiatrist, I was told I had anxiety and depression. I knew it was coming but being able to hear it felt weird. I've been dealing with what my therapist calls ""psycho somatic"" symptoms? Which I'm still confused about but at least I know what I have. Now my only problem is, after that, my whole head and body have been in the worst pain. A good part is from head pain from my pillow and neck pain, but another is just the continued confusion on why I'm feeling so Shitty and physically horrible. There are days where I'd rather die than feel this type of pain again because I don't know what to do for it. It won't go away no matter how happy I try to make myself. I just want to know how to feel at least a bit better throughout all this or if it's a common side effect of anxiety and depression. I'm just continuing to stay left in the dark, my therapist just tells me that it sucks and that positive talking helps but she doesn't help me, and I just fear I might feel this physical pain again and alone.

99,The things they don't tell you about SSRIs.,"I used to be dependent mentally and physically on benzos (ativan/Valium). The withdrawal lasted about 6 weeks and aside from the high anxiety the only other horrible symptom was constant vertigo/ nausea.

SSRI withdrawal is a fresh slice of hell. WAY WORSE THAN BENZO WITHDRAWAL AFTER YEARS OF USE. I tried to get off Prozac months ago. I ended up in the hospital for suspected appendicitis. They kept me for the weekend. Turns out my appendix is fine and it was simply severe psycho-somatic pain. A dose of Prozac cleared the pain up.

I'm going to try titrating down in January. Long term SSRI use is wrecking me. My circadian rhythm is fucked. My ability to distinguish actual hunger signals from an urge to emotionally eat is fucked. Basically anything that serotonin regulates in my body is fucked up.

101,"My therapist is amazing, but I don’t know if CBT is right for me..","Background: I’m a 31 y/o F, separated (going through a divorce) with a 7 yr old son and currently staying with my parents. Finishing up my senior year of undergraduate studies in SLP, recently applied to grad school

I have mild cerebral palsy and have suffered from social anxiety for as long as I can remember, and have spend much of my life feeling depressed and having low self esteem.

My therapist practices cognitive-behavioral therapy, and it’s great to have someone to talk to who basically gives me unconditional positive regard and makes me feel heard

But I don’t know if this is the right approach to address the issues I face. I find that much of my depression/anxiety is sporadic/random.

Sometimes I’ll feel incredibly down for no apparent reason and she’ll ask me if I can remember having any thoughts or experiencing something that led to me feeling that way, and the truth is I don’t.

Same with my anxiety, there are times where I feel particularly anxious and she asks “what was going through your mind when you started feeling anxious?” So I can challenge the negative thoughts, But I wasn’t really thinking anything.. it’s almost like an automatic/somatic response at this point.

I don’t know if I should continue with this therapist or search for someone different who uses a different approach. But I wouldn’t even know how to politely tell her, I really do enjoy talking to her but I don’t know how much progress I’ve made in the past 2 years when it comes to my depression/anxiety.

102,"I have Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, a rare neurological condition. I want to tell my story.","For years I've tried to ignore and lock away my belief that I'm something akin to the plaything of a malevolent otherworldly entity that's able to reshape and distort my sense of reality. This notion, as seemingly bat-shit crazy as it is, was the only way I could seem to justify to myself, or at least attempt to quantify these incredibly terrifying episodic experiences that I will shortly get into explaining.

Until very recently I have always thought that this *kind* of experience was unique to me. It isn't something I've never been vocal about or kept to myself, it's just that the truly alien nature of what actually happens during an episode is, without some objective reference, impossible to properly unpack and understand, let alone verbalize cogently. So my attempts at describing it have invariably been met with confused looks, shrugs, and *shot in the dark* attempts from others (doctors, mental health assessors, psychologists, psychiatrists, siblings, family, friends) at what I'm trying to explain to them. Oft misdiagnosed as panic attacks, or the colloquial vagueness *""waking nightmares"",* or some other panic/anxiety centric label, too often focusing on the physiological, outward behavior I exhibit when an episode hits, (re: pace about terror stricken making frightened noises, hyperventilating), and not the inward subjective, qualia-centric level of ontological experience where the seat, seed and sustenance of such terror resides.

Apparently, what I have actually suffered from since around the age of 6, isn't the periodic, mischievous machinations of some extra planar malevolence, but infact a rare and particularly unknown brain disorder quite peculiarly named *Alice in Wonderland Syndrome.* I have problems with this name, it tends to lean to a presumption of this condition having some positive aesthetic to it. **It doesn't**. When it happens it is without fail an overwhelming and existentially terrifying experience. A more apt name may be something like *infinite hieronymus bosch space-time nightmare syndrome.* It comes closer to the nature of the thing, at least.

I will be describing these experiences through the lense of my childhood, when the vast majority of these episodes occurred, and also more generally and descriptively. So, where to begin...

When an episode hits, it starts, I suppose for me, in the somatic domain. Edges of things become too *thin*. Say as you're sitting, you can feel your clothes, maybe the slightly higher pressure on your arm at the edge of an arm rest as it lays on it at an angle. All the little bits of the world around you that are pushing into your skin in some manner. My perception of those *bits* becomes heightened as they shift into something *thinner and harder,* as though all those pieces exist on the tip of a single pin, or along a really thin wire. This then spreads across my whole somatic sense where any part of my touch I focus on seems to exist at a single infinitely small point, there is a very discomforting almost electrical graininess to everything. Like running something very small between your fingers, except that tiny point encompasses everything. My body feels tense, like an anxious rigidity, only while this happens I can touch and see things and I know they're normal. It's just that everything *feels* as though it's all a single point, and that point is infinitely big. The initial wave of panic hits.

As this occurs, time *goes awol.* Everything becomes manically fast while paradoxically feeling like there's an infinite amount of time between each moment of existence. Every *tick* of reality is an eternity, and each tick is crashing at light speed into the next. This is a terrifying experience. It's too much, it's too overwhelming.

All the while I'm still in bed, I *know* only a few moments have passed, but time has stopped making sense. In this perceptual *mode* It's as though I've already been here for ever, and in each rushing moment that forever is getting infinitely longer. I get up and pace around because I'm panicking. I can tell that I'm moving at a normal pace. But I'm also moving at 500 miles an hour. There's this weird temporal echo to everything, like a *trail* in time, or that things have sort of spread out around themselves temporally. Everything takes both forever to happen while also happening at no time at all. It's really hard to explain this. There's a sense of confusion in *when* things are. everything is now, and now is simultaneously an infinite expanse and crashing forwards in manic procession. All the while a sickening, nauseating terror grips.

Every sound can only be described as *on edge.* Every noise is booming and angry, they're too quick. There's a manic chaos to everything, yet an infinite terrifying vastness and stillness. Someone speaks and it sounds like they're about to cry, and angry and terrified all at once. There's a manic urgency, like the world is screaming just behind the curtain of normalcy and it's seeping through into every utterance of sound, coloring it with a palpable desperation. I can *hear* that the sounds are normal, but they're *not. Everything is on helium.* If helium could somehow instill it's essence into sound and voices without manifesting an explicit actualization. The absolute alien absurdity of it all makes me want to throw up, I can't handle it, I want it to stop but each terrifying eternity crashes into the next. By this point less than 3 minutes have passed.

As I'm out of bed pacing around I can see my environment, I notice that I'm the size of a titan and the room is a *vast* expanse. But I'm also tiny, wirelike, and everything is *thin.* Each step of my foot on the ground is like a single raindrop in a torrential river. The floor feels hard and grainy, even though I know it's soft. I can feel my feet are normal, but they're *not*. I'm a stickman walking along a razors edge and a titan crossing an incomprehensible expanse. I look down at my swinging hand and It's a million aeons away. Even though I know it's just right there at the end of my arm. My hand is a single infinitely small point in space, permeated with an electric graininess. The space between my face and my hand is this titanic, curved arm bridging what can only be described as the non-euclidean expanse between those two reference frames. But I know it's just my arm and I'm just in the room. I can *see* that this is true. But the room and I are *wrong;* and distance, and size, and time and proportion has all become extremized out to the peripheries of comprehension. Everything still *looks* normal. But it *isn't.* It's as though the entire perceptual make-up has shifted, where a different mode of comprehension that's all messed up and discombobulated is interpreting what I *know* is just me in a room pacing about for a few minutes.

Inside my mind the manic internal dialogue is as though it's on fast forwards. Every thought is quick and rushing and surrounded by a fumbling, sort of verbal garbling. Like an alien tongue reciting some incomprehensible chant that sits somewhere in the middle distance and comes from nowhere at all. It's like a muffled shouting rambling drone that endlessly cycles.

This *sound* is so signature to the experience. It emerges from the background hum of my consciousness as fluidly as time begins racing and the voice in my head, *my* voice, begins straining inexorably like something terrible is about to happen. The garbling rambling quasi-verbality is the second most predominant indicator that an episode is coming. the first is the somatic warping and the world accelerating.

Sometimes, but not every time, I hallucinate mental imagery, like two giant balls spinning in opposite orbital directions crashing into each other, with each crash sending waves of panic through me.

Everything I have described here appears roughly at once. With the weird thin feeling generally being a trigger and leading edge of an episode, with the garbling sound and sped up pace letting me know a full blown attack is happening. The whole thing subsides as fluidly and rapidly as it emerges. My mind liquidly slips back into a normal pace, the world vertigo sweeps back into proportion, the electrical grainy feeling fades, and my pulsing fear dissolves into a sense of palpable relief as everything fluxes back to place.  


Attacks usually last around 10-15 minutes, but I'm often unsure as to how much time has passed after the fact, until I've settled more and can re-orient myself again properly.

This is what Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is like for me. My younger years were plagued with these panic inducing experiences, especially frequent when I was sick with fever. Though they have tailed off significantly over the years where they hardly ever occur any more.  


&#x200B;

If anyone else is out there that has experienced these kinds of attack, and, like me, could never get any answers about just what the fuck was going on with you. I want you to understand that you're not alone. I've been there too. I know *that uniquely potent fear.* And there is a name for what happens to us. We're not just crazy.

I felt I needed to share that, for educational purposes and I suppose to get it off my chest now that I'm going through a real road of discovery and healing having finally *named the beast* after 25 years of having this dark and confusing question mark over my head.

It's definitely a very unusual condition. Which is why it's taken me so long to actually even begin to know how to get answers for exactly what happens. And I'm so massively relieved that I've been able to do that. It's been an absolute game changer for me.

I tried believing after I did not believe. ironic set up or what, SSI? I believed in other people's love and my belonging with loving people, which was stupid because I was the retard. my ""soul"" is dust.

(here is the additional details that I figured afterwards - psych wards seem like scams sometimes, in my opinion though.)

vampire = obsessive compulsive disorder which stems from worrying too much in order to avoid worrying too much. maybe dementia is obsessive compulsive disorder and depression? depression stems from a source of worry which causes hopelessness, which is miserable. stop worrying and relax in order to learn how to move forward with living life reasonably, which is responsible and comfortable, which is relatable. no more people trapped in psych wards, please? psychopathy is from compulsively not caring in order to avoid having to empathize with other people. borderline personality disorder is like before bipolar which is before schizophrenia which is before personality split. dementia=alzheimer's, which is loss of identity from worrying too much. paranoia stems from nervousness of other people, which usually stems from worry caused by other people. crazy people affect crazy people the worst because it is a cycle of grieving about not being tolerated and then listened to which leads to actual cynicism and then actual apathy which leads to shutting down by shutting out the world. the somatism for opening up again is comfort and self derived motivation learning how to love again by enjoying living life by experiencing less misery endured by other people. sociopathy just needs alone time or is afraid of other people which causes avoiding other people. why can't I think that I am special? because I have been treated like I am not worth anything by other people which caused me to have myself - I just want some comfort in my life until I move on with my life and away from the past's bullshit, which is why I am too polite sometimes, because I am afraid of what other people think of me because I feel like I am on trial or something, which is usually the somatism for psychopathy.

108,In need of unbiased advice. Should i go back to my meds?,"*This is going to be a long post because i want to be as clear as possible, so sorry in advance but i really need help & guidance.  Also, throwaway because irl people follow my main.*

I'm a 34 years old female and I've been struggling with my mental health, from a very young age. I'm also a domestic abuse survivor and i have experienced multiple traumas in my life. I've seen 3 different psychiatrists the last 5 years (and a couple of psychologists), and I've been misdiagnosed on some aspects, so I'm going to only list the ones that i received from the doctor I've been seeing the last 2-3 years, and that i also believe to be correct, if i can say so my self.

* Generalized Anxiety Disorder
* Somatic Symptom Disorder (ex somatoform disorder)
* Health Anxiety 
* Mild case of OCD, all health related
* C-PTSD (mostly under control now)
* Panic Disorder (i have developed enough coping mechanisms by now, somewhat controlled)
* Depression, i guess situational is the correct term, according to most doctors, my extreme anxiety is causing it

I was on Fluoxetine 40mg for almost 3 years and i can honestly say i saw a big difference. Most of my somatic symptoms either disappeared or didn't occur as often, my c-PTSD related problems stopped (nightmares, flashbacks, freezes etc) and i was doing much better. My anxiety/health anxiety were still there, but weren't controlling my life and i could tell my self I'm being silly half of the time.  These were not ""cured"" by any means, but i feel like the medication helped me pay less attention to my intrusive thoughts, and go about my day.

3 months ago, my psychiatrist suggested i get off of my medication. I was doing good, i had an extremely bad year where everything that could go wrong went wrong, but i somehow dealt with it just fine. The possibility of me getting pregnant was the main reason he suggested that, because in his opinion is best if I'm not on medications if I'm trying to conceive. The first month was OK-ish, i had some brain zaps and brain fog and a bit of depression,  i mostly dealt with it by knitting all day and self medicating a bit with alcohol (a couple of beers to relax). 

And then, everything came back and hit me like a ton of bricks. All my health anxiety and imaginary symptoms of freaky diseases that probably half of them don't even exist, feeling like my guts are tied in a knot 24/7, sweating, hyperventilating, having pains all over, you know how it goes...

Told my self I'm strong and i can fight it, but 2 months later it's getting worse and worse every day. Isolation doesn't help either.  I'm not even thinking about a baby anymore, because i know I'm not doing OK. I booked an appointment with my doctor next week. Since we kind of developed a friendship by now (*which I'm not sure if it helped in the long run*) i know he's going to ask me **what i want to do**? Should i go back to meds? And if i do, does it even work for my anxiety/health anxiety? I'm a control freak and my brain tells me i need to research every medication available and suggest the best one to him to give me, because ***google and my hypochondria know better****... (making light of it, because I'm embarrassed)*    
Am i a failure if i go back to meds? Will i ever feel ""normal"" again? I'm experiencing extreme self loathing lately, so I'm sorry for venting. I try not to bother anyone in my life and keep things to my self, i figured they're all sick of me talking about my issues by now.. So, I'm very much sorry for blowing up steam in here.

109,"Can you have temporary neurotic behaviors during stressful times, but not be considered a neurotic personality type over all? I’m usually an optimist.","Background: Last year was a hot ass mess. I lost my job and gf. This caused me to be very anxious and depressed and not perform well. I had a new job at stretch zone within 2 weeks, but couldn’t sleep bc my heart was so broken. I showed up late to training (HQ was 50 miles away) I could not sleep, missed key information, and failed the entrance exam. I had put off a nicer job interview as a tech at a chairopractor. The 1st interview went great, but I had to postpone the 2nd bc I had committed to Stretch Zone’s week-long training. Thought Stretch zone would be my weekend gig.  The chairo lmk they chose someone else the day before my exam. I was so upset. I had a melt down. 

The next couple of months my body was stuck in fight or flight and I could not find my peace. I was neurotic to a T, not myself. 

Now, the boss that initially fired me got terminated, and the old job offered me my position back. I got a better job tutoring and my college, and got a good roll working as a baby adjunct in a Chem lab, so I get to help students with their experiments and get good mentorship experience. I am transferring to a Florida Atlantic’s honors campus and am majoring in neuro. My End goal is neuro PT, and I’m writing my bachelor thesis on somatic therapy techniques. This is way better than my old desk job and I’m so grateful to be in such a better place this year! 

My friends would say what they love about me is that no matter what happens, I get back up and have a positive perspective on the situation at hand. 

But when I look back at how I acted those past 3 months/year, I cringe. The littlest things would cause my heart to pound  out of my chest, and I was an anxious wreck. I constantly thought everyone was judging me so much that my voice would lock and I would go mute. My vocal chords just felt like they were closed and I couldn’t get a sound out.  I was so self-conscious about other people judging me and in my own head. So so so awkward. I’m usually extroverted. Every scenario I was in my brain would come up with 5 ways it could go wrong, and I was rarely present. 

Since I was a kid and to this present day I do struggle with rumination. But other than that, if there are no big stressors, I’m usually happy go lucky.

112,I can't breathe (Unconscious),"Early in the day, I suffered an anxiety attack due to certain thoughts that I had during the quarantine. I have been diagnosed with some anxiety problems (more than anything, I somatize a lot), in addition to having mild depression. 

However, due to some crises that he had during quarantine, I stop consuming this medication due to a certain fear that he had with the pills (something serious, to tell the truth, because I feel totally normal, but I have certain lows). However, what I am most afraid of right now is that based on that anxiety attack, I cannot breathe unconsciously or mechanically all day. This has brought me quite badly, because every time I try to focus on something else, the feeling of breathing conscious is back in any moment, like an intrusive feeling, and is intensified in such a way that I can't stand being at home not sleeping because I think I could drown. 

I am not sure if this reddit works for this, but I am desperate because I couldn't sleep so well for the same reason, I call a psychologist and a psychiatrist who told me that breathing is controlled until reaching that mechanical form, but I am very stressed and I would like to discuss on this topic :(.

113,My therapist is against Feminism.,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but here goes!

Hey everyone, I started therapy 4 weeks ago and found a therapist that I felt comfortable with as she had the same holistic approach to therapy that I was looking for. (By holistic approach, I mean mind-body integration, somatic exercises, etc.) I don't know if what I was looking for was wrong or if I was even looking for the right things.

I come from a country and a background where I'm not too exposed to mental health and where mental health in itself is viewed as a stigma. I have been to therapy before via online but it has not worked. I also am aware that it is wrong for a therapist to bring their own beliefs and values into the session that can alter the clients view in a negative manner. 

I have been having no issues with my therapist until the last session. We formed a really good connection and I was improving myself in just three sessions. However, in the last session, there was a miscommunication.

We were discussing something and I mentioned how every women out there needs to be financially independent. She misinterpreted me, by assuming that I said that women need to be independent and should not rely on anyone else (the kind where women tell that they can survuve alone in their life with no other social or human connections).

Even though that nothing was wrong with women wanting to be independent, void of wanting any social connections, etc (it's their choice), my therapist said that she was sorry and that there was no way that she could agree with what I said. I was taken aback and she never let me finish my sentences and never let me talk. This has never happened before, before she assumes or concludes something to be the issue, she always doubble-checks with me but this was not the case this time.

She was hellbent on how she believes that humans are interdependent beings and that we need each other and she hates Feminism and all those ideologies. She even said that those things were ""unacceptable"" in her books.  

I had to raise my voice a bit and pause her and told her how I meant that woman should be financially independent and not the other way around on how she misinterpreted it to be. 

She said okay, calmed down and we went forward with the session.  

I was focused on my issues during the session, however afterwards felt very disturbed with my therapist having opposing views and bringing it into the session when it was uncalled for.

My sister is a therapist herself and said that what my therapist did was wrong. My sister also said that I can ask my therapist what happened in the next session and why she was so reactive. 

I'd be lying if I said that I was completely okay with my therapist being non-feminist and that my only issue with her is her bringing her beliefs into the session by not even letting me speak.

I am a feminist and very much so believe in the idea because I've seen millions of women suffer in my country due to the lack of it.

I'm also not sure if I want a therapist that does not have my values. Am I in the wrong for wanting a therapist having similar values?

Also, I read somewhere online and also from a few people who've been to therapy before that some therapists who are extremely religious do tend to have some narrow-minded views (not everyone, there is an exception, of course). Coming from the country I am from, it is very, very true. 

Any thoughts/advise/experiences would be appreciated!

Thank you for reading.

114,Why does my care team tip toe around the diagnosis if (complex) PTSD?,"Didn't know where else to post this. I hope someone can help me.

So I've been getting help about 6 months now. I have a psychiatrist who's great, a counsellor at my Uni's counselling office, and until a few weeks ago a therapist, who bailed on me though. For context, I'm also a psychology student who's pretty far in her studies, so I know my way around the mental health system.

So, I'm actually pretty sure I have complex PTSD. My childhood was, simply put, so horrifying that me telling my therapist about made her speechless, and she's been in the profession for decades. I've nearly died a couple of times, was bullied at school and escaped rape a couple of times. I tick all the boxes for diagnosis criteria. I also take great care to be open to my care team and let them know all the symptoms I notice.

But for some reason, all three of them don't acknowledge the trauma at all. Mostly the therapist, but she bailed. They tell me I have severe MDD and a social phobia, but have difficulty explaining my severe dissocative symptoms, my crazy nightmares or my hypervigilance. I just don't understand. Yes, visual flashbacks are pretty rare for me, but I do have auditive and emotional flashbacks frequently. I also suffer from pretty tough somatization (chronic headaches, autoimmune disease etc.)

116,"Struggling on what to do next. Just got out of a crisis stabilization center. Unsure if I should return to work, etc. ","⚠️Trigger warning: Suicidal ideation, family death


Two days ago I left a crisis stabilization home after voluntarily admitting myself and staying for nine days. I have a lifelong history of severe depression, anxiety, and have been on medications for years. Unfortunately, my meds have not been working, I do not feel like,  anyway. The psychiatrist I have been seeing for more than five years (virtually) has not been very helpful, and her response to my suicidal ideation that has drastically increased in the last year has been to increase the use of my benzo, which I told her I was not a huge fan of with my family history of substance abuse and the cause of my mother's death. I have been extremely stressed/burnt out for months (longer even), get very little sleep, especially good quality, and work the overnight shift. These things were going on before I started the overnight shift unfortunately. I also have fibromyalgia, so am in pain pretty much constantly with little to no relief. 

About three weeks ago, something happened and I had some sort of episode where I became disoriented, was showing signs of psychosis (never have before), and was unable to function. It seemed to me almost like a somatic event of some sort, but I never really found out. My SI was significantly increased and I had to take off work and have not been back. Skipping a few details, I am home now from crisis home and have improve a little bit. A little as far as I am no longer suicidal and crying constantly, I am on somewhat on a sleep schedule, and am eating regular, healthy meals. I am on a new medication that I believe is helping and I am sleeping better. I am also being treated now for bipolar disorder. 

I have a follow up with my PCP tomorrow, but was unable to get an appointment with a [new] psychiatrist until the 7th of March. I have been trying to utilize the skills I learned at the center; they have helped somewhat. I have always struggled to relax, so I have been able to bring myself back to the present moment and meditate, breathe, etc. However,  I do need to think about what I am going to do about returning to work. 

The dilemma with work: I work overnight and drive an hour to get to work. I do not mind the drive since there is no traffic at night. The perks of working this job: 
•I like it. It's in my field I've been in for 15 years.
•Significant pay differential for overnight
•No client interaction. I struggle with compassion fatigue normally. 
•Awesome discount for pets and other perks.

The cons:
•There are no daytime positions available. 
•If I was able to work day shift, the pay cut is drastic and the traffic toward the city is very stressful and probably not worth there & back. 
•The overnight shift is very much affecting my overall health. Despite trying many things, I cannot balance my circadian rhythm. A sleep specialist was unable to help me.
•I rarely see my husband. 
•My main issue of bringing this all up....my new medication is to be taken at night and does help with sleep. I cannot push this 12+ hours each shift to work. It is a mental health medication. I do not have consecutive or consistent days off, so it will be a lot of flipping the medication times on different days; a very gray area. 

My job has already been very understanding and I still have my position, but understandably so, they can't wait forever. 

You may be thinking....just get another damn job? Well, of course I considered this. I am certainly not trying to catastrophize anything, but I am now limited as to jobs I can work due to the Fibromyalgia and in my field, it is hard. I was looking for a job (after leaving one that was too much on my body, and mentally stressful too of course) for six months and I got this one. It felt like it was a true blessing and it is honestly the best job I have ever had. It is the best money I have ever made, I am able to utilize the knowledge I have more than ever, things of that nature. 

We don't have money for me not to work. My husband doesn't make enough and I honestly expect to work anyway. I'm very frustrated with all of this. I fear that the little bit of progress I did make while at the crisis center can easily be reversed and it wouldn't take much to push me back over the edge, which tbh is fucking embarrassing. I have been taking care of others (family, other trauma and crap) for too long and I'm honestly so damn exhausted. 

I apologize for the long post and hope that the details I put in and left out help explain what I am trying to enough. 😮‍💨

117,I’m afraid I know I’m an asshole…,"I think I know the answer. I’m an asshole. 

I left my sibling and parents 35 years ago. Made a new life thousands of miles away, eventually moved a few hundred miles away. I talk to my parents almost every day.  I have a spouse and children.   

The main reason I left was to get away from my sibling.  From the time I was a kid there was a constant theme of “ things are so easy for you, don’t make your brother feel bad because everything is so easy for you….”  Eventually it turned in to him angry and jealous of me because I learned easily, was easily employed, understood how to get along in whatever situation. 

I knew I couldn’t do well in school and have a happy life within a few hundred miles.  

As a child he was sort of manipulative - the kind who would suddenly be ill if my mom was going to see her friends.  He had a learning disability, probably would have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum. By 15 he had a complete psychotic break/ somatization disorder, anxiety depression ? Schizoaffective d/o ? No one has been sure. 

Based on the past few years now , after 35 years of issues, I’m wondering if border line personality was the real answer.  He’s constantly complaining about his body aches and pain. Then the threatens suicide. Then he’s angry at me because I have a job and family. Lots and lots of jealousy and anger towards me.  

All I feel now towards him is anger, not empathy. Years of threatening to kill himself manipulating my parents in their 70s.   I don’t want anything to do with him. I’m too angry at what he has  done to us. 

My parents have done everything to set up a trust fund for him after they are gone.  They are middle class people. They have still managed to provide for him.  

I don’t want anything to do with him. I am so angry at the way he manipulates them. I did everything to get away from him. Now he is thinking that if they can’t  help
Him with whatever he needs - as in they are elderly and actually need his help- they will move to where I live and he will become my ward and responsibility. 
I really do hate him.  Years of nothing but resentment from him, manipulation from him.  Complaining , suicide threats. 
Im burnt out and I don’t even see him or talk to him often.

118,How can I keep my empathy for my mom?,"
I am looking for advice on how to maintain empathy for my mother. As long as I can remember, my mom has been both overtly mentally ill (severe anxiety, and impulse control issues, as well as occasional bouts of semi-suicidal depression and bizarre paranoia) and someone who assumes the physically sick role with gusto via a combination of true hypochondriasis and over-the-top complaining about real, but non-dangerous ailments. She's never been abusive but my childhood was characterized by emotional manipulation and since leaving home 17 years ago I've found I can only get along with her sometimes, though I do love her very much and wish she could be happy. Over the past many years, her overt behavioral issues have become a bit more muted, but in favor of severe somatization. There is always something making her feel sick but never anything obvious to me, my father (a doctor himself) or her doctors despite enormous workups. She constantly has a new symptom to report, and her newest thing is a horrible stomachache triggered by getting in the car to go somewhere, unless she is the one driving. She rarely will do anything fun with my dad or me when I am visiting because of these issues, though she is able to go on long road trips on her own to visit doctors with no problem. She talks about her physical issues nonstop, and wistfully says things like 'if only I could live in [beloved upscale resort town] then I would be well at last.' Though able bodied, she seems to depend on my father for almost everything (like, if my dad is home, she'll call him over to flip a light switch next to her or pour a glass of water) when he's around and most decisions seem dictated by her ailments. If you bring up anything related to illness or death, she becomes dramatically distraught at the idea that she has so little life left, what with her ailments, despite only being diagnosed with minor and typical age related diseases and aches all requiring minimal or no treatment. She's been like this all my life but has worsened so much recently. On one level I know she can't help it and she is suffering from this and likely truly does experience the symptoms she develops via somatization of her mental health issues; but it also seems like if she could magically be free of all 'illness' she would be completely bereft. I am fast losing my ability to maintain my empathy for my mother and find myself mostly just wishing she would get over herself and feeling anger (my favored coping method recently has been chewing on the insides of my cheeks when listening to her) and I know I am often short with her. I've known her long enough to know that she will never change; instead, please tell me how I can change my attitude before my relationship with her goes to hell completely.

119,My fatigue is getting out of hand,"I've had this devastating fatigue for so long. It seriously limits my ability to carry out normal activities such as school and work. It takes me 4-5 hours to even get out of bed. I'm supposed to meet my new doctor (I don't know who it will be) 2 months from now, but this day has made me doubt my ability to hold out until then. I live with my parents and I'm scheduled to travel to Stockholm to do an exam in the beginning of June and, a week after that, fly over to Spain with my parents for a 2-week vacation. This makes me doubt whether it's appropriate for me to take action now, because I feel I'm letting them down if we have to cancel these activities that I've agreed to, but I should probably not take this into consideration now. I'm tired and fed up living with this fatigue. It's also frustrating when there doesn't appear to be a medical condition that can be associated with my fatigue. All reasonable blood tests to test for fatigue, including hypothyroidism and metabolism, haven't shown anything wrong. I'm sure it's not CFS nor POTS either. It seems to be somatic.

120,how can I tell if my friend is lying about delusions?,"For some background on them, I've known my friend (NB18) for almost a year now. we met online through a shared interest of tabletop rpgs and other nerd stuff, and we've talked almost every day since and even met in person about 7 months ago.   
A few months ago they said they fell off a ladder at work, so I told them to go to the doctor. They did a few times and the doctors dismissed it, we both chalked it up to be medical misogyny as they were AFAB.  
A week or so after that, they had just moved for college. They said they passed out, someone called the ambulance, and they had xrays done and were told they'd bruised a lung and were sent back to their dorm and were told to rest.  
Next day they passed out again, this time doctors said their lungs were filling with blood. They stayed in the hospital for a while, about two weeks, for this to be treated. They told me they were experiencing hallucinations throughout and that they'd experienced them before so it was probably just worsened by stress. They were eventually released and struggled with mobility so they had a wheelchair.  
A few days later they were coughing up blood and were hospitalized again. This time it was for almost a month. Their heart kept stopping in their sleep so they didn't get a lot of rest which made hallucinations and delusions worse. I comforted them as much as I could throughout it all and they were eventually released. They got an ICD for the heart issues.

Throughout all this I was extremely stressed. They'd tell me they had a high chance of dying multiple times. I didn't want to lose them. I talked to my therapist about it, my parents, my psychiatrist, and multiple questioned if they were lying to me. There were inconsistencies in the story. With all the issues they told me about they wouldn't be thinking well or communicating well, they'd hardly be alive.  
The day I told my therapist about it she mentioned munchausen. I'd considered the possibility but didn't want to face it, but that night I did.

I was in call with them late at night and I told them people thought they were lying. They began saying things like ""I wish I was lying so this wasn't all happening"" ""Would you believe me if I said I was lying?"" I asked them about the second one, why would they say that.

""I think I've been lying to you""

I was in disbelief and asked why they only ""thought"" they were, why would they lie etc. They then started believing more things were lies when they weren't. I asked if something I knew wasn't a lie was fake, and they said it was.  
We eventually left the call off with me saying I'll support them and their delusions don't make them a bad person.

In the morning we called again. They said they believe the lungs bleeding was real and that that hospital visit was real, and confirmed that the thing they said was fake wasn't and they didn't know why they thought it was. They were still, and ever since have continued to be, confused about the hospital experience and what parts were or weren't real.  
A few days later they asked their roommate about where they've been. The roommate said they'd been at the medical center at the college a lot but not a hospital.

In the past week they've been experiencing episodes of hallucinations and heavy dissociation. Twice now they've gone on a walk and then gotten lost. Today they said someone in the forest threatened them with a knife.

And with all of this, because I'm not there with them, I don't know what they are or aren't lying about. I don't know what is lying and what's a delusion. I've been pushing them towards getting a psychiatrist and therapist but it's hard with their insurance.  
They're an amazing person and I believe they're a danger to themself if what they're saying is true and isn't a munchausen type situation.

I apologize for this being so long or if this isn't the right place to post this, I haven't known where to go to ask for help, my therapist isn't experienced in this realm of stuff and she hasn't been of much help. I just don't know if their delusions are plausible. They have auditory, visual, and somatic hallucinations but I genuinely don't know if it's plausible to be so deluded that you believe you're in a hospital about to die for a month.

122,Disassociation Causing Issues with Therapy,"I'm in this weird spot where I have an amazing therapist but I feel like I'm not getting much out of therapy other than someone to talk to-- but it's not my therapist or my ""fault"".

Admittedly, my therapist has told me I can be hard to therapize because I am an extremely introspective person and often if I have a problem, she will give me a coping strategy only to have us realize I already use it instinctively but I didn't know the name. (Ex ways of logicality talking yourself through emotions, or certain somatic exercises to deal with pain.)

Recently I realized one big reason I'm not getting as much out of therapy as I could be. I disassociate so hard that I literally forget I was ever depressed the moment the episode is over. 

I could only realize this because I just happened to be thinking about this problem during a depressive episode, and thus could remember this is a problem. 

This causes me to have this very bizarre life experience where when I am depressed I feel very much like it's a big problem and that I'm always depressed. Because while depressed I remember the eight other times I've felt this way this week. 

But when I'm not depressed, I feel fine. And I don't remember the last time I was depressed, just a vague notion that it happens once in a while. So I think I'm fine 99% of the time and I don't remember being depressed recently even if it happened earlier that same day.

So if I go to therapy, unless I'm feeling depressed that exact day and hour, I don't talk about my depression because I don't remember it. 

I'm also autistic and if there's a specific topic we've been trying to work on, I feel strongly... compelled to go along with that topic just because it's on the agenda. 

So sometimes I will have a vague thought that I should talk about that one depression episode I had (maybe I got reminded of it somehow) but I don't feel the urgency because of disassociation and I think it's not that important, therefore I go with the other topic instead. 

I want to do better but I literally can't remember and it's so tough. I wrote myself a therapy note now while I'm feeling depressed and hopefully that helps, just feeling like my max level disassociation skill is kicking me in the nads right now.",1634205978.0,False,1,1,noeinan,None,q7wn7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/q7wn7v/disassociation_causing_issues_with_therapy/

\- Agoraphobia

\- Antisocial personality disorder

\- Bipolar

\- Depression

\- Self harm and suicide

124,Self worth therapies & treatments?,"Hi All,

To keep a really complex and convoluted story short, I've found myself in a place where I seem to struggle a lot with self worth, self respect, self trust, conviction, hope and positivity. 

Essentially, I function like a normal 33 year old day to day but feel I'm always just a few sad thoughts away from feeling very, very low. I can only describe it as a feeling of heartbreak over life, or perhaps the idea of who I used to be or thought I was, particularly as an ambitious, creative, opportunistic and emotionally sound (or so I thought) young girl.

I've recently quit my job to try and build something I can be proud of and to be master of my own time freelance, as I've also been feeling strong urges to liberate and express myself, and be proud of myself again. I feel this is my very low self worth crying out for help. 

I've also become aware of a real fear of 'pressure' or performance expectations now, and I often feel overwhelmed.

What are the best therapies to try? I have done CBT it helped me a great deal before, but I feel it left something deeper and still destructive unresolved. I have also had talking therapy before, and am prepared to try this again (I moved a lot and it prematurely ended things a few times) but I've been wondering about other treatments. Hypnotherapy and somatic release are a couple I've heard of but I don't know if they're designed for my type of issues.

I'm also wondering if I should possibly see someone who can help with BPD/EUPD fleas - this is a fear of mine as I spent 8 1/2 years in a relationship with (I'm very sure) an undignosed sufferer of BPD/EUPD and since I left, it's like I've undergone a radical personality change and sometimes I feel like I act more like he did than my true self now. It may just be due to my own sad experiences in the last few years, but it's still a fear.

I don't know if this is possible, but I feel too like my attachment style changed. I would have said I was probably secure or dismissive avoidant for most of my life. Now I would definitely say anxious-preoccupied, especially re men (I'm hetero). Can emotional trauma do this to someone?

I don't know if it's worth mentioning this but I have recently started meditating, and this feels natural, familiar and calming to me. I used to hold space a lot for quiet thought (maybe a natural introvert) and often feel a need for peace and quiet.",1620650924.0,False,1,3,MajoraFeels,None,n93n0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/n93n0q/self_worth_therapies_treatments/
125,Here is what I have done to improve my CPTSD.,"Here is a list of protocol my partner and I have implemented to improve our CPTSD. We are isolated in an area that has a real stigma towards the disabled and LGBTQ+ community, there are no hate crime laws that protect them here, so this adds additional logistical hurdles and terror. There's more anti-LGBT stickers and propaganda popping up around town and this sends a chill down my spine. My partner transitions in secret for this reason.

With the pandemic and so many anti mask/anti vax people around, I am so scared of leaving my house most days. For the last 8 years I've feared for my partner's safety in this town, I feared for our future as people who struggle with CPTSD.

We don't have the in-person social supported needed for re-regulation and we can't receive this until we earn enough to move out of here and relocate in the city where resources and advocacy are better overall.

It is a catch 22, got to heal more to earn more, but got to earn more to heal more. With our struggles with CPTSD we are stuck here for the time being, however at the very least I can share here what has helped us improve as a team.

My partner researches the protocol, she's got a 4 year degree in psychology and compulsively looks up studies and resources to heal these and other issues. I implement what she researches, I'm pretty handy in some ways. Despite the hurdles, improvements have been made.

This is what we've done to improve our CPTSD together.

* Trauma releasing exercises, these are demonstrated on youtube, I could do these even when I was 300lbs so they are feasible. You should give yourself some time to rest, 15-30 minutes at least, after doing them for regulation and integration.
* Polyvagal theory exercises, Sukie Baxter on youtube does content on this. Irene Lion does as well and she has other trauma healing resources too that I use.
* Breathwork, be careful with this one because this can be too activating, but it releases trauma from the body. There's a lot of breathing techniques on youtube. This combined with vinpocetine and canned oxygen for me boosted the effect somewhat.
* Yoga, with my fatigue I struggle to implement this more regularly but yin yoga is recommended.
* Accupressure desensitization, basically you rub, tap, or stimulate accupressure points, namely on the face and hands. This works better if you alternate between the left and right sides of your body.
* Modafinil, this helps push through the fatigue but the generics are less effective on me, this is one of the psychmeds that have manageable side effects for me and the pros outweigh the cons. However I can't sustain taking it everyday due to the side effects on me personally, max I can do is 200mg a week for 6 weeks currently. I add choline and tyrosine to improve the effects. Ashwaganda and rhodiola rosea added to this stack adds a calming effect without sedation for me personally. Modafinil and Armodafinil burns through choline and adding this is ideal so there isn't a deficiency. There's other nootropic stacks and there's subreddits that discuss stacks for different effects but Modafinil is the 80/20 plus choline.
* Internal Family Systems Therapy, there is a subreddit for this. This is a promising therapy modality for CPTSD and it has helped me process many things on my own with just self guided resources. It would be more ideal to have a specialist who can do this, it is similar to Voice Dialog. My partner's therapist does this with her. I've been unable to find a therapist in this for myself.
* Somatic experiencing, this is made by Peter Levine and his resources have been helpful as well. This allows the body to complete the trauma response, allowing it to release it gently.
* Feldenkrais, Irene Lion also goes into this, this can help process trauma from the womb or trauma that isn't remembered.
* Acceptance and Commitment therapy, self guided.
* Ego death meditation, I wouldn't recommend this for someone's first rodeo with mediation but this helps me rinse away unnecessary pain, helps with making clean pain instead of dirty pain, Therapy in a Nutshell on youtube discusses this concept in a few of those clips.
* Nonduality spiritual tapes, this again is more advanced for CPTSD rehab and been listening to ebooks on this, this teaches how to be in the present moment, and to settle into the awareness that is behind the ego. This can give some relief, or at least some perspective but not a good route to go if someone is in the early stages of CPTSD rehab.
* Cathartic meditation method, this is a technique my partner came up with by combining elements of breathwork, somatic experiencing, and dance. She wrote an ebook on it before she started transitioning.
* Urge surfing, this is more in relation to addiction management.
* Dabbled a bit in some qi gong, the five animal frolics act like somatic experiencing.
* Semax, a Russian nootropic that helped me regain some cognitive functioning, but this was too activating for me on its own so I combine it with Selank, a calming nootropic from the same company. They can be combined without issue. This worked for me but I'm not sure how this would work for other people with CPTSD.
* Chasteberry for mood swings related PMS/PMDD, this has been the only thing that helped with this for me and it shaves off the friction around that time a month by 30-50%. Ginko biloba is also recommend for this but I've not had as good of results with it for this issue, but it doesn't hurt.
* tDCS for my drug resistant depression. Had to do a lot of homework and tinkering for this one, but got all the stuff for it for under $200 and this was the only thing that improved my depression with little to no side effects. I would prefer a specialist that does transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) but this is very expensive out of pocket. Both tDCS and TMS need at least a month of daily use in the right locations for it to work. Worst case scenario it doesn't work and no side effects.
* Ice baths and cold showers, this can help the nervous system re-regulate but don't go too much too fast. Even a short rinse in cold water, a couple of seconds, can help. If you want to go full Wim Hof there's subreddits for that and breathwork will be needed.
* Medical cannabis combined with CBD assisted self therapy, in these sessions I load up music that evokes a trauma, or music that evokes a time period or unprocessed sentiment, and I let that surface. The weed softens, not numbs, the experience enough for me to process it, to give it the space it needs, and I've healed a particularly deep trauma from this method. CBG also works out pretty well, mango increases the weed effects and fresh mango works a bit better than dried mango but both work.
* Weight training, building muscle helps with regulation as well as processing and empowerment, I've used low doses of ligandrol and mk 677 to help build a bit extra muscle for a 6 week cycle, the mk 677 helped with sleep when I struggled during the winter over a specific trauma that is now processed. I wouldn't recommend SARMs for other people in general, especially if they have liver issues. I only added them just to get a bit extra muscle for nervous system regulation and resilience.
* Empathy/compassion exercises generally in combination with Medical cannabis and CBD, 1:1 seems best for me personally. With this I visit traumatic moments and I start to dissect the psychology of the abusers in these situations, I do some detective work in my head and piece together how they ended up like that, I trace the trauma thread. This is an advanced technique, I was not able to do this in the beginning years of my recovery. Also this isn't a good tech for everyone, but it helped me see these destructive and hurtful people as broken, because they are. I went from feeling like a victim of malicious intent and design to feeling compassion for what was done to these people to make them into this. Instead of realizing their highest good in life, they were rendered into a broken shadow of that instead with little hope to be much else. This is hell in itself. This doesn't justify the damage they caused, not at all, but it reframes it in a way that allows me personally to process it better and to grow into the kind of person I actually want to be in this life. This all falls into radical acceptance. To be clear, acceptance does not mean agreeing with it, it just means acknowledging and facing reality on reality's terms.
* Gardening, this in general is just therapeutic if I can keep up with it.
* Decarboxylated amanita muscaria, Muscimol is promising for benzo recovery in particular as well as other issues, but decarbing this mushroom with DIY protocols is not something I recommend. There was a canadian pharma company that was refining this, forgot the name or if it was able to launch.
* The Ashton Mehod for benzo recovery, my partner was left on 1mg of Ativan for 5 years and this caused her so many additional problems, this was the only medical intervention she received before I arrived here. This protocol took a year to implement and I've written about this process in an older post if this if anyone's interested. This isn't directly related to CPTSD rehab, more like a pre-requiste we had to solve beforehand, but it is absolutely needed because of how common benzos are still prescribed and it is too easy for anyone to end up on these meds for way too long. Biotin is also a need for this recovery, my partner still can't function if her biotin levels are too low.
* The Sedona method is really overhyped but there's two principles in it that were helpful, the ""could I let it go? Will I? When?"" questioning method helps with letting go of rumination among other things. The other helpful tidbit they teach is about framing all your inner problems as desires for control, approval, and security. Behind these two principles though it starts to get a bit watered down and fluffy.
* Richard Bandler's hypnosis recordings have helped me with progressive relaxation in the past. There's other ways to do progressive relaxation though and there's youtubes on how to do those exercises.
* Lions mane and psilocybin microdosing/macrodosing combined with self guided therapy or my partner provides a hypnosis session or guided meditation audio resources, this was also very helpful. For me tDCS increased the effect of the micro and macrodosing, I saw that raw cocoa nibs is supposed to increase the effects of magic mushrooms but I didn't see this effect personally.
* Body scanning and mindfulness techniques.
* Inner smile meditation
* Resourcing/grounding techniques, Irene Lyon talks about this and other trauma courses do as well. Basically you orient yourself towards safety, one exercise is just to slowly pan your head around the room and gently taking notice of your sensory experience. This trains your nervous system to calm down.
* Epsom salt baths help supplement magnesium and ease body traumas in general, I combine this with massage. While in the hot bath I spray cold water on my scalp and along the base of the neck, I wouldn't recommend this to others, specifically combining a hot bath with a cold shower to the head, but it works on me with calming down and releasing more.
* Knitting/crocheting is meditative when I am not fatigued.
* The Work has really helped with racing thoughts and rumination, the worksheet and process is simple and here's the link: [https://thework.com/instruction-the-work-byron-katie/](https://thework.com/instruction-the-work-byron-katie/)
* The Wholeness work has also been really helpful with reframing stressful people and situations.
* We made self help courses on other techniques that helped us on Udemy, Skillshare isn't a fan of self help content so we got booted.
* Inflammation management is critical, eat foods that reduce inflammation. Many spices are very good for this, combine them with oils and eat it up.
* Gut flora, get in those good gut bacteria, you can homemake yogurt in the oven, or with multicookers that have yogurt functions, and this ensures that you are eating live probiotics. Yogurt, even Activa from the store, generally has dead or low cultures by the time you buy it. Combine this with prebiotics like garlic and barley grass and this will help overall functioning.
* EMDR apps help, I've got two of them on hand, BLST on my phone for audio EMDR and ""Go With That 4.0 Free"" on my desktop for visual EMDR.
* Journalling on reddit.
* Meditative asemic writing.
* Stream of Conscious art therapy, self guided.
* Various CPTSD home courses, audiobooks, ebooks from Pete Walker and others.

Here are some treatment options I want to look into when I am able:

* TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation.
* Vagus nerve pacemaker, I knew a woman with it and it really helped her, lasts 10 years and FDA approved I heard.
* Hyperbaric oxygen chamber combined with breathwork.
* Ketamine assisted therapy but I'm not as eager about this one. I'd still give it a go though.
* MDMA assisted therapy, this is very promising for CPTSD.
* sensory deprivation tank.
* acupuncture.
* cryotherapy
* Pharma grade Muscimol
* cerebrolysin for chronic fatigue

A side note, I wouldn't recommend dabbling in Kundalini stuff for CPTSD, I had a random kundalini experience on accident when I was doing trauma releasing and it is an additional challenge on a nervous system level. This will sound crazy but kundalini psychosis is a real thing and it can happen with people who have CPTSD or other mental health issues. Just avoid Kundalini stuff for self help with CPTSD in general, that's for people with very regulated nervous systems.

Hopefully this was helpful, we aim to make projects and animation that teaches about CPTSD, mental illness, and multigenerational pathology. My partner is working on her first short film about growing up with an alcoholic father as a disabled youth.

We aim to do good work in this life to help less people not end up broken for years like us.

126,I was bullied at a camp," (english is not my first language, sorry) When I was 8 years old, I was bullied at my first camp. I cried because I missed my parents (the camp lasted 15 days) and my campmates messed with me. They spent their free time doing horrible things to animals and the teachers never punished them for it. I was forced to spend time with them. They made me cry and then they laughed at me. They never wanted to spend time with me, they always left me behind. One night the worst happened and of which I will always be ashamed and I can't help but think that it was like a loss of dignity: I woke up at night and threw up on myself, but that wasn't the bad thing. The bad thing is that I did not dare to get up to ask for help from a teacher because I knew that if I would get up and my colleagues would wake up, they would laugh at me and get angry, even though I was feeling sick and hadn't had time to go to the bathroom. So I slept on my vomit out of fear, while crying. The next morning I have it blurry, I only remember shame and teasing and anger. The following days I was isolated in a tent in case I had a virus. I had no fever but I was fatal and everything hurt. They took me to the town doctor and I will never forget what he told me: I was not bad, what I was was stressed. I was somatizing all the anxiety of those days. Now I am 24 years old and I study psychology and it does not occur to me how my teacher did nothing. The only thing that happened is that he sat down to talk to me and said ""you need to relax."" Well thanks. What a fucking help. I continued in that place, having a hard time without anyone helping me. One day I remember going to the extreme of thinking about injuring myself. I thought maybe that way I would go home. I was only 8 fucking years old. Nobody ever helped me. The only thing they did was embarrass me for crying and tell me I shouldn't feel bad. To this day I have a lot of trouble to tell my problems in person. Today I can't cry in front of anyone, it makes me anxious and ashamed and extreme guilt. I never told my parents any of this as they made me think that everything I did crying and trying to ask for help it was wrong.",1627556632.0,False,2,1,RefuerzoNegativo,None,otvboq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/otvboq/i_was_bullied_at_a_camp/
127,My Analysis Paralysis Has Full Control Over Me,"This is a journal entry I wrote today trying to make sense of what I'm going through. This is entirely in the context of career endeavors. I'm a creative person that's always wanted to do YouTube or music full time, but it's so difficult for me. I've been diagnosed with OCD, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Some psychiatrists have also claimed I exhibit symptoms of mood disorders and autism. As well as avoidant personality disorder. I'm hesitant to take medication as I have a consistent track record of psycho-somatic side effects. I feel lost. All of my local mental health resources have been no help at all. When I try to Google specific things I'm dealing with, I'm typically met with no relevant results. I feel so alone honestly.

My biggest problem seems to be this mystery of why I can't commit to shit. I've been a quitter my whole life. I'm for sure lazy. But beyond just laziness, I'm avoiding something within me. I'm avoiding the pain that comes with putting myself out there. I don't trust motivation anymore because I've found a reason to quit things every single time. These reasons are disguised as logical, but they're nothing more than fleeting feelings. Letting the wind blow me whichever way it desires. I don't even know if I want to do the things I want to do anymore. All of my dreams have turned into half-baked failures. I don't even give myself the chance to face outside adversities. the adversities within myself grow in power from the moment I set the intention to do something new with my life. Now, this only really applies to career choices. Anything outside the realm of ""what do I want to do with my life"" isn't affected. I'm pretty consistent with a lot of good habits. Going to the gym, meditating, keeping my space clean, eating healthy, maintaining great hygiene, etc. all come extremely easy to me. I rarely use social media, I've completely quit porn, I don't watch TV or movies pretty much ever, I play video games like twice a year, etc. From the outside, my typical day seems quite healthy and productive. But these ""productive"" habits are still distractions. All of the things I do that are technically good for me serve as a distraction from the fact that I have a dark cloud looming over my head that's saying I'm not living the life I want to live and it's my fault. I spend every day checking off a to-do list knowing damn well that I'm avoiding anything that moves the needle for me career wise. Is it a fear of commitment? Well, My mind rules out all of the odds against me almost immediately with every new career idea I get. My mind likes to generate every reason why I shouldn't commit to something before I even get a chance to experience simply trying. It's a viscous cycle that I have yet to prove resilient against. So far, my mind's desire for comfort has won every time, and my avoidant personality has led me to rarely learning a lesson from these failures. I have this self-sabotage script in my mind that targets all of my career/entrepreneurial endeavors I consider. With my track record of prematurely quitting literally everything I've tried, this has caused me to not trust myself at all. Every moment in recent time that I've had an epiphany of a business, side hustle, career choice, etc., I immediately shut it down. Because these epiphanies are built on the foundation of motivation. And I don't trust motivation at all anymore. Every time I feel intoxicated by motivation, it's short lived as my mind's instant reaction is insecurity and hopelessness. Because I don't trust myself to carry out what I say I'm going to. I haven't been able to literally any other time I've ever tried anything my entire life. Even with complete accountability from others with financial ultimatums involved, I've still failed to stick with my goals. Even with a mentor that I'm paying literally every dollar in my savings for, I've still given up. There's always a reason to quit for me. The most common thread is burnout. Like, a suicidal type of burnout. A crash that lasts months. From overcomplicating projects and overworking myself both mentally and physically. I wish to have consistency in the realms of my career pursuits, but I overcomplicate them artificially instead of letting things naturally grow. I have ""perfect"" ideals that I never reach because these ideals are nothing but molds that kill my creativity. Which leads me to be resentful towards said ideals, causing me to feel justified in giving up. I grow out of a motivated vision within a fucking week of getting them normally.  I let the analysis paralysis confuse me. I don't make a single move. And the monster inside of me grows stronger. And I lose more hope in myself exponentially with each failure. Even if I understand literally everything I need to understand, I still give up. Even if the circumstances are perfectly lined up and I have all the resources I need, I still give up. In fact, I give up before I even start most the time. I've been stagnant for so long that I don't even know what to do. I don't want to be a quitter anymore. I wish my mind didn't overcomplicate every little fucking thing. I wish that the dissonance in my mind didn't have so much control over my actions. I feel shackled to the identity of a quitter, and I don't trust myself to commit to ANYTHING anymore. I am so depressed because of this. Overwhelmingly depressed. Even with my fortunate circumstances in a lot of other areas in my life, I am fucking miserable. And this misery is grim as fuck. Misery and self destruction has become my comfort zone. I feel my soul rotting. Sinking further into a pit where suicide becomes the only option. And it's horrifying. I need help. I need resources.",1712099714.0,False,1,0,No_Tradition3416,None,1bud3n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1bud3n1/my_analysis_paralysis_has_full_control_over_me/
128,I really need some help please.,"This just started happening more often and more intensely lately, but it's been happening on and off for a few years now. The closest thing I've been able to find that would describe what's happening are somatic hallucinations.

So, what happens is I'll start feeling this weird like pressure in my head, not a physical pressure but like there's an idea trying to force its way to the top. I have a little bit of time to try and fight it but if I can't stop it I totally freeze, physically. Mentally I feel like I'm somewhere completely different and experiencing a completely different experience. Sight, smell, taste, touch, hearing, even feeling wind and sun on me, everything about it seems completely real. At some point in my hallucination, though, I always run out of air. Sometimes drowning, some times being hanged, sometimes being strangled, a few times being sucked into space. But then irl I stop breathing and that's how these episodes always end, I'm about to pass out from lack of oxygen when I start thrashing. I come to pretty quick but I still can't breathe right away. I have to, like, get myself to calm down before I can breathe and then I'm gasping and choking for air. They aren't prompted by anything and usually they aren't super frequent.

But it happened twice today. Once I was walking back from the bathroom and I felt it starting. I sat down to try and focus to stop it but couldn't. Then it just happened again about a half hour before I started writing this.

I've tried googling everything I could think of and I haven't really been able to find anything that would explain this. But it's getting worse and I can't afford to go to an actual shrink, so I'm asking you all if you have any idea what this could be or have any idea where I should be directing my searches going forward.

129,Do I have OCD or Generalized Anxiety Disorder?,"I went to a therapist recently since my anxiety has been getting worse and the last time he told me I have some OCD tendencies, but that it was very similar to GAD. 

Basically I struggle with worrisome thoughts that I can’t shake off easily, mostly social/health related. To give you an example:

-When I was about 9 I was scared of HIV, and I would think I had it and wouldn’t share drinks, or if someone got a cut I would avoid them, one time my sister ate from my food and I made her throw up. I still get these thoughts at 25 and not only about HIV and whenever I hook up with someone casually I have to check online for chances of getting HIV from whatever the contact was. My body somatizes it sometimes, I’ll start feeling sick. 
Another example is when I got my wisdom teeth out, I was scared of getting a dry socket and I would spend the day with fear of getting it and checking online at testimonials and posibilities for something to calm me down.

-Also for a while I was kind of scared of thinking about existentialism because I thought if I found something out about existence reality would colapse, I still am afraid about this, and have found shelter in religion.

- I also have thrown away cans because when I open them I’m scared there might be metal in them from cutting them wrong. Similarly I have thrown away food after dropping something with glass even if it’s not close to it.

- I am socially anxious too, a lot of the time I socialize my mind questions my tone of voice, if I sounded funny, if I’m making eye contact for too long, if they’ll think I’m nice. Whenever I go to the grocery store alone I feel watched too, like getting the stares. This happens with friends and sometimes even with family, I get awkward around them, like I need to impress them. I’ve started losing interest about socializing much and phone calls make me scared.

-I also think a lot about my looks, and have been always self conscious and have changed diets, I look up stuff related to surgeries or products for skin everyday, tense my back, do yoga, practice my smile, watch videos online about it.

There’s a lot of things that I’ve done that follow the same pattern, but I can’t pinpoint exactly what it could be. I could use some help for this since it’s making my life harder and I’ve had panic attacks thanks to this (They make me feel like I’m dying).

130,Fish don't know they are in water,"How would you make a fish realise he is in the water? Yes, you feel really, really bad, your thinking is extremely negative, or you are constantly worrying about everything, or you barely do anything all day,.. but how could it be otherwise? If you have a mental health issue such as anxiety or depression, then it is only normal to experience the symptoms, and changes in thinking and behaviour you are currently experiencing - they are literally what it means to have that particular mental health issue. Mental health 'illnesses' are something to be seen as a specific psychological adaptation, meaning a set of cognitive, somatic and behavioural changes part of our genetics that become activated in certain circumstances, and the changes you see in yourself are what would happen to anyone for who this mental health issue becomes activated. 

If you want to see the water that is all around you, you need to find out which specific mental health illnesses you have by either getting yourself diagnosed or doing a self-diagnosis.  That way you can make a full list of the symptoms/characteristics changes associated with that mental health disorder - that is the water you are in. As soon as you feel worry coming up, or becoming irritable, or any of those characteristic changes associated with the illness you have, you then know what is going on, and merely identifying it should be enough to make you take a step back and see that this is just part of the condition you have and as strange as it sounds, that should stop the worrying or negative thinking.  

So whenever you feel you start to worry again, or think negatively, rather than going into the content of the thoughts and trying to stop the worrying or calm down the negative thinking, immediately take a step back by realising that you are in the water, and that worrying or negative thinking, or becoming quickly irritable, are normal characteristics of a specific mental health disorder. The biggest problem is what happens when you are not aware you are in the water: when you start to engage with the content of the the worry and the negative thinking.

People adjust to their way of thinking, feeling and behaviour and it quickly becomes a new normal for them, they think they are their thoughts, feelings and behaviour, while they are just characteristic changes that are part of a mental health disorder. For many people worrying is just normal, and it becomes their way of living; same with their negative thinking, they think everything they believe is the truth (all the negative beliefs they hold), and do not realise their specific thoughts, actions and feelings (the water) are normal symptoms or byproducts of specific mental health disorders.

An important side note is that developing this awareness of being in the water is a skill in and of itself. Many people with depression have developed such an ability for negative thinking they automatically start thinking negatively about everything, and people with worry worry about everything: they fear about the fear not going away, they have anxiety about their negative thinking, or negative thinking about anxiety, worry about worrying too much, or worrying that nothing will works, .. and what might be even the most tricky thing off all, they have negative thinking, worry and anxiety that is reactive: even if they become aware of a certain worry and they see that it is part of generalised anxiety disorder, they would start to worry about that too in some way (e.g. ok but how does merely identifying it solve the problem,.. ) and so there is this constant reacting with worry and negative thinking-effect that is extremely tricky to catch, but again,.. with all time awareness and by relentless focus on realising you are in the water, you are always able to take a step back, looking at your thoughts, behaviour and action, and then you see that ' reactive worry and negative thinking' is also just a form of negative thinking or worry, and part of the characteristics of a your mental health disorder.",1667822291.0,False,1,1,SquareConfidence7,None,yokmxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/yokmxy/fish_dont_know_they_are_in_water/

You can voluntarily direct your sensory organs, muscles and joints (i.e. Meditation, Yoga and Progressive Relaxation) and in a controlled and conscious way affect your ES.  
Thusly, Arranging the facial muscles into a fake smile releases the same positive hormones as a real smile. Holding a Power Stance for 5 minutes increases the level of testosterone in your body, male or female, whether you've won something or not (I do this at the end of my yoga sessions). Testosterone and Cortisol (the stress hormone) are on a teetering see-saw -> when cortisol is low, testosterone is higher & vice versa in stressful situations. More testosterone in the system makes you more resilient to stress. Consenting touch releases a wave of Happy Hormones (Why Therapy Animals and Hugs are so Beneficial).

132,Apathy and low mood after recovery from chronic illness. Help pls!,"Hi all,
I wonder if any of you can relate to my situation and can give me your thoughts.

Some background: I'm 26, from the UK. I have had a chronic illness for 7-8 years. I dropped out of university in 2013 when I first fell ill. It was likely due to working excessively/compulsively hard (was studying physics) and sort of a burn out. I was very unwell for a long time. In 2016/17 I gained a better understanding of my illness (it's called Somatic Symptom Disorder) and was slowly getting better. I was able to work 5-6 hours per day from home on my food blog, which found some success, and I even got a book deal. I managed to finish the book but it was such an intense period of work that I had a devastating relapse at the beginning of 2018. For the next 2 years I was able to do extremely little - basically bedbound.

However, over the past few months I have made a rapid recovery. In such a short space of time I've gone from being the most unwell I've ever been to now where I'm active for most of the day. This is mainly due to working with my therapist on my anxiety about my illness and a few other factors.

To the issues I now find myself battling: contrary to what most would expect after rapid recovery - ecstatic, loving life, happiness - I've been experiencing periods of inexplicable low mood. But the presiding feature of this period is complete apathy, coldness, lack of motivation or interest in anything remotely productive or intellectual. I have no problem motivating myself to see friends, cook or exercise but I don't really take any pleasure from anything atm. Where I used to always have a creative project on the go and a goal to be working towards e.g. food blog, web development, learning photography, etc, I feel utterly apathetic and uninterested. When I've made myself do something that used to give me a buzz it's a huge drag. I feel no ambition, and have no goals. Even reading books and articles that I'd normally be interested in leave me bored and cold. The lack of fulfilment means I seem to question what the point is in living (not suicidal - just more theoretically). I'm normally very compassionate and ethically motivated but those feelings aren't firing either. Naturally, I worry I'll never feel pleasure again or get my ambition or interest in anything back. My current theory is that this is a reaction to the trauma of being so unwell, or subconscious anxieties about the future now that I am actually able to participate in life.

I recognise my circumstances are rare and it is unlikely someone else will have experienced exactly what I've gone through. But I wonder whether any of you have been through something remotely similar and can offer your thoughts or advice.

Really appreciate you taking the time to read and for your input.",1601324747.0,False,2,2,Spicyatom,None,j1k4a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/j1k4a0/apathy_and_low_mood_after_recovery_from_chronic/
133,i need words of support please,"disclaimer: possible TW/CW, but i don't know what exactly could be so read carefully. please don't hesitate to click away if you need to. i don't believe there are any major triggers in my post, however, i can't know exactly what triggers others either. 

no TL;DR, this is a rant/venting because i need to get this out before i explode. if you don't wanna read the whole thing, keep scrolling please. 

i'm 22F and i feel like my body and mind are falling apart. i've been diagnosed with autism, somatic symptom disorder, c-ptsd, adhd, and severe depression/anxiety. now with a new therapist and psychiatrist (due to moving cities) i am being looked at for bpd, bipolar, and osdd as well as eds and pots. i was only diagnosed with autism a year ago, so i'm currently in my unmasking journey which caused me to realize i don't actually know who i am and i don't think i ever have. 

my partner has DID so i know a bit about dissociative disorders from my experience with their system as i've become the system's support person and have done a ton of research on the disorder. 

me myself? well since getting diagnosed with autism last year and getting kicked out of my parent's house shortly after, a lot has been happening with my brain. i don't know if it's because i'm no longer in an abusive situation that now my mind feels comfortable and safe to make me aware of all my issues, but i had never experienced all these symptoms fully until earlier this year. 

however, it actually started with, what i called age regressing, for the first time at the end of last year due to a trauma trigger, but now i'm not entirely sure that's what it is. because after the first time, there was nothing until i ""regressed"" several times in only one month earlier this year which happened mostly while i was actively driving which caused me to almost crash and have to pullover when possible, plus causing trouble communicating as i go nonverbal, and just overall couldn't really function as an adult. i started not feeling like myself but like myself at the same time. it felt like a child version of me had taken control and i was just watching from the passenger seat. i suddenly found im able to soothe ""the child"" by running my hands through my hair and talking to them. which makes me feel crazy i'm not gonna lie. when i'm alone i fully talk to myself/whatever's in my head. i don't think they're separate alters but just versions of me of various ages. 

i'm not asking anyone to diagnose me by the way, i have a therapist and such for that. i just need to write all this out especially since insurance is causing me to not be able to see my therapist lately. 

then after that one month and especially just in this week, everything suddenly got so much worse and very apparent. i've always been a forgetful person i'd say especially since i've suffered several injuries to my head with many pretty severe. i always blamed my adhd for it, but now things are getting weird. it started with me doing something and not remembering i did it. like i have no recollection of this. 

what happened was, i was running late for work and apparently shut the bathroom door behind me before leaving. the cat's litter box is in that bathroom...so my partner woke up to him using the bed as one and had to deal with that early in the morning. i felt so bad and kept apologizing, but it was really weird that i had no recollection of really even being in the bathroom let alone shutting the door before i left. there have been a couple smaller instances with not even just me forgetting information that my partner told me, but having absolutely no recollection of having the conversation at all. 

next, my partner and i have been listening to what's called a podfic together (an audio book esque fanfiction) and we had to start it completely over because i realized i had no memory of how it started even though my partner said we had already listened to it from the beginning. i can remember laying on my partner while we were listening to it, but i don't remember actually hearing the story and it didn't sound familiar at all when we started it over. 

then finally, the most recent thing that happened was just last night. my partner and i fall asleep to markiplier's fnaf playthroughs every night, but after my partner had fallen asleep things got weird. i was just about to fall asleep when i heard voices that were not mine that sounded like they were in the room with me but also in my head. i heard double voices say one line in the video (mark's voice and someone else) and then i heard a childlike voice and i'm not sure what it said. now i pretty much have these videos memorized at this point and was pretty sure there weren't any effects added in that part of the video, but i went back in the video to make sure it wasn't something in the video that i misheard and surprise surprise i did not hear it again. 

that thoroughly freaked me out and i don't know what's happening anymore. i don't think i can call this being forgetful anymore either. i've also realized i don't really have a sense of self. i don't know what to call my sexuality anymore, what pronouns i wanna go by, if i even feel like a single gender anymore, and just overall i have no idea who i am to reiterate what i said before. i know i'm not, but i feel so alone in this right now. which is entirely my fault since i'm choosing not to tell my partner so i don't overwhelm them when they already have their own issues. i just don't know what to do anymore. who am i? what is happening? i'm scared.",1690351434.0,False,1,1,BerryCase134,None,159x8e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/159x8e2/i_need_words_of_support_please/
134,"I have completely self isolated for years, my life is ruined and I'm practically dead. Contemplating ending it all.","Hello. To anybody that is reading this. Thank you and I apologize for this post being too long and delving into too many subjects. This is my official cry for help as best as I can communicate.


I'm 24M. As the title says, I have gone into total seclusion. Outside of my immediate nuclear family, I DO NOT interact with anyone. I've been gradually becoming this way since 2019, it's been almost 5 years. 

I can feel myself becoming something inhumane. I avoid contact at all cost except if it's really necessary. Stopped talking to almost everyone I know 9 months ago except for a few (maybe 3- 4) childhood friends. 

I stopped talking to them as well around 6 months ago, they tried reaching me through calls and texts but I do not respond. 

I almost never come out of my room, only to get food, bathroom and to go out and do obligatory errands.

All I do now pretty much is play video games League of Legends mainly altho I try to play other games when I'm bored or frustrated. I am currently addicted to it. It's my loyal and constant escape. It really helps to distract from the unbearable weight of my many problems and existential dread.

I feel so lonely to the point that it feels impossible to break through me. I feel like my suffering is unintelligible to others. 

Interacting with people on surface level doesn't fulfill any needs I have, and it's seemingly impossible for me to vocalize/communicate exactly and precisely what's going on with me.

It's a mixture of things really. Feeling existentially lost, socially alone, academic and career failure and just overall an inconsequential person.- No disrespect or ridicule intended- but I feel like one of those homeless people you pass by, they are nothing to society, even worse, a problem. I - like them - occupy space and use resources to merely exist, overall counterproductively. The only difference is I just use my family's ( instead of the government/ random people 's)resources to prolong my existence. 

I currently have no spiritual or religious beliefs. I used to be a practicing Muslim. I prayed everyday for god to fix my life, fix me.. but I gave up after nothing happened. I fell out of faith after a while.

I feel like one of my main problems is that I REALLY don't want to exist on a physical level. And that's mainly due to some sort of chronic nerve pain that has spread all over my body. Mainly the left side of my body. It crawls all the way from my toes to my ears. It clenches my muscles and influences how I walk, sit and pretty much EXIST. It's there at all times, like (pardon my language) a fucking cancer. But a way more covert one. A more unserious (at least to others) type of ailment. 

It controls my life. 

It's tricky to communicate somatic feelings through words but I'll try. I can feel the inner pressure of my nerves/ muscles contracting. In my face, it feels like I'm wearing a mask. Feels like half side of my face is just craving contraction and folding, my left eye is almost always half shut, and it makes me feel very weird.. like I'm not perceiving life properly or I'm seeing it through a cracked layer of glass or something.

I can feel the most pain in my left arm/ shoulder and up my neck. It feels horrible, like I'm not even the rightful owner of that side of my body. 

I can also feel my abdominal area always tense, like I'm doing partial sit-ups. Makes me walk in weird way too having my gut all tense.

Overall this mysterious condition makes me feel chronically uncomfortable and distracted at best, ruined and in pain at worst. It sits at the forefront of my attention always. When I'm trying to read something, when I'm in a conversation with someone or basically moment to moment life. 

Now I don't know what's worse, this being like an actual neurological disease or just a result of tens of bad microhabits, like poor posture, too much time on PC, using keyboard, or like just a habit of clenching and tensing my muscles that has built up through repetition over many years.

This creates a thick layer of unease and inaccessibility in communication with other. Partially because it makes listening to others really challenging since I'm almost always distracted by painful sensations. And also because it makes me painfully self conscious if my face looks all strange and not normal (few people have commented on that specifically, saying I look crazy). So instead of focusing my attention on the other person and developing a relationship with them through multiple interactions and time spent. I just get self conscious, ashamed and in result: defensive and avoidant. 

As face to face socialization proved to be horrible, I resorted to strictly online communication like texting and calling. After a while that felt stale and just not like the real thing, relationships with girls who are potential partners started to feel fake and stale after a while because there is no initiation from my side to see each other in real life, meet up, go on a date or hangout or whatever.

Friendships with other guys felt bad as well because of the reasons mentioned above and also because of me being a skinny, not particularly physically strong dude, who is almost always zoned out and for some reason that makes me a target for jabs that sometimes outright developes into bullying.

Not fun.

My lack of enthusiasm towards being/ communicating with other people is felt and in return reciprocated. 

So pretty much all new connections are short-lived.

That leaves my few loyal childhood friends who I've alienated most of them recently. Leaving one or two people who go out their way to check up or catch up with me.

Feeling horrible about life and finding no meaning in all this suffering, I have stopped going to college, quit my job, cut all contacts and completely self isolated.

I live secluded in a routine that just fills my senses with enough stimulation just so I don't die of boredom, enough distraction so I don't get constantly overwhelmed by negative emotions. 

I used to be addicted to smoking cigarettes, marijuana and social drinking. To be completely honest, they really served their part. 
Being successful distractions from life and all it's abundant suffering.

I smoked and drank since I was 17 years old, and stopped last year at 23. I stopped out of marijuana-induced paranoia that I might be possessed or that someone that hates me has put an evil demonic hex on me that ruins my life. 

Being completely sober for over a year now, I realize that I have no personality outside of being a stoner, that my life choices pretty much revolved around getting high (poor academic and career performance), I started entranced as a late teenager and ended up a sober miserable failure of an early adult. 

People who have a miserable life and are trying to numb or -better yet- grow out of their circumstances tend to have faith in either their ability to fix their situation or in an omnipotent force lending them a hand/fixing it for them.

I have tried both routes.

Neither worked.

What is the point?

The logical part of my brain knows that the only way to change my circumstance I have to actively work to fix it.

Yet the emotional side is too afraid of trying again and failing, I feel too overwhelmed by everything.
Feel like I have been dealt a really bad hand, I tried seeking mental and physical help, but the incompetence of accessible medical help from where I'm from is astounding. And I don't have the money to seek higher quality therapists or physicians.

I'm probably going to end it all soon because that seems to be the only way out.",1710259073.0,False,1,0,True_Nose6822,None,1bd0pgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1bd0pgi/i_have_completely_self_isolated_for_years_my_life/
135,psychiatrist said that i show symptoms of trauma and i'm trying to figure out why,"I've had mental health issues as long as i can remember, but a particular manifestation of that for most of my life was that i was sick and that i was going to die. I remember this as young as five. Every time someone thing happened to injure me or i had a pain i couldn't explain, i became panicked, i thought i was dying without a shadow of a doubt. I brought this up to my family most of the time, and that felt like they were leaving me to die constantly, like they didn't care.   


I had a lot of somatic pain from anxiety, and this created a cycle that got worse and worse. I'd start shaking and with teeth clattering, like you do when you are really sick. those nights that i felt like that were hell. I was in pain constantly. i had long since learned that no one would help me or believe me. I had to leave school because it got to be too much.  


As i got older i started injuring myself to try to discover or fix these imagined illnesses. I did that for most of my teenage years. I was convinced already that no one would believe me. I never actually talked openly to a therapist until i was 17. Not long after i realized how delusional injuring myself was and removed some of the things i'd hurt myself to tried and ""fix"" for many years. I was diagnosed with OCD around that time as well which likely contributed to that, although I don't believe that usually manifests so young.   


The meds they gave me never helped, my head was still a mess, and i was unable to function. even without a lot of those things bothering me. I started getting bad. around this time a lot of other things were happening, but they were just a product of my other issues.   


within a year i was in the  hospital. I wasn't thinking clearly, and I began to worry i was a danger to myself and others, so i was admitted voluntarily. I didn't talk to the doctors there. I knew they could have helped me. But it was more complicated than just what i said was my reason for admitting myself. I know those places are supposed to keep people safe, but that place made me worse. I felt like it fucking broke me I started acting different and I feel like something snapped in my head. I got a lot worse. lied to get out.   


I wasn't doing great i started having more issues as i said ie. mood swings, panic attacks, trouble sleeping. and finally for once, I got a med that worked, mood stabilizers. the higher the does got the more clearly i could think, and my general metal health improved. around the time i was just out of the program which i attended after the hospital stay, my psychiatrist noted that a lot of my symptoms were similar to ptsd or specifically complex ptsd. I dismissed the whole thing and it never came up again. Nothing bad happened to me for me to have ptsd.    


it did get me thinking though, that maybe a lot of the things messed me up and i never dealt with them. I haven't made progress in therapy for a year because i don't even know what is wrong. and maybe i am just hoping that if i found out what it was then i could get better. I just feel like this insurmountable wall is here. meds are keeping me stable but can't go much higher, but i still am having difficulty functioning everyday. therapy is a dead end, meds are capped. and i have difficulty even taking care of myself without breaking down. I want to say there is some answer to this but i don't know.

You ever been in such a fog you don't know you?
Never being able to do the shit you're supposed to?
I wouldn't wish it on anyone that I'm close to
Wouldn't wish it on anybody that I'm opposed to
There's not an accurate diagnosis to show you
Basic neurobiology isn't close to it
I'm watching life as a spectator
I can't help myself, even though I possessed data
It's not a part of my spirit to want to test nature
You think you know what I'm feeling, cousin, then let's wager
I'm having trouble retaining new information
Familiar scenes starting to look foreign- derealization
Everybody tired of being patient
Mama wondering why her baby crying in the basement
Constant rumination just exacerbates it
To the point where I can't even barely narrate it
I've had doctors tell me that my mind is fascinating
But they can't tell me why the sickness has been activated

My head don't work, the meds don't work
But I don't want to be dead, dead don't work
Sleep's the cousin of death, the bed don't work
Maybe I'd rather be dead; dead don't hurt
Realization of an inherent emptiness
Maybe that's another sin for the pessimist
Possibly I am a jinn with a exorcist
I've fallen because I've been on the precipice
Maybe it's my mama's possible regret
Maybe it's a neurological neglect
Maybe it's the reason why water's wet
The angular gyrus and where the frontal lobe connect
But maybe I'm being too complicated for you
Maybe I should just be calm and explain it to you
The psychiatrist thinking they could fool you
Paxil, Zoloft, it's just wasteful to you
I've tried meditation, tried to sit in silence
But how the fuck that help a neurochemical imbalance?
Why would you tell a person that they were childish
Without an understanding of the pain that they surround in?
I always feel foggy somatic detatchment
It's like my body isn't connected to actions
It destroys everything that's affected the fragments
I don't have nothing but senses and sadness

I wanna talk about it with people outside my treatment team. So, I've outlined my history and concerns as concisely and as comprehensively I could.. any input is appreciated <3 You can skip sections if you like.

&#x200B;

*Background —*

I’m a young adult female. I’ve struggled with CPTSD for many years now as a result of childhood trauma and adult experiences of abuse+violence. I slipped into a severe depressive episode this year after a sexual assault. I have a caring primary care doctor and a psychiatrist — they want to help me manage the intense levels of panic and depression I’ve recently experienced while using minimal medication. I’ve been on mirtazipine (an antidepressant) for 4 weeks and I’m able to function more (reduced depression but ongoing anxiety). I am also trying to eat more and gain weight as I am underweight.

*“Issues”—*

Nightmares (resulting insomnia), panic attacks that last 2-6 hours, flashbacks, hyper vigilance, dissociation, physical pain, anxiety, depression. I also experience a lot of self doubt and self blame. No history of hallucinations, drug misuse, or violence towards others.

All of the above have improved significantly while being on mirtazipine. I am now able to sleep regularly and eat well when before I was neither able to sleep nor eat due to the level of panic symptoms I was experiencing. Mere improvements in sleep have allowed me to better manage anxiety and panic when they do happen.

*My goals —*

I want help with regulating sleep, food, and mood so I am more equipped to manage triggers and painful memories, while also creating a future worth moving towards. My body’s responses are natural responses to an unnatural situation of abuse. I want to be able to listen to my body and give myself what I need, which is tenderness, kindness, and respect. I expect respect and gentleness from people I interact with as well - it is essential for my healing. I’m not interested in picking apart my trauma or suppressing what is showing up - I want to be able to meet my needs fully.

*Things I’ve tried —*

Medication, therapy, meditation, healthy food, exercise, self care, and trauma informed movement. I’ve found that mind body integration through somatic work + low dose medication is an amazing combo. Talk therapy has felt highly distressing lately (maybe because my providers are not actually trauma informed) even though I’ve been engaged with different types of talk therapy for the last 8 years and had success.

**I feel hurt by my intensive program —**

I started an outpatient intensive partial program (in addition to monthly check ins with my pcp + psychiatrist) and I think it’s doing more harm than good. *This is where I need your thoughts.*

1- The intake staff raised their voice at me but I hoped it’s just the cruel gatekeepers and that the actual staff will be kind because it’s supposed to be trauma informed.

2- I got thrown into a 6 hour day when they told me it will only be a quick 20 minute intake. It instead turned into 6 hours of invasive questioning, classes, and therapy - during which I was required to be present and not eat.

2.1- There was no personal check in or regard for the fact that I was highly disregulated because I wasn’t allowed to move or eat when hungry. This resulted in a 5 hour panic attack after the day ended, nightmares, and inability to sleep. I struggled with severe body aches for 2 days after because of how distressed I was.

3- Part of the program day was meeting with a psychiatrist that immediately fixated on racially targeted questions - “where are you actually from” “why are you here” “what’s your visa status” even though I never brought that up and she assumed I’m foreign because I’m not white. This meeting lasted 13 minutes after which she told me my current medication is incorrect and I need to be on antipsychotics (?) without ever asking me what I need. She interrupted me every time I tried to express what is currently going on. She barely looked at me and spent the whole time eating and looking at the computer. This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program - everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires.

4- I have had no meeting with anyone during or before the program regarding what I need or how this program is customized to me.

5- almost every individual in the program is on medication and there seems to be general push towards strong sedating medication. Most members could not even sit up during groups due to the level of sedation.

6- I have corrected the clinicians and staff over 4 times in a single day with the name they use for me and they continue to use incorrect names for me. I don’t feel respected.

7- The staff seems to treat every action of every client as a sickness. For example, a woman felt emotional anger when someone was rude towards her in public — the staff fixated on the validity or invalidity of that anger instead of the safety needs in that situation.

8- The staff and the program itself feels very paternalizing. Example — a clinician did an activity asking everyone to name “vacation spots” that start with F before jumping into talking about emotional dysregulation and severe distress. The clinician (an intern in training) had a color wheel with activities at the level of a 4th grader for an adult group.

9- The program is apparently owned by a for-profit company and has dangerously negative reviews on google by clients and on LinkedIn+Glassdoor by staff.

138,Disturbing experience with therapist,"This is absolutely weird, is it not?

(Somatic Experiencing Trauma Specialist)

My therapist asked me what I needed once.  I said encouragement.  She said she'd send me some encouraging emails while she was out of state for a couple weeks.  I felt awkward accepting this, but I did.

A couple weeks later, I noticed she would miss days and then apologize for it.  This made me feel really guilty.  I felt just strange and guilty from the beginning, even if I wasn't fully aware of that uncomfortable feeling.  The emails were not exactly encouraging.  They were these little snippets, kind of odd, like, ""There was a great downpour last night.  Today, the flowers look rejuvenated.  Take good care."". I mean, I really did appreciate the intent...

But when she began apologizing for missing days, I just told her that it was no longer necessary.  This was like a couple weeks even after she got back.  I felt they would be temporary, even just an encouragement right then and there in her office when she first asked.  What I could not communicate at the time was that all of this therapy stuff was difficult...I just wanted some human encouragement, like something real.  Our sessions often felt so clinical (even if effective on a physiological level.)

So what happened when I told her she could stop?  Nothing.  She ignored me, and just kept sending them.  Like two weeks later, I brought it up again....at this point I was confused, trying to figure out what the reason was, like did I need these and wasn't aware that I needed them?  What happened when I brought it up the second time?  Nothing.  Ignored me, kept sending.  So 4 days later I am very vocal about it.  

Suddenly, she describes these emails as a ""care plan"" and that she can't discuss a care plan outside of a session.  (We had had at least three sessions since I first said to stop.). My next session is in like 3 days and, what does she do?  Keeps sending them up to the session.  

A month after my original request, she finally talks about it.  She acts all professional and clinical about it, doesn't even acknowledge that she ignored me twice, doesn't acknowledge that the whole thing was weird.  

But next, right after she asks me (lol), ""so you'd like to end the emails?"" she starts telling me that she is my therapist, not a friend...so if I send her emails she will just reply, ""thanks for sharing."". This made me dissociate big time, because it reminded me of my cult....how I was shunned essentially for growing so dependant on them....

But the weird thing is that I told her early on that I didn't like how this daily interaction was making me feel dependant.  Sometimes I'd reply to her encouragement with a reply.  Sometimes I'd send an email just sharing something in general.  Our sessions we did no talking about stuff, just working with the body.  That whole time I had all these things I was needing to talk about with someone (in another thread about her refusing to talk about an ex partner).  Her encouragements actually began making me have breakdowns..,.they made me feel very sad.  I felt guilty that I began sending her my thoughts or questions, and then she called me out on it.  It was a cult flashback, I guess.  

Before the encouragement emails, we didn't interact by email except very occasionally. 

When I told her all this was weird, she said these things were misunderstandings but offered no explanation.  She offered to explain in a session, but that she ""understands if it would be too much for me."". Then she agreed to answer by email but never did.  Just silence.  She was ""sorry for the misunderstanding."" 

Thank you for any thoughts you have about this.  Was it valid for me to think the situation was incredibly weird, and even disengenuous when it got to having to halt the care plan in person?",1532456994.0,False,3,3,LeftHomeland,None,91k0hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/91k0hq/disturbing_experience_with_therapist/
139,What to do when you don't have access to therapy - what worked for me," 

I see many people talking about how they can’t go to therapy or that therapy isn’t helpful. I’ve been in that boat for years. I started therapy and medication at age 14 and tried various therapists and pills unsuccessfully until my late 20s. I went to “specialists” who had no idea what to say to a suicidal teenager or said all the wrong things. 

I wanted to write down some of the things that helped me.

The main barriers people often have in getting therapy:

1. Cost. Therapy can be downright expensive. Many people who struggle with mental health issues are working in low-paid jobs or struggle to hold on to a job. That can make the prospect of giving a day’s worth of money for an hour of telling someone how bad you feel, seem quite daunting, especially since we have no guarantee that the therapy will help. It can also take time until you find a therapist that you click with and find helpful. 
2. Accessibility. It can be hard to find qualified therapists in some areas. Note that by qualified, I don’t mean “licensed,” but someone empathetic, understanding, and up-to-date on the latest knowledge in mental health. 
3. Waiting lists. In some areas, it can take weeks or even months to see a qualified mental health professional.

Free or low-cost alternatives to therapy:

1. Self-help and psychoeducation books. These seem dumb, but you can gain a lot of knowledge from books (and articles, podcasts, and Youtube channels). You can find these books second-hand, in a library, or even free ebooks online (I hesitate to include a link, but just message me if you’re really struggling).   
Some of my most recommended books are:  
**When The Body Says No: The Hidden Cost of Stress by Dr. Gabor Mate.**  
**There Is Nothing Wrong with You: Going Beyond Self-Hate by Cheri Huber.**

**Radical Acceptance By Tara Brach.**  
**When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times by Pema Chodron.**  
**Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy by David D. Burns.**  
My full list of recommendations is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUpRUsH2_8_U9CSJU2IUwtUjK36RmlBgz1em73CosIE/edit?usp=sharing). There are many good books out there - it helps to think about what issues specifically you want to work on. Self-compassion? Motivation? Social skills? Setting boundaries? If it feels like there are too many issues to work on, I recommend trying to start with self-compassion. I found that when I increased my self-compassion, making healthier choices became easier.

1. Support groups.[ Livewell](https://www.livewell-foundation.org/) is an online support group for depression. ACA ([adult children of alcoholics and other dysfunctional families](https://adultchildren.org/)) is a free online + in-person meeting for those who grew up in homes that were unsupportive or neglectful in any way. [Codependents Anonymous](https://coda.org/) can be helpful for those who are struggling to find and build healthy relationships. [Refuge Recovery](https://refugerecovery.org/) is a support group that’s built on Buddhist principles instead of 12-steps. Like therapy, it can find time to take the right support group for you, but it can be beneficial when you do it. 
2. Learning how to regulate your nervous system. One of the things that helped me is seeing my depression, anxiety, and ADHD not as disorders that mean is something wrong with me, but symptoms of dysregulation or trauma responses. r/cptsd is a great resource. Learning how to recognize emotional flashbacks or dysregulation and how to deal with them can do wonders. Incorporating habits like yoga, body scans, or grounding exercises might be helpful for some. Even just learning more about the nervous system, trauma, and regulation helped me a lot.
3. Online therapy or alternative therapies. Talk therapy with a Psychologist can be beneficial if you’ve found the right person. However, it’s not the only way. 
   1. You can have talk therapy with someone who is not a Clinical Psychologist, who may be just as helpful but charge less. I’ve had treatment with several people who were not licensed but had done their own recovery work for years. They trained in or learned about methods such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, TRE (trauma release exercise), Hakomi, somatic experiencing, and emotional regulation. Their journey made them aware of the challenges I was dealing with and understanding. Some clinicians are trained as Psychologists or Social Workers but offer online sessions while living in a low cost-of-living country, which allows them to provide cheaper sessions online. I can help you find some therapists who may provide online sessions.
   2. Non-talk therapy. Modalities such as Internal Family Systems, TRE, trauma-informed yoga, and EMDR might be helpful. You usually do not have to discuss your past in some of these modalities.
   3. Several mental health professionals host online groups or courses. Off the top of my head, Thais Gibson from the Youtube channel Personal Developed School, The Holistic Psychologist, and Crappy Childhood Fairy. You can follow these “mental health influencers” for a while and see if you feel comfortable with their energy/message/if you get value from their free content. The examples I mentioned are some of the more popular ones, but you should be able to find some who don’t have as big of a following but might be just as good. Be wary of anyone who paints themselves too much as a guru or claims to have the one true formula or answer.
4. Psychedelics. You might have heard some people say that one psychedelic trip was like “years of therapy”. That has been my experience, as well. After taking mushrooms, it was as if some things just naturally shifted for me. This effect lasted for weeks, as I noticed I responded in ways and for the first time had a real sense of “hey, I can choose to react differently.”   
However, it’s important to stress that taking psychedelics shouldn’t be taken lightly. A trip can be a scary and anxiety-inducing experience if you’re unprepared. Please, if this is something you’re considering, read up about it first. Look at r/psychedelictherapy and the resources listed there. Read up on harm reduction, make sure you understand “set and setting”, and consider reading Michael Pollan’s book.",1609238281.0,False,16,7,maafna,None,kmc192,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kmc192/what_to_do_when_you_dont_have_access_to_therapy/
140,I simply cannot break my cycle of self problem causing.,"I keep making posts under so many alts. I keep getting more or less the same replies.   
For whatever reason I just cannot change myself for the better. I just cant.   
This is almost a monthly occurrence. I just start self doubting, I start ruminating, I get depressed and stressed and anxious and it usually ends with a full mental breakdown that knocks me out for months or my brain gets bored and this sudden burning ""passion"" to figure myself out whittles way.  
Even much simpler things like keeping my desk clean. I have tried, for YEARS, I have tried different methods. I just cannot. I can keep it clean for a few days, at most 2 weeks. But then something in my brain just forces autopilot and BOOM 17 half empty water bottles and 4 moldy yogurt cups balancing on my desk.  
I dont wanna get into detail with how I tried to fix it but none of them worked and I've tried NUMBEREOUS different quirks to keep my desk or force myself to keep it clean. I just work around it lmao!  
I can tell im again reaching a breaking point because im feeling worsening anxiety symptoms. Sleep disturbances, more muscle tension, spasms, and soreness, my heart beat is more ""active"", my digestion and hunger levels are fucked, my mood and emotional levels are fucked.  
Like I said before this is practically a routine at this point. every year or so I get this ""lets micromanage everything I do, make note of those issues, try to dig into my past and search for answers, aaaaaand then stress about it without fixing anything.""  
I haven't really been diagnosed with anything... Maybe a sort of ""soft diagnosis"" for mild depression and severe anxiety when I had to go to the ER with a panic attack.  
But im pretty much 100% sure I have some OCD variants. Definitely have some Somatic OCD and Pure OCD. My entire life I've dealt with bad thoughts that I obsess over. Religious thoughts, sexual orientation thoughts, pedophile thoughts, contamination and hand washing issues, bodily function obsessions and micromanaging, and disease/health obsessions.  
Possible adhd, possible bpd according to friends.   
Depression and anxiety yes  
I keep researching diseases and few times think what if autism but pretty much no one in my life has ever said they thought I had it. In my paranoid manic waves I used to bother my friends. Even a friend that had an autistic brother didn't think I fit it so idk. I just keep searching but no matter what I find it never fixes my issues.  
I keep thinking back to my younger days when I could make friend with anyone. Sure I was a bit shy but I would warm up easily and be cool with most people.  
I cant do that anymore.  
I dont know why and it makes me so fucking mad. At home and with friends I feel so free to act and say whatever the fuck I want.   
My current fucking thing is my lack of social skills. I've been at a new job for 5 months. and Im still so fucing bullshit fucing shy. I just cant stop it. Im nervous ayt every more. I WANT to talk to everyone, I WANT so much to be chill and feel comfortable around them. But I just cant. WHY.   
I can do it at home or with friends. I was able to do it as a child. WHY the FUCK cant I just be normal? Why am I hiding. WHAT the fuck am I hiding from? its so exhausting. EVERY single day thinking okay cool im gonna try to make some conversation. I get there, someone says something to me and I go ""ʰᵐʰᵐʰᵐʰᵐᵐᵐ ʸᵉᵃʰ... ᵘʰ ʸᵃ. ʰᵘʰ""  
When I try to say something funny it comes off all fucing stiff and I just wish I shut the fuck up instead of even attempting anything. My body physically just tenses. When people make jokes to me I force out this smile that my body is fighting so hard against. And if the joke was any sort of ""banter"" in anyway Ill immediately, IMMEDTALEYL think ""oh damn well what did they mean by that""  
Im just so mad.   
I thikn the biggest part of it is I cant accept myself for what I am. I can when around people that have already accepted me but I cant bring my truie self to strangers?  
And why am I trying so hard to fight against it?   
I just dont know  
Ive even tried going days where I just ignore everything. but guess fucking what. that fucking paranoid anxiety ALWAYS COMES BACK.  
I do remember a few times back in elementary school I was constantly told I was annoying. Somewhere some switch happened and I just stopped talking to people. I even remember a guy saying ""you used to talk so much but now you're so quiet."" what the fuck happened to me?  
I'm even considering possible head injuries at this point. Did some asteroid knock the speaking sense out of me? FUCK Man   
The main problem is this. I have behaviors that for some reason I dont like. Some are bad like being ""chaotically OrGaNiZeD"" Im not as cool as I think I want to be so I find all these little awkward quirks I have and self esteem and confident issues. Im not as smart or successful as I think I want to be so I find reasons to explain why im so stupid and incompetent...    
I have always been a perfectionist and I think im like forcing that mindset onto my own personality OBVIOUSLY im not gonna be perfect but my brain wont let me rest knowing that.  
I already know like 97% of the comments are gonna be ""TRY THERAPY"" but honestly fuck therapy. I've personally knows a few people that have tried it. All they talk about is how expensive it is, how bad their therapists are, how its just a useless fucking circle of ""oh yes uh huh I feel you and I hear you dear, you are valid queen!"" And then top it off with the complete life ruining dependability on pills.   
gold star if you read it all woohoo  
huh  
I left for 30 mins to steep and had a thought. Maybe its hard for me to be open with these people because I dont actually want to be friends with any of them?  
I want to be liked by all but why? Its weird because I never thought of it from this way. Back in hisghchool there were people I'd avoid and others I would kinda naturally gravitate towards... That makes sense too since there were always groups of very similar people. So maybe my job just doesn't have anyone that my monkey brain find worth pursuing?   
Maybe this need to be liked by all is just stressing me out and putting me on the spot. And that makes it hard to be natural because I always feel like im on a stage forcing this performance to get ""overall genral likeness"" or some shit....  
Even gong back to my sunday school days, I was friends with like 3 people but only had one REALLY good friend.   
There was an unliely person I made friends with in highschol also. I never knew this guy and one day we had to work on a project together and we just clicked and stuckj together for the rest of the year...  
And if Im being completely 100% honest with myself it ALL has to do with thewir sense of humor.   
All ym friends have a similar sense of humor. That the biggest thing I notice in people. Are they serious, is their humor more conventional, is their humor that bullshit fake LA smile kind.  
Its still ahrd for me to accept myself that this is how I am tho. It makes sense. All the people I kinda dropped in life were people that we didn';t have specific things in common with. It really makes sense. But why ios it so hard to come to terms with?  
I guess it just means the people at work just really aren't my type... But yet why cant I keep a fake relationship with them? Is it cuz im putting too much pressure on myself??   
Or maybe I just dont se the need to pursue and maintain a fake relationship that is only held on a very like superficial level?  
It makes sense logically. But I just cant accept it? Good friendships come naturally. If you have to force it the body and mind will fight back against you. So then why Am I fighting back against that?  
Did I just therapize myself?  
this happens a lot too.  
I'll focus on a fucking mess in my life, spend days to weeks thinking it over, and then I seemingly find the answer, then I forget it all and move onto another problem.  
Anyways thats all. I think",1684040017.0,False,5,0,wittedshitted,None,13h2yhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/13h2yhe/i_simply_cannot_break_my_cycle_of_self_problem/

### Abstract

Depressive disorders constitute a set of debilitating diseases with psychological, societal, economic and humanitarian consequences for millions of people worldwide. Scientists are beginning to understand the reciprocal communication between the brain and the rest of the body in the etiology of these diseases. In particular, scientists have noted a connection between depressive disorders, which are primarily seen as brain-based, and, insulin resistance (IR), a modifiable metabolic inflammatory state that is typically seen as peripheral. We highlight evidence showing how treating IR, with drugs or behavioral interventions, may ameliorate or possibly prevent, depressive disorders and their long-term consequences at various stages of the life course. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Metabolic Impairment as Risk Factors for Neurodegenerative Disorders.'

**Highlights**

-   IR is a pathological proinflammatory state underlying neuropsychiatric and somatic diseases
-   IR is part of a cascade of allostatic load, which is mediated in the periphery and CNS
-   PPAR- γ receptors, glutamate, cortisol are among mediators of peripheral and central crosstalk underlying IR

1.  Introduction Over 500 million people suffer from psychiatric disorders worldwide, and this burden continues to grow leading to profound psychological, societal, economic and humanitarian consequences (WHO) [1]. Much effort is aimed at uncovering the causes of these disorders and developing new strategies for treatment and prevention. In this review, we underscore the importance of recognizing the reciprocal communication between the brain and the rest of the body, both in terms of the genesis of depressive disorders (DD) and their course. A key concept in the interface between the brain and the rest of the body is the role of psychosocial and physical stress in triggering and exacerbating these illnesses. Stressful experiences can precipitate major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar illness, anxiety disorders, and major depression [2]. Stressful experiences early in life and throughout the life course, as well as health-damaging behaviors increase risk for type 2 diabetes (DM2) as well as depression. Depressive disorders and diabetes, in turn, increase the vulnerability to dementia [3], exemplifying the life-long impact of stress and the ongoing interplay between peripheral and central mechanisms that conspire to create multiple chronic disorders in a single individual. Of note, an increasing number of studies support insulin resistance (IR) as a common culprit underlying these growing and devastating diseases and making it important to understand the mechanisms for development of IR. IR is a modifiable metabolic pro-inflammatory state that occurs in approximately one-third of otherwise apparently healthy individuals. We discuss the linkage between depressive disorders, which are primarily seen as brain-based, and, IR, a pathophysiological condition that is typically seen as peripheral. We also highlight evidence showing how using our understanding of this relationship can lead to the development of pharmacological and behavioral interventions that ameliorate IR and treat or possibly prevent its long-term consequences including depressive disorders. Below, we ask: (1) what are the biological underpinnings of the bidirectional interaction between IR and DD? And (2) can we define molecular targets in this bidirectional interaction that might be relevant for treating depressive disorders?

In sum, the convergence of evidence from cell biological studies, animal studies and early analyses of human clinical data leads to the hypothesis that insulin resistance is a key component in the treatment of depressive disorders. Addressing this may include acceleration of remission, prevention of relapse, and/or mitigation against the emergence of treatment resistance. This hypothesis deserves direct testing to more precisely identify the population of patients that would profit most from such interventions, explore the possible use of such an approach in conjunction with other treatment modalities, and identify the optimal timing to ensure maximal effectiveness.",1534397376.0,False,2,0,1345834,None,97pl08,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/97pl08/insulin_resistance_an_unmasked_culprit_in/
142,I need some help with something that has constricted me for possibly 2+ years.,"I've been struggling with something that has crippled me for a long time but also haven't spoken about until now.

This has been going on for probably the extent of two years, around about when the pandemic started and we had that period when we all just stayed inside and did nothing.

I don't remember if it's been going on longer than that, so it's safe to say it's been going on as long as I remember.

I've wanted to talk about this for a while, however every time I try to speak about it I get caught up on ideas about whether it's even worth it or the fear of simply being told it's my problem or that I'm just lazy and deranged.

I'm the type of person who enjoys learning about things. I think one of the wonders of life is learning about cool stuff and being able to create things with it. I love game development and programming, and have been wanting to properly get into it for about 2 years now. I swear I have made the effort, I've tried to sit down and watch tutorials, and when I open the software and program something I genuinely enjoy seeing my efforts pay off with a working system. It's quite depressing, because I learn by writing notes, and by reading my notes I can see that I'm actually enjoying myself

However, over two years, I've had nothing but a few phases where I try so hard to do something with engines like Unity and Blender but it just dies a few days later and I go back to what I always do: nothing.

It's like I spend a few hours doing something I enjoy and have fun doing, and then the moment I stop I completely forget the enjoyment I had from doing that thing. It usually leads to me spending hours and hours doing the same task, even if it's not going well, out of the fear I'll forget all about it straight after and never come back to it.

It's not just limited to creative tasks either, I've loved video games since I was a kid and yet I can't even make myself play them anymore. I have no hobbies, no creative outlet and no media I enjoy. My friends struggle to try and make me play even casual game modes. Even though I have a sort of somatic (factual) memory that I'll enjoy it, since I always do when I make myself play, my emotions/instincts just pull and pull at me to stay away and keep doing literally nothing instead.

It's really hard to explain the feeling, but it's almost like I'm being constricted. I've tried to just force myself, in hopes that I can sort of condition myself into being able to go ""yeah, I'd love to!"" but I just can't.

I spend most of my days where I have nothing planned sat in front of my computer screen watching livestreams or browsing social media because it's the only thing I'm pretty much capable of doing without overthinking and stressing myself out. Even this stresses me out - if I'm doing nothing, I'm thinking about how I could be doing something, but make no active movements to do anything.

I spent my entire year being a part of a course at my college where I was in a room full of great setups and gaming equipment and all of that crazy stuff, and you know what I did? Just opened Twitch or something and watched my friends play instead. I had, like, a week? where I was properly playing the game along with my friends, and after this one random game (where I did well, it wasn't even a tilting game) I just stopped, as if I'd simply been fulfilled (even though I hadn't reached my seasonal goal yet), and going back to the game made me feel uncomfortable.

Trying to force myself to play when I don't want to not only hampers my performance, but also makes me so anxious and uncomfortable that I begin to shake uncontrollably and sometimes feel nauseous.

I swear I want to do it, I want to spend my time enjoying my hobbies with my friends and challenging myself, because I'm very competitive and love the challenge, but I can only watch my friends do it and make passing comments every so often. I swear I want to learn about my interests and make cool stuff, but every time I think about opening the software, my brain is just filled with an overwhelming sense of unwillingness to do the things I want to do.

When I feel like this, I go through logic loop upon loop and every hurdle imaginable in order to convince myself, but it just NEVER works.

I do sometimes have waves of excitement to get something cool started like a project or a creative task, but I always feel it sucked out of me the moment I ever sit down.

An further example: I enjoy working since I have some pretty cool co-workers and regulars that I enjoy talking to, but actually thinking about work makes me feel constricted and dreadful (for what reason?) and makes me want to take less hours, even though I don't mind it and it's not like I'm doing anything anyway. When my co-workers talk to me anyway, all I can say is that I've watched, like, two TV shows in the past few months? I'm rather bland to talk to and spend most of my shifts doing my own thing because honestly not many people want to talk to me.

It's crippling me, as I know with the amount of free time I have/had, I could have done and learned some amazing things, since I love creating stuff, and I'm fairly self confident in my abilities and intelligence, but every time it's like the memory of that enjoyment just fades away the moment I sit down in my chair and I instead wallow in my own self pity.

I struggle to talk to people in real life and I think I'm starting to develop a stutter, I forget to brush my teeth or even eat breakfast for days at a time and I can't really say anything other than it's eating me alive. I have zero excitement for anything, even the TV shows and video games I enjoy. I'm not excited for a single release and I randomly stop watching shows halfway through and never come back.

I dread being told it's just laziness, because I've tried everything I can without professional help - I've tried forcing myself to keep a schedule, conditioning myself, talking with my friends about it, but nothing works and my friends can never relate.

It feels terrible knowing that you've done nothing, not even recreational activities, for at least 1 year+, and that nobody in your personal sphere can understand you.

It's taken me a year of thinking to actually post this, and I can't really give you a reason. Every time before this I either got that constricting sensation and just went back to my status quo instead, or I felt better for maybe a couple of days and then went straight back to it until a few months later I remember and the same thing happens, which has also messed with my ability to get medical help, because it simply doesn't cross my mind until I go through the same brain numbing fucking cycle.

I guess I just want to know if there's anyone else who has suffered/is suffering with these sorts of feelings and if there's anything someone else has done in order to help themselves because after two years of having zero thoughts and zero genuine excitement for anything it's just painful.

143,Positive Psychology and the Wellness Model,"  

The disease or medical model of ‘mental’ health focuses “on a deficit, disease model of human behavior.” The wellness model focuses “on positive aspects of human functioning.""[\[i\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn1) This disease model ‘defective’ emphasis has been the overriding psychiatric perspective for well over a century. 

We must move away from the disease model, which assumes that emotional distress is merely symptomatic of biological illness, and instead embrace a model of mental health and well-being that recognizes our essential and shared humanity. Our mental health is largely dependent on our understanding of the world and our thoughts about ourselves, other people, the future and the world.[\[ii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn2) 

In 2004, the World Health Organization began promoting the advantages of the wellness perspective, declaring health, ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.""[\[iii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn3) The World Psychiatric Association agrees, stating, ""the promotion of well-being is among the goals of the mental health system.""[\[iv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn4) As positive psychologists point out, ""psychological wellbeing is viewed as not only the absence of mental disorder but also the presence of positive psychological resources.""[\[v\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn5) 

The wellness model's chief facilitator is positive psychology (PP), which originated with Maslow's[\[vi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn6) seminal texts on humanism, and was legitimated by Seligman as American Psychological Association president in 1998. The focus of positive psychology and other optimistic approaches, is on virtues and strengths ""not only to endure and survive, but also to flourish.""[\[vii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn7) PP describes recovery as people ""(re-) engaging in their life on the basis of their own goals and strengths, and finding meaning and purpose through constructing and reclaiming a valued identity and valued social roles.""[\[viii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn8) 

Positive psychology is a relatively new field (since 1998) that ostensibly complements and supports rather than replaces traditional psychology. ""Positive psychology serves as an umbrella term to accommodate research investigating positive emotions and other positive aspects such as creativity, optimism, resilience, empathy, compassion, humor, and life satisfaction.""[\[ix\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn9) 

PP has been defined as the science of optimal functioning, its objective ""to study, identify and amplify the strengths and capacities that individuals, families and society need to thrive.""[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn10) Cultural psychologist Levesque[\[xi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn11) describes optimal functioning as the study of how individuals attempt to achieve their personal potentials and become the best that they can be. 

Research has shown that positive psychology interventions ""improved well-being and decreased psychological distress in mildly depressed individuals, in patients with mood and depressive disorders, \[and\] in patients with psychotic disorders.""[\[xii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn12) Studies supports the utilization of positive psychological constructs, theories, and interventions for enhanced understanding and improvement of ‘mental’ health. ""The things that allow people to experience deep happiness, wisdom, and psychological, physical and social wellbeing are the same strengths that buffer against stress and physical and mental illness.""[\[xiii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn13)

A range of approaches promoting wellbeing have been tested in intervention research.  A recent study found positive psychology interventions showed ""significant improvements in mental well-being (from non-flourishing to flourishing mental health) while also decreasing both anxiety and depressive symptom severity.""[\[xiv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn14) Continuing research suggests that a positive psychological outlook not only improves life outcomes but enhances health directly.[\[xv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn15) A meta-analysis of 51 studies with 4,266 individuals utilizing therapies focusing on mindfulness, autobiography, positive writing, gratitude, forgiveness, or kindness, found PPIs ""significantly enhance well-being . . . and decrease depressive symptoms.“[\[xvi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn16)  

The academic discipline of positive psychology continues to develop evidence-based interventions that focus on eliciting positive feelings, cognitions or behaviors.[\[xvii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn17) Independent research shows PPIs ""decreased psychological distress \[in individuals\] with mood and depressive disorders \[and\] patients with psychotic disorders . . . improving quality of life and well-being.""[\[xviii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn18) Positive psychology offers promising interventions ""to support recovery in people with common mental illness, and preliminary evidence suggests it can also be helpful for people with more severe mental illness.""[\[xix\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn19) 

**Positive Psychology 2.0.** One of the early challenges of positive psychology was its inattention to the negative aspects of the individual. Recognizing this imbalance, psychologists advocated a more holistic approach to embrace the dialectical opposition of human experience. Positive Psychology 2.0 (PP 2.0) evolved as a correction to this singular focus on optimism so that it could ""move forward in a more inclusive and balanced matter,[\[xx\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn20) incorporating both positive and negative aspects of the holistic individual. As one psychologist put it, ""people are not just pessimists or optimists. They have complex personality structures.""[\[xxi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn21) PP 2.0 recognizes the individual achieves optimal human functioning by living a meaningful life that comes through full engagement. PP 2.0 is a balanced approach, one that ""equally considers positive emotions and strengths and negative symptoms and disorders.""[\[xxii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn22) 

The positive psychology perspective maintains that individuals with a ‘mental’ disorder can live satisfying and fulfilling lives *regardless* of symptoms or impairments associated with the diagnosis.[\[xxiii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn23) Positive psychology aims ""to emphasize the positive while managing and transforming the negative to increase well-being.""[\[xxiv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn24) 

Positive psychology focuses on enhancing wellbeing and optimal functioning rather than ameliorating symptoms. By emphasizing wellness rather than dysfunction, the positive-psychology movement aims to destigmatize ‘mental’ illness. Positive psychologists believe ""the constructive use of positive psychology perspective is generally needed in contemporary research to complement the long tradition of pathogen orientation.”[\[xxv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn25)

144,"Have C-PTSD, afraid of uncovering memories. Know of any online support communities?","I'm more a lurker than a poster so my sincerest apologies if I'm posting in the wrong place!

***\*\*Warning: Possible triggers below (PTSD, flashbacks, abuse)\*\****

Over the last year and a half I've been on an incredible mental health rollercoaster. In July 2018 my husband and I moved into our first home and thus began my nightmare. We both thought that moving out of our unsavory living situation (bad neighbors) into our own home would be an incredible, exciting, happy adventure. For my husband it was. Right after the move he was truly the happiest I'd ever seen him—but I wasn't and I didn't know why.

For me moving into the house caused this unsettled walking-on-eggshells feeling that reminded me eerily of how I felt growing up. I became hypervigilant, always aware where my husband was in the house and constantly afraid he'd be angry with me over the smallest of things. I also had an incredibly stressful job at the time and had been struggling with a chronic illness for the past few years. I chalked up all my weird feelings to that: ""It must be the work stress."" As the next couple months eked by my relationship with my husband began to deteriorate. He didn't understand why I wasn't happy. He felt abandoned with the work that needed doing around the house because I couldn't muster the energy or will to do much of anything. He started armchair diagnosing me: ""I think you might be bipolar."" or ""Maybe it's BPD, like your mom."" 

In September 2018 he came home from work. I greeted him and began to share some of my day. Unfortunately for many months I hadn't had anything positive to share from work so this was more venting/ranting on my part. This particular night was a breaking point for him. He got mad at me and things became heated and he said, ""I spend all day working with messed up kids, I can't come home to someone who's messed up too!"" (He has since apologized profusely many times, and regrets having said such a thing about his students or me.) 

I began having intense panic attacks at night, right around the time were both falling asleep. They were brought on by fear that he might be masturbating in bed next to me (which he wasn't). I have no problem with my husband masturbating—it's a perfectly normal and healthy activity for all adults. I still do not fully understand exactly why this thought would cause panic attacks. I started having them almost every night. The fear and paranoia that he might be masturbating became so great that several times I confronted him in the middle of the night. By December 2019 I couldn't even sleep in the same room—I'd try to fall asleep, the panic would creep in, and I'd escape to the couch. 

I began desperately researching mental health issues searching for answers. I'd struggled with depression and anxiety periodically through my whole life, but I knew this was something more. In all this research I realized I'm on the autism spectrum, (which turned out to be a totally incidental discovery, but definitely helps me understand myself better). I thought ""Hallelujah, an answer!"" but my panic attacks continued. Fortunately my autism diagnosis helped me find a therapist I really connected with.

I ended up in a partial hospitalization program for 7 weeks, despite the help of my therapist. My anxiety was so high that I could barely function. I spent 3 months on short-term disability. With the time away from the stress of my job my panic attacks all but disappeared. The fog over my mind cleared enough to be begin to start processing the enormous amount of trauma in my past, much of which I had never realized was trauma. It was in sharing small anecdotes and memories with my husband and having his reaction be, ""That's not normal—that wasn't ok."" for me to start to realize that I'd experienced abuse. Emotional abuse from my mother. Verbal abuse from my stepfather. My therapist started helping me to understand that I have C-PTSD from what I went through. It explained the panic, the anxiety, the fear, everything.

And now I'm starting to remember physical abuse. The other day my husband crawled into bed with me to cuddle in the morning (we haven't shared a bed in over a year because of my anxiety/panic). He accidentally leaned on my ankle as he was crawling into bed. It hurt, and suddenly I had the most vivid flashback to my stepfather grabbing my ankle and pulling me out of my bed. I can't remember how old I was but I'd guess between 17-21 (I lived at home through college). 

Lately I've been remembering a lot and having flashbacks, somatic flashbacks, nightmares, the whole shebang. What scares me the most is what I don't remember. There are huge gaps in my memory between 12-22, the entire time I lived at home and my stepfather was in the picture. 

Last night I didn't sleep well (more nightmares). I woke up and heard my husband masturbating (which, again, I don't logically have any issue with) and was overwhelmed with fear. I spent the next ten minutes or so stuck in bed, being able to hear him ever so faintly, and I couldn't bring myself to move. Afraid of saying anything because when I'd first started having panic over him masturbating in the bed he would get so angry with me. 

In hindsight a lot of my relationship with sex involved some element of fear. Vacillating between a very high sex-drive and virtually none at all throughout my life. When I was younger I felt deeply that my value as a woman was based on my sexual value to the men I was seeing. If they didn't express interest I'd become terrified they were going to leave me. Conversely I was incredibly afraid of male genitalia. With the three sexual partners I had before my husband I somehow managed to almost completely avoid every touching or seeing their anatomy. I know this was a conscious effort on my part. With my husband I've always felt safe, so I thought I'd overcome this fear years ago after meeting him. 

In retrospect all of this makes me very afraid of the things I don't remember. Was I sexually abused by my stepfather? I honestly don't know and it scares the living hell out of me. But it would explain why I've had nightmares about him ever since I moved out of my mother's house. Why I'll have flashbacks of just his face. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? Or know of online support groups for C-PTSD? 

I need other people to talk to about this besides my husband and therapist and don't know where to turn...

145,"My experience with panic attacks, various medications, and a badass book that made all the difference","Cross-posted from r/PanicAttack

Brief back story first: I'm temporarily single-parenting 4 young children overseas while my husband works an ocean away for about 4 months. I am normally a very calm, competent, rational person and not prone to emotional outbursts or even emotional roller coasters. At all. I didn't cry when I got married. I didn't cry when my kids were born. I didn't even freak out when my 3rd baby was born before the midwife arrived and stopped breathing and I had to resuscitate her. That's the kind of calm person I am. Okay, now onto the main story...

About 4 weeks into our separation, I had these crazy symptoms--what I now know was a panic attack--that lasted all night long, persisted much of the next day, and lasted about half the next night. My symptoms were racing heart, heart palpitations, chest pain/pressure, waves of fear and adrenaline, sweating, dizziness, weakness, trembling, nausea, and full-body tingling. I thought I was having a heart attack and went into emergency care. They did an EKG, ran a huge battery of blood tests, and all they could tell me was ""Nothing is wrong with your heart.""

6 weeks later this happened again and lasted about 5 days. Again, I thought it was a heart attack and went in to emergency care. Same slew of tests, same lack of helpfulness in giving any answers other than that my heart was fine.

After this 2nd episode, it only took me 5 minutes with Dr. Google to figure out what it likely was. Panic attacks! 

I had a 3rd attack lasting a few days and then a 4th attack soon after, again lasting a few days. I met with my family doctor and she confirmed my suspicions that I was experiencing panic attacks. 

I'm normally not one to take medications, but as I was not sleeping and not functioning but still responsible for 4 young children, I was desperate.

She put me on 10 mg Paxil daily (SSRI/antidepressant) and bromazepam 1.5 mg as needed. Bromazepam is a mild sedative and at very small doses can calm down a panic attack. This with the goal of getting me through the last month until my husband returned.

For the first few days everything just slooooowed way down and the attacks mostly stopped. But then the Paxil sent me into a depression. The attacks started coming again nonstop. I felt numb and dark and very somber. And on top of that I stopped sleeping again. I started having dark thoughts. That freaked me out and immediately I knew I needed to change something.

So 10 days into the medications, I had a doctor come do a house call (a benefit of living in this particular European country! Doctors do house calls night or day!) He was amazing and spent an hour going over everything in great detail and exploring some additional possible somatic causes (low magnesium, for example).

He advised me to immediately stop Paxil, gave me an antihistamine to help me sleep (25 mg hydroxyzine aka Atarax/Vistaril), and generally was AMAZING. We are running some more blood tests and I'll get my results back in a few days. 

By time I had the house call doctor come, I'd been working on doing lots of deep breathing and meditation to calm down the panic attacks. During the day I could generally stop the attacks really soon, but I was still having issues at night being woken up by a full-blown attack that just wouldn't calm down even with the bromazepam.

A few days ago I read a book about a counter-intuitive approach to panic attacks: [Badass Ways to End Anxiety & Stop Panic Attacks](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Ways-Anxiety-Panic-Attacks/dp/9090305262) by Geert Verschaeve. It was amazing. Instead of trying to resist/stop/fight panic attacks by deep breathing or relaxation, you either  

* a) laugh at them--humor and anxiety can't co-exist
* b) give them the middle finger by, essentially, deliberately inviting them on and saying ""come on, give me your worst!"" or 
* c) accept and welcome the attacks as a sign that your body is desperately trying to protect you (although in a very unpleasant way). 

BEST ADVICE EVER. I've done all of the above strategies and all of them work. Bam.

It's been 5 days since that last doctor's house call. I made some drastic changes in my life (flew my MIL in from overseas to help with the kids until my husband comes back). I've been sleeping better and better and now have reduced the antihistamine to a half dose (otherwise I'm super groggy the whole next day--it's powerful!). The daytime attacks have stopped entirely and the night attacks got less and less. I haven't had a strong night attack at all for a few days. I've stopped using bromazepam entirely.

I know this is super long. If you got through it, thanks! But I want to leave you with this main message: your panic attack is your body desperately trying to keep you away from danger. Your body is trying to help you! Don't think of your body as your enemy or of the attacks as something you need to fight, to resist, or to stop. Instead, embrace the attacks and tell your body, sincerely, ""Thank you so much for keeping me safe. Thank you so much. I'm okay, so you can stop freaking out. But thank you for caring so much about me."" I had some nights where I'd repeat this over and over, feeling an immense amount of love for myself and especially my body (which, previously, I had described as my ""enemy"").",1522823730.0,False,1,0,frozendoctor,None,89n3xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/89n3xp/my_experience_with_panic_attacks_various/
146,Anxiety - an Overview and Ways to Treat It,"**Introduction**

Do you often feel anxious, or do you know someone else who is? Read on to find about more about what it is it, and learn a number strategies to help prevent it, or reduce the severity of the symptoms if you have it.

Anxiety is a common mental health problem, which is prevalent throughout the world and can be really serious in some cases. Studies show that more than 1 in 10 people will develop a disabling anxiety disorder at some stage in their life.

Anxiety is usually assessed on a degree of severity, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe.

There are a number of different anxiety disorders, which include: generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and selective mutism.

&#x200B;

**Symptoms**

The symptoms associated with anxiety are quite varied, and can range from quite mild or to quite severe.

**1)** **Behavioural** \- social withdrawal, sleeping problems, loss of appetite, increased motor tension.

**2)** **Emotional** \- feelings of dread, trouble concentrating, feeling tense or jumpy, anticipating the worst, irritability, restlessness, blank mind, nightmares, obsessions about sensations, sense of 'deja vu', feeling trapped in your mind.

**3) Cognitive** \- thoughts about suspected dangers, such as fear of dying, believing that chest pains are heart attack, believing shooting pains in your head are a tumor or aneurysm, feeling an intense fear when you think of dying, or you may think of it more often than normal, or can't get it out of your mind.

**4) Physiological** \- headaches, vertigo, digestive problems, nausea, shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue.

&#x200B;

**Cause**

The risk factors associated with anxiety include:

**1) Neuroanatomical** \- Neural circuitry involving the amygdala (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the HPA Axis and sympathetic nervous system) and hippocampus (which is implicated in emotional memory along with the amygdala) is thought to underlie anxiety. People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala.

**2)** **Genetics** \- Genetics and family history may put an individual at increased risk of an anxiety disorder, but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation.

**3) Medical** **conditions** \- Many medical conditions can cause anxiety. This includes conditions that affect the ability to breathe, like COPD and asthma, and the difficulty in breathing that often occurs near death. Conditions that cause abdominal pain or chest pain can cause anxiety and may in some cases be a somatization of anxiety.

**4) Substance-induced** \- Several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, withdrawal or from chronic use. These include alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, sedatives (including prescription benzodiazepines), opioids (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin), stimulants (such as caffeine, cocaine and amphetamines), hallucinogens, and inhalants.

**5) Psychological** \- Poor coping skills (e.g., rigidity/inflexible problem solving, denial, avoidance, impulsivity, extreme self-expectation, negative thoughts, affective instability, and inability to focus on problems) are associated with anxiety. Anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person's own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity. Temperament (e.g., neuroticism) and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) have been found to be risk factors for anxiety.

**6) Social** \- Social risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma (e.g., physical, sexual or emotional abuse or assault), early life experiences and parenting factors (e.g., rejection, lack of warmth, high hostility, harsh discipline, high parental negative affect, anxious childrearing, modelling of dysfunctional and drug-abusing behaviour, discouragement of emotions, poor socialization, poor attachment, and child abuse and neglect), cultural factors (e.g., stoic families/cultures, persecuted minorities including the disabled), and socioeconomics (e.g., uneducated, unemployed, impoverished although developed countries have higher rates of anxiety disorders than developing countries).

**Tip 1: Mindfulness**

Mindfulness is a psychological process, which involves bringing one’s attention to what you are experiencing in the present moment, which can be developed through the practice of meditation.

To perform mindfulness you must adopt a particular orientation toward one’s experiences in the present moment, which is characterised by a mixture of acceptance, curiosity, and openness.

Mindfulness practice has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, stress, anxiety, and can is also used to treat drug addiction.

**1) Awareness** \- Notice the thoughts which arise in your mind, and the sensations that feel in your body. Do they feel hot or cold? Notice your heart beat. Be aware of your breathing. Allow yourself to feel these sensations without resistance

**2) Acceptance -** Rather than accept or reject your thoughts, try to just observe them without judgement and allow them to flow in and out of your mind.

**3) Present Moment** \- We often worry about the future or dwell on the past, but you should learn to focus on the present moment, and bring your attention back to what is happening in the now.

&#x200B;

**Tip 2: Breathing**

Square breathing is a simple technique which involves taking slow, deep breaths. It is good for stress reduction, and can increase performance and concentration.

To start, visualise a square, then follow the instructions going clockwise:

**1)** Breathe in for 4 seconds picturing one side of the square.

**2)** Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the second side of the square.

**3)** Breathe out over 4 seconds visualising the third side of the square.

**4)** Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the fourth side of the square.

This exercise should be completed as many times as required for the breathing to become calm and regular.

&#x200B;

**Tip 3: Other Ideas**

**1)** **Keep** **a** **journal** \- Write down your current thoughts, and brainstorm possible solutions to your problems.

**2) Reading** \- Read one of your favourite books, or shop around for a new self-help book.

**3)** **Write a poem** \- Turn your current worries and problems into a poem to give meaning to them.

**4) Colouring** \- Get some coloured pencils, or crayons, and draw whatever comes to mind. Try some random patterns, or if you are feeling more adventurous create a stunning piece of art.

**5)** **Music** \- Listen to your favourite band, or play your instrument if you have one.

**6)** **Dance** \- Move your body to your favourite song, to help keep fit and distract yourself at the same time.

**7)** **Walk** \- Take a walk outside and, and pay attention to your surroundings. Count houses, cars or trees as you pass them.

**8) Relaxation** \- Take a warm, relaxing bubble bath or a warm shower, which ever you prefer.

**9)** **List** \- Write a list of positive things in your life, such as good memories and your best attributes, and read them whenever you feel bad.

**10)** **Triggers** \- Make a list of your triggers, and give it to your therapist if you have one.

&#x200B;

**Quotes**

To end this post, here’s a few of my favourite quotes related to anxiety:

“Fear is excitement without the breath.” \~ Fritz Perls  
“You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.” \~ Jon Kabat-Zinn  
“Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass; it's about learning to dance in the rain.” \~ Vivian Greene  
“Accept - then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it.” \~ Eckhart Tolle",1568844458.0,False,2,2,Sbeast,None,d64j9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/d64j9g/anxiety_an_overview_and_ways_to_treat_it/
147,I have no clue why I am so ill; can anyone offer a little guidance?,"I humbly request that you please read the whole post if you have the time and are willing to help. Thank you in advance.

Hello. I’m a male on the younger side, only a handful of years out of high school. I’ve been struggling with symptoms for over half a decade. After multiple instances of comprehensive neuropsych testing and a slew of medications and therapists, I still haven’t the faintest idea what condition I might be struggling with.


While I understand that human psychology isn’t necessarily accounted for by reductionist labels, I still find my self desperately wishing for a diagnostic basis to help me and others understand what I’m dealing with and what kind of help I need. 


My symptoms first became debilitating when i was still a teen in hs. I usually described the emptiness and unfamiliarity that I experienced, and this lead to my initial diagnosis of depression, which stuck for about a year. It was an easy label since there was a general abundance of depressed teens, and there wasn’t any reason I shouldn’t have fit the bill. That is, until it became clear that my behavior and symptoms strayed a bit too far from depression alone. 

At some point, it became normal for me to forget very basic things, like my name. Writing would appear as arbitrary shapes with no inherent meaning. Time would pass and I would not remember anything of it. Around this time, I began telling others that i felt as though I’m living a dream I haven’t woken up from, or that “someone is in my head, controlling my body and mouth, speaking my thoughts, and I’m just watching them live my life in my body.” Sometimes I would cease moving or talking, and enter a trance. I began to feel immense anxiety about small things; talking to people, brushing my teeth, getting out of bed in the morning, the like. I switched therapists, and the new therapist suggested i consider a condition called dpdr, depersonalization and derealization. 

Towards the end of high school, i was sent to a wilderness rehabilitation program for delinquent minors. Here, i began having minor delusions, such as feeling things watch or touch me, or believing myself to be sick in ways i was clearly not. In truth, the delusions were probably a result of my obsession with fear; I was so hypervigilant that my mind would desperately spin in circles around anything it could imagine as a threat, and over time I began convincing myself that I was indeed in danger from shadows around me and the feelings in my body.

After a diagnostic neuro-psych test, I was officially diagnosed with bipolar type 2 for all of 3 days before my therapist shot it down, saying that the basis for the diagnosis was flawed and that my “acting out” and troubled adolescent behavior should not be confused for mania. For the record, this behavior included acts such as setting fire to classroom objects and breaking into private buildings. 

In all of this, i had a recurring somatic experience that seriously weighed on me - my right neck would always feel vulnerable, and I would have to cover it when i got stressed. In an effort to confront my fear, I lay with my neck exposed one night. I opened my eyes after a few minutes with the notion that someone was watching me. I saw a massive dark figure in my room; immediately i was screaming for my mother in my first language (turkish) which I had not spoken regularly in years. When my parents entered my room, I did not believe they were mine; they were clearly impostors. They would lick their lips and never blink, but they tried to look like my parents. I was unbelievably terrified. I felt imminent doom, and I froze. I did not sleep that night or the next, much less leave my room. My thoughts raced and never stopped, the voice in my head kept morphing into terrible screaming and inhuman rasps, tripping over itself and never stopping. Over the next few months, i would have many delusions; that the water from the shower was going to come into contact with a power line and electrocute and kill me; that I was a dead walking corpse; that I was actually deluding myself into thinking i lived in reality, and i needed to take certain unreasonable actions to free my mind from the simulation, or was receiving secret hints from outside the simulation that I needed to follow. I would sleep with the lights on because i kept seeing figures in the dark and would never sleep otherwise. 

The meds I had tried up to this point had been a slew of  mostly antidepressants. Lexapro, Effexor, Wellbutrin, etc and a few anxiety medications such as klonopin. Now, my psychiatrist prescribed me Abilify instead. It didn’t do anything except make me incredibly angry. 

Eventually, mirtazipine ended up working, allowing me to sleep without terror. I still have delusions on and off but altogether much less frequently, i can go months without any.

After many years, i have amassed a detailed account of my recurrent behavior patterns as well, and these also concern me.

I am a boiling cesspool of anger. I try so hard to keep it to myself because i know i always regret it when i treat others poorly, and i love the people in my life. Considering the discrepancy between what I feel and how I act, i’d say i do a very good job. However, it still comes out at times. I can blow up inside over people so much as talking to me at times. If they interrupt my thoughts, i feel rage. If they talk to me kindly, I feel rage. If they talk as if I might not know something, I feel rage. Then I feel rage at myself, because none of them deserve the way i think about them. I really hate myself, as the primary emotional threat to those close to me. I feel I deserve to suffer and repent for these thoughts; i put myself through all sorts of pain as it is the only way to at least assuage the burden of my hatred without hurting anyone else.

Sometimes I think i’m god’s gift, a beautiful god among mortals. Usually I just think i’m the most hideous curse to ever grace the earth. I can’t bear to look at my grotesque face in the mirror, but i can’t pull myself away. I starve myself. Not too much, i don’t think I have an eating disorder, but enough so that I get dizzy while walking or exercising sometimes. 

My mind never stops turning sometimes. I can’t complete menial tasks because i’m worrying that my veins will get caught on things and tear open (i have a lot of visible veins because im fairly lean + muscular) or that i’ll rupture an aneurism if my heart rate rises. I think about my veins and my face sturcture and hair, i always fiddle with all of it and they always seem off. I’m terrified of being dirty and I wash my hands over and over. They get very dry but they never crack and bleed. I almost always wipe my ass until there is blood on the toiled paper though. I skip any important appointment if i’m unable to shower even if i’m not dirty (i shower once daily, but sometimes i do it more often if i feel the need). I also skip them if my face is too fat in the mirror, although everyone tells me I am looking thin. My entire day, all of my thoughts, just mull over these menial things, flying in eccentric ellipses around worthless and mundane anxieties over hair and shit and oil and subcutaneous fat. 

Sometimes I get scared because my hand moves and lifts up something but i didn’t tell it to. I can’t tell if it’s really mine.

My diagnosis is currently “depression with anxiety and dissociations.” Healthcare providers treat me like somebody “blowing a run of the mill mood disorder out of proportion.” I don’t believe them. 

My therapist has apparently ruled out OCD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. I believe him, but if I have reason to doubt his judgement, both he an I are willing to revisit the possibility. He says there is a realistic possibility that I have PTSD, but that it’s not likely enough for a diagnosis. I don’t have any traumatic memories. The closest I can get is watching people overdose and die and men beating their sisters and wives unconscious in an alley I lived across when I was a little boy in Turkey. I don’t have clear fear around these memories though. I also don’t think my psychotic symptoms are explained by PTSD.

I exercise regularly and am in great physical shape. I take my meds consistently, and I have people I care about and people that care about me. None of these things relieve me of the ceaseless suffering. 

Do any of my symptoms ring bells for anyone? Where could I look for help?

148,"How fluid are you, really?","The doctrine of fluidity 

Over the course of a few years I have witnessed mental illness and it’s true master, rigidity. In meditation I have studied this state of being in myself, and in those areas where I am more rigid, I sense internal conflict and pain. What’s more... physical sensations, those we refer to as somatic, accompany these feelings. 

“Don’t do that. You shouldn’t be doing that. You shouldn’t be thinking that. That’s wrong. Why do I feel this way?” These are but a few of the thoughts that are bred from internal conflict. Internal conflict, psychology would call, dissonance. 

I believe all suffering may be traced back to a moral designation or value once placed on an idea, and it’s related concepts. As one learns that one of his thoughts is “bad,” he will be met with internal conflict related to said thought. As the individual engages with thoughts, which are, or appear to be related to the original thought, the individual’s conflict grows. And as anyone versed in the mind knows, the more dissonance, the more dis-ease. And I’d argue the more dis-ease, the more disease. 

We as human beings are on an ever ongoing quest to seek to be optimal social animals. In so doing, we require guidance, a baseline if you will, with regards to those things that are considered, at bare minimum, harmless. However, we seek those things that would be beneficial as well, to increase our standing among our peers. And while this is admirable and desirable, what we begin to notice too, are those things which are suboptimal. It is most likely that we do this as a form of personal threat detection. We identify those patterns which are benign, optimal, and detrimental. And in our constant struggle to optimize, we begin to over evaluate thoughts or behaviors as suboptimal, or in other words, wrong or bad. 

Now in the realm of behavior, some things are objectively bad for social creatures. Taking out our frustrations on an otherwise harmless peer is bad. And in recognition of this, we attempt to socialize our young, and in some cases, rectify the socialization of those much older. However, what thoughts are “bad”? Now this is not so easy a consideration. 

In truth, it appears that qualitative distinctions have rendered many of us immobile. At least in so far as our thoughts are concerned. Instead of creating a culture in which we engage with our thoughts, and learn about what they are trying to tell us, we try to push them away. At least this has been my observation as a westerner, and I do not presume to know what eastern philosophy regarding thought is or might be. 

We try to push these thoughts and feelings that accompany them away, in all sorts of ways. Some of these methods may be useful in the short run. For instance, there may be a reason, evolutionary or otherwise, for binge eating or fasting when an individual is under undue or prolonged periods of stress. 

Though when this behavior becomes common place, and associated with any level of stress, then the individual has developed a pattern of behaviors and thoughts which are not beneficial to them. Notice here that such things were not labeled as bad, or wrong. Simply stated, they are not helpful, or beneficial. They needn’t be regarded as anything else. 

From the standpoint of moral or value judgments, these behaviors may be regarded as wrong. After all, we are meant to eat with a particular balance from this lens. However, when labeled as such, an individual is perhaps furthered into a state of distress, as they engage in manners they deem as harmful. Given that the individual, generally, does not want to cause harm to themself, then it stands to reason that the recognition of doing so, perhaps compulsively, would lead to a heightened state of anxiety.

Now if distress is what leads the individual to engage in these behaviors, then surely furthering this distress, by way of devaluation, can only foster the continuation of said patterns. 

The solution here seems so simple. Stop doing those things, that cause you distress, which are created from distress. However, how does an individual stop doing these things, if they can’t stop feeling distressed? 

My claim is that when the individual does not regard circumstances, thoughts or feelings as being “less than” then they are free from their perceived gravity. 

However, the issue at hand is not simply the quality placed upon circumstances, internal or external. The true obstacle arises when the individual assaults their personal character by associating those distinctions with themselves. 

For instance, if I regard smoking as bad, and I smoke in order to quell my anxiety. However, then regard myself as being bad for smoking, which gives me anxiety, and am unable to stop. Then how might I feel about myself in the long run? I might consider myself bad. And as I don’t want to be bad, as being bad does not help a social animal, then I will begin to feel the stress of this internal conflict. Which then, of course, leads to more anxiety. 

It is almost by design that our patterns are cyclic, and often times, experientially, paradoxical. The real questions seem to be, what makes me anxious? And how can I learn to engage with those things more effectively so as to reduce this emotion, thereby making it easier to quit smoking? And how might I characterize the act of smoking in a way, which does not label it morally?

I’ve often times said that psycho education is integral, as well as absolutely fundamental, to the development of an individual. Westerners, specifically those of the liberal alignment, have attempted to create a society in which almost anything goes from a value standpoint. Some have done this, I believe, in an attempt to decrease the distress felt by those in benign categories of action or thought. However, as we are social creatures who maintain our well being by usage of sign posts or guidelines, we have difficulty living this way. As conservative elements of moral propositions regarding action still exist, we cannot fully liberate ourselves from giving these values to our thoughts, as our thoughts can often feel like actions already perpetrated. 

It is through psycho education, at a young age, that I feel we might be able to bridge the gap in the differences between our thoughts, as potentialities or simulations, and our actions. This may be achieved by incorporating things as simple as having developing human beings discuss their thoughts with a professional who is versed in sifting through human experience. 

Once an openness to exploration is fostered, an individual is less likely to stray away from said thoughts in a manner which deems them a negative charge. The state of Openness, of course, is in direct opposition to the closed nature of rigidity.


(Notice I have given little to no advice on how to foster openness. I’d love to hear from others who have done work on themselves to reduce rigidity. Be it anything from parts work to exposure therapy. Let’s help others who might be struggling to be more experientially open and less distressed)",1558541367.0,False,0,2,MichaelOlan,None,brqn55,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/brqn55/how_fluid_are_you_really/
149,Kind of struggling to take decisions in terms of how to pick a new study/life/geography path ?,"Hi !  I've been tip toeing around the idea of writing here for a long while, so here i go. Might be a long post (EDIT : it is. he last 3 bullet points are about my situation atm if you want to skip ! )

I'm a 23 yo, and I'm since quite a long time now facing a huge wave (or waves) of changes. I'm in this transitional state where the things I had to quit have been left behind, but i'm still not feeling able to take any decisions. My brain is like a slow hamster wheel, kind of under control in terms of speed, but going round and round in terms of problem solving. i'm going to try to recap the facts + feels.

First of all, I started studying very young, I was 17, freshly out of high school. I started studying arts and fashion design in Paris, in the best schools out there, as it was my secret dream since I was 12. And it was hard, as it's supposed to be. my mental health wasn't great but it was much better in a way than what it was before I turned 18, and I was trying to grow as a person and overcome the obstacles that come up when you want to study fashion and are insecure. And then, two years in, I started to actually study fashion design, and everything started to take a bad turn. The teachers, in this famous uni, that required a very long and tough contest to get in, were the worse. I won't go into details because it's still quite traumatic for me, but let's say their methods of pedagogy were non existant and they ended up not teaching anything and only criticising the intents. I resisted 2 years, and in the middle of the 2nd year I had a big burnout, and stared at the ceiling for 2 months, unable to feel anything. During this time, I was extremely peaceful and quiet ; just before I broke down, I realised I couldn't do it anymore, and that I actually didn't want to DO it anymore. I took me 4 years to realise it, and 1 more to accept to let go of this path.

That takes us to me, stubborn as a donkey, doing an exchange program the next year (last year) to still study fashion but in another school. Usually you do a semester abroad, then you go back to your school to do your last 3 semesters and be graduated. It didn't work that way ; I was extremely weak and depressed, spent most of my days crying and having to take 3 hours long naps in the middle of the day (the hormones + the body don't deal well with acute stress). The main problem to me was that if I left my studies right there and then, what would I do ? I was learning the language of the country, having absolutely no hopes or dreams or desires about anything, struggling to feel anything but fear and tremendous loss. I had moved to another country, where I had friends and I felt good in, but couldn't see myself settle there without a plan. And going back to Paris in this university was at that point completely impossible. As I was navigating that I stupidly didn't seek help and I was really really low.

I wrote my master's thesis, because I was really passionate about it, and I loved writing it. I had to go back to France in June to present it, and I had made the decision to ask for a gap year so that I could take time to think. The presentation of the thesis went good, but the rest of the contact with my uni was a disaster. Picture a fight between middle schoolers, and you'll have an idea of what it felt like. It's just heartbreaking to communicate and never be listened to or taken in consideration, even in a class of 10 students. I felt like I was going to crumble down again, so after a lot of debates with myself and friends I just quit the uni cold turkey. That means, I don't have any diploma from the 5 years I studied.

I stayed in Germany because I felt better there than in France. This year I took a job in retail (ain't fun but at least my head is above the water), I'm continuing to learn german and I'm doing a Yoga teacher training, something i've been wanting to do for 5 years, and it feels nice to learn things. But here's the sticky part. My mental health is still quite bad, I'm able to have longer periods where i'm not completely not ok, but when I'm not ok I think it's to the level where I should take medications. The problem is I still cannot really feel positive emotions, I can dissociate for quite long periods of time, and I can't seem able to take any decisions. Let me bullet point it out :

\- I have to decide what I'm going to study for next year or the year after, to have some sort of a professional project. Lately i've felt a pull towards osteopathy or somatic practices, and it feels really good to have something I can think about and not just nothing as it was until then. But when I look at the studies, I would have to go back to France for 5 years, and I have people I love there but so many things that are for me really traumatic : the language, the mentality, the fact that you need some money to just get by in Paris (where i'd study).

\- there comes the 2nd choice, the geography of things : I really like Berlin but I feel completely unable to settle down here and enjoy the present moment because I feel like the city doesn't carry a future for me in terms of studying (I would need to master the language, which I can do, but I don't want to realise half way there that I actually don't want to live in Germany) (living abroad is so loaded, even if i'm m aware it's such a privilege for me to have the choice). Paris hurt me a lot, the mindset of the city and the political climate are very tough, but some of my closest friends are there and ready to welcome me back there. I could study there but I'm not sure I could find peace and grounding. My bonds with my friends from France are changing and getting a little looser, and i don't feel safe to explore and build my life here and now in Berlin.

\- and in the end it's this whole identity crisis that comes up : if I can't seem to know where I want to be and what I want to do, how can I make choices ? If i'm always a foot out the door in terms of everything in Berlin or in Paris, how can I be alive ?  My mom just told me it's symptomatic for me to feel lost, and that i won't ever feel ok with any thing because it's me (that was nice). I try to take all of the things i've learned in the past 20 years, to remain present and to breathe and to give me time, bu i'm really scared to never find this feeling of home and belonging somewhere, in any language, in any studies. I really want to be able to make decisions and trust what they have for me, but I need to make them first and I am completely and utterly lost. It's like I've jumped and I am floating, waiting to see an appealing place to land but I can't see anything, it's all foggy, so I keep floating. I can't think of having feelings for someone, or something, because it might leave me or i might leave it.

Anywayyy this is my messy brain at the moment. I'm quite sad. It's getting slowly better, but I'm really not grounded. Does anyone have a similar experience ? How'd you get out of it ? What is home for you ?

thank you for reading this novel haha

150,Illness Anxiety Disorder,"TL;DR I think I have illness anxiety disorder and I'm having trouble coping. Looking for suggestions on management

I am self diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder (DSM no longer considers hypochondria a thing - its separated as Somatic Symptom Illness and Illness Anxiety Disorder) Growing up I never was particularly a hypochondriac, beyond the feeling that if someone near me felt sick in a contagious manner, so did I. So if I was next to someone with a broken arm, my arm didn't hurt too. But if you tell me you feel nauseous, so do I. I wasn't rushed to the doctor for every little ailment as a child, but the times I did go were appropriate.

All this started later on - and I can trace it to one event. I never wanted to be 'that' mom who called the doctor for every little thing. So when my 15 day old son got sick, I figured it was just a cold and treated it as such, not wanting to bother the doctor with silly new mom concern. A close friend who was in medical school at the time came by and mentioned he really didn't like my sons breathing, or color (the change was slow and subtle, and I missed it). I had been checking his temperature, and it wasn't high at any point. In fact, it was low - something I learned later was how a newborn would react to illness. At his encouragement, we brought my son to the emergency room. I remember being almost annoyed, because I thought it was an overreaction. Within moments of bringing him, we were triaged ahead of everyone else there. They brought us in a small room to take my sons vital signs, and swept him away quickly, the nurse began to explain what we were about to see. Moments later, we were brought to the room next door, where my son was sedated and was in the process of being intubated. I was told had I waited until the morning, he would not have survived. He was placed into a medically induced coma for the next two weeks while his five pound body fought the strong virus - he had RSV. It was traumatic of course, but it had a happy ending - he is not a silly and annoying 7 year old with no indication of those scary times besides a tiny scar from a central line. For a long time, I didn't trust myself, I was scared to be alone with my baby, in case I missed something else. 

Over time, I gained confidence, and learned to message the doc anytime I was worried. Things got better, and because of my experiences , I found my passion and I decided to go to nursing school. This is when nursing school hypochondria kicked in (not entirely uncommon in the medical profession, convincing yourself you have everything you learn about!) Overall it wasn't too terrible, but I definitely became more aware of the goings-on in my body. 

Skip to this year, June. I've been working as a nurse, I have high blood pressure (I've had it since my first pregnancy), somewhat controlled, but not perfect. I had a headache for about two weeks. It was worst right where my head and neck met, and by my eyes. My blood pressure at this time was elevated, likely from the pain, but not in severe range. I ignored it all. 

Then, one day I went to sleep after work ( I work nightshift, some I was asleep during the day). I woke up to pee as I always do, and realized half my body was numb. I stumbled down the stairs and assumed I had been sleeping funny and waited for the tingles to wear off as I sleepily woke up a bit. I stumbled back up the stairs, and I realized I *could not* stand straight without falling to the right side, and it was my entire right side - hands, feet, arms, legs, even face that was tingling. I was so so so dizzy and I was scared. I tried to text my husband (I didn't want to scare my kids) and I had absolutely no coordination to do to. Luckily, I managed to send him some gibberish and he came to investigate what was going on. I told him something was wrong and we needed to go to the ER. I was so scared. My husband said I was slurring my speech, but it felt like I was being perfectly clear. I knew something wasn't right and I knew I should know what but I couldn't put my finger on it. We went to the ER and they did a stroke assessment on me and that when I realized that is what I couldn't put my finger on (It showed negative). The gave me an EKG, IV fluids, Toradol (my head was still pounding) and a Xanax, ran some labs, and brought me over for a MRI of my brain. The MRI showed that I did not have a stroke, nor did I have a brain tumor. (Interestingly, I have a fetal anomaly of my Circle of Willis, more on that later) My labs were all within normal limits, and my tingling was fading away. I was still dizzy, but I could stand upright without falling over. They said I had a panic attack, and sent me on my way. I specifically remember saying ""But does that account for my symptoms?"" ""Not really"" ""Do people really wake up from sleep with a panic attack?"" ""Not usually"". And yet that was my diagnosis. When I got home, I called my sister in law who had just left her job as a neuro NP (which, she reamed me out for not calling her in the moment! I just wanted to get the ER, I didn't think of it in the moment.) She asked if they did a MRA of my neck and I confusedly said no. She insisted that I needed one, and she was coming with me to my primary care doctor follow up that day to make sure. I think my primary thought she was nuts, but since my insurance covered it, went ahead and sent me for it. He agreed it was not a panic attack, he thought it was from a migraine. Again however, it didn't really account for my symptoms. After a little unimportant clusterfuck of a situation, I finally got my MRA results. I had had a vertebral artery dissection (VAD) - a tear in the artery in my neck leading to my brain (and hey, thats why I had symptoms!!) Usually, if a person has a VAD, they will have a stroke since the blood is blocked. My neurosurgeon thinks I didn't have a stroke because of my fetal anomaly - my brain gets blood two ways. So I had stroke symptoms because I was getting less blood than normal, but not an actual stroke. The MRA showed I had the acute dissection on one side, but I also had an older, healed dissection on the other side. I also had pretty significant stenosis (narrowing) in both my vertebral arteries. 

So it's rare to have a VAD, and even rarer so to have TWO, so we spent the summer investigating symptoms that never added up - including my high blood pressure at such an early age. A MRA of my renal arteries showed that I have severe stenosis (narrowing) - we switched up my medication and for the first time in seven years, my blood pressure is within normal limits. My latest 6month follow up shows that my latest VAD is healed and I have NO MORE stenosis in my vertebral arteries. All things on all accounts are good. 

Except, because of this experience, I am so anxious still. Initially it was horrible. I wouldn't be alone, I wouldn't drive, I panicked constantly, I was TERRIFIED to go to sleep. I spent a lot of time doing Headspace, coloring, and relaxing. The Sleep With Me podcast changed my life and helped me sleep and turn my 'brain bots' off. I've taught myself a lot of coping techniques - chewing gum, deep breathing, writing, mantras etc., even doing self neuro checks help me a lot. But now I feel EVERYTHING in my body and I'm always worried its something more than normal and something is wrong and I don't know it. A sharp pain in my belly isn't gas, it must my gallbladder becoming inflamed. A ache in my calf isn't a pulled muscle, it's a DVT. I'm so scared everything is more than it is. I get anxious when I go out alone still, sometimes it's worse than other times, but it's almost always. My logical and illogical mind fight all the time. My illogical mind says ""Your neck hurts! It's happening again! AHHHHH!"" While my logical mind is rolling it's eyes and reminding me that I slept funny last night and it's not the same kind of pain. I just can't seem to talk myself down enough. I know time is going to help. The longer I go without anything happening, the more I can trust that everything is okay. I take medication, which helps a little.

I've seen a few therapists, and their reactions are always one of two things. One, I have coping techniques, keep doing those. Or two, it's not that bad, just chill out. (GEE?! YOU THINK?! THANKS SO MUCH!) I want to not feel like this anymore, not just cope and survive. with it. I'm just not sure how to get there. Like I said, I know time is a factor. When it first happened, I was anxious and thinking about it all the time. Then, I would be able to go a few hours entirely distracted. Then, a half a day. Now, there are days where I don't think about it at all. But more often, I still do. I am still constantly worrying, wondering if something is going numb. Worrying that it  -- or something else -- will happen again. 

Not sure if anyone out there has any advice, but I just wanted to throw my story out there just in case....and major props if you managed to read this whole thing!!

151,The life growing up with a mother who suffers from delusional disorders....,"Edit: Seriously if you read all of this, props to you and thanks so much. :)

Well... I'm just going to vent, or rant, because I just feel stuck and there's not much I can do about it but maybe talking about it will make me feel better.

So for background, I'm a girl & 23. My mother suffers from delusional disorders. Technically officially diagnosed about 4 years ago but from my view has been around for as long as I can remember. Though I would say slowly worsened throughout the years. 
By the way I don't know how fast a psychiatrist can diagnose something like this, they did it within a week because she got sent for a psych evaluation by the police, the result being delusional disorder, and said probably persecutory with some grandiose. (From my own observations since then, there's a hint of somatic as well)

Anyway I essentially grew up with her being like this, but it wasn't till she was diagnosed that it -clicked- that there was something wrong with her. Definitely before then I thought she was just being really really effing difficult.

Today she is a constant source of conflict. I think all of us immediately family members have taken this too long and so our fuses are very short. Personally I can't stand talking or just listening to her even for a few minutes, because when I do I just slowly get more irritated and angrier until I can't take it anymore which either leads to yelling or me storming off. I don't know.. I just think this has impacted me so negatively and even though I logically think its not her fault that she is this way, any feelings of sympathy or love have been buried under years of confusion, annoyance, irritation, conflicts, personal attacks, etc. I can't have peace of mind in my own house.

Honestly I'm concerned with how I'm turning out as a person because of this. I've been trying to get more independent and I guess I'm on the upward slope now but now and again I still get really worried and anxious about this. My own mental health is something I think about (other than being concerned whether I will ever become delusional and not know it), things like my self-esteem, my lack of social awareness, feeling depressed (not officially but at least in the very very sad sense), emotional expression or communication..... Like sometimes when I feel somewhat depressed (there is a long story about this) and then I start thinking of suicide I'm just so confused at whether these are normal thoughts or not (*I am NOT suicidal, I've NEVER seriously considered suicide, my thoughts are typically; life sucks, there's no point, I'd be okay being dead, man I wish I could just drop dead, if there was a button I could push and just painlessly die I might push it, etc.*)
And mostly I'm fighting loneliness a lot. I don't feel that close with my father, I mean I can rely on him that's for sure but for things like emotions and having close conversations... not really our thing. I don't have many friends. A few, some from secondary school who I almost never see or speak with because they are all overseas (talking online once and awhile doesn't help enough for me to not feel lonely). I have a couple college friends but we just graduated so I'm unlikely to see them often, and I don't think we're as close and I am with my secondary school friends. Friend prospects for the future seem dim - I guess that's why I feel emotional this week. 
Anyway I just started a new job but I'm still living at home. In fact I'm working for home (other than my mother I don't mind this and I think the job is good so far) I don't make enough to move out (typical fresh grad salary in this country) so I can't expect to live on my own anytime soon.

I don't know how to deal with my mother. The things she says irritate me to no end. I am unable to separate the rational things she says from the delusional. As much as I try not to, I worry about being affected by the delusional things she says. Like if she say something crazy that I know is crazy but then what if it's slowly creeping into my mind that what if she's right? Or what if I am dismissing something reasonable just because she said it?

I realize I haven't said anything really specific about what she has done but you know, as many times as I've had this conversation in my head (I've often wished about telling people this, as it makes me feel better). I just don't know the right and simple way to describe it. There's no one sentence or one paragraph or anything that can accurately convey how I feel. I'll try though.

This may be a bit random as I'm thinking of just stuff that's happened within my lifetime so it may be disjointed.

* A common one is her mistrust of doctors, comes up a lot. Also I've never been to a doctor that I can recall (since baby) because of this. Quite often she'll bring up how medicine is bad and to never take medicine because of sideeffects, never trust what doctors say etc. I'm honestly quite concerned that if I ever got really sick where I needed a doctor that she would try and prevent that from happening. Luckily nothing so far. She just routinely complains about how the medicine doctors gave her when she was pregnant with me resulted in my childhood allergies (dairy and seafood mainly). then she'll constantly moan about how sorry she is for that and learn from her and don't take any meds not even panadol if you can. 
* Offset of that, this is somewhat new, she claims I'm still allergic to lots of stuff even though I grew out of it years ago. So when I'm eating stuff like chocolate she'll start saying I'm making myself sick, why are you doing this to yourself, blah blah blah...
* I'm kind of fat but not super obese or anything, but my shortness doesn't help in this regard. So whenever she sees me eating something I'll get a rant about ruining my life by eating so much and also ""how fat do you want to be?"". This firstly, hurts my self-esteem a lot and I have to admit sometimes leads me to eating my emotions right after. Though I don't think I eat unreasonable amounts, maybe a bit more than a should, I think my diet just sucks and I definitely do not exercise enough. It's mostly her tone, she says it without tact or grace like she's really fucking disgusted by me (and this could be said during my first and only meal of the day) This is one of the instances that make me paranoid about what she says. Like one I'm fat and I need to lose weight, I admit it. But I don't think I'm too fat yet? But then what if I'm being delusional and she's right? and I'm ignoring actual advice because she is she? Ah it's so messed up in my head... anyway I'm working on it but I don't cook a lot because if I'm in the kitchen she's there and I get angry. If I go for a walk I get this condescending sounding praise when I get back from it. I think I could fix it better if I was alone
* She's an immigrant (one of the factors that can lead to DD apparently!), well PR, married my dad and moved to his home country. Constantly complains about this country, how it was a mistake moving here (side note, how she should have married one of the other apparently many boyfriend choices). But yeah she mostly complains about the people here, how they are fishy and all sort of negative things (dirty and lazy comes to mind), which at times lead me to think she's being racist but it's just the delusions talking. Sounds kind racist when she says it like that though.
*Branching of the list of lifetime mistakes, having children. Yup how many times I've heard her say to my face that she shouldn't have had kids. Lovely stuff for your self-esteem. God...
*Also ""don't be like your father"" I'm not sure in what way specifically just don't be like him you're not the same as him something like that. Well even though we aren't emotionally close I admire him because he still supports us financially. (Oh sidenote I also never saw that much of him growing up, he often left early and came home late [likely to avoid her]) We did have weekend lunches and dinners growing up. Of course no family holidays at least since young because how unbearable would that be?
*Also don't do (insert bad habit here), because the neighbours will copy you. example, don't slam the door. Apparently everyone will copy us (because we're so great?) and they'll emulate the bad habits or whatever. Everyone's is apparently watching us waiting to steal our ideas and habits. 
*And this was really common but she hasn't done it in awhile. Don't fucking sneeze or cough around her. I hated this so much. She always thought they were fake and that you were trying to insult her somehow by doing that. There was quite I few times I held legit coughs and sneezes because of this. 
* She can get into conflict with any stranger somehow. I'm not always sure how it starts, she just starts speaking louder and louder and gets offended at something. How embarrassing to have your mother yelling at other people in public and you don't even know why this is happening, and you don't agree with her when you do and you have to leave with her. Oh and afterward she'll often complain that we didn't side with her and that we always side with other people. 
*Of course she had variously shouting matches with my father over various things over the years.
*Oh and also don't trust your friends, friends aren't real, always looking to stab you in the back, when you are in trouble they won't help you etc. This point SUCKED so much when I was in secondary and I didn't have a lot of friends (seriously I was so socially inept that the teachers noticed and pushed some people to be my friends [it worked actually lol but was embarrassing as hell]) Also since friends can't be trusted so sleepovers or gatherings (had to get my dad to drive us on weekends) and I'd be damned if I brought people over to our house!
*Oh but now she's whining about me wasting my twenties at home. wtf... I'd go out and have friends but my social life sucks now.
*And she didn't believe me when I said I had a job working from home. She asked if I was getting paid or not. I said yes and somehow still not believed.
*And she has said that she thinks (keyword THINKS) she is dying in X months so prepare yourself [this was a couple years ago, surprise she didn't...] (sadly I really wish she did and *sometimes* I feel bad about that) But she does still say she's gonna die eventually and how are we (kids) going to survive without her doing *everything* for us. And how are we going to survive if my dad dies?! < she said this throughout my teens and this really stressed me out because I didn't know how to survive without my father. I had moments of stress whenever he went on his many many business trips. I really hope he outlives her... I can't be the one to deal with her....

Well that's all that comes to mind right now... 

I think one problem I have is I find it so hard to tell people about this issue. I just don't know how, and if I blurt out everything I said above it seems too much and not coherent. I've only ever told 3 people, one was someone who told me about her problems first. And the other two were my friends so after years I managed to blurt it out when I was feeling really really sad. Also we don't talk about it really. But how do you go about telling people you just newly met? or only sort of know? It's like an secret I carry because I don't know how to start the convo. How close do I need to be to tell someone and what should I say to people I'm not really close with or else it's TMI? but they ask a question that's hard to deflect. Like ""oh why don't you learn this from your mother?"" (my current answer is to just sound really uncomfortable about doing that) And you know there's this close friend who I wouldn't mind telling and kind of want to tell, but I actually don't want to bring it up cause it's a shitty topic and since we haven't had a convo that has come close to this topic I haven't yet segued into it. Not to mention the stigma around mental illness. 

Wow I've always though about typing this up but I'm never done it before. 

If anyone actually reads the entire thing I'll be really really amazed. I'm sure I've left out a ton of points but it's difficult to remember what I've already said. If you did read everything, thanks so much!


TL:DR; 
*Mother has delusion disorder of persecutory and grandiose type
*It sucks, many emotional, behavioural issues have come of it
*Don't know how to deal it with
*Don't know how to fix it
*Venting I guess
*I guess I have to live with constantly till I move out. And then what...
*This TLDR sucks because you can't TLDR this.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have. I kind of hope there is someone out there who can relate.

159,My therapist thinks i'm improving after two sessions? I don't feel anything at all..,"In my first session, I discussed what I've been through and what I'm still currently putting up with. I talked about my trauma and how it led into having PTSD symptoms. Discussed about my past suicide ideations and hospitalizations. We discussed about how I was seeing a therapist during my time in the military for depression and after I left the military service, that depression flared up and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I've been on meds before and never really liked it but would try it if I could see the positives in it. Anyways after my first session, I was given prazosin for my nightmares and my sleep problems. I don't have nightmares or dreams anymore but I still have issues with my PTSD symptoms like irritability/anger/hyper-vigilance, and my depression and anxiety was still present.

In my second session, it seemed like everything wasn't as great. I told my therapist I was angry and depressed still and I don't think he liked the answer. He asked me how I am, and I was just like ""okay"". He started to say I was doing good but I discussed I was dealing with worthlessness and still have issues with passive suicidal ideations. He also told me that I was ""young to be depressed or sad or to be even dealing with mental issues"". I was in disbelief because I told him my trauma story of what happened during my military service and how that incident changed me. I lost everything during the last 5 years and have spent all my holidays alone by myself. When I got out the military, it was scary and depressing. I never felt so overwhelmed how difficult it was dealing with mental health issues. I didn't know my depression would cause me to be absent from work 6 times a month. I had no clue what I was going through. I thought I was just a young adult. I was using avoidance and isolation to deal with my problems. I only started to seek help because I needed it but now I feel like I want to ditch therapy again. It seems like age is a factor when dealing with mental health because I have seen high school kids deal with depression and anxiety. What makes them different from me?

160,Annoyance of sound and movements,"Hi all,

I was lying in bed last night, for the thousandth time, feeling shitty about how I've been acting throughout the day. I am really awful at writing things like this, so it will probably be so unstructured, for that I am so sorry!

So, since as long as I can remember, I have had issues with sound, the earliest I can remember is my dad eating after he came home from work. I had to shut the kitchen door, using ""lock the dog in there he's annoying me"" excuse. A few months ago, I discovered it was called Misophonia. A relief to see it's not just me dealing with this, but a stress to see there's no known cure!

Now, sounds annoy me, they make me so angry I could honestly round house kick anyone, but the last few years, it's getting worse. It's not sounds mainly anymore.. IT'S MOVEMENTS!!

For example, my dad rubs his feet... I have to block my line of vision to stop seeing it, before my thoughts of chopping them off become reality ( I joke, I think?). My brother bites his nails, my mum bites the inside of her mouth.. All of the above cause me the exact feeling of sound irritation.

I've always been able to just run to my room, watch tele or play Xbox. But now. I have recently got my first girlfriend (I'm 24, pity me). She's literally always at my house. First month was fine, NOTHING annoyed me, she rubbed her leg once in bed (Which she was doing every day, not to my annoyance) but one day it annoyed me. I had to tell her to stop. She didn't understand and got annoyed. It still to this day infuriates me. But now everything she does is slowly annoying me, and it's making me not want to spend time with her, as it's bad for me and her. It's only little things, she wiggles her toes, she shakes in bed to calm down when she's anxious, and now even scrolling her phone with her thumb, infuriates me.

I've come to the conclusion it's all delicate movements that annoy me, any delicate sound, and it's only people I'm emotionally connected to.

I could honestly list everything that annoys me, but it will be huge. It's making my life borderline unlivable, and I can't see a way out. I'm waiting for the clicking in my work to start annoying me, which will be the end of the line for me, and I will hit breaking point.

I don't know what to do. I've always suffered with anxiety, I'm the most social awkward son of a bitch you'll ever meet. It's my worst nightmare speaking to people about it. It took a huge amount of courage from me to tell my GF what was going on. She says she understands, but no1 does. 

I need help, please any advice is a life saver, quite literally.
