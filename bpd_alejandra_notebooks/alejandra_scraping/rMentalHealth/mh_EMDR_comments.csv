0,Honestly tried it last Monday. With my therapist anyway I have really really bad ptsd with door knocking and doctor office. But basically they make you think about the memory which is they stressful but then they sort of overload you with a bunch of tasks to distract your brain. It’s still really weird but I thinks it’s working well I hope.,Corporal-Biscuit2,1cemizu
1,"I have been in EMDR therapy for two years & at first it was really, really hard but after a few sessions things started to get easier & I learned a lot of strengths about myself. Give it a try, if you don’t think it’s for you- then it’s not.",Suitable_Patient_939,1cemizu
2,"Life changing. I’ve done it twice in Telehealth and will probably do it again a third time sometime in the future. The first time, a week in, my night terrors, sleep talking, and sleep sweating I didn’t know were PTSD related all disappeared. It completely eviscerated my daily SI/SMD too.

1,"I know, I felt rather bewildered when I realized how much I was struggling to come up with nurturing examples. I did think of one more, though! 

Samwise Gamgee (from The Lord of the Rings). He supported Frodo through everything and enabled his progress with selfless love and without doing it for him.

Also, elsewhere someone suggested the following characters:

Uncle Iroh from Avatar the Last Airbender

Dalinar Kholin from The Stormlight Archive (old Dalinar not young Dalinar)

Grandmother Fa from Mulan

Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird

Moraine and Thom Merrilin from Wheel of Time",HermioneJane611,1aq2wup
2,"Ted Lasso is the one I like best so far, besides Samwise. I see Samwise as more of a protector, though. He always had Frodo's back and made sure he was safe and taken care of.
 Ted Lasso encourages your best self. He's there in the safe, quiet moments when you don't need protection, you need to be heard and understood. 

I've been thinking about this all day lol",laceygray,1aq2wup
3,"Thanks for the suggestion! I had to google Ted Lasso but now I’ve apparently got 3 seasons to get to know him. 

Sam seemed less of a protector and more of a supportive figure to me. Literally carrying Frodo (because he couldn’t literally carry the Ring for him) to enable his success at the end. The other members of the fellowship felt more like protectors; it was Gandalf protecting everyone from the Balrog, for example. Sam taking care of Frodo, even when he himself was suffering, never abandoning him, doing the hard work of the mundane consistently (instead of one grand self-sacrificing gesture and he’s out), *and* doing it in a way where he wasn’t setting himself on fire to keep Frodo warm, to me is a fantastic representation of healthy nurturing. 

Some of this does feel to me like a thought exercise that builds the brain muscle for “how to be nurturing”. Like you’ve first gotta figure out what “nurturing” means to you personally, then look for examples, and finally internalize their approach. 

I will say coming up with protectors was way easier. Peak Dumbledore with the Elder Wand stands in front of me, and the entire Leverage Team is executing a chaotic good scheme in the background. 

The wise figures weren’t as much of a challenge as nurturing, but without any repeats from protectors I found I had a very short list. Basically a template using Alfred (Batman’s butler), with a hefty dose of Patrick Jane (the grifter protagonist of The Mentalist). I pulled some ingredients from self-help type resources, like Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search For Meaning, or the skills manual for Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (or Radically Open DBT) too.",HermioneJane611,1aq2wup

0,"Obvious call your doctor/therapist to let them know you’re having an urgent problem and want to be seen as soon as possible.

Otherwise, it sounds like your main problem is tolerating these issues until your providers can help you get out of this state.

The following may or may not be helpful to you, but I’ll share anyway.

I don’t know that I practice this exactly as written, but I’ve found the concept of [radical acceptance](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/what-is-radical-acceptance/#:~:text=To%20radically%20accept%20means%20to,make%20an%20uncomfortable%20situation%20better) to be helpful for dealing with significant and persistent discomfort (physical or otherwise).

I’ve dealt with long term physical pain in the past that regular caused me to spiral. I found it useful to pause and acknowledge how I felt. I give myself space to examine my pain and emotions in the moment. I then follow up by asking myself “what can I do right now that would result in me being happier in this moment?”. I then do that thing.

It’s the best tactic I’ve found for dealing with discomfort in the moment. It helps me course correct without lying to myself or trying to repress how I feel.",Warm_Cabinet,17307x5
1,"People have very different experiences with that particular therapy. Some patients say that this makes the problem worse. Of course you should tell them about the problem you're having. There are other things that can help trauma victims.

DBT, the best treatment for borderline cases, has what they call distress tolerance methods, ways for calming down when you're badly upset. This article tells you about the methods. You can use any that you like or any combination.

5,"Yeah, side effects from psych meds can be frustrating to deal with.

My issues aren’t the same as yours. But I ended up having the best outcomes by weaning off of the meds and using talk therapy for a while. Granted, I did use some meds for a while as a crutch during the worst of my ptsd.",Warm_Cabinet,17307x5

1,"I haven't, but I've been desperate to try it!

From my understanding, for people with complex trauma, they often work to help find the capital T trauma, or the one connecting event between it all. For example, I had one thing during a traumatic experience that took me back to my childhood trauma and that one connection would be the starting point for me. It's especially helpful apparently for those who's different trauma events are mixed up in their minds (flashbacks with a crossover of events) which are confusing, and EMDR supposedly helps them diffentiate them in order to start processing them

I listen to bilateral sound videos (also 8D and 12D audio) when I'm struggling, it uses the same basic premise as EMDR in the sense of the left/right audio. I find my eyes starting to dart left and right in time with the sounds which calms my nervous system and allows me to use other distractions to calm myself down

I don't know if any of that is helpful or even makes sense!",SnooHobbies9995,1088jvd

4,"It's the treatment with the most evidence behind it currently for treating trauma in all forms. Long trauma may require longer sessions, and the sessions are extremely draining for both the therapist and the client.

I'm about to get into some form of PTSD treatment so I won't speak to what works better. I will say that I don't think your therapist is going to put you in a place to ""react wrong"". Your therapist will likely do things to make sure you process everything in a safe and healthy manner. You may end up hating your parents. It happens. 

>I'm pretty sure she's building some sort of case against me

I'm praying for you. I can only imagine how that might make me feel and I know I wouldn't feel great. What's done is done though and you can't change the past so it's not healthy to worry about what might be coming. If you have trauma associated with the situation you're describing, it would be wise to address that with your therapist ASAP. Everyone's pain is valid and you may actually find some peace with your situation.

>everything in my life has basically exploded and now I'm left with the pieces

I can relate. All I can say is that therapy helps. Also, acceptance and letting go.

>can I really trust anyone?

Maybe not right now, with the exception of a therapist, but this will not always be the case. Work on you, process the stuff, and one day you'll find that you can trust a few people.

>I feel like I should be mad at the world

Don't give in to that urge. While your grievances are valid, no one else can resolve those issues inside except for you.

>I don't want to give up on love and relationships, but this year has really hurt me.

Don't give up. Learn the lessons, grow, and move forward. You will be ok again in time and the truth is that you do and don't control how long it takes. Do your best and just keep going.

>I don't know what to do anymore

Yes you do and you're already doing it. Therapy, PTSD treatment, and sharing on Reddit. Sometimes just getting it out helps us let go and move on, even if we've only moved an inch. That inch will become feet which will become miles. One day you'll look up and see how far you've come.

1,"Hey, I can provide some insight. In my experience, EMDR can relieve some distressing symptoms but it's definitely exhausting, emotional, and you need lots of coping skills in order to go through with it. EMDR made me feel a bit suicidal because of the content that was being brought up, but if you do some self-care, practice coping skills, and have good support behind you then it shouldn't be excruciating. If you struggle with dissociation, please work on that before jumping into EMDR; dissociation can fuck with the whole process. I'm sorry that you've gone through these horrible things. I hope you're in a better place now. EMDR doesn't work for everyone of course, but I'd give it a shot :)",No_Hat_5962,v4d4o7

13,"Well it involves a lot of ‘prep’ work in the weeks prior to better define what it is you’re dealing with so I’m assuming you’ve done that. For the actual session you’re asked to bring up a traumatic memory / event and see where your mind takes you in that moment while following the dots from left to right and possibly vibrations in your palms as well. It’s difficult at first because all the negative feelings flood in but with every cycle it get easier and you kind of just, find your way out of the situation. The therapist is supposed to guide you through it but it’s physically and mentally exhausting. I came out a bit dizzy and was out of it for the rest of the day. Now it’s kind of settling down and I genuinely feel like it at least took the edge off my worst triggers.

The one thing I would say is just go with it, don’t try to overthink it or question whether your doing it wrong or not. Let your mind roam. ",StuckOnTheEdge,8rayzu

I have a long history of sexual abuses and suffer with PTSD I gave up on traditional talk therapy because I felt re traumatized after each session. 

Last fall I was assaulted the most recent time and I hit my rock bottom I could barely function. I called my HR at my job and was very privileged in that they found my a immediate therapist. I was not very optimistic because I thought therapy would not work for me but also knew I had to try one more time before throwing in my towel. 
As soon as my therapist explained EMDR I was filled with hope, and it truly did change my life, after the first EMDR session I felt such a relief and after the second I was finally able to go about my normal life again. I had never heard of EMDR but it truly changed my life and I think anyone with PTSD should at least try it out. It can be very scary thinking about the trauma again but allowing the brain to process the information correctly has allowed me to stop dwelling on my past traumas.

When it's good, it's amazing. When it's not, it usually is still productive.  EMDR enabled me to move into even deeper therapies, although I could have probably given it more time as well.  Just know it's great, and there are other great ones out there.  Congrats!",LeopardBernstein,6g5gqe

Even trying a few meds might not be enough; there are cocktails and dosages that might still work for you. I say this because RTMS is generally--I don't know where you are--conducted in research hospitals such as Stanford. Sometimes access is restricted to their studies. Determining eligibility for those would involve screening, if any are accepting anyone. Your doctor may be able to help with inquiries, and I'm not sure where insurance stands. Another depression treatment for severe depression that was once only administered in ERs is ketamine at a very low dose. Clinics are now popping up that do this under medical supervision. Depression tends to recur, so other steps are necessary. Most treatment, unfortunately, is still geared toward the majority who are not treatment resistant. ",MaidaStars,3zt95e

While likely not an issue for newer clients, after a few months the seams might start to show, as I could detect agendas that bothered me and interrupted my personal processing, although not by much.  

Just like with any modality, a therapist can only take you as far as they've gone themselves.  Good luck!",cjazz108,44nyw7

1,"For me EMDR was a really effective tool in getting me to gain a new perspective on viewing/handling my anxiety, and depression. I was able to ""disconnect"" from myself in a way, and I learned how to view my actions and emotions as a third party viewer. That knowledge helped me to objectify my thoughts and emotions, and it became much easier to see how they truly effected me. I find the rhythmic pulse to be very soothing as well, being a drummer haha. 

With my new found perspective, and with the help and guidance of my counselor, EMDR became an invaluable part of my sessions that I still look forward to. It depends on what kind of session I want to have, but it's generally a staple in my treatment now, at my request. 

Initially it took me around 2-4 weekly sessions to start getting comfortable with the process, and after that it was maybe another week or two before the 
effects were noticeable to me. I highly recommend keeping with it even if it seems 
like it's not working, because it's helped me quite a bit. It might not be for everyone, but personally I love it, and I recommend it to anyone willing to try it. Good luck friend. ",gojirasan,54sl5t

0,"I think that short-term, it worked okay. To me, it kinda felt like BS. A lot of imagining pictures and asking me how I felt when seeing this “images” of different traumatic events. My therapist then flipped the situation and asked me to think of it differently. I think I really wanted to convince myself that the EMDR worked. The thoughts of trauma went away for a short while but that was a few months ago. Now, my trauma still feels the same and I often get flashbacks that trigger my PTSD.  Maybe it was just my therapist, but it didn’t really work for me. I know that everyone is different. Sorry if this is not the answer you were looking for, I know it’s hard to manage PTSD.

0,"The first time ever was interesting. The memory itself wasn’t painful, but the EMDR made me cry during it. Afterwards I had 1-2 weeks of not feeling so well. Me and my therapist didn’t think this would have such a huge impact on me, we wouldn’t have done it at that time if we knew. I was competing in regional championships few days later and I had a panic attack just before my performance, which I hadn’t had ever before.

1-2 weeks after the treatment I actually started to feel A LOT better. We’ve done EMDR with few other memories and it worked for me.

What insurance do you have? 
And are you in a rural location? ",SpecialSand,6viy7y
1,"Call your insurance provider and ask. They should be able to give you a list of providers they cover in the surrounding area. That's usually the easiest way. Then you can start making cold calls to see if they're taking new patients. 

In my experience, many therapists are certified in EMDR. It might also be worth calling therapists near you to see if they do it, even if it isn't advertised. 

Good luck!",pennyturtle_,6viy7y

3,"Calling Aetna was the first thing I did. They gave me numbers to call, but none of them do EMDR (multiple calls to Aetna keep pointing me to dead ends). I'd tried conventional therapy, but the therapist suggested I'd be better served with EMDR (which their practice doesn't offer). I have multiple-trauma PTSD, just fyi.

FWIW, the most recent trauma was losing my only son to a car accident just over three months ago. Besides being a basket case, I'm in a Moebius loop trying to get help, which is why I came here to Reddit; it was time to call in the air support.",bmh0797,6viy7y

I'm truly sorry for all you've had to go through, and for the loss of your son. You might also find good support on r/ptsd, if you haven't been there already!

If calling insurance is leading to dead ends, you could choose a town/city near you and call a practice to see if they do EMDR. If they don't, they may be able to direct you to one that does. Another option would be the therapist finder on psychologytoday.com. (I don't have the exact link right now but google will help you find it.) You can search by specialty and by zip code, so you could hopefully find someone not too far away. Then you'll just have to make sure they're covered by your insurance - just because they support EMDR doesn't mean every practice will be covered.

So I’m acknowledging how bad that voice is being and fighting back, like a friend standing up for me lol. It felt fake and frustrating at first and took a lot of practice. I’m now not needing to say it out loud and my cruel voice is now much quieter than my nicer cheerleader voice. Makes things easier.",swild89,18p6ns0
1,"Two things that helped me.

1) Everything is practice. You can't make mistakes in practice. You're not an idiot in practice. You're learning. 

2) Add an additional voice, one of constructive criticism. One that says ""next time we can try...""

So, when learning a skill we practice by doing something to see how it goes. Then after it's done we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses, choose a thing to try next time, then at some point try again. 

For example, maybe you're learning to bake. You make some cookies. You find they're too crispy and burned. One voice will call you a useless fucking idiot who can't do anything right. Then you intentionally add a new voice, think about why they ended up overcooked, and go hmm maybe I'll leave them for 3 minutes less next time! Then, you do the thing. Note as well, the success of the thing here isn't that the cookies are then perfect, but that you left them in the oven for less time to try to make them less overcooked, if you leave them in for 3 minutes less that's a success. Even if the inner critic is about serious life events and calling you a bad person or whatever, the same process applies. Next time, maybe we don't burn down someone's house for leaving a mean comment on our social media post, yknow?

Honestly, a lot of thoughts are habit. Eventually, manually doing this thought process will make you begin to sometimes do that naturally, and you'll get less of the abusive critic.

Remember also that thoughts aren't really anything. They're just stuff the brain does, basically as output from processing information. You're allowed to treat them as seriously as you want to. Note, that not taking a thought seriously is not the same as ignoring it or trying to stop the thought. 

Consider all the thoughts you have in the day. Maybe one of them is ""I should buy a boat"" but you live 200 miles from the nearest body of water. You'd not really take it seriously, or linger on it. Maybe even laugh a little at the idea. Fundamentally, there's not any difference between an inner critic and an inner boat enthusiast. The fact that you have thoughts you don't take seriously is evidence you have the capability to differentiate. 

Practically, being able to disarm thoughts by not taking them seriously is developed through meditation. People over-complicated meditation. Sit somewhere comfy, quiet, and with comfy lighting (I like the pitch black). Focus on your breathing, in, out. _Let thoughts happen_, follow them naturally until you catch yourself that you're thinking, wrap up the thought and refocus on breathing in, and out. That's it. That's the game. People think that they've fucked it up when they catch themselves thinking, but that's the whole point. You're not ""not thinking"" you're actually letting yourself think, and then letting yourself leave the thought alone after. Do it for 5 minutes or 5 hours whatever you feel like. You can do this walking, or exercising too. You can also do it with music on, I use nature sounds or soft instrumentals as a way to sort of ""wall in"" my thoughts and give me another thing to bounce my focus to.

I suppose meditation would be the third thing that helped me with this.",videogamesarewack,18p6ns0
2,"I confess I have been worried about doing that out of fears of becoming arrogant, but I suspect that is just anxiety talking. There is a big difference between ""healthy self regard"" and ""total jerk.""

  
Thank you. I will try it.",AdZestyclose8024,18p6ns0
3,"Thank you for the reminder to meditate. I have done it in the past but let my practice lapse--tonight would be a good night to rekindle it.

I appreciate your thoughts. While I don't disagree with anything you have said, and will try to internalize them, I have trouble not being affected by the thoughts just due to their sheer violence. Nitpicks are unpleasant, but my inner voices go way past it, telling me I deserve some pretty brutal torture and violations for my faults, whether minor or major. It wears me down even when I don't take it seriously.

Regardless, I appreciate your advice, and will try to utilize what you have said. Thank you.",AdZestyclose8024,18p6ns0

>__Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing__ (__EMDR__) is a [psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy) developed by [Francine Shapiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francine_Shapiro) that emphasizes disturbing memories as the cause of [psychopathology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology)   and alleviates the symptoms of [posttraumatic stress disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder) (PTSD). 

>EMDR is used for individuals who have experienced severe trauma that remains unresolved.  According to Shapiro, when a traumatic or distressing experience occurs, it may overwhelm normal cognitive and neurological coping mechanisms. The memory and associated stimuli are inadequately processed and stored in an isolated memory network. 

>The goal of EMDR therapy is to process these distressing memories, reducing their lingering effects and allowing clients to develop more adaptive coping mechanisms. This is done in an eight-phase approach that includes having clients recall distressing images while receiving one of several types of bilateral sensory input, including side to side [eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye) movements.  The use of EMDR was originally developed to treat adults suffering from PTSD; however, it is also used to treat other conditions and children.

11,"Yeah, I think finding the right therapist can be life changing. If you have sleep issues, they should be giving you specified lists of actions you can take. If you have health problems that extend beyond mental health, they should be referring you to other services, suggesting pain management programs, and be in contact with your GP to work together on a combined effort approach. When your mental health is caused by tangible issues like poverty and homelessness, they should be advocating for you and looking up shelters and charities and any association that might get you out of the difficult position you're in, whatever it may be.

All that said, there are a lot of duds. At one point, I was seeing a guy who made me feel like I was the therapist and he was the patient.

Before I knew this years ago, I was seeing a therapist, and I told her that I was considering seeing someone else who specialized in CBT. She said, ""I do that here too."" Then, hands me a piece of paper that has some sort of CBT assignment on it and tells me to fill that out. I never went back to her. That was no way to properly administer or perform CBT. Thankfully, I was in school to be a psychologist and specializing in psychological assessments and knew she had no idea what she was doing.

If it's the type of thing that has triggers, they help you discover what those are, how to navigate ones you can avoid vs. ones you can't. Or if you are going through something that you notice unhealthy patterns help you develop ways out of those patterns. 

Sometimes finding a therapist is like dating. You might need to go on a few ""intake appointments"" before finding a good match. I usually recommend giving a therapist two or three sessions before deciding to move on (unless it's super obvious right away). It doesn't mean they're not a good therapist, they may not be a good therapist for you.

26,"In the first session you will be doing most of the talking. The therapist has to get to know you, understand you, your patterns, goals, etc. They should ask some open ended questions and reflect your feelings to make sure that they understand you.


However, some therapists will do more as they go. 

Cognitive behavioral therapy seeks to help you understand your behavior and form new ones.

Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy looks to identify irrational behaviors and beliefs and replace them with positive and rational ones.

Gestalt therapy focuses on the now and uses different techniques.

It should be a conversation with your therapist. Ask about their methods and how they work.

If this therapist isn’t for you, ask for a referral. Part of the code of conduct means they should give that referral without any problem.

If you are not good at organizing your thoughts or figuring out your 'whys' as to why something is bothering you, or why you're feeling the way you are, therapists are often good\* at helping you figure out your own emotions and thoughts.   


Imo, therapists are less ideal for getting concrete advice on how to proceed with objective issues.  They're only humans with certificates, after all.

30,"Hello, pre-licensed therapist here! 

I highly recommend reading articles by Dr. Jonathan Shedler, a psychodynamic clinician and researcher who has studied the efficacy of psychotherapy for decades. Good therapy facilitates growth in your own sense of autonomy & does not work as an advice-dispenser. Therapy is meant to be an exploratory relationship for you to figure out what works best for you as a unique individual, & no therapist can make that designation for you because they are not you! Good therapy allows you to see how your past is still playing out in the present, what patterns you are still enacting, what you are projecting onto your current relationships, including onto your therapist. Good therapy assists you in exploring what lies below the surface of everyday consciousness, reworking your character structure, personality, & ways of being to better adapt to & evolve with your circumstances. It is difficult to examine long-held assumptions & blindspots without a person (therapist) holding up a mirror to you. 

Unfortunately, many therapists are not trained very well and tend to coddle clients with validation. However, as you may have noticed, just listening & providing validation does not generate any long term change & enables clients to continue to behave in self-defeating ways. Good therapy is gentle but challenging, oriented towards honesty, truthfulness, & the client’s best interests (that is, always in service to their stated goals). Therapists are meant to be active participants, offering observations, connections, hypotheses, reframes, & psychological knowledge when clinically appropriate. Meaning-making and healing occur in the context of relationships & therapy is meant to provide a safe relationship devoted to your personal growth and self-understanding. 

Also, different therapists adhere to different treatment modalities & theoretical orientations; some are more skills-based (CBT, DBT, ACT), incorporating mindfulness/grounding exercises and “homework” to practice cognitive restructuring. As someone else mentioned here, you may be more interested in a solutions-focused framework which I find is less about emotional regulation & internal shifts in perspective & more about finding and implementing practical solutions. The idea is to focus on exceptions (times when you aren’t struggling) and on little wins/positive movement and momentum towards your goals. It’s a bit more like coaching. The reason I personally don’t love this approach is that most people are stuck due to internal conflicts & not just due to lack of ideas for solving external problems. This is why psychodynamic therapy appeals to me, as it focuses on addressing the underlying roots of suffering rather than its symptoms.

My third therapist is the best one I’ve had yet; it takes time to find the right fit and approach. Hope you still have some faith in the process — therapy can be an invaluable support for personal transformation and can enhance a sense of intimacy with self and others. I am extremely grateful for the care, kindness, curiosity, non-judgment, acceptance, validation, exploration, new perspectives, connections, & insights I have gained and received in therapy.",Timely_Resist5656,1bgdbi0
31,"they don’t all just listen. therapists are also supposed to offer advice in response to what u tell them. i’m gonna be real with u. it took me YEARS to find a good therapist. like 6-7 years. but i kept going and it ended up being worth it to me because i found someone who helped me turn things around more than i ever thought i’d be able to. so no, it’s not pointless, so long as u are willing to not give up on it the second things don’t turn out perfectly",pentichan,1bgdbi0
32,"Generally speaking, the therapist can start taking a more active role once they get to know you better and begin to understand the way you think. This takes some time - first session is mostly an assessment.

This is necessary, as you'd receive rather generic advice that doesn't fully match your situation or misses an (emotional) aspect that is important to you, which can be very frustrating or anger inducing as a patient.

Do also communicate to the therapist what you expect from them and how you'd like to approch things. This kind of communication is very important - do also tell them if they said something that you deem inappropriate/offensive/hurtful or that misses your point.

Most importantly, the chemistry between the two of you needs to good, such that a relationship of trust can be formed and it becomes easier for you to open up. If you can't stand them or vice versa, seeking someone else is recommended.",kiffmet,1bgdbi0

For your reference, normal talk therapy focuses primarily on treating symptoms, nothing else. Some people need something more involved, like EMDR. Besides, it’s critical to revisit your past to process it from a different perspective, especially since your brain is (presumably) now fully developed. If you don’t, you may continue to wait on someone or something that will never come.

She is really good at getting me to open up even when I’m being difficult, gives me great practical advice, and she calls me on my shit.

75,"I've had multiple therapists with different kinds of therapies. I'm talking about 11 or 12. Only three of them have had a true impact in my mental health. 

I had a social worker in high scholl was very kind, understanding and helpful. Although my mental health was in decline, he was one of the first people to point me to the right resources for my mental health. He would listen to me once a week. He was very non judgemental and I enjoyed just having casual conversations with him. He would help me in academics and mental health. He was very dedicated to his profession as a social worker. He is the only person in that high school who is worthy of recognition. I'm not the only one who says that. Many agree on that, parents and other students. Hope his life is full blessings and prosperity. The other two were therapists. 

One of them was a Cognitive Behavioral therapist, and she was great. She helped me overcome my anxiety to silence in social situations. We did multiple exercises for mindfulness and a sort of imagination therapy. It became so so useful to me, that even know I still use when feeling on edge, event though it's been more than 5 years since.

The other therapist was a guy who truly loved his job. He worked at a teen outpatient facility. He would do groups and individual therapist. I trusted him with my most embarrassing mental secrets and he helped me changed the vision of life I had for me. I was broken beyond repair. I had a very twisted image of who I was. I thought I only deserved to die a painful death. But he never gave up on me and managed to get me studying back in high school, despite my psychiatrist and the school opposing. They wanted me to go straight for GED, but my therapist knew that's not what I wanted, and he fought hard to get me in. He advocated for me a lot. He was my hero. I've never seen him again, but now that I'm about to graduate with a Bachelor's degree, I want to go to his private practice and give him a gift or flowers or something like that. He deserves all recognition. He is a angel in flesh and bone.

However, I have had therapists and psychiatrists thst were very dispoointing or just not useful for my case. I had a psychiatrist that recommend me to look for girls and have sex to control my depression. I also had therapists who would yawn and just listen to me. But it wasn't better than talking to a wall. There were no real action plans, no exercises, no advancement, nothing. Psychology is definitely not for everyone.

However, my last psychiatrists have been awesome. Very enjoyable to be their patients. I love their dedication and their willingness to work with patients to find the best treatment. Above all, I liked that both of them knew how to hold me accountable for my lack of commitment to treatment in a way that was respectful, motivational and encouraging.

You can try CBT, DBT, EMDR, NARM, and various non-talk therapies. For each their own, and I will be the last person to judge you. It often takes more than one therapist until you find the right one.

My personal experience with therapy over the last few years was transformative, probably in more ways than I know. I can process my emotions, I can deal with difficult situations, I can deal with stressors and so much more.

Some are there to listen, and work through your issues. others provide specific coping skills based on your diagnosis. trauma therapists help work through/process the event, as well as dealing with PTSD symptoms.

97,"No, no, no.  All *you* do is listen... to yourself.  The therapist serves as more of a facilitator than someone with whom you're having a conversation, helping you learn more about yourself.

Well, that's one role.  Others include teaching you about your diagnoses, maybe a little bit of the neurology and psychology behind what you're experiencing, etc., as well as modeling how you should treat yourself and/or expect others to treat you (research Carl Rogers' person-centered therapy, as well as feminist therapy).

But it's important to note there are many types of therapy and many therapists who all do things differently.  Some are very structured, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, whereas others are really loose, such as person-centered, where the relationship with the counselor itself is designed to facilitate the healing, so what you do in sessions isn't as important as the fact you're doing it.

Also, most therapists use some combination of those, adjusting it based on the client, as each one is optimal for certain situations and personality types.

If you want my advice, try one or two more sessions, and if you still feel the same way, talk to your therapist about whether there are any other modalities you could try or if you could be referred.  But it sounds like you're looking for something more structured, like CBT, DBT, ACT, or the like.

Don't give up on therapy: there are so many types out there that you haven't tried.",Terrible-Trust-5578,1bgdbi0
98,"It really just depends on the type of therapy that you're after. 

My therapist does talk therapy and EMDR therapy, and I have found them extremely healing. The talk therapy is essentially me using her as a sounding board so I can (essentially) talk out my own problems whilst having validation and an alternative perspective if I need it (I am quite self aware but often just need to talk things out as a means of processing them). Then the EMDR is actually going into different memories and rewiring the way I perceive those memories, so they then don't affect me in my current life.

If you're looking for more solutions based therapy, find a solutions based therapist, you are allowed to find a therapist that works for you, if you can try to find out what each therapists philosophy is before committing to seeing them regularly. Ideally before going into therapy, you'll want to have a list of things you want to work on (memories, habits, behaviours, traumas etc) as well as what you are looking to get out of therapy. The best way to get what you want out of therapy is to present your list of things and say, is this something that you would be qualified to work with me through? And if they say yes, perfect! If they say ""no, I do more talk based therapy,"" then you can move on and just look for someone else. 

At the end of the day the relationship that you have with your therapist is one of the most important relationships when it comes to your own personal healing journey, it's okay to find the perfect person who you feel will be able to help you along that journey.",-iamu-urme-,1bgdbi0

Therapy is pointless IF the therapist is unskilled or they aren't a good match for you. Most aren't, unfortunately. You may have to change a few psychotherapists to find your perfect match.

At the beginning of my adventures where I live now... I actually was talked/forced into checking myself into the hospital and from there was committed and given a therapist and basically forced (less you wanna go back to the hospital again) to talk to someone or get white sheeted.

I had three therapists at the center the hospital referred me to. The first one, Josh? Oh my goodness, I loved him. He was a younger therapist, but he knew all the right things to say and was almost like a friend, but we had our boundaries. Josh sent me to the hospital a lot. At the end... he told me that if I were to attempt unaliving myself again... that I would have to work with someone else, and that's how I got Jim. 

Jim was an ass. He wanted to talk about his board of words and all these left field feeling things. When I told him that I wanted/was hurting myself at the time... he suggested that I bake. I walked out of my last session with Jim and ended up speaking to a supervisor and everything. They ended up holding me in their transitional housing in the back (big community outreach center) and held me for 3 days until they all realised that I wasn't gonna work with Jim and that you can't force DBT therapy on people. 

I ended up with my last therapist there, a LOVELY man named Brent who had been trained in DBT therapy but switched to CBT. They all thought it was the next big thing, and they were right.

Brent... this sweet, sweet man once was on a phone call with me at 1am while I was actively trying to end my life, and because of him, I'm still alive. He ended up meeting my Mom (by phone), and my brother came in a couple of times when I was seeing him in person even. Sadly I lost the insurance I had and had to stop seeing him... but he literally still messages me once a week to check in.

It took me at least 3-5 therapists before I found one that clicked for me. It’s very much a matter of finding the right therapist for you. With the right therapist, therapy should feel like somewhere you can go and rant/vent about anything and everything. Somewhere where you can let everything out without judgement. It depends on each individual of course, and therapy is different for everyone. What therapy is for me may not be what therapy is for you or someone else. Also keep in mind that it takes a few sessions to figure out if the therapist is a good fit. I always give a new therapist 2-5 sessions to start off with, and if I’m still not feeling like it’s a good fit after those sessions, I go to someone else. Unfortunately, the first therapist that you go to see isn’t always going to be the right fit. And for that matter, neither is the second or third sometimes. Stick with it, once you find the right therapist, it is worth every cent. I think about it this way: how many people do we have in our personal lives, friends or family, that can listen to us rant/vent without being biased? How many people in our day to day lives can offer a neutral opinion without any emotional persuasion? Usually minimal to none. A therapist can really help see things from another perspective.

Later I tried in person therapy. I went for about 6 months until they cut it off. Again the therapist didn't know anything about ASD despite me claiming that was the reason I came in.

The work of therapy is self work, the reason why therapy doesn’t work the way we want it to is often we aren’t ready to take on the work in order to change.

136,"Unfortunately there is a reason the can't give advice, it's because they are heavily trained not to. Not only can advice be kind of damaging because it's not actually teaching you anything, just telling you what to do, it can also just be the therapists own biased opinion due to their own experiences and not totally fit you. Plus the idea of just ""getting advice"" makes people think mental health should be a quick fix... ""I'll just get some advice, follow it, and everything will be ok"" (not saying you think that, but they are trained to avoid it due to those who do) 

But the biggest reason they are trained not to? They give advice, the person goes away and they can misinterpret that advice, or even follow it to the letter and everything goes to hell. Now, not only is that therapist now in huge trouble, they have ruined future trust in therapy for their client. It's the therapist equivalent of malpractice.

But that's not what clients want to hear. They feel like everything is a mess, they have tried everything, now they just want to be told what to do to fix it.

In training, many therapists are taught advice giving is a cardinal sin, but often are not properly trained in alternatives, so they just end up listening because that's safer. 

Don't get me wrong, listening is often a really good strategy. Sometimes talking things out loud allows you to finally see a bigger picture after drowning in the details for so long, or a puzzle piece will finally slip into place to help make sense of a problem. But that doesn't work for everyone.

The biggest thing people need to remember is... There is more than one kind of therapy and there is more than one therapist. One kind of therapy might not work for you, and you're entitled to try other types. One therapist might not work for you either. They are still people and you won't get along with everyone. Shop around. Why keep taking your Toyota to the mechanic who only services Fords?

Every therapist is going to be biased towards their own trained type. Myself, I always advocate for narrative therapy because it's really about digging out those ideas, perspectives, and personalised approaches for redesigning your life. But it's better if you do a little research about different types to see what you like, not what they recommend.

Advice in therapy tends to be ""you should do this"" which suggests an answer and leaves you feeling bad if it doesn't work. A good therapist can find ways around advice giving by laying out options and ideas, helping you brainstorm things that might fit you, and then being a springboard as you piece together the best strategy to try, while leaving room to come back and tackle it from a new angle if the previous one didn't work.  

And like any good relationship, communication is key. You'll never know unless you ask. Some therapists are willing to be adaptive and come to the table if you ask to help hash over ideas. And if they aren't, well you can stop wasting time.

I'm not sure if this helps at all but... you know, it could be a few ideas to consider. It's really about finding what is going to fit you.",becauseshesaidso,1bgdbi0

It takes at least a few sessions to get the vibe of who you’re working with, both as the therapist and the individual seeking therapy.

176,"Therapist here: there's a difference between validation and accountability. It sounds like you want accountability.  

A therapist teeters on a line, a like that could snap at any second with a misstep. 

You can't have accountability without a fair amount of validation. ""I totally see why you did what you did, but I want to point out something that concerns me."" Vs ""next time you're fighting handle your anger by doing XYZ."" (Not going to go over well)

Also, without established trust a client confronted (too hard or too quickly) on a problematic behavior will end up becoming defensive and end up leaving. 



I've had clients ask for accountability, and then shut down completely as soon as I bring up an issue. It is a huge risk for the relationship. That's what you're really paying for with therapy, the relationship. 

But, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're not really worried about the relationship and just want facts.
If that's true, ask some polls from people on here so you can do a little research as well as watch some YouTube and see if you can do your own behavioral modifications.

193,"Yeah! First, Psychedelics aren't going to be for everyone, because sometimes there's some underlying health conditions like Type 1 bipolar, schizophrenia, narcissism, heart issues, and anyone with delusions can't take them because it can worsen their issues.

Used correctly, they can do a lot for people.  The medical trials are very positive so far. For people who have anxiety or severe trauma, they should look into MDMA therapy because it deactivates the Amygdala, which is the fear center of the brain. I've never tried MDMA.

I've done ketamine therapy (the one where you go into a doctor's office and get an IV) and psilocybin mushrooms, and both have been really positive for me working through my shit... But note I use these in addition to inputting other 'work' in my life.... I have a full writeup on my discord about my trip day protocol (it's a full day of busting your ass and crushing a to do list), and I go into detail about what kind of 'work' you can put into your life to prep for trip days. Disciplined sleeping habits, really taking your living space as a serious project, decorating, therapy, exercising (even if it's walking and walking paths you don't normally go on foot), building an ideal trip music list, etc.

I have a trip day once every 2 or 3 weeks with a moderate dose. Most of the time they are amazing and I feel great about myself... Proud, accomplished, and motivated. They are heaven normally.... But....

Last night's didn't go so well. Some would say ""it was a bad trip,"" but I think it was just some underlying happenings over the past 2 weeks that were just floating in my head that caused me to be insecure and self critical. 

The great news is that even the ""bad trips"" are good ones, but I believe it's the way of how I've approached my relationship with Psychedelics as tools. Starting slow by starting with a low dose to understand what to expect and learn how things can sometimes be emotional or hard is very important. 

I had a difficult time calming myself down for some reason yesterday, and couldn't take it easy on myself about how I kinda ""fucked off"" this week professionally. It turned into me giving myself a pep talk about how I need to course correct for the future, because I just don't want to feel unsuccessful in what I'm doing.... Right now I feel a bit of that because I've slowed down my hours a lot just to do this podcast and work on this project.... So there's money stress built in here.

What I'm proud of is how I navigated a ""bad one."" I was able to recognize what was going on because of my knowledge, research and experience, and ""feed myself"" a lot of things I've learned from therapy or other good, supportive people who care about me. Then when I got out of the shower, I walked out to my place that was pristinely clean and the lighting was already set exactly how I wanted it... God, it was nice to say ""well, at least when I open this door I did something right today... Along with 26 other items I crossed off my to do list.""

198,"There are a lot of different frameworks that therapists operate from but most should actually help you process the past. We all have internalized negative beliefs and shit about ourselves which we see and interact with the world through. These beliefs can then cause all kinds of dysfunctional behaviors and relationships so it's your therapist's job to help you recognize those beliefs and where they came from and challenge/process them. Over time the goal is to shift those negative beliefs into more adaptive, functional beliefs. So if you're an anxious person functioning from beliefs like, ""I'm not safe,"" or ""I can't do this,"" your therapist should help you identify that and connect to more adaptive beliefs like, ""I can trust myself,"" or ""I can handle this.""

Your brain creates these new neural pathways and you start to see the world through this new lens so your anxiety symptoms decrease.

59,"Loneliness was my greatest fear for most of my life.  Honestly it's still probably my greatest fear.  I feared friends and family moving away and leaving me alone, and I feared the loneliness and insecurity of living on my own if it ever came to that.

When I was 24 (I'm 32 now), I lived on my own after a breakup, falling out with my family, working a terrible job that consumed all my time, and living alone far away from everyone.  I lived out my greatest fear and it WAS bad....

...but not because I was living alone, but because it was a perfect storm of shitty situations.

Since then I've lived alone more than I've lived with others and realized that it's not so bad.  You get used to it, and it's not as lonely as you'd think.  We're good at adapting, and I tend to visit friends on my time off when I feel the need to see people and I spend time online a lot now, which kind of helps mitigate that feeling of loneliness.  Most of my contact with my friends is online too so it's not like it's just complete random online strangers every time.

In recent years I've had to learn to get out of my shell and seek out new situations with new people more, and with the help of therapy, that's been going great.

We're good at adapting, and as someone who lived out a worst case scenario, I can say it's not so bad.  Now, I kind of fear having roommates because I feel like I'd have the added pressure of being a good roommate to them, which I don't have right now with anyone.  I'm afraid of being naturally kind of inconsiderate with roomies given that I'm used to complete freedom at home lol",Kaldin_5,1ctmlga

There's a laundry list of reasons why this isn't the greatest idea and I would encourage you to work as hard as you can to self-reflect and pull yourself out of the mindset.

But I've also had friends abandon me and wait for the perfect opportunity to stab me in the back so they can get some satisfaction out of demonizing someone.

You just gotta keep trying.  It's kind of like dating actually.  There are all kinds of people out there and you might not find the people you vibe with the best right away, but keep trying and accept having to start over new (don't have to abandon friends every time, but just trying to make new friends in new environments is what I mean).

You don't have to stick with people if you're not feeling valued by them. I think if you're also comfortable in your own company, you can be a friend to yourself when there aren't other friends around.

I'm not sure if you can, but maybe finding a therapist that helps deal with trauma things to help you feel like you have more control than you think. This is a setback. One that life has given, along with many others, and they're going to keep coming. Having support with your providers and also friends and family (if available) helps a lot. If you have access to crisis counseling, homing options, different areas that can help you along the way, use them. They are there for a reason and you have a valid reason.

I know it may feel like it's all over, but it's not. You've got many other life twists and turns. One huge thing I carry and use all the time is: What you can control and what you can't control. You work on what you can control, and what you can't, you let it be. You can control the situation of housing with resources. Ehat you can't control is asking for the place back. (Using as example)

0,"EMDR is trauma therapy.  It allows you to process past trauma that  has not been resolved.   I am currently doing it and it has been working pretty well for me.  It is not easy,  the sessions can be intense and may affect you for several days afterwords.  A lot of physical sensations as well.

I went over the years to a bunch of different talk therapists and psychiatrists.  My ex ""gaslighted""  me and convinced me I was biopolar.  She even told me what to say at the initial appointments so I would be guarenteed to be diagnosed as Bipolar.  She is the source of most of my trauma.    None of the therapy or the medication did anything for me  and only made things worse by invalidating what I was feeling.  It was not until last year that I finally got the correct diagnosis of CPTSD.  For a lot of people,  talk therapy and CBT do nothing or make things  worse if trauma is their main issue.    Most ""regular""  therapists really don't understand trauma very well.  

If your condition is caused by trauma then you need trauma specific therapy.  There are others besides EMDR that are also proven to work.

My ex of 1.5 years was maybe emotionally abusive? Like he would put me down for SH and my depression episodes, calling me fucked up and such; he would get so angry when I would get depressed that he wouldn't talk to me for days. I mean, thar hadn't given me any sort of like... trauma? but I basically don't tell anyone when I'm feeling bad or SH' ing because I don't want to feel guilty and even shittier than I already do.

2,"So trauma affects everyone differently; some people come through a situation fairly unscathed and others get put through the wringer.  And CPTSD can come from a period of emotional/psychological abuse with no physical abuse.   My exwife is a covert narcissist.  Basically they fuck with someone's head and feed off of the emotional energy because they don't really have emotions, at least not like the rest of us.  Closest thing to vampire that I can think of.  She drained me over 17 years (when I finally got divorced).   Though actually she was the one who clued me into PTSD,  just in an off conversation.  I never would have thought about it otherwise.  She had convinced me I was bipolar and I sought help for that at various times over the years.   But the treatment never worked.  Because I was not bipolar.

In my experience,  you need to get trauma therapy from a therapist who mainly does that.  Not a ""regular"" therapist that offers it on the side.

Don't discount your trauma.  Trauma therapy is about processing unresolved trauma.  You may not even be aware of it.  I help a friend by taking her to therapy appointments every week.  She just remembered,  probably as a result of doing trauma therapy,  something horrific that happened when she was 16.    Also stored, unresolved trauma has a lot of physical symptoms that you would never think were connected.  

So do some research on CPTSD.  You really have to be your own advocate.  No one is going to do it for you.  I wish a full recovery and peace.  We all deserve that.",coprolite_breath,9tn0q0

1,"Okay so this is a bit complicated.

For one, your therapist’s conclusion is likely correct, but the way they treated you was disrespectful, unethical, and potentially harmful.

You have a history of trauma, but it doesn’t sound like you have a goal of actually focusing on, processing, and healing from the fallout of that trauma. It sounds like your goal is to have someone to vent to about weekly feelings/events, and then for them to tell you what you should do about it. That’s not trauma therapy; it’s supportive counseling.

The hard part is that deeper problems like abandonment issues may very well be closely connected to your history of trauma. You might feel like all your relationships are one-sided because your history of trauma fucked up your ability to form healthy, balanced relationships. No amount of supportive counseling will ever fix those problems, because you’ll continue to show up week after week with a new experience (caused by those underlying issues), you’ll vent about it to your counselor, maybe they’ll give you advice about how to address that particular problem, but none of that ever touches the *reason* why these issues keep happening. Venting helps us cope and feels better in the moment, but it doesn’t teach us how to behave differently in our relationships so that they’re more balanced. Same with advice. Receiving advice solves the short-term problem, but it doesn’t teach us how to reflect on ourselves and change our own behavior, so we remain dependent on others to solve our problems for us.

Your therapist realized that they weren’t helping you recover by listening to your problem of the week, letting you vent, and giving you advice, so they decided to terminate therapy (in an unprofessional manner). If you want to resolve those deeper issues like feelings of abandonment and unbalanced relationships, then you’re going to need to do trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT), both of which are evidenced based treatments for the problems you described. You can seek supportive counseling, but it’s unlikely to resolve the problems you described in the long term.

Lastly, to clarify some other comments. Most psychiatrists are not trained in evidence-based talk therapies. They completed a 4yr medical school (MD or DO), did a 3yr residency in psychiatry which involves medication management as it relates to behavioral health, and have at most several months of training in talk therapy skills. They are experts in brain and body physiology as it relates to medication for behavioral health. You might find their services useful as an adjunct to ongoing behavioral therapy since medication can often help to stabilize our mood, but most are not therapists primarily (there are some exceptions, but they are few and far between). Given your trauma history, I strongly recommend seeking a licensed clinical psychologist (PhD or PsyD) for TF-CBT or IPT. They have 5-7yr of talk therapy training and are experts in assessment and behavioral intervention.

Hope this helps.",Reave-Eye,zr9ue3

In general therapists aren't there to give advice so much as listen, assess, and guide you to make your own healthy decisions. If needed they may help heal you but again this is you doing the work.

You're probably going to fair better with a ""counselor"" if you're looking for advice. There are many types, such as a guidance counselor, financial counselor, spiritual counselor, nutritional counselor, etc.

Keep in mind even a counselor needs you to provide him or her with a goal in order for them to give advice to reach it.

I know that these feelings come from a place of not having an objective in life, not having dreams to work for or a future to look up to.
After a life time of you doing what you are supposed to but not what you really want to maybe is time for you to step by step little by little do the things you always wanted to.
Start with a bucket list, write small and big objectives (example tasting the best pizza in town to having a gold statue) Some of them could be as ridiculous as ""learn to fly"" then you can break up that idea in ""fly in a helicopter for the first time"" or ""jump from a plane in parachute"" so somehow that objective can be obtainable.
And just do whatever eventually you will find your life how it was supposed to be. Might not cure your worry but it will keep you busy cuz at least you started something that might lead you where you need to be.

I want to offer you a solution because I believe there’s a reason why medications might not be working forever.

Life is temporary, and God wants us to know that we shouldn't be dependent on these medications. There’s a reason why meditating often at a church helps. You need something different, a whole new lifestyle change, and to know your purpose. Islam has all of that.

Everything you’re going through, all the pain you’re enduring, can be solved by submitting to Allah. Allah is sending you messages, whether through me or something else (like meditating at church), that the solution is out there for you to seek. It’s within your hands, brother. Go seek it.",Key-Impression9983,1byyx1m

4,"I know what you mean, man. 

I was bullied for my entire grade school life. In university, they didn't really give a shit—but in elementary, middle and high school, kids were cruel. I was often the only Asian in my class. Not only was I racially different, I was abnormally short, autistic as fuck, and considered ""intelligent."" So pretty much everyone had at least one thing to pick on.

The bullying I experienced still gives me flashbacks. I have three very ""innocuous"" triggers—as in, people do it without thinking or on accident. And unfortunately, they're very common actions, too: it's 1) when people clap once, 2) when someone leans in to talk to me, and 3) when people touch my leg with their shoe.

You have no idea how many times I've been sent into a full panic attack because of these three little things. These three little things that everyone fucking does. I can't even ask them not to do it because one of them is usually always an accident and the other two are just behaviours you don't think about. But my flashbacks so incredibly intense and the fact that they're triggered so easily weighs so heavy on me sometimes.

But there's an effect that you probably weren't expecting! Bullying has made me much more considerate and compassionate towards ""misfits,"" especially children and adolescents who other people have deemed ""weird"" or ""in need of intervention."" I always go out of my way to include people who I notice are being ignored or talked over, and I respond empathetically to people who feel like they just don't fit in.

As for help:

I would first recommend that you find a *good* therapist. There are a lot of bad ones out there. Don't give up, because good therapists do exist, and once you find one, it feels incredibly relieving. My therapist worked with me on both CBT and DBT skills. I mostly use DBT now, and it's saved me from a *lot* of panic attacks and helps my flashbacks feel less overwhelming.

If professional therapy is not an option for you at the moment, still try looking up CBT and DBT, and see if you can start using some of the concepts in your life. 

And finally—and this is kind of an underrated advice—just live your life, my guy. If you can stomach it, keep going outside and do some things. If you can't go outside, staying active at home helps, too. The only way to move on from your past is to gain life experience that show you how to, and you can't gain life experience by doing nothing. 

It's not even necessary to do anything special. I think, as we grow older, we grow wiser. There are just some things you don't understand until you've gone through it. You're 31, just think about how many things you can handle now that your teenage self couldn't.

I have always been very introverted and haven't had the urge to get attached to people. This meant I isolated myself from the people who bullied me, even went out of my way to extract myself from the ""friend groups"". From then on, I've felt the most at ease alone, relaxing only when isolated.

This social isolation of course stunted my social skills, which on top of my introverted nature caused me to develop social anxiety. It has gotten worse over the years, and now I'm on meds and therapy for it + depression.

Combine that w Covid & being autisitic and I keep having to remind myself that that's a big reason I'm shy, nervous to go up to people or say how I really feel or act like ""myself"".

You should maybe look into self-conditioning or cognitive psychology. Fears are a bit weird, you may feel drawn to the emotional response but after attempting or exposure to what scares you, you should have a mind to understand it's unfounded.

65,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this, but it's good you're reaching out for help. It's not uncommon for early experiences of bullying to have a lasting impact, affecting confidence and feelings of safety well into adulthood. This fear and anxiety you mention, especially when encountering similar situations or even reminders of past bullies, is a natural response to those past traumas but it's important to address them so they don't limit your life.

Working through these feelings often involves understanding and processing the emotions tied to those past experiences. A helpful approach might include exploring coping strategies to deal with immediate anxiety, identifying and challenging negative thoughts about yourself that were developed during those times, and gradually facing situations that evoke fear in a controlled and supportive manner. Seeking support from a therapist skilled in cognitive behavioral approaches or cognitive processing therapy could be particularly beneficial for you.

In the meantime, focusing on self-care practices and possibly engaging in activities that build confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment could also be helpful steps towards alleviating some of the weight you're feeling.

Kids thought I was ugly and a weirdo for being different. I barely had any friends. It was hard to make some because I was too scared to make any. I was like to even make one. I was made fun of and pushed around. This one time this girl threatened me with a knife because I was a weirdo and I didn’t do what she said. Another girl threw dirt in my face because she hated the way I looked. I hated being friends with girls for a long time because they’ve always treated me like an outcast. As I got older I started to realize that I’m unique and it’s really cool to be different. My social anxiety is well under control and once in a while I’ll have an episode (maybe once or twice a year) now I have a lot of friends who love me and I’m slowly opening up to being a girls girl. I’m trying my best to gain trust in being friends with girls. I’m sometimes scared to be friends with one because I don’t want them to back stab me or hurt me like many have before. In high school, some girls were mean to me too. Idk why but it’s okay because I learned that I don’t need them.

78,"In a nutshell...

I have been colder to people. I rarely open up nor do I engage with anyone. Back when I was kid (pre-bullying) I used to be warm and emphatic even though I am an introvert (and lowkey have autism spectrum disorder). Post-bullying during my school years, then high school years made me withdraw from people. I find it even harder to relate to people.

My alienation and introversion was exacerbated. From here, I feel more distant with people. I learned the ways of a cynic and pessimist (I'm not a nihilist). The zeitgeist of it all landed me with an answer - I have Persistent Depressive Disorder. I'm 26 as I write this, taking medication.

The fear rises nonetheless. An anxious throbbing heart would warn from the people whose actions and words are similar to that of my attackers, abusers, and manipulators. At a distance I am safe. Through time I have healed. But the darkness of that very, very long time persists.

There is always a nuance; it's not all men just like it's not all women.   
Men do get abused and hurt by women and by other men. Unfortunately there are just many troubled and mean people in the world.

Therapy can definitely help, but, if you can, I would suggest you to move to a less dense place, if you are living in a big city, as dense places tend to induce more stress in people, which tends to make some of them more violent.

It’s true, men can be very violent sometimes and of course more often than women. I am a man and I have had my fair share of violent encounters with other men as well. I can’t lie that it has made me a more on edge person. I can feel the energy immediately when I encounter a violent/aggressive man and I start preparing for a fight.

I shook my head when reading about what happened to your boyfriend because it’s a traumatic thing for both of you. Such a horrible thing to do to someone. People are absolute animals.

However, it doesn’t mean that all men are like that. The vast majority of men that I know wouldn’t hurt a fly - the violent ones are simply animals.

I have met plenty of women who are horrible people as well. Literally shit stains upon the earth, however because of their physiology they tend not to be as physically violent. Men are very strong, so them being violent is like them abusing their power. 

I hope you get the help that you need in psychiatry, and please try to carry some form of self defense.

11,"There's nothing really that can be said that will fix any of this. Many men are aggressive, violent ""people"" and that's unfortunately just how it is. It is traumatic. Only therapy and cognitive restructuring can really help with that. To regain a sense of control over our lives.

We have to accept that things are as they are either way, because in my estimation they're not likely to change within our lifetimes. Going outside is always a risk, especially late in the evening or at night. Whether you're on the streets, in a club, or a bar, it all comes with risks. And it can be much worse depending on your identity.

We can choose to live with the risk if we believe it's worth it, or try to avoid it as best as we can.

And I said we need to (re)gain ""a sense of control"", because really we don't ever have much control at all over society and its structures. We can't change those things, but we do generally physically have control over what situations we let ourselves get into and we can and have to prepare for eventualities like encountering aggressive and violent people, because we know they're everywhere even if they're hiding it.

That's why I always carry a knife with me. At least I can take solace in the idea that, if nothing else, if I'm attacked by someone they probably won't be leaving unscathed. That's what helps me feel more in control when I'm out at least. We don't have to feel completely powerless.

Men are just as important as women. We are both human. Also, I hate to add this... but women can be just as bad as men.

Like, I know first-hand that a lot of men are violent, subhuman pieces of shit. Neither the violence nor being associated with it has ever benefitted me as a masc enby in any way and it never will. And I know it's generally much worse for women and fem people, and it's absolutely OK for them to be wary of men because of it. Hell, as you say, a lot of us are just as wary of them really.

In the past I've also kept my keys in my hand as a sort of brass knuckles-like weapon when I felt uneasy. I hope you can find something better than that. I don't want to advise carrying illegal items with you, as I don't know if I would do it myself if they were illegal here. I can only recommend hanging out in groups, being vigilant and looking into unarmed self-defence strategies. I'm sure there are resources for that.

Not that you have to learn martial arts or anything. It's just good to know how to assess people and situations and whether they're dangerous, and knowing how to hurt someone if necessary and having confidence in your ability to do so and defend yourself and get away.

I mean, they say the best self-defence is to just run away and I guess it's true in a sense, but it's just not enough of a solution I feel.   
Some people will also say that you should avoid an escalation of violence, especially with weapons. Which is also true in a way, but fucking hell, if someone attacks you there have to be things you can do and means you can use to physically stop them from harming you.

I live in a pretty safe country, but in a country like the US I would probably even look into carrying a gun, and if I were a woman I definitely would carry one.

On the flip, I have dated extremely aggressive women (not physically) who didn’t care about my feelings and now I have a preference for a more gentle, caring woman who will understand my feelings.

And for the second example, I don’t see that as a benefit to me. If a woman is nervously rejecting men because she’s terrified of them, then that’s just horrible. How does that benefit me? I don’t want women to be nervous I want them to feel safe",Southern_Yesterday57,18wqwfc

And yeah absolutely women should be wary, just like you should be wary of a wild bear or tiger. They’re animals and they will hurt you. I think many women could benefit from carrying firearms.

Key is to limit going to places where these sorts of scum go. If it means telling your boyfriend to spend time with him you’d like to go out to dinner at 7pm rather than drink at 10pm, so be it. 

And whenever you are ready to go out at night, make sure it’s only to places where rowdy clientele won’t go. And I’ll tell you with age you will experience that once you earn more money at work and not need to go to say the dingy pub on the corner of the road.

He is also on a wide mixture of medicines and THC, but like you said, the side effects have their own downfalls. He is heavily sedated most of the time, and nights when he takes higher doses to fall asleep, he wakes up still exhausted.

5,Like all treatments it doesn't work for everybody. The drug is called Spravato. The only Ketamine drug insurance covers. It's a nasal spray causes disassociation. But on the fourth treatment I started to notice improvements. When you get to maintenance treatment stage it can be long term. I was preferring electro convulsive therapy. I was talked into Spravato but was skeptical. I've grown to look forward to every treatment. The disassociation is usually relaxing. Private room and recliner. I get a boost after a treatment. Sometimes a manic like boost but it fades. It's done enough that I highly recommend it. It's just time consuming and can take a while to kick in. Ketamine IV treatments for depression and chronic pain aren't FDA approved so you pay out of pocket $300 or $500 for pain every treatment. Must work if people shell out that money. I had a $4 copay on Spravato. Besides working on treatment resistant depression it is great for OCD. Still would have preferred ECT but got a pleasant surprise. There are risks if you're bipolar though. I paid the price but it was my fault. It is a controlled substance.,OutsideTheBirdCage,181xrtj
6,Yea she did ketamine infusion and financed it it was thousands of dollars. She said she would have haullcinqtions but it didn’t work. Do you take that drug spravato at home or was it in a clinic? She said Hers was in a clinic. Also did a normal psychiatrist per scribe it? Is it long term like antidepressants or it’s for a couple months? Sorry my spelling is really bad,blue_strawberryx,181xrtj
7,Spravato is done at a ketamine clinic. You must stay 2 hours after you administer the dose. Private room and recliner. Your vitals are checked at specific times. Ketamine is an anesthetic. Some people sleep the 2 hours. My psychiatrist recommended it. The doctor who owns and directs the clinic as actually an anesthesiologist...not a requirement. The psychiatrist recommends you. The clinic does their own assessment. Then they talk to your psychiatrist. It's twice a week for 4 weeks. Once a week for 4 weeks. Then customized maintenance treatments. I start that in 2 weeks and will continue once a week. Eventually every other week. At most once a months. Depression acts back up the increase the frequency as long as needed. Maintenance treatments can be long term. Your psychiatrist decides when or if you stop. Not the clinic. So it takes up time. Not driving the rest of the day after a treatment. Or sign any important documents. For them to do it you must currently be on an antidepressant medication. The day before a treatment you are emailed the same assessment forms. Your scores help the track symptom relief or if an increase occurs. Despite it being fairly new and a controlled substance insure companies don't fight it. My psychiatrist himself owns a ketamine clinic. But like him it's in another state so he had a bias favor towards it. I look forward to the disassociation...and Keurig. If I could have done electro convulsive therapy I would have had quicker relief and just 2-3 weeks of 3 days a week.,OutsideTheBirdCage,181xrtj

1," Thats totally fine mate, Always remember you are not a Robot even when life hands us things at 100 miles an hour we feel depleted and our energies start to diminish it is totally fine to take your time on things revise and brainstorm, take your self out for once as a reward we tend to not reward ourselves for our small successes but it is important to do so, also find something thats going to spiritually ground you and yes i said spiritually your physical is human but deep down you have a soul that connects with the earth. So take your self out on a drive go to a garden place or even a beach or anywhere that has scenery and away from other people for a bit and the city life, pay attention to the trees grass and the splashes of the waves when near a ocean your mind will automatically connect and calm itself down, write down a journel of thoughts and feelings this will make you ground yourself and calm you down from everything happening around you and from there you can see one by one of the actions you need to take of what you need to be done and taking your time on it, Like i said its super important to reconnect with yourself and that comes before anything else so find anything thats going to calm and sooth your mind there could be something that you never knew about but you start to enjoy it, youl know when your feel it in your gut and your brain will slowly start to slow down and relax it self just by visualising Nature. Everyone has a purpose here on earth and nothing is more powerful then your own brain it is a super computer so take time to give it a break and slow it down for a bit it will automatically do this when things around you aren’t rushing and putting pressure on you.",SuitableAntt,14w0htq

A famous psychiatrist named Abraham Low said, ""When we can't control our emotions, we can still control our muscles.""  
  
You might think that Low's idea has limited usefulness, but people who have had difficulty with self-care and getting out of the house to go for a walk have been finding the idea useful for generations, as far back as the 1930s. Some professionals say that Low's approach is the original CBT.  
  
Dr. Kelly McGonigal of Stanford taught The Science of Willpower and wrote a best-seller based on the research and her experiences with students of the course.

This solution will make you have a strong mind. What is having a strong mind? Like if a medical emergency unfolds in front of you, you don't freeze up, or if you see a danger come at you and you completely don't panic.

This solution to anxiety all comes from this guy Marcus Aurelius (some old Roman Emperor)

Summation of his strategy: Basically you can't control what is said to you, what you see, what your past actions have brought you to (it's in the past), but you can decide how you feel about it. So if you think of or see a concern or a danger coming at you; you can't control that, but you can control your feeling, your attitude or how you are going to feel about it

Some actual quotes from him

1.""The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."" (control your thoughts to control your life)

2. ""You have the power over your mind -- not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength.""

3. ""Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option: To accept this event with humility; To treat this person as he should be treated; To approach this thought with care so that nothing irrational creeps in.""

Try practicing this. Just try imaging something that triggers your fearful thoughts in a fictitious way or recall something real that does. Now stop yourself from forming any emotions/negative thoughts associated with the trigger and think how you should or want to feel that would be most competent.. Now see if you can choose for yourself to feel that way. Keep correcting yourself if your thoughts start to veer negatively. Now slowly in this state of having a positive/neutral/desired/ or competent feeling/emotion, while thinking about the trigger, start to try to solve or take action against this trigger. Don't forget the competent actions against something maybe just putting an honest x amount of hrs of work a day toward it, being kind, outlasting someone, ignoring it completely, asking a friend about it, putting it off to tackle it later, giving everything you have on it, there maybe more than one competent solution, or there is no satisfactory solution and just do the best you can do, or this is the end, nothing you can do... but you can have a superior attitude about it to enjoy the last journey to end (like U.S. marines have an attitude of seeking out and enjoying being miserable).",Lens_of_Joy,1co32wl

I went to a maths preparatory class (equivalent to an intensive foundation degree) and I was with only brilliant students : suddenly, I was not the best one anymore. I suffered from depression, I had to drop school because I had to be hospitalized for many months.

I hated myself, because I thought I had destroyed this brilliant future of mine by being weak, when I was just sick (mental illness is an illness). Four years later, I started studying in a field I like so much more, french litterature, and even if it's not considered as successful as the engineering school I would have had after my preparatory class, I am so much happier. I still struggle with mental illness, and with perfection syndrom, but I've learned that even if you think you failed, it's just another way to succeed. Four years ago I wanted to kill myself because I thought I was worthless and I failed at my life, while allowing myself to not be perfect helped me so much. Because I know I can't be perfect at everything I allow myself to try new things even if I'm not good at it, but because I enjoy doing it, I allow myself to take my time when I need it, even if that means I'll not have 100% on my test, I'm teaching myself that having 87% is more than ok. I'm still a bit anxious, and I learned that I have bpd so it'll possibly always be that way, but I learned that being perfect is not healthy, and you can be so much happier by allowing you to make ""mistakes"", because sometimes a mistake is another way to succeed.

They have an addiction to cannabis and video games, they can't be around people, very antisocial mostly of large groups. There's more but I barely know what I am talking about.

11,"I had my first anxiety attack in 1998 when I was 18. My doctor prescribed benzos instead of therapy. I trusted him, plus it was 1998 and we didn’t have the access to the information we have now.

He prescribed them to take daily - UNTIL 2020.

A few years after starting benzos for anxiety, I was diagnosed with depression.

Now that I am off all prescription meds (I’m using alternative methods now) I realize that the benzos actually made my anxiety worse, it deepened my depression, it made me numb to many things - including some trauma, and it gave me an easy way to develop hypersomnia. 

When I decided to taper off the Benzos, my doctor said “Are you sure?” even after I told him that I’m really reading a lot about how they shouldn’t be taken daily or long term.

It’s been over a year since I tapered off (the final Benzo prescription was 6mg of Klonopin a day!!!!) and I’m still angry that I didn’t know and that my doctor still doesn’t know how bad this was.

12,"After struggling through life untreated (and abusing alcohol for about 15 of my 54 years - from my mid 30's until I was 51), I decided to apply for disability after not being able to hold down ANY job. I even tried vocational rehabilitation after I got sober 3 years, 6 months and 13 days ago....to no avail. Of course, I lost at the first go around and am in the reconsideration.

The letter didn't mention my alcohol use as I have been sober, but did state that even though the department of Economic security found me disabled enough to give me vocational rehabilitation services, the SSA used different measures and found I was not disabled enough. I was 54 when I was denied. I have no plans on going back to drinking (unless I found out I had a terminal illness and I wanted to end it faster, I guess)....but I still worry the issue may come up.

I am new to treatment as I went most of my life untreated. I was dx with manic depression and BPD as a teen in the early 80's and just recently (3 weeks ago) took another assessment and was told I did not have bipolar, but SEVERE PTSD, GAD, as well as BPD and here is where I was surprised: schizo-affective disorder - bipolar type.

I saw a trauma therapist for 2 years after I got out of rehab and we did nothing but talk therapy. I have managed to block most of the abuse, but I score pretty high on the ACE test (as well as these assessments my psychologist had me take)

- trauma-informed care is needed system wide and i believe should be a standard of care. I feel embarrassed i was so blind to how much trauma people have faced and the effects it has.

-insurance companies do not want to pay for treatment that works bc the messiness and slow progress is not cost efficient for them.

-How do we advocate for better care and for our clients and our profession?

26,"Hey I just wanna say I’m in a similar boat. 

I’m 22, been in therapy from 11 to now (with a yr break from 19-20) and I have boatloads of trauma. 

While I can’t relate to becoming hypo manic, I can relate to the whirlwind of shit that comes from feeling the feels literally *once*. 

I’m working through my childhood and some prememory traumas from my life atm. It’s rough my dude. Like sessions go from chitchat about the week to trauma and my mood flips like a switch. One second it’s all “yeah the puppy is great!” To becoming extremely angry and upset once trauma is touched. 

I’ve tried to do trauma therapy when I was younger (15ish). That was worse. I was forced into doing a trauma narrative and it basically felt like talking to the detectives again. Every gory detail was wanted from me. 

Nowadays, my therapist is fantastic! We discuss how my traumas are affecting me *in the now*. My relationship struggles, lack of focus, being in complete shutdown when I’m left by myself for extended periods of time, getting overly angry because I was triggered, etc. She doesn’t force me to talk about the trauma itself, just how it’s still affecting me. 

Obviously, there’s points where I do explicitly state the trauma. And those feelings are hard. It comes out in word vomit and I end up wanting to eat every word I said bc I feel horrible for mentioning it. And it’s uncomfy to sit with that, but we (therapist and I) do. And they eventually pass. I think my whirlwind of emotions more so comes from when I *refuse* to sit with the uncomfy feelings. 

I get what you’re talking about with relapsing EDs and all the other coping mechanisms we use to try to get by on our limited knowledge of coping (or at least my limited knowledge of coping. Won’t speak for you). 

I hope some of this might help, if not I’m sorry. But I hope you find a caring therapist that helps you to connect with your inner child and helps you heal.",borderline_cat,niyvjn

That’s when I’d get the “you look like a deer in the headlights.” But it’s like they never STOPPED pushing and then they’d get frustrated and I’d feel bad I was wasting their time. 

I’m really lucky my now therapist is great! I think that’s part of the reason I would shut down with other therapists- I didn’t trust them really. But my therapist now really understands what it’s like to go through some unfair things in life.

I have limited coping skills *that I use.* it’s like I’ve learned coping skills that are better, but they don’t come as second nature and they don’t help my brain ACTUALLY calm down ... it’s for sure something I have to work on. 

I really really appreciate your comment. It’s nice to know when im not alone, really truly. Even though it does suck and it’s not like I WANT people to have been through it to understand, but knowing you do... a relief. 

It’s really great you’re doing the hard work and learned so much about yourself. Hang in there. And just to remind you, therapists don’t mind helping pick up word vomit.

I was wrongly diagnosed with bipolar and BPD. I did have what seemed to be literal manic states, checked all the boxes for it. They could never pin down if it was bipolar 1 or 2 though which made me question the diagnosis as a whole. 

Since being with my current therapist she’s taken away both those diagnoses and has labeled it as CPTSD stemming from childhood abuse/neglect.

I also want to say that if it happens to not be magical the first session, that's OK. Give it at least four, and if you're crawling to get away each session, ask yourself if you feel like the therapist gets it.

It's easy to assume anybody that does all that school will make a good therapist, but that's not always the case.

I bring this up because my first therapist was not helping me but I wanted help so badly that I forced it for months. You don't owe a therapist who's not helping you a damn thing (they won't feel bad) and you have every right to get to one that makes you feel like they get it. This is crucial to recovery.

6,"Good for you to recognizing the need for and then seeking help. It took me 30 years to reach out for help and then 10 more to talk about my trauma. After 4 years of seeing my therapist I finally trusted her enough to begin EMDR. 

I’d like to give you some tips from my own experience. 

You are in charge! You set the pace. There’s nothing wrong with stopping any session if you become triggered or uncomfortable. The idea is to chop the trauma into bite size pieces and process each piece individually until they’re all gone. This I learned the hard way. After my first session I disassociated until my next appointment a week later. I had no recollection of that week, but apparently gave myself a haircut, groomed my dog and on 2 nights I tried to cook dinner at 4 am. 

The first 2 months or so are spent learning and practicing coping skills. Practice, practice, practice. You simply cannot practice too much. You need these skills to become second nature!

Up until my first actual EMDR session I constantly asked how it works. I just couldn’t understand how it would work. My therapist told me that I don’t need to know how and to just accept that it does. Today I can tell you it does work but I cannot tell you how. I still don’t know. 

There will be peaks and valleys. Some days are great, some suck. Just be honest with your therapist about how you’re doing. However, expect some set backs. 

It may be hard and seem unending but is definitely worth it. You’re definitely worth it.",unknownbyeverybody,hbyjod

2,"**He takes medication for mood stability and anxiety and depression.**

Researcher, no medication has been proven effective for the long-term treatment of borderline personality disorder. BPD is believed to be caused by an inherited gene and/or by a childhood trauma (e.g., abuse or abandonment) occurring before age 5. Because the trauma occurs so early, it blocks the child's emotional development at age 3 or 4.

The child therefore has no opportunity to develop a strong stable sense of self identity -- and has no opportunity to learn the many emotional skills needed to be able to control his own emotions.

This is why a pwBPD cannot learn those missing emotional skills by swallowing a pill or talking about his childhood. Like a person learning to play a piano, he must work hard for many years in a weekly training program (e.g., DBT) to acquire those missing skills. One study (by John Gunderson & Frank Yeomans) estimates that 8 to 16 years are required.

**My husband has PTSD, anxiety and depression. He takes medication for mood stability and anxiety and depression.**

Although medication won't make a dent in the BPD itself (or his piano playing skills), nearly all pwBPD are prescribed meds. The reason is that the vast majority of pwBPD also suffer from 2 or 3 co-occurring clinical disorders -- e.g., bipolar, depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, or ADHD.

For example, 74% of pwBPD have a co-occurring anxiety disorder, 75% have a mood disorder such as depression, and 39% also have PTSD. The medications are targeted to treating those co-occurring disorders. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

**Please share advice.**

Researcher, I suggest you take a look at the r/BPDlovedones sub, where you will find hundreds of members sharing their experiences of living with -- or walking away from -- their BPD partners. In the right-hand column of that sub, you also will find a list of good books and links pointing to online resources. Moreover, Reddit's biggest BPD resource targeted to the abused partners is the r/BPDWiki",Up-Town,wog9ax
3,"**He randomly will become so angry with me and he does so in front of our infant son.**

When you're in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, Researcher, it is difficult to know that you're doing more good than harm by staying in the relationship. Whatever you do will be hurtful to him much of the time. A comment or action that pleases him on one day may greatly offend him when repeated a week later. Moreover, he often will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T do it.  
  
This conundrum is due to the position of his two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.  
  
Your predicament is that the solution to calming his abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers his engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming his engulfment fear (moving back away to give him breathing space) is the very action that triggers his abandonment fear.  
  
As you move close to comfort him and assure him of your love, you eventually will start triggering his engulfment fear, making him feel like he's being suffocated and controlled by you. Granted, he likely craves intimacy like other adults do but -- due to his weak self-identity and lack of personal boundaries, he cannot tolerate intimacy for very long. He thus will start feeling like he is becoming enmeshed in your strong personality. Yet, as you back away to give him breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering his abandonment fear.  
  
In my 15 years with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution -- between ""too close"" and ""too far away""-- where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate his own emotions and tame his two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away (by creating fights over nothing) and pull-you-back (by love bombing you).  
  
Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, an untreated pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. His subconscious does this to protect his fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside his body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, he consciously will be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU.  
  
Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you will often find yourself hurting him -- i.e., triggering his engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering his abandonment fear as you draw back, and sometimes triggering his fears even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing.

10,"**He does not blow up at others nor does he do it in front of others. That makes me question the BPD part.**

If he suffered from IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder), he would blow up around ANYONE (e.g., road rage against total strangers). If he is a pwBPD, however, he very likely does not show anger to strangers and casual friends. Most pwBPD are good and caring people -- as long as you don't get so close in a personal relationship that you start triggering their two fears. Their problem is not being BAD but, rather, being UNSTABLE.

Indeed, the vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning."" This means that they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, clients, casual friends, and total strangers. None of those people are able to trigger his fears of abandonment and engulfment.

There is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment. Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually appear only when someone (e.g., a casual friend) draws very close to the pwBPD.

This is why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to excel in socially difficult jobs such as being a social worker, professor, salesclerk, or doctor. And this is why most pwBPD can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers -- but often will go home at night to abuse the very people who love them.

Importantly, this does not mean that a pwBPD *chooses to control himself* around casual friends and strangers. Rather, it means that he experiences no strong anger around those people and thus *has no anger that needs to be controlled*. He experiences frequent anger around you and family members because, as noted above, you frequently trigger his abandonment fear whenever you draw away and you trigger his engulfment fear whenever you draw close.

This is why his very WORST behavior typically occurs during the very BEST of times -- e.g., the morning after an intimate evening, during a family holiday celebration, or in the middle of an expensive vacation. During such special events requiring prolonged periods of closeness, you eventually will start triggering his engulfment fear, making him feel like he's being suffocated and controlled by you.

Granted, he likely craves intimacy like other adults do but -- due to his weak self-identity and lack of personal boundaries -- he cannot tolerate intimacy for very long. He thus will start feeling like he is becoming enmeshed in your strong personality. Because his subconscious often projects those uncomfortable feelings onto you, he will be consciously convinced that YOU are the source of the unpleasant feelings. In this way, a pwBPD will start fights (over nothing) to push you away.",Up-Town,wog9ax

1," 

I'm really sorry to hear about what your boyfriend has been through. It sounds like he's dealing with some really heavy stuff, and it's admirable that you want to help him.

First and foremost, it's important to recognize that healing from trauma and managing mental health struggles like depression isn't a quick fix. It takes time, patience, and sometimes professional help.

Here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. Encourage him to seek therapy: Talking to a therapist who specializes in trauma and autism could be really beneficial for him. They can provide him with coping strategies, tools to manage his emotions, and a safe space to process everything he's been through.
2. Take care of yourself: Supporting someone who's struggling can be emotionally draining, so make sure you're also taking care of yourself. Reach out to friends or family for support, and consider talking to a therapist yourself if you need someone to talk to.
3. Encourage self-care: Help him find healthy ways to cope with his emotions, whether that's through exercise, creative outlets like art or music, mindfulness practices like meditation, or simply taking time to relax and do things he enjoys.
4. Be patient and understanding: Healing isn't a linear process, and there will likely be ups and downs along the way. Be patient with him and let him know that you're there for him no matter what.
5. Celebrate small victories: Recovery can be a slow process, so it's important to celebrate the small victories along the way. Whether it's getting through a tough therapy session, trying out a new coping strategy, or simply getting out of bed in the morning, acknowledge and celebrate his progress.",Classic_Ad_5292,1aqe9a2

4,"I consider myself a 'recovering depressive' - I was depressed for as long as I can remember up until the age of 30 and have (mostly, bar a spell where my relationship broke down, job went shit and I had other personal stuff going on) been 'clean' since then (am soon to be 45, so halfway toward evening out the score!)

&nbsp;

I know some people resent the terminology and think it is stigmatising to associate it with addiction, but for me I think there *are* similarities and it is only by talking about and understanding the conditions that we break that stigma - starting by challenging the notion that these are anything other than illnesses or that they somehow speak to some kind of moral failing or character flaw.

&nbsp;

I will never be one of those toxic positivity people that claims ""things will get better!"" because that ain't always true, for some people it never does...but for some people things *do* work out.

&nbsp;

I'm one of those people. I'm one of the lucky ones. So my view is that ""things *can* get better"" and I firmly believe that you have to be open to that possibility - if you tell yourself they never will, then that is a self-fulfilling prophecy and sure as you like, they never ever will.

&nbsp;

But if you can at least be open to the possibility that they *might* - then you give yourself that chance that they can. It's by no means guaranteed, and whatever the outcome it's a long and difficult struggle, but being open to a better future allows that possibility.

&nbsp;

Would I say I'm 'normal' or that I jump out of bed each day filled with the joys of life? No - but what the fuck is normal anyway? I live each day as it comes, generally content with my lot and manage to more or less enjoy life overall. That said, I'm always aware of that black dog lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce - just as an alcoholic can relapse after having a drink, I know that if I lapse back into the self-destructive thought patterns that dragged me down, I could be right back at rock bottom in the blink of an eye - so discipline and vigilance are the constants that keep me on a level.

I think that once you get it it's kinda always going to be there I just don't think it's possible to completely beat it once and for all or at least I haven't gotten to that point yet, but things do get better. I think with time you just learn how to control it and live with it, how to deal with all those emotions, you learn to not let depression overwhelm you and control your life. In a way it's like taming an animal, once you learn how to train it and keep it in check things become easier(hopefully you get the analogy I'm trying to make lol). I myself have struggled a lot with my mental health, 2-3 years ago I was sh and wanted to just end it, now although I still struggle with my mental I can say things have gotten better. It just takes time and unfortunately sometimes for things to get better they need to get worse first, but they DO get better. You may not see it now but in time when you look back you'll realize just how far you've come, all you need to do is keep going and keep fighting for yourself. And if I have to give advice, what I think helped me a lot is just taking everything one day at a time, one small step at a time and it eventually builds up. Therapy is definitely something you should consider or talking to someone friend, family. Also big thing is to not make your goal happiness, no one is always happy, happiness is just a temporary emotion like sadness, anger, pain, excitement etc. there will always be bad days,weeks even months and that's normal, that's life, it can suck but things happen then they pass and better days come, it's a cycle.

0,"I think you should look for another therapist. I’ve tried EMDR in the past with no results. That doesn’t mean it couldn’t work for you, but what concerns me the most is how much anxiety you’re feeling towards your therapist. Therapy is meant to be a safe space where you’re comfortable. If your therapist makes you this uncomfortable then it’s time to move on. To me this doesn’t sound like a very healthy experience and I think there needs to be more time to be invested in looking for another therapist. 

I think it’s fantastic you’re seeking help and I’m proud of you. It’s a hard thing to do so you’re very strong for going through this process. Finding a therapist that’s a good fit isn’t easy, but I urge you to keep going. You’ll find the right one! :)",,c7h9v2
1,"Thank you so much :) I would really like to talk to someone who tried EMDR but I can't find anyone. I'm really worried it's not the best therapy for me, but every time I try to talk to her about this she acts as if I'm not believing in it and I'm not making an effort. And that's really not the case. The only people in my life who I talked to about this have the same ""you don't want to try"" opinion and I'm lacking some support here. I'm not the type of person who gives up easily but I'm worried this will affect me more, instead of helping. 

It took me a really long time to find the courage to go see a therapist and it's been a difficult process. Finding a good one is really hard.",wendymoriarty,c7h9v2
2,"You’re really strong for going through this process. It’s extremely difficult. I’m still going through this process myself, I’ve had a therapist for a while that seems to have been working fine but rn I’ve been thinking it’s time for a change. When I tried EMDR I honestly didn’t understand it. It’s a very interesting process that didn’t work for me because it was too confusing and I felt that my therapist didn’t really care for me. Of course there’s always that “you don’t know if you don’t try” mindset, but I had the same mindset and after 10 sessions with EMDR my other therapist told me that of it wasn’t working I should have backed out earlier. I think there’s this notion that because of our mental illness that our judgement is impaired, which varies from different people. But I’ll tell you this. Just go with your gut, see what your other options are, and then if you still aren’t too sure then maybe you can reconsider trying EMDR. This is your mental health, and you have to do what feels best for you.",,c7h9v2

Was out on an antidepressant by a PCP in 1998

I was diagnosed as schizophrenic/manic depressive in 2015 and been in therapy/psychotherapy ever since. 

The EMDR I started 3 weeks ago to try and move past some trauma as my therapist thinks I was misdiagnosed and my symptoms are based on unknown childhood trauma. ",WerkQueen,8snggt
31,"It's very common from what I have read and been told! I worried that I was doing something wrong but my therapist explained that it's basically your mind resisting working through stuff. Our minds wants to protect itself. In my case I had a lot of childhood neglect/abuse and as a child we disassociate to protect ourselves because we don't have the power or control to protect ourselves. As an adult we do, so EMDR is supposed to help you remap neural pathways to ""process"" stuff, whether it's trauma, depression, anxiety, etc. 

Personally, the dissociation only lasted a couple weeks and I sometimes still space out a bit but I am doing much better. I am feeling more positive and hopeful for my future; I am confident you will get there too and get back to your job that you enjoy :D

Has your therapist taught you how to ""come back to reality"" or like... ""pull yourself out"" of the dissociation? I will try to not over explain it because you should ask them if they haven't explained it to you. Basically, you look at your environment and ask yourself ""what do I see?"" and list a few things in detail (""grey fabric couch, leather armchair, fan set on low"") and you work through your senses. ""What do I smell? What do I taste? What do I feel?"" 

That method has helped me a ton when I feel myself starting to check out. I hope it helps you! ",AtypicallyJakeDotCom,8snggt

If the forking thing is real for you, then it's real everywhere and for all time. If your present self occupies a newly forked universe, consider that every potentiality in the history of time and space also created such forks.

But the reality is this: A mole is a collection of melanocytes, which are the cells that give the skin its pigment. They can change and evolve over time. Some moles eventually fall off altogether. When healthy moles disappear, the process is typically gradual.

A disappearing mole may begin as a flat spot, gradually become raised, then get light, pale, and eventually disappear.

Other moles just seem to disappear suddenly. It happens. It's not evidence of a new reality.

Something similar happened again in 2012, when an SUV speeding off an interstate highway off ramp ran a red light and by all means should have struck and killed me.  Instead, I blanked for a moment and somehow found myself braked with the SUV flying by so quickly that it made my van shake.

32,"Someone else mentioned quantum immortality. I'm sure you have looked into that by now. This post caught my attention with ease because I experienced something very similar, but I don't know how I feel about it. 

When I was sixteen (thirty now) I was driving down the expressway with my mom. She was driving and we were doing seventy mph. A guy who had been up all night partying with friends and spent all morning as well was swerving in and out of cars. I heard the screech of his tires and saw a flash of white in the mirror and BAM. The impact struck like a blow straight from death itself. He his us from behind doing one hundred and twenty mph. This equates to a fifty mph impact. 

Once he hit us everything slowed as if time had taken on a new meaning. Our car began to do a one-eighty into the concrete median which we were two or three lanes from. We were moving with such speed and force I thought I would without a doubt be crushed upon making contact. Instead we hit the median and the car smoothly bounced backward and rolled onto its side. While we were mid-spin I knew I would die when we hit. I accepted it fully and felt overwhelmingly peaceful. I walked away without a scratch though I had some whiplash a few days after. I always have wondered if something more took place that day.

Others here have mentioned it could be a PTSD like after effect. I totally understand you questioning this, but I do believe it to be the case. Cars nowadays are so safe that people commonly walk away from crashes that were impossible to survive thirty years ago. I got PTSD from mine and it still haunts me today. I do believe otherworldly things take place and are more common than we realize, but the mind is such a powerful thing it to can play tricks. 

It is ok to ponder what happened that day and to keep an open mind but please do heed my warning here. Do not dwell on it too much. These types of things can drive a sane person mad with ease. Whether you survived or died in that crash is irrelevant. If you survived than it wasn't your time to perish in entirety and reality corrected the mistake. You are still here whether it's a parallel dimension or not. Live the life you are in now. Make the most of it. Don't waste it driving yourself crazy.

Be happy that yoou came out alive. Many people in all places of the world also have near deaths, near death is not synonymous for surviving, so i dont get the title. 
But I also had 3 similars experiences, exactly like yours, almost dying which I came out alive, now if you wanna explain it through quantum terms and parallel changes or quantum chances, when you were about to die that part of the universe you were splitted in 2, creating 2 probable versions of the accident, therefore saving you from death, that part of the universe splitted in 2 so you kept living and a symbolic mathematical ""you"" was created at quantum scale with another hypothetical mathematical outcome was created where another self instead of you may have occurred at quantum level, but only as information, not actuality, just for saving you from death, so youre lucky to have survived, this is the quantum immortality, which reality splits, transmutes so you survive.. but it's more likely false and just a joke some ppl use to explain near deaths... since it cannot happen due to the paradox of old age, you will almost die but there will be a time when you will die of natural causes or old age.

You experienced a traumatic event. You were in a violent car crash and your mind accepted death, and then you didn't die. You were in a physically and mentally and emotionally traumatic event. You are experiencing PTSD. There is a very large spectrum of PTSD subtypes and what you experienced as a child is different than what you are experiencing now they are however both PTSD. In trying to cope with trauma your mind has created a delusion of being in a different dimension.

[PTSD with Psychotic Symptoms](https://www.verywellmind.com/relationship-between-ptsd-and-psychotic-symptoms-2797525) is real and is somewhat common among war veterans that have experienced violent traumas. I am not a doctor or medical professional and I am not offering a diagnosis. Psychotic delusions are serious and need to be addressed. Psychosis can become very very bad if left untreated for a long time. You need to seek treatment from qualified medical professionals, even if only a therapist that specializes in PTSD. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh or cruel but psychotic delusions are not something you want to mess around with, left untreated they *will* fuck up your life - involuntary commitment to a mental treatment facility type of fuck up.

However, I would point out that whether this is some kind of symptom of PTSD, or if you're 100% right about the timeline switch theory, it's best to have a trained professional help you deal with it.

Having read through the comments a bit, to me this honestly sounds like you've now got some subconscious fears of the instability of life. Having accepted that you were dead, only to find that you were wrong is going to traumatize you, even in non-violent situations. There are a lot of documented cases of cancer patients becoming extremely depressed when they go into remission, because they didn't expect to live. It doesn't sound like you're depressed, but that type of mental trauma can cause a lot of unexpected symptoms. Your logical brain has basically found a way to explain both it's acceptance of death, and it's continued existence without having to accept that either is incorrect.

Well, if that's your question, there here it is.

It's IMPOSSIBLE to be due to quantum mechanics.

The interpretation on quantum mechanics (many worlds interpretation) does NOT suggest what you're trying to suggest here.

The quantum states non-interacting, therefore, you don't ""change"" any timeline of universe, you always stay in the same, no matter what, if you didn't die, then you didn't, your copies would be only non-interacting quantum states, if the interpretation was true, you would still not be sharing your consciousness or memories with anything.

The REAL theory of quantum many world, which is only one of thousands of others. DO NOT imply that you change yourself into any new timeline, but it simply states that if you survived an accident because you were lucky, because other quantum states may have died, instead of you. There is only ONE YOU, one original you, if you die in our universe you're dead, if you survived you'd still be on reddit to tell us the story.

*""No 'splitting' is implied by the Schrodinger equation itself: it tells us only that quantum systems evolve in a unitary way, so that superpositions remain superpositions and different states stay different. How, then, does a split happen?That is now seen to hinge on the issue of how a microscopic quantum event gives rise to macroscopic, classical behaviour through decoherece. Parallel quantum worlds have split once they have decohered,* ***for by definition decohered wavefunctions can have no direct, causal influence on one another***\*. For this reason. the theory contemplate is something like teleportation gone awy in an episode of Star Trek.""\*-- Beyond Weird: Why Everything You Thought You Knew about Quantum Physics Is Different (Philip Ball)

**Also, there can't be ""billions"" of copies. Energy is quantified.**

1. ""In quantum theory discrete regions of space have finite amounts of energy. ""
2. ""The probability of DNA-based life is greater than zero; and if the number of types of DNA-based living things is finite (because the size of the DNA molecules cannot be arbitrarily large)""
3. ""The number of possible histories in each region is finite because the energy in each region is finite and, according to quantum mechanics, energy is quantified.""

As for how to find someone to help guide you, it'd be similar if not exactly the same as finding a therapist or counselor (no psychiatrist or psychologist).

PTSD can take many forms but disconnect and distrust of reality are more common symptoms. They probably did the full CT/MRI regimen so your brain is probably fine. 
As for speculation on metaphysics this has always fascinated me. Tiny differences in circumstances could have really killed you, but you lived. Feeling reborn after accepting death is kind of like ego dissociation. You aren’t in the same universe to you anymore and that’s fine. You’re looking for signs to anchor you and also to tell that this isn’t real. In a way, you did enter an alternate reality bc this accident changed your perspective on life, and that is your reality to you.
Even though I didn’t face death, I had a point where I accepted my fate once. It changed me, I worked on myself a lot since and even though what happened was horrible and it changed me, I made it for the better. But the few months afterwards I was questioning if I really made it out and was waking up everyday with a surreal feeling-I tried to numb that feeling of unease with drugs and that worked until it wasn’t enough . That went away only after I started trauma therapy, EMDR was helpful as fuck. I accepted what happened and that I was still here and moved on (sadly more shit has happened since which left me with the same feeling and I’m working on it again). Best of luck 

Edit: come to think of it I have faced death this summer, was staring down the barrel of a gun during a Home invasion and I felt weird sensations and predictive thoughts of being shot at the time (like a tingling) in my stomach expecting bullet holes to be there any second) and it definitely affected me.

Just a suffocating nothingness.

 It's hard to emotionally sit with. People have founded institutions, religion, and even secular movements all in the name of dealing with death anxiety and existential angst. People engage in addictions, sexuality, aggression, all as some extension of this primal fear. Many of our compulsions have to do with death anxiety.

...made more traumatic by the fact that you are also alive. I've noticed that you seem unable to let go of this memory/thought, even though you want to. Not being able to let go of a traumatic memory/thought... you've been through trauma before, does that have a familiar resonance?

Secondly, the physicists you mention do talk about MWI (which has nothing to do with the sci fi absurd you said above tho, But, besides MWI being an invalid interpretation, No, they dont consider it to be possible in rl AT ALL, first of all, no physicist ever said the weirdness scale up to our scale, no, it remains at quantum scale, second, the interpretations are based on mathematics, they considered it as a possible mathematical interpretation, just like thousands of others, even you can create a mathematical interpretation trying to explain the double slit, however, the MWI (besides having nothing to do with rl) was proven false as a mathematicL interpretation afterwards,  inconsisitent , but can also be debunked through the thousands of paradoxes it creates.

The same goes for your situation, only the marks left on your brain and nervous system aren't necessarily as ""visible"" as a mark on your hand.

I am going to outright say it though, you do seem slightly psychotic, although you speak, perfect, coherent language. Your answers are thought through, and you sound perfectly rational.

You may also have traumatic brain injury. Although like others, it sounds more like a mental health issue.

And I would argue it’s not necessarily ptsd. People forget trauma comes first, ptsd is when the trauma doesn’t heal through a normal progression. No one talks about the effects of trauma because it’s normal. It’s the prolonged effects of trauma that don’t go away that are considered post traumatic stress disorder.

It really sounds to me like you’re brain is trying to make sense of what happened to you and is grasping at theories that you are aware of. This is especially common when something profoundly shakes us and is outside our control to prevent.

I passed out and fell down some stairs within the last 6 months, woke up/regained consciousness while still moving, but more or less at the end of the fall. I was facing head down halfway down the stairs, and I believe I had sorta been trying to catch myself before I became aware of my surroundings. 

It was EXTREMELY disorienting. Nothing made sense. As I came to, I felt a sense of confusion, I knew I was falling, but not why, where I was, what time it was, how to get out of that situation safely, how hurt I was. I didn’t remember anything prior to the fall until I was out of that position. And it was extremely scary.

I was fine other than bruises and a few scrapes (I was also really lucky; I live alone.)

And yet, for the next few nights I had trouble sleeping because my body was convinced it was going to fall off my bed.

And 6 months later, I still get a weird feeling around those stairs. Even if I’m no where near where I could fall down again.

I suspect this feeling might be what’s driving this. You didn’t recognize the world you were in because nothing made sense. Add to that trauma and your mind is off to the races as to explaining why you feel odd.

Many-Worlds Interpretations Can Not Imply 'Quantum Immortality' Jacques Mallah PhD

This is not even bad pseudo-philosophy, as even bad philosophy requires a minimum of rationality. 

Let's us all think ""outside the box"". Maybe the earth is flat and is controlled by flying horses from the blue planet... 
or maybe people who survived an incident and acquired cotard delusion are living in a parallel reality where they are in a type of ""purgatory"", because quantum mechanics..obviously....

This is not thinking outside the box, at ALL. This is being a loonie and irresponsable to even suggesting this obvious idiocy to people.

Ppl like you who is responsible for fake news and nonsense in the world, there are rational ways to think outside the box without a tinfoil hat.

You're the stupid, not only that, but either mental or delusional (the cotard one), which I see no problem unless you don't suggest your delusion as an advice to others and you keep quantum mechanics out of this.

Cotard delusion is a rare mental illness in which the affected person holds the delusional belief that they are already dead, do not exist, are putrefying, or have lost their blood or internal organs.

I have a friend who is similar, she is very level-headed and tries to put a brave face on no matter what she's going through and I can always see her pain building up inside before she eventually can't keep it all internal anymore and she spills it all out. I try to make her feel comfortable and let her know that it's okay to feel the way she does, but I can tell she always feels guilty for letting it out. 

from my perspective, it is heartbreaking knowing she's suffering inside without telling anyone. I wish she would feel more comfortable being vulnerable, it actually makes me feel closer to her and I always feel relieved when she lets it all out because I don't want her suffering in silence. I want to be there for her. I want her to feel comfortable crying in front of me because that means she trusts me enough to be vulnerable around me. I like helping carry her burdens when she lets me, even when (especially when, actually) I have my own stuff going on because it reminds me I'm not the only one struggling, takes my mind off of my own problems, and gives me a sense of meaning to know I'm helping her feel less alone. 

I don't know if any of that means anything to you or not, but I just want you to know that your loved ones probably feel the same. part of loving someone (platonically or romantically) is being there for them when they need you. your loved ones won't judge you for how you look or sound while crying, they just want to support you and see you happy.",,lhu7rd

If there are supportive people in your life that you can trust, it is good to let them in sometimes instead of only supporting them. It feels good when friends let you help them.

29,I’m sorry to hear that. Hope you had a good cry,UsualMorning98,lhu7rd
30,"If you struggle to answer the second question then it is because when someone cries around you, the attractiveness of their face isn't what is important to you in that moment. The same logic works in reverse, and when someone you care about sees you cry, then how your face looks is not any concern to them. Being open around people can be very difficult. I have struggled with it my whole life, but one of the things that helps me most is to try to make myself remember that the small things I hate about myself aren't usually noticeable to others and if they are then the people who really care about me usually aren't thinking about them at all. Your real friends won't care if you have an ugly cry face any more than you would care about one of them having an ugly cry face.",NotDelnor,lhu7rd

45,"I’ve always tied being vulnerable to leaving myself out in the open to be taken advantage of, bullied, rejected or even more alone then had I just kept my mouth shut. Keeping myself open like that makes me feel like people are taking pieces of me to use for selfish gain",UsualMorning98,lhu7rd
46,"Thank you so much!

I think my problem is that I set myself different expectations than with other people, since I’m in my own mind and know my experiences. I can tell myself to wait and I know my limits. Meanwhile with other people, I don’t know what their life experience is really like and what they’ve been through. So I handle them with more care.

I do get days where I know I deserve it, but hold back to do something else. But then have days where in the back of my mind I feel like the scum of the earth and deserve nothing because I should be punished for getting to this point",UsualMorning98,lhu7rd

This has transpired over the last two weeks.

As context, I’m not much of a crier. I don’t consider not crying a point of pride or anything, though I do think I’ve conditioned myself to be ‘tough’ and not ‘break’. I, like you, hold it all in so people think I’m stable (whatever that means). 

This week, I’ve found myself in the most difficult experience of my professional career. A new, very high level and high pressure job, and a deep sense of not being good enough. It led to a breakdown, in front of HR. In other words, the thing that was the worst imaginable in my mind - happened. 

And you know what? I am alive. 

I may not have the job come next week (it got escalated as a mental health issue to my new boss). But I’m alive.

The reaction I had was real. It was human. It wasn’t malicious. It there for is not something I, in the deepest sense, regret. And there’s a sense of calm and clarity that comes with knowing that the worst that could happen has happened. Now nothing can hurt me.

It also prompted the HR rep to deeply and meaningfully commiserate with me. It led to a very open conversation with my wife. It led to me seeking professional counsel, and to connecting with a friend at a deeper level.

When it’s all said and done, I will come out of the experience a better prepared, more balanced person who is kinder to themselves and others.

I used to cry pretty easily but I went through a phase where I stopped crying and feeling anything because my heart shut off.

With being overwhelmed, I feel journaling about it might help as writing it out rather than keep going in head helps.
For low self worth, I struggle with it too but it's just constant effort on how you talk to yourself everyday don't talk to yourself in a way that you won't do with someone you love or best friend

1,"This might not be the greatest advice but, I’m in a similar situation myself - job to job ups and downs and burnout and anxiety before I even show up, just general dread. 

Therapy is always a good option. But realistically - take a breath and remind yourself that no one really cares. I feel like you’re having a little bit of spotlight anxiety. Just take a deep breathe - my fiancé told me that I needed to understand that you’re there for what you need to do and so are other people, they’re usually not too worried about other people around and if they are it’s because they’re worried about their other coworkers In the same way you are and it eased my anxiety a lot. Go in with a smile even if it’s fake and just keep a positive energy about you - maybe do something you like (like training your brain the way you do a dog with treats) on your breaks or before you go in just to ease your stress. 

I would try to maybe think of some rather vague things to say in response to coworkers and not allow the toxicity or tension of the environment to drain you once you’re home. As soon as you walk through the door image all that just washing off your shoulders. 

If it’s the job itself realize that jobs come and go, maybe line another position up or get yourself a work from home position if it’s just the social battery drain. 

I wouldn’t beat yourself up! The pandemic really impacted everyone and not in a fantastic way, you’re doing the best that you can and you’re trying, don’t let your mind be your downfall! I know it’s hard but I feel you and I understand!! I hope this helped in some sort of way! Keep your head up!",,tyulfx

5,"Honestly, I really do think some places are very understanding of it, my college found out that I lost my housing and did everything in their power to help my family and I find another place to stay and helped us with food. But, on the other hand, the job that I had before everything started was not understanding at all - I was fired for a Covid test taking almost 3 weeks to return results and this was in March-April 2020 I believe. 

BUT, my fiancé works for a very understanding place, they’re even offering him same day pay if we need it and the job I’m with now is allowing me to work from home because I have an autoimmune disease. Sometimes it’s really just trying on a location to see if management and environment work for you. 

I don’t blame you honestly with the whole corporation thing, maybe just hold out hope until you could find yourself a sustainable side hustle. You could sell art, make a YouTube channel, work with animals, work with a small mom and pop shop. I understand they may not be feasible but it’s better to be broke and happy than depressed and burnt out with a few dimes.",,tyulfx

0,"I went through extremely similar things. My trust issues were out of control. It’s been a constant battle, but it’s just been therapy on and off for about 5 years now. Medication can help, it varies person to person. I took Buspirone for a bit until I had adverse effects. 

As for the messaging the ex on Facebook, it may not give you what you want lol. I’ve been there. I felt dumb after. Will it really give you what you want? If the ex says no, will you believe it? You can throw yourself down a further hole. Communicating with your partner is so important. Telling them what can make you uncomfortable. Letting them know things that they can do to help reassure you. It will be hard to accept someone who can be telling the truth. You have to take the chance of trusting again. The truth always comes out, don’t waste your time and energy trying to search for it. You will lose your mind. 

Being where you’re at now.. I get it. It gets to a point where you try to find any and every little thing to PROVE that your gut feeling was correct. It’s never worth going through a partner’s phone or messaging exes. Doing this just comes with more guilt sometimes or more unanswered questions. 

For the paranoia, do you have hobbies? Exercising for me is something that helps soooo much  exercising and a nice shower to help sooth you a bit. Going for a walk. Anything to get your body fixated on something in a positive manner (look into different grounding exercises). That would be my biggest advice to deal with it in the meantime until you can see a therapist. I wish you the best with your journey",megacunt312,1bzz2gs

2,"It's comforting hearing experience from someone who's dealt with this kinda thing personally. Yeah, I'm not gonna message his ex lol, as much as I'm dying to.
I have a lot of hobbies and interests, I love baking, cooking, exercising, running, drawing, foraging and looking for mushrooms and plants to identify etc. I've been very depressed and unmotivated to partake, and the anxiety ruins the enjoyment I get whenever I try to do them so I've been focusing on trying to manage both of those symptoms. 

Also when I get into these anxious/paranoid moods it is EXTREMELY hard to pull myself out of it. It becomes all I can think about, it dominates me and overtakes me completely. I feel like there's something fucked up in my head that won't allow me to stop thinking about it when I have paranoid episodes. Hopefully the medication helps and I can start to worry less and enjoy things again. Thanks for the advice and the well wishes, I'll keep trying my best. 🥲",punsexual69,1bzz2gs
3,"Yeah the paranoia that dominates is no joke. I would rot for hours and then I felt like I would get brain fog from getting so worked up LOL. Those are great hobbies to have! Running would probably be the best since it’s a tad bit mindless compared to the rest. 

Possibly phone a friend? That would help me. I wish I could give you more. The paranoia feels like unbreakable chains 

Just know there’s nothing wrong with you. It may be hard for others to understand, but everyone copes with things differently. I know it’s a generic thing to say, but it’s true. IN TIME things will get better. I hope you like your therapist. CBT has helped me as well as EMDR.

I'm a fellow Aussie, with the same disorders you've listed (plus more on top) and I've been in and out of therapy for the last 8 years. 

I'd suggest focusing on coping skills to help you manage stress. Both CPTSD and ADHD can cause stress (along with the Schizo of course), and from my experience, stress definitely worsens my Schizophrenia symptoms. If you can learn coping skills for the stress, it'll also make it a more safer experience when trying to process trauma (if that's something you'd like to focus on) through stuff such as EMDR. 

I'd also suggest seeing if you can apply for the NDIS, as some mental health practitioners offer lower cost appointments for those on or applying for the NDIS (my psychologist costs about $40 per session since I've applied for the NDIS).",Fancypotato1995,1cq378q

Also, if you do need to go to a doctor tell them you have medical trauma. You don't have to go into detail. Doctors and medical providers are people too and will do what they can to make the experience easier for you.

Psychiatrists say that although grief is not the same as depression, it can lead to depression. If the symptoms last too long, the condition should be regarded as a case of depression and treated as such. You're describing depression symptoms.   
  
Advice from experts in my comments - standard treatments and the self-help recommended by therapists. A lot of things can help, some of them very easy.  
  
The lockdown has changed the therapy situation. You may want to look at online therapy and self-help. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.  
   
   
What I usually tell people -   
   
Treatment usually begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  
   
If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.",RWPossum,yzh04j

28,"I don’t know what advice you want. You say in the post that you always get the advice of “go to a therapist”. So you must have an idea of what advice you want, if you know what you don’t want? 

I hate to be that person, and I feel that this advice is everything you clearly don’t want to hear, but there is NO way to get over those issues without some form of therapy. Since what your describing are actual phobias and mental challenges that are inhibiting your life, that’s exactly what therapy exists for. You might be able to find therapy that’s not conventional like you might find an activity/group/person who’s not a license therapist but that helps you get over some of the issues you mention, but the fear or nudity and fear of woman if those are legitimate phobias then really only a trained professional will be the one to help you get over it. 

I don’t know if the advice you want is that finding love or the right woman would help you get over these things, but you clearly have quite a lot of issues. It wouldn’t be fair, responsible, or grownup to know you have these issues and inflict them on someone in a relationship with you. 

You need to overcome these problems, anxieties and phobias with therapy and professionals and then start to build a life where you can have an adult relationship with a woman. 

The reason you always get the advice to find a therapist is because it’s probably the only thing that’s got a great chance at working. Therapy is hard, it’s draining, it’s painful, it usually costs money (there are LOTS of free therapy and discounted therapy but you will have to seek it out), and it takes a lot of time. That’s the reason people generally don’t like therapy and don’t invest the time into it. If you can muster up the strength, energy and motivation to be concerned with being on a long journey of recovery then it will be a success. Otherwise you’re just going to compound and add more issues to your already existing ones. 

I also hear time and time again that people have “tried therapy and didn’t like it.” They either didn’t agree with their therapists, or didn’t have a good relationship with them etc etc. Getting a chip on ones shoulder about all therapy because a few therapy sessions or therapists have been below par or not successful is like ruling out all restaurants because you ate in one you didn’t like. 

The thing people often don’t make clear about therapy is that you have to find the therapist that is right for you, therapists are rarely going to advise you see someone else because they make money from you, but actively seeking a therapists that you have a good relationship with and can be honest with is the only way therapy will work. That might mean having to meet and visit several therapists before you find the one that works for you but that is the only way to find good therapy. There are also so so so so so many different kind of therapy for different issues and now there is a whole branch of online therapies. 

I believe that honest is the best policy and sometimes that means being blunt to put the point across: without therapy you won’t overcome these issues. It seems that you’ve been snuffing at other people’s advice because it’s not what you want to hear and it would be hard work.",,roi56y
29,"My only advice is to stay away from incel pages, as they become awful and toxic. The fears you have aren't a reflection of you, and your negative self-image is your brain bullying you. 

Besides therapy, I would look at self love exercises.

One my therapist taught me was:

""I am (insert whatever), today, period.""

You could say:

""I am handsome today, period.""

It's a way to trick your brain into breaking negative self-thought loops. I could explain the idea behind it, if you wanted, but it really, really helps.

33,"honestly even if you do go to therapy, you have some phobias, and the only genuine cure for phobias is exposure therapy.  you might as well just expose yourself, on your own time.  now i highly recommend therapy for BDD.  but for phobias i’d like to see some exposure first.  

put yourself in environments to meet people.  probably bars or clubs or something of that sort.  expose yourself to your phobias by putting yourself in social situations with women.  just regular small talk with a woman counts, and it’s an achievement for you to be proud of.  it’s a start.  take as long as you need.  this stuff takes time and you gotta keep working towards it.  

let’s say you get good at small talk and regular social interactions with women.  i would start working on your gymnophobia.  id start by exposing yourself to pornography honestly.  this way you can be alone and deal with your reactions and emotions towards it on your own time.  i personally wouldn’t just go telling everyone about your struggles, just because people (very commonly women) can be quite judgmental.  but if you can find a good, trustworthy friend to help you get used to seeing a body uncovered, then this will probably work best as a form of exposure.  this will guide you towards positive sexual interactions.  this also takes time, and it’s okay to take as long as you need! some people need months, some need years.  it’s all perfectly fine!

Start a meditation practice, the sooner the better.
Something about delayed virginity makes you hyper-tense even if there are no external reasons for it, so meditation for me became a helpful practice to calm down in the morning and not be so irritable.
The hyper-tense thing becomes more apparent the older you get.

Start a hobby like drawing or exercise you can do everyday.
Drawing for me allows myself to express emotions/interests in a way that seems more private/intimate than discussing them with others, and this helps fill a void.

Walking for me helps battle social anxiety for some reason and it's also helps with stress, so that is a twofer.

Make and keep strong family ties if you can.

Many can relate to feeling picked on and pushed into the gutter alone by some unknown force, it's just in different ways for everybody and some have it tougher and have to be stronger than others. The good news is you can eventually learn how to make yourself happy and confident no matter what problems you face - your looks, your issues that seem to complement eachother perfectly to torture you in the meanest way imaginable. All that matters is you and your happiness, not sex or being liked by others or even being ugly, those will seem more superficial if you manage to suffer enough to reflect and see the deeper meaning in life and grasp how to reflect in the most honest way and grow. Also I will hopefully offer you some comfort in that I know for a fact there are people who care far more about your personality than your looks, you just have to weave through your issues while learning and observing your thoughts through the years, stay alive long enough and be open minded to everything and all ideas, don't get too attached or sucked into any thoughts or principles, stay open-minded and learn how to change your ideas, building and adapting them by observing others faults and successes and evolve your thinking patterns and philosophies on things to feel less scared and lost in the midst of the unknown. You will feel like your mind is stuck and attached to certain insecurities that you feel you can't get out of, you will also have moments where you feel free from them. What matters is learning what you need to do or how to think to get to that freedom and when you finally learn how to grow and fall into your personality and gain some confidence, people will see past your looks and see your strength and the beauty and uniqueness of the personality you learned how to build yourself into and someone will love you. 

I am 27 as well I think, maybe 28, I don't know I can't count. Anyways I have learned these methods over the 8 years I've been tormented with severe ocd among other things by reflecting, being thoughtful, considerate, honest and caring for others' wellbeing the same as I care for myself. We are all human and we all relate to eachother in the most fundamental of ways. Learn from others, yourself and learn how to seperate yourself from your insecurities and bolster your personality and you will feel much happier and secure. Also the most important thing ever is to never lose faith in yourself.😌🥺📯🛎🤏🙂",Redgrievedemonboy,roi56y

57,"Well, there's possibly two main things people want from relationships: sex and companionship. For the former, and this is just my personal opinion, its value correlates with how much you want it. I don't see any reason to *try* to want it. It sounds like it isn't ideal for you given the issues you have and I don't think you should put pressure on yourself to feel differently.

As for the companionship - that can be really beneficial to people (especially those with depression) but again it works for some more than others. 

If I was to guess an answer - I'd say walk before deciding whether you want to run. Work on friendships and meeting new people including women. Don't feel pressure to get a girlfriend but do see if you start feeling more like you'd specifically want one.",Lanskiiii,roi56y

59,"I had a friend with a similar situation. It started with his parents never showing him what a loving relationship looked like (consider reading “adult children of emotionally immature parents”). Anyways, he said that he started with “massages”. That could work for you since they stay clothed. Then as he enjoyed it, added more “services”. Felt new things, learned a lot, and eventually got over that phase. Found the love of his life, and they seem pretty happy now. 

If it’s worth anything, people around him had no idea he was going through so much mentally. They thought he was normal and striving actually. So another strategy could be “fake it till you make it” lol.

1,"(Sorry for my English, I'm using a translator)

A comment above questioned him about actually being a narcissist, having called himself that, and a legitimate narcissist, would never do that.

I disagree. I have a lot of contact with narcissists, both because I was a victim of one, also following the cases of very close friends of mine, who had relationships with people like this, and also because I study the subject.

Narcissists feel special because they are different. Many, in the height of their arrogance, consider narcissism as something positive, as it only reinforces their self-view of being special.

But in most cases, they reject the idea that they are narcissists. However, they often use this to victimize themselves, referring to themselves as narcissists, as someone with a problem, but they themselves do not believe it, they use this speech only to manipulate you, make you feel sorry, as if they were victims, and thereby justifying their abusive attitudes

Every victim of narcissism has the impression that they always get along well. Because they are highly manipulative, they give the impression that right after destroying their life, they find a new person, deceive that person, make it seem like they are a good guy/girl. While you are completely torn apart, trying to pick up the pieces, that person who destroyed you is there, with another, in an apparently happy relationship, as if nothing had happened. Feeling of injustice

But after this phase of anger, which is totally understandable, you will realize that this is just an illusion: The harsh and even sad reality is that a narcissist is condemned to self-sabotage throughout his life, with practically minimal chances of a cure, as there is no effective treatment for narcissistic personality disorder.

The vast majority of people can make a lot of mistakes, but they learn from their mistakes, make amends, and evolve. Most psychological disorders, if treated well, can be cured or even alleviated, as the person understands the problem, is willing to change behaviors, follow treatment and, when necessary, use medication, and with that, can have a full life, reasonably normal and free from suffering.

But not for a narcissist: As they are unable to understand and accept their own problem in 90%+ of cases, there is nothing they can do. And all their actions will inevitably lead them to ruin. It doesn't matter that they are great manipulators, so they can deceive people to obtain their own benefits (money, relationships, status), their high ego, their arrogance, their lack of empathy, their fetish for manipulating and controlling, and their true self: They are people empty of spirit, in the end, will ALWAYS lead them sooner or later to their downfall, in everything. You can sustain a lie for a long time for many people: But never forever. And narcissism, their essence, is precisely the lie.

Having said all that, what you can and should do is: Therapy. Not only to put the pieces back together, but to close the gaps: Narcissists only have relationships with people with psychological disorders. A narcissist will never stay with a healthy person for long. If a narcissist entered and established himself in your life, it is necessarily because he noticed your gaps and weaknesses, and used this to enter and establish himself.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy will help you identify these vulnerabilities and their origin. With this, you and your therapist will be able to chart a path so that you can improve, evolve as a person, increase your self-knowledge, putting a real barrier to abusive people's profiles (narcissists are not the only ones). You will realize that many of the reasons why you wonder why all this happened, their origins are there in the formation of your own personality, which took place in childhood.

And finally, obviously, cut off any contact with him. Don't allow him to come back into your life, you can be sure he will come back (yes, narcissists always look for their exes when they get things wrong), he will try to activate all your triggers to convince you to give him another chance. Don't allow yourself to have this relapse.

I think that's it. As I said, I have a lot of experience with this subject, so if you want to talk more about it, feel free to send me a PM, I'll be happy to help you (:",rapid_rodrigo,1axnt76

He obviously doesn't have it number one, bc if he did he would be ashamed about it- not use it against you. And second, he clearly doesn't even know that- he's just using it to fuck with your head. You need to focus on you. I'm a younger one, and i actually had my 15 yr old ex go fuck around w some 20 something yr old so i have some understanding of ur pain. The thing you really gotta get tho- and im gonna warm you here

5,"Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to this in such detail. I really appreciate hearing from someone who has had first hand experience with a narcissist because some people just don’t understand how deeply complicated it is to be a victim of one. It really fucks with your mind even after removing them from your life. 

I do agree that he was using it as a way to be “different” from other people, and he knew I have such deep empathy and understanding for those with mental health struggles so I could never blame him for being mentally troubled. And he certainly pursued me because he knew I was deeply in pain and struggling during that time of my life. My therapist says he liked when I was unhealthy, and knew he had the power to keep me unhealthy. He liked that I thought I needed him but he didn’t need me. The manipulation and gaslighting was insane. 

I do really appreciate this response. It’s really hard to have some people remind me that he clearly never loved me. I know that and have accepted it a while ago. I’m not struggling because I want his love- I’m struggling because he continues to have power over my life and emotions and I want nothing more than to take my power back. Luckily he will never be in my life again (legally can’t speak to eachother).",DesperateAd9898,1axnt76

7,"Thank for you taking the time to respond! And for the recommendations. I am definitely curious into looking into why I attracted him. I think it was mostly that he saw I was broken at the time and he knew I was susceptible to manipulation. But for why I accepted that and continued pursuing him after he showed his true colors is something I want to understand. I’ve been tapping back into my spirituality and trying to stop wondering why the world is the way it is, why there’s evil people, why am I always a victim.

8,"And another thing... all those things you can't help but ""wonder""? You're not wondering. That's what you hoped he would become for you- and let me say you have no part in who he is. Everything in everyone's life is based on the decisions that they make- he just didn't make you part of his decisions. It can be hard to come to terms with but that's... most times, really all there is to it. Sure you might ""care"" about him in some way, and that's perfectly fine- you can still wish him well. That doesn't mean you need to put up with any of the shit he put you through.",TheRealestOne2007,1axnt76
9,"I understand perfectly, because until 2022, I didn't realize it, but I had Wendy syndrome, a condition that makes you sacrifice yourself for the person, take on their pain and responsibility, save them, be the hero to the detriment of yourself.  This creates emotional dependence, because when you want to ""save"" your loved one, you are just having all your energy sucked away, which is obviously the perfect victim for an abuser.

 Empathy is a scale from 0 to 12, where 0 is exactly a person completely codependent and vulnerable to others, and 12 is a psychopath completely devoid of scruples, empathy and respect for others.  We must fight to stay in the 6, where we feel love, compassion and respect for others, but also feel love and respect for ourselves.",rapid_rodrigo,1axnt76
10,"He did it just because he was ""bored"" for lack of a better term. In all honesty- it is quite possible he didn't mean to fuck you up like that- then again, it's quite possible he did it to you so he could forget the rest of the girls that he's done that to, continuing a cycle. My oppinion, i honestly don't think you meant much to him regardless what he'd told you. It isn't my place to make any calls like that- but realistically, if you care about somebody, you're gonna incorporate them into whatever decision you're making and if it affects them negatively- well you won't do it. Narcissists have ""supplies"" and he ran you dry.. you're a reserve of energy in his head, and he just wants to empty you emotionally, mentally, physically, financially, and whatever other way you can imagine. He cheated on you and ""moved on"" bc he doesn't care- he just wanted someone new. If he is a narcissist at all, then he knew he was done with you well before he really was. Its a funny thing, where they adore the admiration and praise from people- but if it's from somebody who can see their flaws, it basically just means nothing to them. That's why they go for strangers, they're completely new people and all the bars are totally reset. 

Also- i apologize for the info-dump, but ik what it can be like to question absolutely everything about your existence because of one person who barely did anything- and that you've seemingly gotten over. Time doesn't really solve much tho. Let yourself grieve a bit more if you need, get it out.

2,"the concept of hell serves as a reminder of the consequences of disbelief, but it is not solely reserved for unbelievers. The Quran emphasizes that Allah is just and merciful, and ultimate judgment rests with Him alone.

The promise of peace in the afterlife is not exclusive to Muslims; rather, it is extended to all who sincerely seek and strive for righteousness and goodness in accordance with their understanding and circumstances. It's understandable that anxiety should not be the sole motivator for embracing religion, as true faith stems from love, conviction, and a genuine desire to seek closeness to the divine. 

All I can say is that I suffered bad from depression and anxiety so much so that I thought I could find peace through substance abuse and other evil I would rather not speak of, little did I know I was only further destroying my mental state and wellbeing it wasn’t until I learned how merciful god truly is towards his creation which inspired me, submitting my will to god that I realized this world really is only temporary and nothing in comparison to the hereafter, just something to look forward to while we’re here on earth, taking away that crippling depression, if god portrayed himself as unjust and punishing it wouldn’t inspire people to turn to him.",Key-Requirement9648,1biniiv

It's not a straightforward journey to heaven or hell; there are stages before reaching that point. Even before that, we encounter trials in the grave, and prior to that, we face the angel of death. Depending on our deeds in this life, the angel's appearance varies. For those who led a righteous life, the angel manifests in a form of unparalleled beauty, while for the wicked, it takes on a horrifying appearance, a punishment in itself so vile that one would think that would be enough but that’s only the beginning, very fascinating stuff I can not lie",Key-Requirement9648,1biniiv

Those bodies that resist burial likely encountered the angel of death in a repulsive form, mirroring their earthly conduct. They decay in the grave, emitting a foul odor, while the bodies of the righteous remain preserved, emitting a pleasant fragrance. There have even been cases where bodies of the righteous had to be re dug up after several years to be moved to another location due to flooding or other various environmental circumstances, these bodies upon looking at them one would think they had just passed away, untouched not a sighn of decay, what an honour, This manifestation of divine mercy underscores the value of honoring God's commandments, a sacrifice deemed worthy of this worldly life.",Key-Requirement9648,1biniiv

A friend of mine had good experience with a form of behavioural therapy for anxiety, I'm not exactly sure what it's called. The main thing that helped them was exaggerating behaviour; e.g. if you're anxious about calling a friend, really commit to being cripplingly anxious about it. I've tried this a few times too and it keeps you from rationalising and overthinking, it shows you how silly the anxiety is, and afterwards the feeling is more manageable.

2,"I know you aren't schizophrenic but this video might help you recognize some things to help yourself with.
https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4

Mental health in a lot of first world countries (I'm predominantly talking about the US lol) is very very very taboo. In the video, it explains how people with schizophrenia in other countries see it as ""having a gift,"" ""connection to a higher power,"" etc. I the US, it's seen as ""evil,"" ""horrifying,"" all that good stuff. What I'm trying to say is that what you may seem as horrifying is just because of the ideas pushed into you since you were a child. Mental health issues are people who can't get better, are a lost cause, crazy. You are not crazy, you are not going insane. You are subconsciously apart of the ideology pushed on you. This is nothing to be ashamed of, so don't worry about that. Start seeing what you experience as a gift. You are able to listen to yourself more and disconnect from what isn't serving you. You have a unique ability to see things in a different way that allows you to understand more. Use this to educate others on how amazing and beautiful the mind is. Use this to your advantage and don't be afraid of it. Of course along with this, see a doctor, but find one who doesn't try to get rid of it entirely.

It’s great that your friend has forgiven you and can joke about it. Do they suffer from PTSD as well? Also support groups can help tremendously, you could find a PTSD support group or program in your area?",Away_Elk2823,1al6s1x
1,I don't know much about PTSD but I hear that EMDR  (Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) therapy is supposed to be good for it,Medium-Monk-109,1al6s1x
2,Damn that's some really rough shit you're dealing with there you blame yourself and feel extremely guilty for what happened and on top of that you have ptsd and your dad brings you down for it what you went through was really traumatic I'm so sorry I'm glad your friend is okay but I think you should give therapy another try,jburnsey2606,1al6s1x

I do understand to a reasonable extension have my own trauma, as my brother whom is mentally unstable and supposedly getting a psychiatric help killed are mother by attempting to set her on fire and trapped her in the enterway of are childhood home the fire was contained in that room it only happened maybe 30ish minutes before my father and my husband a I arrived back at the house. 
I recommend you send a email or call this foundation and see if they will recommend someone whom you can talk with it is for TBI. Patients with a trauma as you stated may not be considered a TBI the little explanation you stated may be appropriate for you to get the help you need.

There is help for you just need to find the right people to help you. The best take away that I got from the video was good health food and exercise and good sleep and being outside ( if you live anywhere that it is cold that is hard to do) many people bad mouth tanning beds if you use them as they should they are several health benefit claims such as improved, enhanced mood, and increased vitamin D levels have been attributed to tanning and definitely sunlight.

0,"Nicole Lepera has a lot of “icky” situations attached to her. 
She participated in charity fraud and knowingly stole from the public. Which to me puts her ethics in question.
She has denied systematic racial oppression. She was approached by another therapist in 2018 and asked to address that her approach that everyone can “create their own abundance” denies the unequal reality that BIPOC people live in. Her approach is very rich white woman centric. She often makes blanket statements that declare nearly any human experience as trauma.
Her paid “self healer circle” has a very self promoting feeling of passive income while doing the least to me. 
She also has wording on website that claims any post by her members is her intellectual property which again makes me raise an eyebrow.",Hereforfun1987,i96yqr

0,"This sounds very stressful and also exhausting! My sincerest sympathies that you're dealing with this. Just going off what you wrote, it sounds like there may be a combination of toxic shame and PTSD from the abuse trauma mixed with some - catastrophizing and obsessing, which often stems from anxiety and self esteem issues - which also can be rooted in the abuse trauma. Do you have access to psychiatric medical resources? A full evaluation would be needed but just going off what you wrote it sounds like maybe some meds as well as CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and/or other trauma therapy might possibly be a helpful option, if that's accessible. There are some CBT self help books if therapy isn't accessible for now. I also know people who've found EMDR and Somatic therapy helpful.",Elegant-Value2116,1bxvjt8

1,"There is still some question about the efficacy of EMDR- specifically whether or not the treatment gains that have been made are because of the added specific eye movements, or because of tried and true behavior aspects, specifically exposure therapy. Personally, I'm a bit inclined to hang my hat with the later. It doesn't help that the theory behind EMDR is unfalsifiable and thus not able to be put up to scientific study.",ryanpsych,1by40p
0,"If you go to the Amazon ad for The PTSD Sourcebook by Dr. Glenn Schiraldi, you'll see from the reader reviews that people with the disorder really appreciate this book, which says that there's a variety of symptoms associated with PTSD, some of which respond to self-help. For example, there's a simple but effective remedy for recurrent nightmares.

2," A victim of childhood trauma has said that the most important thing she has learned is dealing with her dysregulation, which is getting upset for no good reason.

Psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk says in his book for trauma victims, The Body Keeps the Score, that simple relaxation methods can be very helpful. Methods like paced breathing help with dysregulation. 

DBT paced breathing 

This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.

Article below - more DBT coping methods here. Use any of them or any combination you like.
