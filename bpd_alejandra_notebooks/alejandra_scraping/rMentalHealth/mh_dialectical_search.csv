1,Dialectic Behavioural Therapy (DBT) - Please Share Your Experience,"I have been diagnosed with several mental disorders, including Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which is the most troubling. Mental illness has been a struggle my whole life. But only 3 years ago, I began looking for solutions. Recently, I read this book on DBT, called ""DBT Made Simple"" and overall I understand how the treatment is administred and the fact that DBT is clinically-proven to be effective specifically for BPD because its principles once fully absorbed by the patient transform behavior from unhealthy to highly adaptive. 

Have you or someone you know received DBT? Please share your experience. Thank you.

2,Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Depression and Anxiety?,"I have suffered from depression and anxiety for some time. Medication has helped greatly, but I know that I need to change my modes of thinking to see real, lasting change. I have had limited success with cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT has helped me through bad anxiety episodes by getting me to realize that such anxiety wasn't the end of everything. However, it's been less than successful for anxiety and depression in general. A large part of my problem lies in my personality: I tend to be extremely introverted and introspective; I spend a lot of time ruminating in my head, at the expense of paying attention to the people and the world around me. Also, I tend to experience very intense emotions: very high highs, but very intense sadness and gloom. (This is not bipolar since I don't get manic phases!) Looking at my options, it seems like Dialectical Behavior Therapy might work better for me because of its focus on accepting emotions and the situation.

4,BPD and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy + minor psychosis?,"Hey guys first time posting here! I was recently reassessed after 4 years because my old treatment wasn’t working. Instead of just having Anxiety they have concluded that I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder. Im not even sure what it is but I guess I have it. They recommended more antidepressants and DBT. In the past I’ve taken some SSRI meds and gone to CBT, which didn’t work at all for me. I’m a little nervous about taking antidepressants again because of the side effects I got. Are there any meds that help depression that aren’t SSRI? Also has anyone had any luck with DBT? I read about it and it seems pretty intense. In my assessment I mentioned some symptoms that suggested I’ve been suffering from minor psychosis. They agreed but said it’s best that we wait it out and monitor it, because I’m so young (only 20). He said that usually disorders involving psychosis will fully develop in women in their late 20s, and that hopefully this therapy will make it go away. So I’m not on an antipsychotic. Anyway, I’m pretty scared and nervous I’m going crazy and I just don’t know what to expect. Would really appreciate some advice.

5,Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) how does it work?,"Quote from nhs on dbt therapy:

*""Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a type of therapy specifically designed to treat people with BPD.

DBT is based on the idea that two important factors contribute towards BPD:

you are particularly emotionally vulnerable – for example, low levels of stress make you feel extremely anxious

you grew up in an environment where your emotions were dismissed by those around you – for example, a parent may have told you that you had no right to feel sad or you were just ""being silly"" if you complained of feelings of anxiety or stress

These two factors may cause you to fall into a vicious cycle – you experience intense and upsetting emotions, yet feel guilty and worthless for having these emotions. Because of your upbringing, you think having these emotions makes you a bad person. These thoughts then lead to further upsetting emotions. 

The goal of DBT is to break this cycle by introducing two important concepts:

validation: accepting your emotions are valid, real and acceptable

dialectics: a school of philosophy that says most things in life are rarely ""black or white"" and that it's important to be open to ideas and opinions that contradict your own

The DBT therapist will use both concepts to try to bring about positive changes in your behaviour.

For example, the therapist could accept (validate) that feelings of intense sadness cause you to self-harm, and that behaving in such a way does not make you a terrible and worthless person.

However, the therapist would then attempt to challenge the assumption that self-harming is the only way to cope with feelings of sadness.""*


So the goal of dbt is to find coping mechanisms to replace self harming.

What sort of things would be recommended here? Or am i taking this to lightly.

22,Something I've learned in the healing process,"From a decade of Dialectical Behavior Therapy with meds I've learned to separate from my emotions, observe them and discriminate between what's real and what I can let go of but it occurred to me recently that indeed of things that are depressing, matters of grief, these things must run their course. Mourning the loss of a loved one for example. These things take time and it's okay to give ourselves permission to grieve, to be sad. It's healthy to be sad and it's healthy to take mental health breaks when necessary. I struggle with a bipolar 1 disorder to include psychotic features but with DBT I am no longer a victim of my emotions. However, when grieving, it's liberating to have the autonomy to express myself, without shame. It may take weeks if not months to heal but give yourself time to mourn, feel those big feelings and try to find some comfort in happy memories.

36,What types of therapy work best for bipolar spectrum disorders?,"The treatment of bipolar spectrum disorders typically involves a combination of different approaches, including medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle adjustments. There is no single best therapy for bipolar disorder, as treatment plans should be tailored to individual needs and preferences. However, several types of therapy have been found to be effective in managing bipolar symptoms and promoting overall well-being. Here are some commonly utilized therapies:  
  
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to mood instability. It focuses on developing coping strategies, problem-solving skills, and relapse prevention techniques.  
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): DBT combines elements of CBT with mindfulness practices. It helps individuals regulate intense emotions, improve interpersonal relationships, and develop effective coping mechanisms for managing distress.  
Family-Focused Therapy (FFT): FFT involves the individual with bipolar disorder and their family members. It aims to improve communication, reduce family conflict, and educate family members about the disorder. This therapy can help create a supportive and stable environment.  
Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT): IPSRT focuses on stabilizing daily routines and sleep patterns, as disruptions in these areas can trigger mood episodes. It also addresses interpersonal issues and aims to improve social functioning.  
Psychoeducation: This involves providing education and information about bipolar disorder, including its symptoms, triggers, and treatment options. Psychoeducation helps individuals and their families better understand the condition and actively participate in managing it.  
It's important to note that medication management plays a crucial role in treating bipolar spectrum disorders, and therapy is often used in conjunction with medication.

37,How do I know I'm getting the help I need?,"I started speaking with a counselor about 6 months ago, it started off as once a week, switched to every other week about halfway. I need help with being unmotivated, not engaging with people or tasks, feeling restless, feeling overstimulated or out of control.

The counselor is easy to talk to and they have helped me be more aware of my issues and sorting out what's missing to some extent. I understand that getting a handle on your mental health takes time and work. But how do I know if I'm getting the help I need?

According to her profile she uses a ""combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, EMDR, Wellness Therapy, Internal Family Systems, EFT, Gottman, and Mindfulness""

It's been 6 months and I feel like things are just as frustrating and debilitating as ever if not worse. It's been a lot of talking which feels redundant at this point, they're trying to find some underlying trauma that my behavior is protecting me from which doesn't make sense to me. And there's been some mindfulness exercises that I have completely failed at. Maybe I'm not putting in enough work, afterall motivation and engaging is the issue, but if so they haven't called me out on it. Maybe I'm just more aware of it now and that's just a hard step to take. But I'm getting very discouraged and second guessing myself. I hate doing things the hard way especially if it costs money, so I really don't want to just spin my wheels more than I already may have.

I'm not qualified to diagnose myself but what if I'm not neurotypical in some way because it feels like these methods are not what I should be starting with. It's not fair that a person needs to know what kind of support they need when they don't know what options there are or even what the underlying issue is.

I don't want to dismiss my counselor just because I don't know any better, but I also don't want to waste time and money because I don't know any better.

If anything, what I need is a way to address my concerns with my counselor in a way that doesn't sound judgmental or impatient/entitled. For all I know, they are very good at their job and this is all just part of the process.

I finally got a consistent therapist this year. However, during my last session she said she doesn’t see borderline in me. She says it’s normal to feel these things, whereas the psychiatrist is medicating and recommending dialectical-behavior therapy.

42,Journalist Request: Do you listen to podcasts to improve your mental health?,"Hi all! I'm a journalist who writes about podcasting for a media company in Canada and I'm writing an article about people who listen to mental health podcasts and their reasons why. There are many podcasts that are dedicated to help people navigate relationships, mental illness, and other issues we all face. Plus, put simply, therapy ain't cheap. 

I'd like to hear from podcast listeners about which mental health podcasts they listen to, why they listen, and what they get out of it. If that's you, please comment and/or send me a message. 

Personally, I listen to Therapists in the Wild, a podcast by two psychologists who teach listeners dialectical behaviour therapy skills in each episode.

43,Alternatives to therapy and psychiatry?,"Both me and my youngest child are wondering this. It seems like everyone recommends these and then besides these two it's quacky stuff, but I feel like there's gotta be something else legitimate. Both me and my youngest have been to more therapists than we can count on our fingers and toes for over a decade in their case, over two in mine, and we've hardly been helped. Also tried a lot of meds. Hubby and I have been to several couple's therapists too.

Is it something genetic perhaps? Meds have been worse than useless too.  I wanted it all to work so bad. I really did. For me at least, I'm burnt out and sick of them having me dump out all of my trauma for months on end and have me fill out intake forms only for them to give me little in return beyond ""That sounds hard."" or ""How does that make you feel?"". And it's always that eerily soft-spoken voice too. Do they get dialect coaches or something?

Really? My husband and I could even sit there and scream at each other for an hour and I end up on the floor crying with a panic attack and this is all they think of? My kid has told me similar. They don't have opinions seemingly ever.  It's hard to know what each session actually helped solve. I also went to AA and it was all this prayer, which seemed really weird and didn't help me quit drinking.

48,I'm loosing my self-esteem living in the US. ,"Hi, I'm from a non-English speaking country, and moved to the US last summer. I'm currently working as a nurse. I have five years of experience as a nurse back in my home country. 

I personally came to the US with big academic dreams, but I'm not sure if I can do it. If I were in my country, I wouldn't have any problem communicating with others. I could answer and understand every question that my patients would have. I'm getting used to make fake smile and endure awkward silence when I couldn't get what my patient is saying. I am smart when I use my mother tongue but now I feel so dumb. I think I just don't like myself incompetent. 

Yesterday, I called my patient's husband and he had strong dialect accent. I couldn't understand what he was saying and I asked him to repeat the questions several times, but I still couldn't get it. he got annoyed, and asked me to put my supervisor on the phone. 
I had several phone calls from other coworkers, and it was really hard to understand when I'm talking over the phone. It makes me frustrated. 

And also I know Americans like to joke, or be sarcastic. But I'm not used to joking around even in my mother tongue. I'm not a bubbly person. I could feel that my patient is not as pleasant as when they are being cared by my other coworkers. That's what makes me sad. 

I'm also introverted. My coworkers are mostly nice, but we only talk when I asked them questions. I am already a quiet girl in the department and don't know how to approach them. 

I'm kinda paranoid that my coworkers see me as an unreliable, incompetent coworker. And keep questioning whether I'm good enough to work as nurse here. Even me, if I were the patient, I would prefer to be cared by someone who can communicate easily. 

There is a friend here from the same country but I can't tell them how I feel because they said they don't want to be near a person who has negative thoughts. I can't tell how I feel to my family either since I don't want to make them worry about me.

49,I'm thinking of cutting off my friend because of her mental health issues.,"Hi, I'm not sure if this post belongs here but it's the only place I can think of. Quickly before I start there are quite a few people that I write about here so let's do fake names for everyone:

Kassy - The friend I'm thinking of cutting off

Mary & Alice - Friends of both OP and Kassy

So this might sound bad, but you need context. Kassy suffers from a mental health condition called misophonia. This condition causes them to get extremely angry because of certain words and noises I and other people make. I and other people try to be as accommodating a possible, however, Alice has Tourette syndrome and has several ticks that set of Kassy's misophonia. 

Though I am aware that it's not Kassy's fault that they have misophonia, but Kassy's reactions and decisions are getting out of hand. Nobody knows about all the things that Kassy reacts to, this is mostly because Kassy won't tell me or others what they react to. Their reasoning for this is that ""I don't want to bother anyone"". This is extremely annoying as Kassy will get mad at us and we don't know why. 

Kassy is very quick to anger outside of the misophonia, they'll get unreasonably angry at people just talking or disagreeing with them. After they've verbally attacked everyone (this can also include friends of mine that aren't even there because Kassy will go on their phone and text them) they'll come back with that same excuse, "" My misophonia was really bad that day, I didn't mean to get so mad!"" After this, I and others are expected to forgive her without even getting an apology. 

Recently Kassy has started talking badly about me and Mary online. They'll write things like ""Don't be friends with them, their horrible people, thank me later"". In this example, what I and Mary had done was breathe through their nose. Even though I know that what they wrote wasn't awful, it's the fact that Kassy went online to talk shit about us. There are so many things that we all have to think about in class instead of studying so that we don't set her off. Such as:

\- No yawning

\- No sneezing

\- No sniffling

\- No coughing

\- No rolling r sounds

\- No references or saying of the word mayonnaise

\- You have to say ""sju"" (seven) and not ""syv"" (seven but with a dialect) (also we are from a European country) 

\- You have to say ""sint"" (angry) and not ""sur"" (angry with a dialect)

\- No opening your mouth too widely

\- No breathing through your nose.

These are only some of the things that trigger their misophonia, now, as I've said, I am aware that it's not their fault that they have misophonia but I feel like they use their condition as an excuse for their bad behavior. They expect everyone inside and outside our friend group to cater to their needs while they ignore everyone else's (we all have some form of mental health struggle).

I and Alice only meet Kassy about three years ago, and they try their best to help and not judge Kassy's actions because they are not completely in control of them. Mary, however, has known Kassy for about 7-8 years. According to Mary,  Kassy's misophonia has gotten worse and worse over the years and it is just too much for me and from the conversations I've had with Mary & Alice they feel the same way. I feel it's affecting all of our mental health at this point.

So, I don't know if I'm in the wrong here. Is the normal for people with misophonia? Am I blowing things out of proportion? Please lend any advice you have, Thanks in advance.

50,Learning how to live with Borderline Personality Disorder,"So just recently, I went to an appointment with a psychiatrist. I always knew that I had anxiety, depression and PTSD due to childhood trauma but was never actually diagnosed with any of these. When I went to the psychiatrist for what I thought was bipolar disorder, turned out to be something else. She did indeed confirm that I had an anxiety disorder, depression and PTSD. But the one that I never thought about, was that she also diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder. After doing my research on this disorder, I sit here and think how the description as well as the signs and symptoms fit me to a Tee. It is entirely me all over. Explains my poor self-image, my wanting wanting to live at times, my track record of bad relationships and fear of being left, abandonment issues, substance abuse issues and just all of it. I experienced abused in more ways than one as a child up until I was fourteen years old. Come to find out that this disorder can develop due to trauma experienced early on in life. It also comes with other disorders much like the ones that I got confirmed that I had. Learning how to live with this disorder is hard. I am only hoping that in time with DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) I will be able to live a more happier life.

In addition, they have never apologised for the negative things they do, and mentally, I still haven't gotten past it. I would like to make it clear that I'm not pent up over minor things; my mum is a hoarder and can be emotionally manipulative.

I've [created a subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicallyOpenDBT/) for a new form of therapy I just found out about called Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) (http://www.radicallyopen.net/about/). In contrast to DBT, which is for people who experience extreme emotions and might be emotionally undercontrolled, RO-DBT is intended for people with emotional overcontrol.

60,It is such a freeing feeling to finally be able to put a name to what you’ve been feeling and going through.,"I just wanted to inspire some of you today who are dealing with anxiety, depression and panic attacks. I’ve been dealing with all three for most of my life, I knew something was wrong but I couldn’t figure it out. Not knowing what’s wrong with you and why can cause even more depression and anxiety that leads to further panic. 

Yesterday I had my Psychiatric evaluation and the Psychiatrist has come to the conclusion that I suffer from Dependent Personality Disorder also known as DPD. I feel relieved and excited to know what’s going on with me and that I can fix my disorder with the help of continued therapy. 

It’s been suggested that I join a 12 step CoDA (Codependent Anonymous) group on a weekly basis, as well as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). At first I was concerned because the Psychiatrist said it’s difficult to find someone who is skilled at DBT, but I’m extremely relieved to know that my therapist has knowledge in that area and will be implementing it in our sessions. 
So yay for me! I don’t have to search for a new therapist. 

I just wanted to encourage you all who are still struggling and trying to figure out what is going on, I urge you if you haven’t already, to speak with your doctor, psychiatrist and therapist to get you on the right track. You deserve a happy and fulfilling life, you just have to put in the work to obtain the tools so you can utilize them effectively.

61,GF has severe BPD and is on the edge of ending it,"I(20M) have been dating my girlfriend(20F) for a little over two and a half years. Throughout our relationship we’ve been through A LOT of good and bad. From flying across the country to meet family, to sleeping in the car together because we had nowhere else to go. In short, i’m deeply in love with her and i’m willing to jump hurdles to help her with this mental disorder. Over the last 2 years she’s had a lot of mood swings and she’s even said some really hurtful things to me because of it and it’s really taken a toll on me and my view on our relationship. She’s told me before that there are many times where she’ll have a freak out and completely black out and forget what happened. She’s never been to a doctor about this but we’ve both came to the conclusion that it is definitely BPD. I want to get her to a therapist but I just don’t have that kind of money to spare right now.

I always thought these outbursts were her being emotional due to a stressful situation. We recently moved into an apartment which was very stressful but she was very optimistic and happy throughout the whole process and was a tremendous help. I’m fortunate enough to have a job where i’m able to pay all the bills and even have time to take care of a lot of things as well. I thought now that she’s in a less stressful position it would be at least less severe. As of yesterday and today, the outbursts came back and they’re just as severe. She talks about her life being miserable and how she should just end it. Now that she’s aware of it being bpd it’s even worse because she has a reason to believe it will never get better for her. I’m not very good at being an emotional support, I do what I can and try to push myself to be as emotionally supportive as I can but usually it ends up in her resenting me because i’m not as helpful as she’d like me to be. I try explaining to her how good her life really is and how i’ll always be here to take care of her. She only takes it as me rubbing it in her face and takes it as she’s a burden to me. I don’t truthfully think that, all I wanna do is help.

Basically I just need advice on what I can do to help her. I 100% will be getting her therapy but that’s not an option right now. In the meantime what can I do?

Also, i’m not great at explaining things so sorry if this is a little confusing.

63,My mother-in-law thinks everyone wants to poison her,"This began 2 years ago but has progressed so much that we don't know what to do anymore. I'm so stressed and tired. We live together, FIL, MIL, my husband, our daughter, and I.

My husband and I have small restaurant where is mostly operated by our family members, including my MIL. She started having paranoid thoughts about keeping money safe, thinking clients were planning on robbing us. Then she started to think people in the kitchen that are not family members are trying to poison her/us to get money from us. She wants us to change our regular suppliers because they are too familiar with our hours, they might put poison in the products they sell us. She won't drink or eat anything prepared in the restaurant. 

One time she yelled at a client because she felt them looking at her and the cash register. She has started discussions with our staff and now we are not letting her work in the restaurant anymore. She stays at home all day everyday, and only goes out a couple times in a week, but not without us. 

Now she is suspicious about cars that pass several times down our street, she won't line dry clothes that can only be air-dried, because strangers or neighbors could put poison on the fabric, now the living room smells like wet towels all the time. She has put locks in the pantry to avoid enemies entering the house while we are out.

She started to only trust bottled water from Costco a couple months ago, but last week she had a panic attack claiming that the water is poisoned, that there were needle sized hole in the cap, which were in fact there. Has she now progressed to fabricate evidence that fits her narrative?

This has been so disruptive, as she calls my husband and I several times a day and we have to go calm her down. Our neighbors have called the police twice because they heard her screaming while alone at the house. We are first generation immigrants and they never learned English because we live in a tight knit Chinese community. There are no psychiatrist in our city that speaks the Chinese dialect that she speaks, and even if there were, she will absolutely refuse to go, she didn't event had the covid vaccine, and has not gone to any doctor since it all began. No matter how sick or bad she feels.

We actually tried going to a psychiatrist with the excuse that my daughter was sick and we needed her there to help soothe her after the consult. She stayed in the waiting room and refused to go in. After explaining everything to the doctor, she said there's not much she can do without communicating with her. 

We want to go to China to get her treated but it would be financially and logistically challenging, as we would need to close the restaurant for some time, and to cover all the travel and medical expenses.

I'm so afraid that she would eventually start to suspect us and the family too, and could cause harm to us or herself.

65,"I really struggle with ""black and white"" or ""all or nothing"" thinking. Any advice?","So I'm 28F and never thought or even heard of this concept until like a year ago when I started therapy. 

My therapist said I use always / never and I don't leave any room for a grey area with how I think about certain people / situations. 

I have ADHD and I told her I had done some research on it and that it may be because of that and she said it has other causes too. I do have some trauma as well so she thinks it's more because of that but who knows. 

She said I have likely been this way most of my life so it will take time to change it but I also suffer from other things- low self esteem/ trust, possible codependency, people pleasing, no boundaries, depression, anxiety, etc.

So when I catch myself having a black and white thought, I try to think about it a little more and ""challenge"" it but usually my soul just won't believe a more middle ground reason / scenario. I think I am realizing a bit more when these thoughts happen but not always, as it's just my brains automatic process. 

But since even challenging the thought can't seem to sway me, I get upset with myself and feel helpless like I will never improve. 

A family member told me ""yes you are very all or nothing. But that's ok, thats just who you are."" 
However obviously my therapist says that it is potentially harmful to myself and relationships with others and wants me to work on it. 

One example I talked to my boyfriend about today was that I felt bad for leaving (I was at his house) to go to a birthday party. He said it was fine since we hung out the night before and asked why I would feel bad. I said I felt hypocritical because in a previous relationship that I was at my boyfriends house after he invited me over and he decided to leave to go to a friend's house and I got upset. I think it's rude to be with your bf/gf and all of a sudden just leave. I said I would never do that I would just see my friends the next day. And (him and my therapist) both said ""well you can't expect other people to think and be like you"". But that doesn't make me feel better? I still think it's rude. So do these situations mean that since they're ""not like you"" that you shouldn't be with them? (I mean he's an ex so clearly, but I mean in general. ) With my ex there were deeper issues that I never felt like a priority that probably played into this but still. 

I just ruminate trying to ""work on it"" and end up really upset and emotional and feeling bad about myself because I feel like others don't get it and / or that I am wrong. But it feels impossible to shift to the idea of certain things being ""okay"" when they truly bother me. 

Because of this I always ask my therapist ""is it ok that I felt _insert emotion_ about this?"" And she says yes, my feelings are valid. But that I can still always challenge my thoughts. If my feelings are valid why do I need to challenge them? My brain just won't accept this. 

I am a mega overthinker and so when I'm reflecting on these things I feel that I think in black and white ABOUT my black and white tendencies. It honestly feels impossible to crawl out of. 

Today I said maybe I'll just quit therapy and just accept myself as I am. If I am alone forever so be it. 

Going to therapy in general kind of bothers me. A lot of people just live life, accept themselves, get married and are happy just naturally. It makes me feel bad about myself that I need validation and help from someone to just ""be"".",1691286433.0,False,1,3,Acadiavibes,None,15jd442,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15jd442/i_really_struggle_with_black_and_white_or_all_or/
66,"Realized I was seriously triggered and depressed, but feel it finally lifting after eight months","Stupidly (maybe being too harsh) went to my hometown where the majority of my abusive upbringing happened and didn’t realize I was in a triggered state for weeks. I guess the nearly constant palpitations and muscle pain weren’t any indication. I’m so thankful that I did realize it and now have a much better support system than I did as a child.

Was feeling super depressed since around January/December and just feel like even though it took me eight months to get here, at least I’m aware of what is happening in my body. 

I stopped going ACA (Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families) when I started Dialectical Behavior Therapy because it was too overwhelming to do therapy, DBT, and ACA. However, in two weeks back at ACA I realized all the issues I’ve been having are related to my insecurities and triggers from childhood. 

Thankfully, I’m not in the same position I was as a kid. I’m no longer helpless. I have a job and can provide for myself. 

I’m getting back to things that help my mental health- exercise, healthy eating, meditation, yoga, community, friends.

68,My BPD is tormenting me. I am struggling. I feel like I am slipping away.,"I have been sober for 16 months. I have BPD. I have made a lot of progress but I tend to backslide when things get rough. Granted, it really is pretty damn rough right now. I have developed many tools using dialectical behavioral therapy tactics, but it still gets really bad.

 It's like I am fighting off a volcano.  My emotions uncontrollably pour out of me. Sometimes my fear, sometimes my sadness, sometimes my anger. When my anger comes out it's like I completely lose control. 

I feel like I am watching myself act out; like I am watching and saying what the fuck are you doing. Like I'm standing behind all my emotions and trying to push through them. 

This past year I have destroyed everything I built and had built a lot. Self sabotage.  I'm broken.  Heart broken and I am the culprit.

 I am struggling with everything that's going on in my life. Sometimes it hurts so bad I break down, sobbing pathetically. Then I feel scared and alone. Then I feel angry, angry at the world, angry at myself, angry at everything; and then that makes me sad and the cycle continues. 

I lost the only person I had by my side because I am an emotional train wreck. The person I love doesn't want me anymore and it's my fault. It hurts. I'm lost. I am an asshole.

I hate that I am so fucking emotional. My emotions consume me and sometimes it feels like a hurricane in my head and all through my body. It's overwhelming. 

I'll be okay. I am resilient. I'll be okay. I have tools and I will use them. I always get back up. Always.

69,Severe school avoidance/refusal as a college senior-- need help desperately.,"I'm a college senior who is literally one semester away from graduation. I've maintained straight A's my entire time at university, until my junior year when I was repeatedly assaulted and traumatized (on and off campus) by another student. After that, I failed a trimester, took a leave of absence, got into therapy and medication, and returned last fall to complete my degree. I made it through last fall by the skin of my teeth and more absences than attendances.

Everyone is putting the pressure on for me to finish this semester. Obviously, I'm with them, but pushing myself is getting harder and harder again. My family, partner, therapist, professors, all of them are a huge ""get it together"" crowd in my head, and it's not helping.

It's a week into the semester and I avoided the entire first week. Didn't email ahead, didn't go to class. I know I need to email this week and apologize, say I joined late because of mental health issues.  Every time I think about school I freeze like a deer in headlights. Sometimes I will just sit for hours (literally) in silence biting my nails or staring off when I worry about school.

I'm in therapy once a week, I exercise, I eat healthy, I sleep plenty... but school makes me want to kill myself. Genuinely, would rather kill myself than go to school. I know that's dramatic but that is honestly how I feel when I think about school. It feels like my whole life has led up to this moment-- 15 years of school, hundreds of thousands of dollars spent, my entire future depends on my degree, not a single person in my life would be proud to hear I never graduated... it just feels like the last 22 years of my life was for nothing if I can't graduate.

70,What does mental health therapy consist of?,"In a world where the complexities of the human mind often remain uncharted territory, mental health therapy emerges as a beacon of hope and healing. This multifaceted approach provides individuals with a lifeline to address the intricate interplay of emotions, thoughts, and behaviors that shape their well-being. Let's embark on a journey through the components of mental health therapy, unraveling the layers that contribute to its profound impact.  
  
1. **Assessment and Personalized Care**: The foundation of effective mental health therapy lies in thorough assessment. During this crucial stage, mental health professionals delve into an individual's history, experiences, and current challenges. By gathering this comprehensive information, therapists gain insights into the unique circumstances that have shaped the individual's mental landscape. This assessment guides the creation of a personalized treatment plan tailored to their specific needs.  
  
2. **Establishing Therapeutic Alliance**: Central to successful therapy is the establishment of a strong therapeutic alliance. This relationship, built on trust, empathy, and respect, forms a secure space where individuals can unburden their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. This alliance serves as a platform for exploration and growth, enabling individuals to navigate their emotional terrain with the support of a skilled guide.  
  
3. **Goal Setting and Collaboration**: Therapy is a collaborative journey between the individual and the therapist. By setting clear and attainable goals, both parties chart a course toward positive change. These goals, often framed using the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) framework, provide direction and motivation throughout the therapeutic process.  
  
4. **Therapeutic Techniques and Approaches**: Mental health therapy encompasses a rich tapestry of therapeutic techniques and approaches, each designed to address diverse challenges. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focuses on identifying and altering negative thought patterns, while Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) emphasizes emotional regulation and interpersonal skills. Psychodynamic therapy delves into unconscious processes, and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) combines mindfulness practices with cognitive strategies to manage distress.  
  
5. **Exploration and Insight**: Therapy offers a unique opportunity for individuals to explore their inner landscapes. Through introspection and dialogue, individuals gain insights into the root causes of their struggles. This newfound awareness serves as a powerful catalyst for change, enabling individuals to make informed decisions and break free from limiting patterns.  
  
6. **Skill Development**: Therapists equip individuals with an arsenal of coping skills and strategies to manage life's challenges. These skills encompass emotional regulation, stress management, effective communication, and problem-solving. By honing these skills, individuals bolster their resilience and cultivate a greater sense of control over their well-being.  
  
7. **Behavior Modification**: A significant aspect of therapy revolves around behavior modification. Therapists help individuals identify maladaptive behaviors and work collaboratively to replace them with healthier alternatives. This process, often gradual, empowers individuals to embrace positive change and witness tangible improvements in their daily lives.  
  
8. **Emotional Catharsis and Expression**: Therapy offers a safe haven for emotional catharsis. Individuals can express pent-up emotions, fears, and insecurities without fear of judgment. This release not only alleviates emotional burdens but also fosters a sense of relief and clarity.  
  
9. **Progress Monitoring and Adaptation**: As therapy unfolds, regular progress assessments ensure that the treatment plan remains aligned with the individual's evolving needs. Flexibility is key, as therapists adapt their approach based on feedback and emerging insights. This ensures that therapy remains a dynamic and tailored process.  
  
10. **Empowerment and Resilience**: One of the profound outcomes of mental health therapy is empowerment. As individuals gain mastery over their emotions and develop coping skills, they build resilience. This newfound resilience equips them to navigate future challenges with greater self-assurance and emotional balance.

I tend to isolate myself from people when I'm worried about it and make sure that I'm in a room by myself. I just try to distract myself with whatever I'm feeling like doing. I have depression though, and a lot of times I'm not interested in doing much of anything and I just have to sit with my thoughts and feelings.

What things should I look for from your experiences that are concerning and what courses of action keep the people around you from being hurt mentally or physically? 

Is there anything that can put a stop to the brain bad for you, at least temporarily? What kind of emotions can pull you out of it, if any?

74,"Identity Crisis, Easily Influenced, More concerned about others.","Hi. I never thought I would get to this point but I’ve been having an identity crisis for what feels like only 2+ months but these things don’t happen overnight. I used to be consumed by my goals, my grind (growing up it was mostly me and my small circle) but now that I’ve accomplished these things I have fallen into the worst depression of my life (because these goals weren’t rooted in myself, just there to prove a point).

I find myself more concerned with my friends lives, comparing myself to what they’re doing, and checking my phone to ensure I’m in constant communication with someone but not actually living my own life.
I’m wildly indecisive and influenced (for example: switched from an in person class to an online class because of fear of a professor and conversations I had with someone, forgetting that I only wanted to be in school if it was in person. I use social media as a way to self harm, watching others live the lives I want to (I know more about what my ex and their friend group is doing then how to solve my problems).
I just feel so consumed by others and I don’t know how to turn it off. 

I feel as though I don’t have interests anymore, only consuming what’s recommended. I used to have pockets of the internet, of the world that felt like mine but I don’t anymore.

I am severely insecure. Happy for my friends on the outside, jealous on the inside. I am too old for this. I don’t know where to start.

I can’t really focus and my memory is fried. I have a lot of support but that means nothing when on the inside you feel so lost, behind and disconnected.

I have an appointment with a psychologist next week and I do a Dialectal Behavioural Therapy Skills Group each week, but I feel like I'm falling apart, I don't know what to do. 

I just want to cry all of the time, going to sleep is almost impossible, waking up is just as hard.

I've been denied legal assistance for a Domestic Violence court case against my ex so I am going to lose the case and have the Domestic Violence Order removed.

I literally just want to die. I do not want to go on like this anymore. The only reason I haven't just ended it all is because my dogs need to be fed. My whole life is fucked and I don't know what to do. I am just honestly ready to take a whole of diazepam and just sleep forever. I'm done trying.

77,What are the first steps in getting meaningful therapy?,"Hi,

I've known I have mental health issues for a while, and it's time for me to get some help. One of the first things I want to do is get some type of meaningful therapy, but it's difficult to do without knowing exactly what's wrong with me. I'm not a doctor, but to me I have signs pointing to anxiety, depression and/or bipolar issues, and I don't want to make any assumptions past ""needs help.""

I live near a university which has a psychological center, which might be a good resource, but my mom wants to sign me up for a psych evaluation and therapy at a Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) clinic. I'm nervous about signing up for a specific type of therapy without knowing what kind of issues I'm dealing with (in terms of diagnoses).

So what should my first steps be? Do I talk to my general health doctor to get a diagnosis, or should I leave that up to the university, or DBT clinic? Is it even important to get a diagnosis, or can I just look at my symptoms and go for what feels right? What should I be looking for when finding a therapist? Is DBT effective or should I just look for help through university, or should I find a ""normal"" system to go through?

Basically, I need mental health care, but don't know where the best place to start is. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I would really appreciate it.

79,Prescribed medications: they only work when one remembers to take them.,"I've been taking prescribed medications (SSRI) for several years. Gradually adjusting the types, dosage, mixtures, timing, and method with a team of health professionals. Paired with other forms of interventions including meditation, exercise, group and one-on-one therapy sessions (eg. Cognitive, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), my progress was moving in a healthy direction. I ultimately feel like I had a pretty good grasp on my situation and had come to terms with the less admirable parts of myself.
 
However, every now and again I forget to take my medication. This is when things go sour... When I forget the first dose, I don't notice but my subconscious might. I evidently forget the next, and this perpetuates a spiral that I am still unaware of. The more I miss, the more likely I am to miss. My days blend and life become vague and blurry. I am disassociated from my regular self and unaware of it. That is until I begin to feel the physical withdrawals of being off the medication. My lips feel icy cold, my body shakes, my heart flutters, and electric shocks randomly through my limbs. An irrational, pathetic, self-loathing kind of sadness consumes my consciousness. It's torture. It is painful. It's also really difficult to explain it to loved one that I am both okay and not, just that I am very sick at that moment. This moment. 

I know that feeling this way is not my normal. So I take my medication again and pray I never forget again. 

Right now, I am on my first dose back on track, recovering from some of the most tumultuous withdrawals I've ever experienced... begging, ""Please never again.""",1557192322.0,False,1,1,MPawz,None,blkjku,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/blkjku/prescribed_medications_they_only_work_when_one/

82,Help me figure out what TYPE of talking therapy I need,"TRIGGER WARNING…


Hi , I’m thinking of going private for therapy but I’m really not sure what type of therapy I need. 
I feel like I’ve been having psychotherapy for 6 months and all it’s doing is regurgitating things I already know. What I need I think is someone who will give me homework. My main problems are chronic loneliness and suicidal ideation. I feel like although I have a lot of trauma from childhood focusing and talking about that, isn’t what I need for figuring out coping mechanisms in the present.

I would need it to be long term probably. 

Idk it feels like I’ve had psychotherapy for 6 months and i’m self harming more. I know therapy is supposed be hard, but after every session i feel worse. It’s like, my therapist will tell me  things like “ you push people away” or “ you act like you hate yourself” , but wtf am I supposed to do with that information. There isn’t an activity that then follows on from that. 
I really like my therapist but I don’t think we match up. It’s a real shame because I waited 2 years to see them. 

I know there is no magic wand but there must be someone out there who can work with me in a much more effective way.

84,I am so miserable and its eating me alive,"I've had mental health problems since I was a child. Never made friends in school, walked on my toes, couldn't look adults in the eyes, speech problems, etc. 

&#x200B;

At 11, I was diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, and GAD. I got tested for autism but I didn't have it. My mom always acted like I did have it. She always babied me and never had much confidence in me. I know I clearly had my mental problems, but not in the way she treated me. My problems were more emotional. Like emotional pain, not like I was incapable of functioning. 

&#x200B;

Things were really bad in middle school. I went to my first mental hospital in the 6th grade. I went to therapy after that and did intensive Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I got better and improved a lot over time. 

&#x200B;

I grew up in a small town, and even though I struggled socially and mentally, I graduated top of my class and did relatively good with ACT (28..not exceptional but for my area it was the second highest in my grade). I live in Louisiana, and I always thought I would either go to a college in New Orleans (Tulane probably) or a college out of state. My parents did not support me at all. They said Tulane or college out of state was too expensive, and they didn't support me in applying for them, so I didn't. 

&#x200B;

I applied to one school, which was LSU, and I got in. I don't qualify for financial aid, but I got academic scholarships, so it only costs me $500 a semester. I never wanted to go to LSU. I was disappointed from the beginning, but I felt like I didn't have a choice. 

  
My heart wanted to do something creative like English or journalism, but I thought I should do engineering so that I could make enough money one day to get out of Louisiana and not have to rely on my parents. I wanted to prove everyone wrong. I basically chose my major out of spite.

&#x200B;

I went to two mental hospitals in 2020. Took a semester off of school and ended up changing my major to journalism. I like this major a lot better.

&#x200B;

This summer, I worked a seasonal job in Minnesota. I made good money bartending, way more than I would've made anywhere in Louisiana. Welp, now I am back in Louisiana and I don't want to be here. I have two more years at LSU in journalism and I dont know if I can do it. I liked being in the north so much better. I don't fit in here at all, and I am so so miserable.

I have borderline personality disorder and finally found something that I love and makes me happy - this certain yoga class. Shortly after I started and committed to this yoga class, a DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) group opened up. It is at the same time as the yoga class. No there are not other times for THIS yoga class, no there is not another group.

I've been trying to make this decision. It has been eating me alive. I haven't been able to even go to individual therapy either, so this has just been bouncing around in my head and I just don't know what the fuck. Talked on the phone with therapist today, of course he convinced me to do the group. Now I'm worried it's the wrong decision, and I'm feeling progressively worse.

I don't know how people make decisions. I've been in therapy for 6 years. My life continues to be the same and I don't know why. I wonder if it's because I'm not living my life. I wonder if I use therapy as an excuse to postpone living my life and looking within. But I just don't fucking know.

I have Borderline Personality Disorder and am doing Dialectal Behavior Therapy. I've been doing it since August of last year... and I don't think I'm getting any better. This therapy is useless to me. Most of it is distraction/meditation (which I already did way before I was diagnosed) and radical acceptance, which is bullshit. Why am I supposed to accept everything? Not even a normal person does that.

I have spirals all the time about everything, and when I bring them up to my therapist, I feel like it's just a ""Why Neuro is Wrong"" hour. I'm told to do the radical acceptance, and learn to control my emotions. Yeah, I'm working on that, it's obviously not making things better. I don't feel validated in therapy, so much so that I make it a point to spend my sessions venting about what happened the previous week so by the time the hour is up, there's no time to tell me I'm feeling the wrong way.

I feel like my therapist should at least validate my feelings once in a while. I feel like I'm not allowed to feel the way I do, and that sucks, because I can't control it initially happening. My feelings and emotions are so heightened and it really hurts when even my therapist is basically telling me stop being a baby (she doesn't say it this way, but it feels like that's her point).

Am I the only person who feels like DBT is a crap therapy? Is there another type of therapy that may be better, or maybe I just need to get on some medication?

89,Is it possible to fix mental health issues?,"Mental health issues have long been a topic of discussion and concern, yet many questions linger about their nature, treatment, and the possibility of a complete ""fix."" In a world that increasingly values holistic well-being, it's important to address the question: Is it possible to fix mental health issues? The answer, as with many complex matters, is multifaceted and nuanced.

**The Complexity of Mental Health Issues**

Mental health issues encompass a broad spectrum of conditions, from mild anxiety and depression to severe disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These conditions can arise from a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Unlike physical health issues, mental health problems often lack clear-cut diagnostic criteria and straightforward treatment paths.

One common misconception is that mental health issues can be ""fixed"" as definitively as a broken bone. However, the reality is that fixing mental health is often a process that involves managing symptoms, developing coping strategies, and improving overall well-being rather than eradicating the issue.

**Dispelling the Myth of Quick Fixes**

In a world accustomed to quick fixes and instant results, the notion of immediately ""fixing"" mental health issues can be alluring. The media sometimes portrays therapy or medication as miraculous solutions that swiftly banish mental health struggles. This portrayal can create unrealistic expectations and undermine the true nature of the journey toward mental well-being.

While therapy and medication can be incredibly valuable tools in managing mental health, they are seldom quick fixes. Psychotherapy, for instance, requires time, effort, and a strong therapeutic alliance between the patient and therapist. Similarly, medication can take weeks to show noticeable effects, and finding the right medication and dosage often involves trial and error.

**Shifting the Focus: Managing and Improving Mental Health**

Instead of seeking a one-size-fits-all ""fix"" for mental health issues, the focus should be on managing and improving mental well-being. Just as physical health is a lifelong journey of maintaining a balanced diet, staying active, and getting regular check-ups, mental health requires ongoing care and attention.

Developing healthy coping mechanisms, practicing mindfulness, engaging in regular exercise, maintaining social connections, and managing stress are all essential components of mental health management. Additionally, seeking professional help when needed can provide valuable guidance and support in navigating the complexities of mental health.

**The Role of Therapy**

Therapy is a cornerstone of mental health treatment, and it plays a pivotal role in helping individuals manage and improve their mental well-being. Through various therapeutic approaches, individuals can gain insights into their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, and develop effective strategies for coping with challenges.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), for instance, focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns that contribute to distress. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) equips individuals with skills to regulate emotions and improve interpersonal relationships. These therapies don't necessarily ""fix"" mental health issues, but they empower individuals to better navigate their experiences.

**Medication: A Piece of the Puzzle**

Medication can be an essential component of mental health treatment, particularly for individuals with severe or chronic conditions. However, it's important to understand that medication is not a standalone solution. It works best when combined with therapy, lifestyle changes, and a supportive environment.

Medications for mental health conditions often aim to manage symptoms and create a stable foundation from which individuals can engage in therapeutic work. It's worth noting that finding the right medication and dosage can be a trial-and-error process, and regular communication with a mental health professional is crucial.

**Destigmatizing Ongoing Care**

One of the barriers to effective mental health management is the stigma associated with seeking ongoing care. Many individuals feel shame or embarrassment about needing therapy or medication. This stigma can hinder people from seeking the help they need, leading to untreated or under-treated mental health issues.

Destigmatizing mental health care and promoting open conversations about mental well-being are essential steps toward creating a supportive environment. When seeking help for mental health is viewed in the same light as seeking medical care for physical ailments, individuals are more likely to prioritize their mental well-being.

**Embracing the Journey**

Rather than fixating on the idea of a quick fix, it's more productive to embrace the journey of mental health management and improvement. Just as physical health requires continuous effort and attention, mental well-being thrives when nurtured over time.

Understanding that mental health issues are complex and multifaceted allows us to approach them with empathy and patience. By combining therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and a supportive community, individuals can take meaningful steps toward managing their mental health and enhancing their overall quality of life.

The concept of ""fixing"" mental health issues is a nuanced one. While complete eradication of these issues may not always be possible, managing and improving mental well-being is achievable through a combination of therapeutic approaches, medication, lifestyle adjustments, and ongoing support. By shifting the focus from quick fixes to holistic well-being, we can foster an environment where individuals feel empowered to prioritize their mental health and thrive on their unique journeys.",1692594053.0,False,1,0,sanjeevrana011,None,15wxq4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15wxq4b/is_it_possible_to_fix_mental_health_issues/
90,Should mental illness be considered the same way as physical health?,"A conflict between me and my partner has prompted this question.

&#x200B;

I'm struggling to make sense of a situation with me and my partner of 2 years. Things have been tenuous for almost 2 months and we have been really working hard and committed to saving our relationship because we are really emotionally connected. Well things came to a head when he went to drop me off for a solo trip overseas (I was meeting a friend after a few days there but going alone). At the airport I ""freaked out"" and he reacted extremely poorly, told me we were breaking up and that he lost all his respect for me. Later I told my brother, who helped pay for the trip, that I had a panic attack at the airport and cancelled the trip. He was incredibly understanding and supportive, which was such a contrast to the reactions I received from my partner and also my friend that I broke down.

&#x200B;

It wasn't really a panic attack, but why would that be treated with so much more validation than the extreme distress I was experiencing? People are quick to offer grace when someone’s body is attacking them, but when it is - equally involuntarily and overwhelmingly - their mind, the blame is on them and their character.  I'm grappling with the perception that mental health issues often receive less empathy than physical health concerns. Having a mental illness doesn't equate to having a flawed character and he clearly and directly linked my behavior to an evalution of my character DURING an episode, I was sobbing and hyperventilating and he looked me in the eye and said he couldn't see himself being with a person who ""makes decisions"" in that way - referring to cancelling the trip at the last minute.

&#x200B;

I believe there is a crucial distinction between using mental illness as an excuse for my behavior and acknowledging it as a real, ongoing condition that expresses itself in behavioral symptoms - it is a core dialectic I work hard to internalize and strive to live in an understanding of what that means for me and my actions. I know it's confusing so I am trying to have grace, but I am not using it as an excuse to not try to change myself, I am actively seeking treatment, heavily medicated, and constantly working on building skills to manage my symptoms. On this occasion the treatment was not effective in controlling the expression of my symptoms.

&#x200B;

I keep thinking about if it was an “actual” health issue and how it would be treated differently. Like if it was a seizure, theoretically I could chill for a second, regroup, technically could still get on the plane. It might happen again in a foreign country where I have no support for addressing it, while I am alone trying to get a cab, or looking for my bus. Choosing not to go wouldn't be scathingly criticized as a character flaw. I just can't believe he equated it like that.

&#x200B;

When my illness was under control/in remission - a period of time in my life where I wasn’t expressing the symptoms that qualify me for a diagnosis - our relationship thrived. In so many ways he had a superior understanding of the work I was doing, was quick to cheerlead and give me appreciation for things that no one else has ever noticed. I felt more seen that I thought possible and so loved. Now that I am sick, the support and understanding is evaporating. I know it's fair, this is hard, but I am heartbroken to discover this is the kind of relationship where one partner gives up when the other falls ill. I am truly shocked, which is making this a million time worse.

While having the blade in my hand I decided to call the psych to tell them what was going on, so I told them that I was cutting myself as we spoke and that I had thoughts of suicide. 

The lady on the phone told me to come on down for a chat so we could figure out which ways to go and what they can do for me. After the phone call I was a bit relieved that I finally had told someone and that I was going to get help. 
I take the buss and when I arrive I’m greeted by the lady I was in the phone with, she asks to see my scars and I show her (maby they weren’t deep enough?) she tells me she doesn’t need to do anything about them which is what I expected anyway because they weren’t that deep. 

After that im seated in a room and eventually she comes and we have a small chat and she asks questions like

“What help do you expect from us?”
“What can we do to help you?”
“What is it that you want help with?”

And im sort of baffled by the questions and not sure what to answer. 
Well, first of all look at my fucking arms. I told you I was suicidal and have no urge to live, then you ask me what the fuck The problem is? What the fuck do you think I want help with you dumb cunt. I didn’t say that to her directly and I said I wanted medicine to not feel this way. Then she tells me that if I want mood uplifting medication I have to go to a doctor, not the psychiatric hospital. And since I don’t really live here I have to change my address so that im booked here in order for me to see a doctor who can prescribe medication. 

After this brief interaction with the not so nice lady at the hospital they send me on my way and I’m left starstruck and even more baffled than I was when they asked me those questions. I go out with tears in my eyes and start making my way to the real hospital near by. This is late at night so the doors was closed but a very nice lady had to enter and let me go in behind her. 

This hospital like most is very tall, enough so that you would most likely die if you were to jump of it. I had in mind that I was going to go to the roof top, call someone I know and tell them where I was, but first I had to charge my phone because it was dying so I sat down in the hospital lobby crying on the floor charging my phone. Instead of calling someone I texted two people as my last call for help and “finally” told someone the situation. Told them I got denied help at the psych ward and that I was at the hospital ready to kill myself. 

After a few minutes I went to the bathroom to cut myself and one person calls and we talk for a bit and I felt a little better, I was still cutting the whole time we spoke but I wasn’t as suicidal as I was before the phone call. 

I should also note that I live in sort of like a halfway house but not for prisoners, I’ve been in Forster care all my life and it just so happens that I’m at this place right now. Anyway, one of the people I texted was a staff at this place and he told me that he would come pick me up and that I should stay at the hospital and not do anything drastic. He picks me up and drops me off at “home” and tells me we’ll talk about it tomorrow (today)

So today comes and we have a meeting with the social service and tell them the situation and everything that had happened. We agreed on that tomorrow at 9 o’clock in the morning we are going to give it another try. They will give me a ride to the psych ward so they can put me in. 
So,
 I really don’t know what to do at this point. When I google I see a lot of people saying how bad it is but also people saying that it was good. The rooms look like they look like hospital rooms and I’m afraid that they won’t let me go or put me on some kind of suicide watch where I won’t be allowed to do or have anything. 

I know what I want from the psych ward tho. I want someone to look at me and tell me what the problem is because I can’t seem to figure it out myself. But I don’t know if I should go tomorrow or not",1645667005.0,False,2,2,inthemindimperfect,None,szybll,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/szybll/is_it_worth_getting_emitted_to_a_psych_ward/
93,Nothing is appealing.,"I'm writing this because I have no idea where else to turn to, or who I could even talk to about this without worrying anybody. For as long as I can remember, back to my early childhood (ages 5-7), nothing has ever been interesting, or made life feel like it was worth living. I've never been particularly good at anything. I've always kind of went through the motions.

As a kid, I played with the neighborhood kids, went to school, had a healthy family life, everything normal for a white middle class child, but no happiness, it was all a facade even as a child. Through my teenage years, I'd experienced the same losses as so many other young adults; my first loves and breakups, my parents divorcing, losing friends, etc, none of which ever phased me like they would my peers. This continued into adulthood.

Now, 23 years old, living on my own. I've been seeing psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, GP's, emerg psychologists, counsellors, everybody, for the better half of the past 5 years. They've tried one on one therapy, group therapy, CBT, dialectical behavioral therapy, locking me in safe rooms. I have nothing but a diagnosis for what they think is a severe case of Borderline Personality Disorder, with a few things comorbid.

I experience the general symptoms and criteria for BPD, illusions of grandeur, amplified emotions, substance abuse, low impulse control, heavy feelings of percieved loss and failure, suicidal ideation, but also a plethora of other things I'm fairly worried about. Visual delusions of my fears being a big one. The feeling that no matter what everybody else is better than I am. I can't escape the fact that I feel that I'm a terrible person for not being able to find any sort of meaning in anything. I don't want to live like this anymore.

94,"Bipolar 2, COVID anxiety, winter depression, repeated failure at work, and intense long lasting triggers. I cry every day and desperately want to self harm.","I had a breakdown a few years ago when I was evacuated from my home due to a wildfire, while I got a call and told I lost a promotion to much newer employee who had quit and only been back two months. I don't remember the actual start of the self harming, but I was somewhere in that time. I think right after the call. It went on for months. Went to my boss for help, they forced me off work while I went through intensive and dialectical behavioral therapy. I returned to work, had a few issues, had to med change, went through intensive again, then I came back again. I started to stabilize, right as COVID hit.

I've hung in there. Haven't self harmed or been terribly depressed. Hadn't really wanted to. Still have been bored with the job though, which is part of the problem.

Now as winter sets in my boss, who I liked, is temporarily replaced with the guy who got the promotion at the start of it all. Added to that the guy replacing him is young and super new. He knows so much less than me about the job it is infuriating.

Supposedly this if for three months. I'm worried the boss I like will leave permanently. I can't work for these people like this. I am too bitter and angry and mad at myself. I have more experience, I have a degree. I'm not denying I've had issues but I was also jerked around a lot. I've never been promoted and my degree is just a big waste of money. I'm approaching forty and it has just made me angry. I told myself I didn't care anymore but seeing this kid be my ""senior"" just kills me.

I know I should be grateful to just have a job and be essential. And I am. But that's also part of the problem. I'm in a small town and need expensive meds. This is pretty much my only employment option.

So I'm trapped in this emotionally painful situation where I feel this awful combination of anger and sadness that makes me desperately want to self harm.

The honest to god only reason I am not doing it right now is because I cannot think of a way to hide it from my wife. I know that's a good thing but I am in so much emotional pain. I don't know any way to let it out. I cry every day on my way to work, or at work. I'm angry all the time. I can't even talk to my boss I liked who understood me, at least somewhat, because she isn't around and her replacement is the trigger.

My breakdown was too public. Now I'm doomed to be the office crazy guy who wasted money for a degree that would never matter. And I can't even get away from that.

I'm just so tired of feeling worthless and insignificant. Like a failure and a loser. Twenty years and a degree and I can't do something a young twenty year old can. What does that say about me?

95,"Does anyone else question the validity of ""mindfulness?""","At its core mindfulness strikes me as a mentally pacifying opiate that passively dampens critical thought and insubordination.

Mindfulness has so rapidly swept through mainstream psychology since it's emergence in the 1970's  to the point where now it's basically a house hold concept. It often gets treated with the same brush that exercise does- namely it's often sold as being a totally beneficial thing that should really be incorporated into everyone's life.

I've also noticed that global corporations and governments are utilizing the exact same vocabulary and phrasing that originated in ""mindfulness"" texts, specifically in HR departments or when discussing the supposed benefits of a various program respectively. 

In fact at least in North America it's almost impossible to find any mention of mental health treatment or any center or mental health branded phone app that doesn't largely involve ""mindfulness.""  Almost all current therapies for the vast majority of mental health conditions (anxiety disorders, major depression, eating disorders, anger management, to name but a few) involve ""mindfulness""  and it is baked into the vast majority of cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy programs I've come across.

All this except nobody really questions its actual usefulness or its origins. Actually whenever I question it or why it is being used as often as it is, or where it came from, people actually tend to get really hostile and defensive. 

It has a pretty simple premise of essentially ""being fully present"" but incorporates a lot of aspects of what would fall under Eastern spirituality in general. I find it strange that in environments where mental health practitioners are supposedly forbidden to push their religious beliefs on others it is such common practice to include things like yoga and meditation as part of treatment. Why has everybody taken so readily to performing secular and sanitized versions of deeply spiritual rituals? And why are they viewed as being a rigorous and science based treatment? There are studies that show rituals associated with ""mindfulness"" to be effective in alleviating anxiety, but religious practices in general are designed to do that by their nature. Why have specifically these practices been chosen? I think part of that has to do with 1970's culture when all of this developed but why is it so widespread and so devoutly followed now? 

I find the whole thing to be a little eerie. How in a relatively short amount of time it has a near complete strangle hold on mental health discourse and how nobody seems to challenge it or question it. In any therapy I've personally attended I've definitely been discouraged to question it and have been treated as being ""difficult"" or ""noncompliant"" for not wanting to participate in what are expressly spiritual practices. I've found that since around 2010 when mindfulness REALLY went full steam ahead it has created the least ""mindful"" professionals out there. They stick  to a robotic and pre-formulated ""mindfulness"" script with full faith in its efficacy and without interest in alternative approaches. I find it creepy that major corporations and governments have been so quick to incorporate it into their language and policy.

Does anyone else question this?

At the best I would say ""mindfulness"" is a well intentioned but in some ways half-baked ideology which heavily borrows from Zen Buddhism and Gaudiya Vaishnavism and has achieved mainstream usage and success through the west's fascination with Eastern religions stemming from 1960's/1970's culture and through the inherently soothing nature of religious practices in general.

At worst I would say ""mindfulness"" is a globally astroturfed phenomenon designed to gently subdue the mind and inculcate tractability and complaisance within vast swathes of the population and to stop people from questioning why they are mentally or if their society may be very sick and in need of internal change, and to make people accept the ""here and now"" as it is without the ""encumbrance"" of previous experiences or anxieties about the future intruding.",1632636703.0,False,3,1,cantordustbunnies,None,pvo5g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/pvo5g4/does_anyone_else_question_the_validity_of/

97,Starting therapy tomorrow...(a success story),"Possible trigger warning: death, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, negative thoughts...

I haven't seen a therapist in about two years. I haven't really needed to. I used to do dialectical behavior therapy once a week for four years. The last time I saw a therapist was in December 2017. I have been using coping skills I've learned to get by. I felt great. Didn't have anxiety attacks. Didn't have any suicidal thoughts. 

Then my daughter was born still. 

I waited two years to get pregnant. First my husband got orders to go overseas...then after he got back and we got pregnant I had a miscarriage. We tried again and after I got past the three months worrying about another miscarriage, we were so happy. Then, at 26 weeks we were told our daughter would die. She had a rare genetic abnormality that would cause her to either, die in utero, or die after she was born. 

We were putting so much hope that she could live. That she'd be fine. That we'd give birth to a live baby. But she died. At my 32 week check up she had no heartbeat...I was induced...we welcomed her with tears and sadness...the next week she was put into an urn. 

This was a month ago. Now I'm struggling to just hold on. I drink to forget how numb I feel. I am sleeping too much. I want to jump off a bridge...or just take all my sleeping pills with a bottle of vodka and sleep forever. I know this isn't good. I know I need to get help.

So I did. I looked up therapists and called around. I got an appointment. I'm seeing someone who will help. 

I hope that I can learn to understand this grief. I've learned how to manage my borderline personality disorder, how to recognize things that trigger my Cptsd, how to apply coping skills into my life....I just don't understand this....

I've lost a ton of things in my life. I've lost my childhood to trauma. I lost and found a healthy relationship with my mother. I almost lost my spouse so many times. My losses are mostly relationship losses. Disconnections. I've never lost a loved one to death...I've never had something growing inside me, and lost it. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so lost. If you read any of my posts you'll see, I'm losing my mind...

So, I'll take this bit of victory. I'm going to see someone. I'm going to learn to grieve. I'm going to learn to heal. I can do this even though I'm freaking out inside. I'm going to be able to get it all out and I can finally get some answers.

98,Help & Opinions/Experiences on Curing Panic Disporder,"I imagine like some of you here. I suffer from an array of mental issues.

Panic Disorder, Anxiety, Depression, Cluster B Personality Disorder.

I found great comfort in Weightlifting. It made me feel like I had control of my life again. I've been training since 2016. Religiously for about 3 years. Then it got to the point where it was affecting my relationship because I was so dedicated. So it's been on and off for the last 3 years. Sometimes I'll have a month or a few months off. But when I do train, it's a 5 day split. I generally won't train on weekends so I can spend time at home. 

Prior to this, I have only had a handful of Panic Attacks in my life, NEVER while working out. In January of 2021 I went to the gym. I'd had some Pre Workout (I've been on and off them throughout the years, but hadn't used one for about 2 years prior to this). This particular Pre Workout was Banned in Australia. But I had been using it for about a month. This particular day, I started my workout as usual. But during my warmup sets I became breathless, tightness in the chest, strange feeling throughout my body, all of a sudden I think oh geez I've overdone it, I'm going to die. So this all got worst very quickly. I left the gym. Drove home which was about 5 minutes away. Tried to sit down and relax. This strange sensation became overwhelming so I hopped in a cold shower to try and bring myself to. Something I'd done in the past for panic attacks which seemed to work. This time it made it worst. It exaggerated it. My heart is beating out of my chest. I can't breathe. Couldn't catch my breath. Legs feel like they're running away from me. So I adjusted the Shower to a like warm temp, sat on the ground with my knees to my chest for about half an hour breathing very shallow breaths. After some time I thought I need this to stop so I took my night time medication, and passed out on my bed. It was about lunchtime, I slept until about 6pm then went back to bed around 11pm.

I went to the hospital the next day to check things are normal. They said with an ECG that their was a mild myocardiopathic event but nothing to worry about. So I went to the gym again (I got rid of the pre workout). At the end, doing my HIIT workout. It started to happen again. I thought maybe I've over exercised. Went home, relaxed. It went away after a while and was fine. 

Did some googling, saw something about Seratonin Syndrome. Three of the Medications I was on at the time which is been on for about 3 years were SSRIs. So I decided to ween myself off all of them alongside continuing Therapy. 

But it scared me off training for a few months. I didn't train again until June/July. Trained for a few months, everything fine. Then one day I thought about it, which triggered it again. I was medication free by August 2021. Stopped training until January 2022. Started again. Was fine for a few weeks. Then one day just out of the blue, it came back. Then the next day at work, it happened bad enough for me to go to hospital out of fear. They told me to take Valium and breathe into a brown paper bag as it's all in my head. 

By this point I'm thinking there's definitely an underlying health issue. So I spent a month doing appointments. ECGs, 24 Hour ECG, Stress ECG. Ultrasounds, Bloodtests. Everything comes back normal.

I try not to use the Valium unless the panic/high heart rate won't subside. 5 x 5mg tablets generally last me about 4 months.

But now, maybe 3 out of 5 times, I will have a panic attack at the gym. Then take a week or two off. I even took my daughter to see Sonic at the movies. I got a stressful text message just near the end of the movie, went into a full on panic attack but couldn't leave as I didn't want my daughter to know or worry.

Basically, what I'm searching for, or asking here, is has anyone found anything that cures or Ross them of this Panic Disorder as it's beginning to ruin my life.

99,Finally a diagnosis,"So today I met with the psychiatrist I have been doing tests with. At first I was fearful that I would come out of there none the different with no direction but in the end it went mostly how I had been hoping with a few added things.

Well either way she says that yes, I do have ADHD and will need stronger meds than what I have been taking in order to cope.  This is what I had been thinking and what I wanted to hear.  Now maybe finally I can go through life as a normal person. That's all I want.

ALSO she added on that I am showing signs of moderate to severe depression and anxiety. That much I already knew, and my roommate was like, ""I could have told you that about the anxiety."" lol :P Either way, I'm hoping that with my ADHD symptoms under control my depression and anxiety will be better.

But the psychiatrist also added, and this wasn't something I had been anticipating because I never really knew what it was (despite having heard the term before) is that while there isn't enough for a full diagnoses, I do have symptoms of borderline personality disorder.  When she said that I was like, ""Okay I've heard of it but what exactly IS it?""

She explained the bits of it to me that she said I was displaying symptoms of, and upon further research I would say that yes, I do relate to some of that is listed.  Here's a link if anyone is curious.  I don't want to type it all out haha. Either way she wants me to seek out therapy and a specific type of treatment known as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I've never heard of it before but I guess it's supposed to help train me to have better relationships with people or something? IDK whatever works I guess. She said that this kind of stuff could be genetic but also can be caused by stuff that happened in my childhood and/or the way I was raised. 

Either way, I have better medication and treatment coming my way.  I almost feel really angry at the years wasted because no one else caught on to this.  How might my life be different if I had been told all of this years ago? Especially since I had a neuro-psych eval about ten years ago and the dude didn't seem to give a shit and never explained any of the results to me or anything. I had no idea what to do.

100,How do I stop obsessing over everything?,"Hi. New here. 

I am trying to figure out how to spot obsessing about every little thing in life. 

I am constantly worried 
- that I am getting old
- obsessing over body weight
- am I happy
- how am I going to pay off debt
- do I have cavities
- is this pain in my chest some kind of heart attack
- is this cold going to make me lose my hearing
- am I losing my hearing 
- am I eating enough vegetables 
- am I vitamin deficient. 

The last part of those makes me sound like a hypochondriac, but I think it's just due to this crazy obsessive behavior that I exhibit. 

I feel like through my 20s I didn't think about anything. Now over half of my 30s are gone and I can't seem to turn off my brain and just fucking live in the moment. 

I feel. Sad? But not depressed... Apathetic? But not because I can't turn off my frigging brain and stop obsessing over everything. 

If you have some kind of advice on how I can stop obsessing, please. I need some kind of relief from this.

101,I was in two mental institutions for Bipolar I psychosis.,"  

I make my way down the locked psych ward’s hallway, past the nurses behind the desk, always on their phones. I reach the magnetically sealed door, my body dripping with everything I own, which is not much since they took almost everything, including my shoes and phone. I take a deep breath, depress the bar, and push with the might of God.

**I had been in a mild depression and on anti-depressant meds for six years after college until a four-year manic period where I engaged in risky sex and then full psychosis, which lasted a couple months.**

""*The average length of time between a person’s first episode and getting the correct diagnosis is eight years” —* Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and author of *Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament.*

**Those with bipolar disorder often go manic on antidepressants. I was no different.**

My meds were upped and my delightful and productive hypomania became full psychosis.

**I believed Jesus was an actor on a comedy show I liked and I was his twin sister Sophia, the goddess of wisdom.**

I ended up in **two mental institutions** in a month, with a **two week period** in between where **we couldn’t find help anywhere**:

· the earliest a psychiatrist could get me in was two months

· no one was willing to write me a refill of my two week prescription, including the doctor who prescribed it

· my community mental health services in my county said I wasn’t sick enough even though I was still in full psychosis

At both mental institutions, I saw my doctor for less than two minutes at a time. There was twice a day group therapy at the second institution, but no individual therapy, and at the first institution, I saw my therapist for less than ten minutes the entire two weeks I was there.

**The first institution diagnosed me with Bipolar I but I had to find that out my looking at my Patient Portal after I got out. No one ever told me.**

**I met so many interesting characters:**

· a girl who thought people were stealing her thoughts

· the girl who ONLY ate fruit but preferred fruit with a demon trapped inside

· the woman who told everyone that I wanted to start a cult so I could murder orphans

· the girl with the debilitating speech impediment who said she was Catwoman

· the girl with bipolar who wouldn’t stop yelling that we all wanted to sleep with our cousins

· the man who thought he was the Sun god Ra

· the over-six-foot tall and three-hundred-pound girl with hundreds of scars up and down her arms who headbutted other girls in the stomach by running at them full speed with her head down. I hung out with her the most.

· and so, so many people who “acted normal”

At the second institution, I was on **Lamictal** and **Risperidone** but was only allowed to leave after taking **Invega**, a monthly shot for schizophrenia. I think it helped. I was still psychotic when I left but after a horrible day where I felt my brain was going to split in two, I suddenly realized the actor wasn’t Jesus and I had been psychotic.

***I plunged into the deepest depression I’ve ever had before.***

**I had to find a therapist. It took three tries to get it right.**

· The first one was younger than me, asked if I was in high school (as in, didn’t read the intake form), and had her life together so I couldn’t go with her

· I complained that Dialectical Behavior Therapy that the second therapist was doing wasn’t *doing* anything and she said it sounded like I was done with therapy. She showed me the door

· The third therapist was at my new psychiatrist’s office. She is a slightly overweight, middle-aged divorcee with major depressive disorder. That’s the kind of therapist I want. She’s seen some shit

I’m on a lot of meds; it’s a little alarming sometimes. But they keep me stable.

· Latuda

· Zyprexa

· Buspirone

· Wellbutrin

· Depakote

· Lexapro

With my new therapist and my new psychiatrist (that’s another saga for another time), I got stable.

102,"I get told I'm a horrible person, sociopath, monster, but I don't understand why. Please help.","Hi everyone. 
I don't really seem to fit into society as nobody will have me. Could you please help me determine what's wrong with me? Even an amateur or subjective diagnosis would be helpful, thank you.

My whole life I've been pushed out of friend groups and snubbed by people. I do have quite a few friends who I get a long with, but it seems most people think I'm a horrible person.
I've been told I don't understand peoples emotions, that I'm a sociopath (which I'm most certainly not!), I constantly get told I'm an asshole, I've often been called a creep, I get told I'm a monster, and various other things.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong and I've been trying for as long as I remember to become a better person, but it's not working.
Things I've tried:

1.) Writing 5 things I appreciate about the people in my life in a notebook every night before going to bed. According to a theory in '59 seconds' this could help me develop my empathy for others. I did this for over a year.

2.) Making new friends, bringing people together, organising events. I've actually formed friend groups, over the course of 2-3 years of inviting people I liked spending time with to my events. These friends often then became closer friends together without me and eventually have all stopped contacting me or inviting me along, even though they continue on as a close group of friends.

3.) I've stopped saying judgemental or mean things to or about people. I've managed to almost completely stop speaking ill of others. 

There are a couple of obvious things I think I do that make people dislike me, but have no idea how to stop:
1.) I like speaking with candour and direct language. 
2.) I've been told I take things to extremes.
3.) I often do little white lies if I think it will bring about net-good and not harm anyone; when it's logical in a purely utilitarian sense.

Is there something wrong with me? Some mental health condition? Do I need help?

Has anyone else experienced this? Is there anything I can do to fix this?

Just like anyone I just want to love and be loved, all of this has over the years made me depressed form time to time, often very sad, insecure and very lonely. 
Feel free to ask questions. Thanks for your time!

Distress is a combination of extreme emotional, physiological, cognitive and behavioral responses that one experiences following an event. When a situation causes us to feel distressed many of us may have a fight, flight or freeze response to the situation. An example of impulsive responses to a situation whereby there is a conflict between two colleagues results of a shouting over one another, finger pointing and shaking. 
 
The aim of the skills discussed below is to help you not to act upon impulse but make a more informed decision of how you would like to deal with a distressing situation. 
 
The skills are a way of distancing and distracting  oneself from the distressing situation, allowing the rational part of the mind (pre frontal cortex) to make a more informed decision and not act upon impulse and hopefully this may reduce feelings of distress. 
 
Situations where these skills could be useful to reduce levels of distress can include: Conflicts and disagreements between colleagues, feeling under pressure from multiple work load demands, feeling isolated and overwhelmed. 
 
Before going through the skills, a pre-foundation base is required. At the time of the distressing situation:
1.Take a deep breath and move away from the situation.
2. Use the distress tolerance skills for at least 20 minutes.
3. Remind yourself that the distress will pass in time. 
 

Below are some examples of the distress tolerance skills: 
 

1. The 54321 technique skill is based upon our senses in which I would like you to notice  5 things you can see right now, 4 things you can hear right now, 3 things you can touch right now, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste. 
 

2. Name as many things as you can in a room. So for example, if you are in your office, look around the room and name as many items as you can see e.g. clock, computer, desk and so on.
 

3. Do a meaningful activity for 20 mins. Choose an activity that you enjoy doing and is meaningful e.g running, gardening, walking or meditation. 
 

4. Positive filters: at times of distress we often reflect on negative issues and struggle to think about any positive things around us. I would like you to try and recall the positive, encouraging and feel-good moments of your life. 
 

5. Create a Magic box/bag: The items in your bag will be related to your sense, so A FAVORITE: 1.Picture or video 2.Smell 3.Taste 4.Touch and  5.Sound. At the time of feeling distressed use the magic box/bag mindfully to help reduce the feelings of distress. 
 

Besides the above skills, breathing exercises and using mindfulness techniques discussed in previous issues are also very beneficial in reducing feelings of distress. I hope you find these skills useful to use.
 

Overall we all feel distress and experience it differently from one another. 
 

We have to remind ourselves that it is okay to feel distress and that it is an important human reaction. 
 

In the end what matters is being kind to ourselves, as we often are our own worst critics.

104,Stressing Ourselves to Death,"After reading about a thousand posts on the mental health, mental illness, self-harm, adult survivors, anxiety, depression, PTSD and BPD subreddits through the conceptual filters of 10 years of post-grad education in neurobiology, psychopharmacology, addictive behaviors, social psychology and about 30 types of psychotherapy; I'm pretty convinced that STRESS is at the bottom of about 90% of the ""complaints"" I have seen. 

Further (and because I get to see and hear the same sort of thing out here in the ""physical"" world), I'm just about convinced that 65 to 75% of those 1,000 complaints would be manageable if the *current* (as opposed to traumatic event or early life) stressors of living in the material world without adequate skills and resources were corrected. In many cases, I agree that remedial work for the ""terrifying event"" or early life trauma *is* necessary, but sense very clearly that if the *present* day stress is not greatly reduced, all the therapy in the world will not accomplish much. 

Much of the stress in our lives is self-induced as the result of using coping mechanisms that don't jibe well with things the way they are and not the way they are not. One can pick up more effective coping mechanisms from the various ""skills training therapies"" like the cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking,  and Schema Therapy; as well as the ""super"" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). 

But trying to use those skills when one continues to be committed to trying to run an *exhausting* daily marathon against the challenges of work, family, exercise, recreational drugs, social drinking, pseudo-spirituality and/or continual social media-tion, forces the autonomic nervous system into relentless, unrelieved [fight, flight or freeze](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=fight+flight+freeze), which is a surefire formula for inducing [complex post-traumatic stress disorder](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=c-ptsd). Because C-PTSD is what I see all over the place, both here, and in the physical world of mental ""health"" (not).  

I use a compilation of the cognitive and mindfulness-based, ""super""-cognitive therapies called the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to keep me from slipping back into the (truly *awful*) C-PTSD I had for nine years from '94 to '03, because I have enough experience with all of the others listed above to be able to do so. But I had to start somewhere, and suggest that others who *start somewhere* with those nine therapies will ultimately get to where they will stop buying into all of the crass, self-destructive rat-racing most of us do because of all the caca we bought from the Commercial Culture of the [Consensus Trance](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+for+Recovery+from+the+Consensus+Trance).

105,My 2 year Discord journey with peer mental health support," 

Mental illness can leave you feeling isolated and alone, thinking that few people understand and that everyone is judging you. We internalize stigma, and there is a tremendous stigma around dealing with mental health. We are afraid to talk about it. But that doesn’t have to be the case.

A few years ago, I broke my neck and back in a suicide attempt. It came after years of frustration with my own mental illness, and several previous suicide attempts. I’ve always been outspoken about my mental health, and I decided, as I was in recovery, that all I wanted to do was use my personal experience to give back to others so that they could avoid the hardships and struggles that I went through. At least then I will feel like it all meant something. I spent years in and out of hospitals, up and down with episodes, and pulled out of school, unable to work. Many of those hospitalizations were traumatic, and have left me with a lingering fear of being hospitalized. But I’ve done a number of different types of therapy, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and my life has improved significantly from the state I was in a few years ago as a result. My medication is finally steady, though I’ve tried basically everything out there. I have been around.

When I was younger, I found solace in chatrooms and on forums dedicated to mental health. Today, now that chat platforms like Discord are making a comeback, I wanted to incorporate this technology into our outreach, catering to people struggling with emotional issues or mental illness. Having an understanding community can be very powerful, so a community full of people with common experiences can help people feel less isolated and lonely. Learning from others can also lessen the anxiety of the situation when going through something new and scary. My idea was to create a space in which like-minded individuals could share experiences with one another without fear of stigma or judgement. Who better to seek advice from than someone who has been there themselves and come out the other side?

The Haven is a mental health support Discord server that I started July 15, 2017 in an attempt to tackle some of these issues. Since then we have become a nonprofit (501c3) organization, with the long term goal of funding mental healthcare for members in need. The server is run by a team of volunteers who spend from 20-60+ hours a week moderating. All support, which is offered in private channels in either a one to one or group setting, is offered by volunteers; any member of the server can offer support. When I started The Haven my intention was to lean on the power of peer support. I think talking to professionals is wonderful and can be very helpful, but not everyone has access to a professional or wants to talk to one, so only us citizens of the internet. Identifying with someone else, finding another person dealing with similar issues, has always made me feel less crazy, so I hoped that introducing people to one another would help as well.

After almost two years The Haven has reached 5200 members and has a lively, kind, and supportive community of folks. I always said that if everything I went through could help just one person that I would be satisfied. Well, I achieved that goal but there's so much more to do. This is a start.

106,"Desperately need some guidance and/or help dealing with a family member who is bipolar/borderline personality disorder, please.","For some background, my sister is diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder. She also has a daughter that is 9 years old. She lives at home with my mother and my father passed away from cancer two years ago last Thursday. Given the current circumstances of her life, her outbursts and severe emotional mood swings (and I mean SEVERE) have gotten worse and worse over the last few months. She doesn't work (b/c her mental health won't allow it), she doesn't help around the house (b/c those with this type of mental disease are extremely manipulative), and she doesn't have any drive to do anything. She causes an absolute Hell to be raised in my mom's house on a daily basis, disagreeing with everything, embellishing everything, to a point that it's beginning to kill my mom emotionally. I'm sure many of you who may be reading this understand what I mean. 

I need help. We need help. 

Yesterday afternoon she called the police and they showed up and she was spouting some lie about my mom, which was not true. The police (who had been called a few times over the week by her for random reasons) know her and her condition and decided to Baker Act her. She's been in a mental health clinic since yesterday. I don't live in the area, I live in the Northeast, but I flew down for the weekend on the whim to help my mom through the crisis. 

We're about to head to the clinic and speak with the doctor and psychologist about next steps. What we do know is the following:

- her living with my mother cannot go on anymore. It's a cancer to the household and to my mom. 
- MY SISTER NEEDS CLINICAL INPATIENT HELP WITH DIALECTICAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY.

The second one is capitalized because we've been told for years she needs this. The issue is that these places are very very expensive and often do not provide any financial assistance. When my father passed he left my mother some money, but by no means is it a large sum. It's enough that basically tells my mom to continue working (well, she wants to go back to working in retail) part time for about 6-8 years and then live off of the investment we made with that money. We're on the verge of taking that money out to help my sister, but as her son, I need to know how to take care of both my sister and mother long term.

Does anyone know of any type of financial assistance or places that are most cost-effective for this type of mental health condition and help? 

Please, we need serious help, and we need it quick. Anything and everything helps.

107,Mindfulness,"Most people run on auto-pilot in their daily lives, not noticing what has become monotonous and mundane. Mindfulness is the act of noticing what is going on around and inside the mind and body. This has many benefits and is a boon to wellness and mental health.

For many people including myself, one of the first steps to successfully managing mental illness is incorporating mindfulness into the recovery plan. Being aware of what is going on in the mind enables you to better cope with and change it. The more information you have about a problem, the better equipped you are to solve it. Mindfulness is about noticing the problem and taking in all the information, while also distancing yourself from the problem. There are many reasons mindfulness is a key part of Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy.
If you are mindful of positive experiences, you enjoy them more. You take in more information about your surroundings and events that happen if you experience them mindfully. The mindful mind is simply a more conscious mind. Everyone experiences negative emotions. Since a part of emotional mindfulness is distancing yourself from emotion, mindfulness helps take the edge off emotional pain. Even for someone mentally healthy, mindfulness is great for wellbeing and happiness.

I have and had a serious problem with anger and emotion regulation. Anger is overwhelming, and negative emotions feel like the end of the world. When angry, I do and say things, to the point of violence, that are unthinkable to the not-angry me. Mindfulness was the first step in recovery from this issue. If I am mindful of my experience of anger, I know that I am just feeling an emotion, and can recognize it’s time to take steps to lessen my anger. I am proud to say I fought off anger successfully last night due to mindfulness and other skills. Mindfulness may have saved me from prison.

In addition to this, life is just better if you are mindful than if you operate on auto-pilot. I like being as conscious as possible and noticing the intricacies of my life.

If you want to be more mindful, start by setting an intention to be more mindful. This means set a goal to notice what is going on in your mind and body more and more every day. Try meditating on your breath and body sensations. Meditation has many proven benefits in addition to promoting mindfulness. Notice your breath every so often. Notice your body contacting surfaces. Notice your emotions, and patterns of your thoughts. When you eat, notice the full flavor and texture of the food. Again, mindfulness = consciousness. To be more mindful, be more conscious of yourself and your environment. There is an app on Google Play called Conscious which gives you a daily mindfulness challenge. Try it out!

One thing to watch out for is that if you are using mindfulness to treat mental illness or to regulate emotion, mindfulness may not be enough. After you notice the thought pattern or emotion, you must use other skills to tackle it. I will cover other skills in further blogs. Regardless, mindfulness is a necessary first step to recovery.

108,Lithium problem. Please help,"Male. 27 y/o. I'll try and be as brief as I possibly can. About 6 months ago, my girlfriend of a year and a half told me she never wanted to speak to me again and was dating someone else already. I honestly didn't blame her as our relationship was very complicated and downright toxic at points as I experienced symptoms of bpd and bipolar syndrome (similar symptoms, different problems. I know this). Throughout the relationship, I would experience mood swings that she took most of the brunt of. I fully blame myself. I got into therapy as soon as I could while I also started a new job that had demanded more out of me. My therapist specializes in dialectical behavioral therapy, but my treatment has been almost all talk therapy. My psychiatrist prescribed me alpralozam and busiprone, but the busiprone had made me feel bloated and sick. He asked how I had been sleeping and I told him ""horrible,"" which was true and still is true (then, about an hour or 2 a night. Now, about 4 hours a night).

After a few months, my depression started clearing up, but the racing thoughts/anxiety still persisted. He suggested a new psychiatrist due to my current psychiatrist not being responsive to my calls (literally two calls a month with extended delays on refills of meds). I agreed, as my frustration had grown. Though I did feel I was going in the right direction, I felt as if another antidepressant medication could need help.

After a two month wait, I finally get in to see this new psychiatrist who I had high hopes for. After about 45 minutes of questions and answers, she tells me she thinks I'm bipolar. I tell her my therapist who has been treating me for 6 months is only comfortable diagnosing me with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder with panic attacks (which I agree with). She follows up with three questions which were ""do you have problems sleeping?"" ""do you have racing thoughts?"" and ""do you experience hypersexuality?"" I answered yes to each and says ""I think we should start you on Lithium."" This throws up a few red flags in my mind as I feel I am getting more than I bargained for here. I initially resist the diagnosis, but she insists that Lithium has ""literally changed peoples lives."" I'm instantly persuaded as she is the doctor and I do feel I need all the help I can get.

I am 5 days in to taking 30 mg of mirtazipine and 300 mg of Lithium twice a day. I have had night sweats every night, but I noticed some more concerning problems yesterday and today. Yesterday, I started to trip over my own feet during my morning commute, but it wasn't anything major. I thought maybe I was just tired, but I did notice throughout the day that my coordination was effected. Today was the day when I started to have major problems. I was reading documents at work and could not focus. My racing thoughts were replaced by a docile melancholic feeling. It took me an hour to write a 4 sentence email. There was a point I literally thought ""this must be what farm animals feel like"" as there were almost no reactive thoughts passing through my head. I was not able to do my job as it requires a good amount of focus and analysis (over 100 pages of documents with meetings throughout the day). I am also having a problem with typing and making repetitive linguistic mistakes that when I realize them, seem as if I have been hit in the head or I'm coming off of an lsd trip. Do I continue the Lithium or should I request something else? Does anyone else have any similar experiences? Please help. I don't want to have to keep feeling this way if I don't have to and my job might depend on it.",1543378231.0,False,2,2,down2lithium,None,a12nu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/a12nu9/lithium_problem_please_help/
109,Slowly losing my will to live despite using my skills,"(In order of what’s going well to the very worst)
I am over 21. USA.

The past week I’ve been trying to improve my happiness and decrease symptoms of depression (which are feelings of hopelessness/despair/ being upset like I’m not happy waking up and being alive - which has been happening for weeks now)

I watch shows, listen to music a lot of the day, watch skits of people and content creators I like as my coping skills.

I started going back to my support group which happens a few times a week which makes me feel more understood and less alone.

Honestly all of that has been helping a lot. 

I call hotlines etc. when it’s bad too.

I was in a Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) program which helped me change some behaviors I had but I don’t look at it too much. I struggle with radical acceptance honestly because I think I need to grieve my situation with my parents. Honestly I’m trying to have compassion with myself for not being perfect because often I struggle with perfectionism.
I’m trying to normalize sometimes finding answers for myself instead of only blindly following a set of psychological tools to help myself.

I’m switching therapists and have to contact them on Monday bc I might only see them in 2 weeks or a month (compared to my therapy which was every week, so I’ll have less support than before. It bothered me my old therapist said I should think about transitioning out of therapy in the near future but I still struggle heavily with my family and passive suicidal ideation?? I didn’t like that comment. 

***I’m also debating if I should switch psychiatrists. Any advice on that? I don’t like their attitude when I disagree with trying more medication because the symptoms are hard to deal with. They’re not that nice.****

Part of what’s weighing me down is that I have a bunch of mental and physical illnesses.

-Inattentive ADHD struggling with indecisiveness and impulse control w/ sleep
-Depression symptoms but not fully clinical depression 
-Insomnia/rumination so my sleep cycle is pretty messed up
-Social anxiety so I’m finding it difficult to make friends bc I overthink every conversation/ have trauma/ not the best at boundaries/ have some trust issues
-Codependency so I don’t mean to but I usually fixate on one person at a and they become my world for a while until the friendship/ relationship gets really messed up. I’m trying to work on the as above mentioned issues.

I’m also isolating because I think I’m too mentally ill/fucked up to have friends. The ones I have, less than 5, maybe 2-3 friends, I haven’t talked to in weeks or months. I feel like I’ve used up all their social support so I just try to cope myself. 

My closest friend we laugh a lot when we catch up but ruminate on some of the comments she’s made to me (which rarely happens) like when I was dating my previous boyfriend and I said yeah he likes me for who I am even though I have some mental health issues and she seemed happy for me but said “that’s good bc I don’t think most people (or guys?) would put up with that” like it sounds messed up… I’m trying to weigh it out bc she’s like 95% kind to me so overall she’s a good friend but that comment was insensitive/hurtful to me. I didn’t understand if that was just ignorance or malice. Historically in other situations I don’t think she was intending to hurt me. It’s just hard because I don’t trust/ feel comfortable around ANYONE near 100%. I’m pointing it out bc I don’t wanna be treated poorly by anyone.

***Any advice on making friends when you have social anxiety/ other mental illnesses? Have any of you made friends through r/mentalhealth or any other r/?***

I hesitate to mention all my physical health issues bc of else that would be a full health disclosure - I’m just avoiding my health issues (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) which is adding pressure to my hopelessness/ despair.

I live with my parents. Both are emotionally abusive. My mom has narcissistic traits and never listens to me/ criticizes me at every opportunity. I lock my door but she unlocks it sometimes/ totally disregards my boundaries. Both my parents speak to me through the thin walls so I feel a lack of privacy/ emotional safety. My dad yells at me a lot which breaks my heart a lot.

***I’m trying to look up locks for my door that don’t involve changing the doorknob so if anyone has any suggestions that would help a lot.***

I want to get a job, save up, then move out, but so far feel too mentally ill to work so I’m in a loop of every week or every 2-3 weeks at least once a month being in crisis (being overwhelmed and in despair to the point of having passive suicidal ideation and contemplating if I still want to live) mainly due to my parents but also because of my worsening physical/ mental conditions and feeling socially isolated. 

It’s been like this for years now.

Most recently, I fought with my mom 3 days ago. When it’s bad when we fight she threatens “you’re gonna wish you treated me/ others (mostly about her) better when I’m gone.” 

Although I am trying really hard to practice my skills and approach some days as just bad days, again I am slowly losing of of my will to live/ keep fighting. 

***It would help a lot to have support please. Validation. Words of encouragement. If you feel comfortable, please share how you’ve overcome similar situations. ***",1645947662.0,False,1,1,theobserverx3,None,t2izi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/t2izi9/slowly_losing_my_will_to_live_despite_using_my/
110,Points/questions to consider when dramatically changing a patient's diet in order to improve the patient's mood.,"I have Borderline Personality Disorder. My family paid many tens of thousands of dollars for Dialectical Behavior Therapy treatment, and it was helpful, and I graduated from the program and all of the staff were really proud of me.

But.

I was nowhere near recovery, normalization, or acceptance and self-awareness that my thought processes were keeping me down.

It should also be noted I'm well-medicated for schizophrenia, with infrequent auditory hallucinations, and I've been out of the hospital for about six years.

But, yeah. Even after the expensive DBT, I didn't feel comfortable in society, completing ADLs, and treating other adults with respect.

I was 260 lbs at 5'3"", and I found out about the keto diet (high fat/high saturated fat, but low net-carbs excluding fiber) at a reddit meetup. I started on the diet the next day. Since then, I've lost over 100 lbs. During outpatient therapy I focused on my disordered eating, and I was pushed to accept food, not as black-and-white, but simply a landscape of choices in which you can show yourself love and care.

On the keto diet, my mood swings disappeared. I don't mean that I just avoided the people I would get in fights with. I mean that any anger I felt, I dealt with in a way you would expect of an educated and respectful adult.

I'm a nutrition major in an undergrad program right now, and if everything goes well, I'll be a practicing nutritionist with a network of mental health workers who could rely on me to give patients/clients guidance when it's even just a little bit possible that certain nutrients are causing suffering and distress.

Please leave me a comment if you happen to be aware of mood changes you suspect to result from how you feed yourself. Further, help me! I'm an overwhelmed student and I'd love to hear from people with Bipolar I and II, Borderline personality disorder, and any psychotic disorder. An ideal study would be primary source diary-entry submissions about your general mood during a given week, and how any sharp changes of mood or any sudden anxieties coincide with certain foods.

If you're not sure what the distinctions are between types of food, and, for the sake of my study, how the macronutrients affect a patient, here's a cheat sheet:

French fries made from white, red, or brown potatoes from a fast food place or restaurant are high sugar. Fries made from sweet potatoes in 3oz servings spread out sparingly, alleviating stress and reducing impulsivity, however, is in line with my hypothesis.

Some more quick examples are:

- Switching from sugar in your coffee to splenda or stevia. 

- Switching from beer to wine or liquor, and diet sodas or seltzer instead of sugar soda or juice.

- Switching from bread to low0carb tortillas or just sandwich stuff rolled up with no carbs to put it on.

I'm not a keto-cultist. I love that I lost so much weight on keto, but it's really the relief from BPD symptoms that I'm grateful for.

If you'd like to try a week on a reduced-carb food plan, I can help yuo map that our (for ANY budget), but what I really want is diary entries/testimonials about overall mood and especially changes in your approach to tense or difficult social situations.

I am NOT preaching that I have some idea on how to fix people's problems, but getting the data -- info on moods during a switch from the standard American diet to a low-carb or slow-carb diet --would mean so much to me as I go forward in pursuing an exentual masters in nutrition so that I can help people deal with mental illness in ways that avoid over-medication.",1445827871.0,False,2,0,pennycenturie,"Asymptomatic schizophrenia, BPD, anxiety, EDNOS.

111,You Don't Have to Stay Stuck,"I have chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder. There have been times when it has been debilitating and I have felt like I was drowning from the weight of everything. Today I feel good. I feel hopeful. I feel like life is manageable. It still feels odd to say I’m doing well because that was not my “normal” for quite some time. I had assumed that my “normal” was just being in survival mode - not crying every five minutes like i did when it was really bad, but feeling overwhelmed by the smallest tasks or the tiniest change of plans. I figured this was as good as it gets for me.

Earlier this year, my depression/anixety/fatigue got so severe that I was regularly breaking down crying at work and fighting myself to not just call in sick everyday. My job is not particularly stressful, nor do I have to take work home with me, but with a mental health disorder it still can seem unmanageable. I was sleeping whenever I could at home and avoiding all social interactions in order to have time to try to relax and take care of all the to-dos that felt impossible. I thought that maybe if I did nothing but clean and do laundry and organize and sleep, then I would feel more in control.

After a few weeks of struggling on my own and not getting anywhere, I emailed my psychiatrist about how I was feeling and she recommended that I attend a 2 week intensive outpatient program. I was relieved that I would get some time away from work, but I was doubtful that the program would even be helpful for me - after all, I’ve been going to therapy for years and I take my meds regularly. I am very self aware and understand the thought distortions and coping mechanisms I needed to change. What else could I possibly learn about the disorder that I’ve lived with for most of my life?

Despite my concerns, I took a step toward caring for my mental health and it was so much more valuable than I ever expected. I got on a new medication and I found new tools for sorting out my thoughts and helping me overcome uncomfortable situations. I learned to identify triggers and what self care really looks like for me. I learned how to sleep better and skills for coping with stressful situations. I learned the importance of building a support network and communicating your needs to them, as well as creating a safety plan if you have a history of self harm or suicidal ideations. I learned that it is actually possible to shift my mood and regulate my emotions even when my anxiety or depression feels out of control. I learned that being with people instead of isolating myself can actually help to improve my mood and make me feel more equipped to manage the to-dos of life.

I also learned that so very few people are aware of the help they can receive. There are so many resources available to you if you’re struggling. YOU DON’T HAVE TO STAY STUCK. Take the first step. Tell someone. You don’t have to keep feeling this way. You are not alone in your suffering. You are not weak for struggling with your mental health. You cannot will it away. Medication can help. Therapy can help. Simply talking to other people who struggle with mental health issues can help. You can re-shape the way you think and respond to stressors. You can learn ways to get out of your head and stop ruminating. It takes a great amount of time and effort, but it is possible. YOU DON’T HAVE TO STAY STUCK.

To be clear, I am not fixed. My anxiety and depression didn't just go away. I still struggle and have bad days, but I no longer feel hopeless. I have a plan that help me stay at baseline. I am still taking medication and I am still in therapy. It is a continual journey, but I have the tools and resources I need to manage my symptoms now.

Whatever it is that you are going through, I guarantee you, you are not alone. Help is available and easier to get than you may think. There are many options available online as well as in person. One option is cognitive behavioral therapy or dialectical behavioral therapy. https://www.nami.org/ can offer a great deal of information about different disorders and for helping your family and support network understand what you are dealing with. Talking to your doctor about medication options or if they can refer you to a therapist can help so much. There are even phone apps that help with managing mental health. I don’t want anyone to think they have to settle for a life of suffering in silence.",1541198906.0,False,3,0,mbeeelz,None,9toz5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9toz5h/you_dont_have_to_stay_stuck/
112,I feel so much I can hear my spinal fluid.,"I can't have background music while having conversations or doing work where I need to form words, unless it's really really undefined instrumental music aka musac / elevator music (even then I prefer not). Still I love music! I used to listen to Muse in my car but realised it made me drive much more aggressively. Music affects me, but I takes so much of my attention that I cannot combine it with other things. 

I hear everything all the time. When eating with someone that makes noise when eating, I struggle, I really can't stand it, because the discusting sounds overwhelm me. Oh my, that piece of butter or milk or whatever that is stuck on someone's lip or cheek, I cannot stand it, and I really cannot understand how it is even possible for that person to not feel it there themselves. - Cause I do, I think I feel everything like that. I itch all over my body, not so much that I scratch myself to blod like, but more like a little tickle from the clothes, my hear or whatever, just enough that I do need to scratch it just a little. Then the itch moves another place and the cycle continues. It's more intense if I'm tired. 

I can consentrate intensely. I work as a programmer and can sit for 2-3 hours with the same code without stopping. But if someone has a loud (they say it's not really loud, but for me it is) sound on their phone, or they ask me a question, I am out of the flow and need a lot of time to get back into it, especially if the code I work on is complex. 

In a dinner party or other places where many people talk at the same time I hear all conversations, and none of them, I really struggle to hear what the person nearest to me is saying to me, because the words mix with the other conversations in the room.
But in my youth I often got complimented that I could ""read someones mind"", I think I am good at reading body language, tone, and deeper meaning in what people are saying - but of course in a one-to-one conversation with no one else in the room. 

When I wake up in the morning and sit upright, I sometimes can hear a long sound (3-8 seconds) like sand streaming down a wood block (exactly like the large wood-pipe-with-sand-inside-instrument you can buy as a souvenir from Africa). I googled it and someone said it might be that I hear my spinal fluid moving from my head down my spine when I sit up after laying down. 

My sister has Adhd. My daughter to (but she has adhd on her other side to). I am an adult man and I have a steady job, marriage etc. 

Our house though looks like a mess. Clothes on the floor, we just can't get that clothes washed dried and folded. It piles up. My sheds are full, I can not get rid of stuff, I have 1000 unfinished projects. ""Projects"" are my thing. I will finish them soon, I promise, and I will try hard to not begin new ones before I finish the last ones. I don't keep that promise, and instead of getting rid of stuff, I build a new shed, and a new one. But all of them are 80% finished, and miss that last piece of roofing that makes the stuff not get soaked in the rain. So when it rains at night I lay and think about how bad that is and that I really really need to fix that. When I eventually do, I get so much boost, and that makes me get self confident, over confident enough to start a new project that I will never finish. I worked with long-running-projects in my previous job, but had to change jobs since I got depressed by the way to long time frames. I work best with the carrot in reachable distance in front of me. 

I don't have anger issues. At least I don't think so. My wife says I sometimes do, but I don't feel so myself. I do however can become verbally aggressive kind of, if I know I am right and the other person is wrong. I have said sorry to strangers that I might have been ""to much"". Not like I curse or say bad words or evil things, more like saying things that may sound very cynical un-emphatic. 

I dont feel hyperactive, allthough I can be of i choose to. Like being a clown at a children party. The children and adults laugh, cause I really am funny, but the youngest children might hide behind their childrens feet cause that clown is crazy. I have 150 characters and voice-imitations and I can't help myself by imitating other peoples dialects. I one time impressed everyone with my Polish language skills, just to finish of by laughing and saying I don't speek a word polish and that it was just jibberish. 
I just recently had a drink at a bar, sat down with a. group of strangers ""owning the table"", everyone had a good time and I was kind and funny, and believe everyone cincerly enjoyed. Other times I keep in the background, shy and introvert. I remember one of the people at the table (when I said I was a programmer) if I felt like a introvert. I responded ""yeah I really am"" - but obviously not today. I am very much both an introvert and an extrovert, and sometimes they tear me in both directions. I would love to be an actor, but I judge myself to hard, and could never sit down and enjoy a movie where I act.

In my one year of treatment , I have been on number of anti-depressants & other kind of medications . It all started in July 2017 and now it's October 2018 , I have had almost 10 different kind of anti depressants , SSRI's , SNRI's , anti - psychotic drugs , anti - epilepsy drugs , anti- anxiety drugs , sleeping pills . 

>Scientifically speaking , Low **serotonin** levels have been linked to **depression**. **Serotonin** is an important chemical and neurotransmitter in the human body. It is believed to help regulate mood and social behavior, appetite and digestion, sleep, memory, and sexual desire and function.  
**Anti-depressants** ease depression by increasing levels of serotonin in the **brain**. Serotonin is one of the chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) that carry signals between **brain** cells. Anti- depressants block the re-absorption (re uptake) of serotonin in the **brain**, making more serotonin available.

 When I began with the treatment , I started with one anti depressant drug. Different drugs have different effects on your brain and it causes different behavioral pattern. 

*I had two phases in my treatment , one in which I was trying out different medications frequently and another one when finally medicines started showing some positive signs.*

On my first drug intake , I reacted very weirdly , I was almost lost and numb , I stopped talking to people. I was really worried and went back to my doctor after a week. I was prescribed another pill and this one also had a very bad impact on me , I felt caged up , I lost my ability to think , I couldn't push my thoughts and this went on from ***July to November***. In the span of these **4 months** , I was the same , no change in my behavior , same feeling of sadness , low mood , low energy , isolation everything remained the same, I tried different kinds of medicines and tolerated their after effects and at this point I felt like a ***laboratory rat*** because it was as if so many experiments were being performed on my brain and my behavior was being observed. My sleeping pattern was completely disturbed , I was on sleeping pills and in those 4 months I was on at least 4 pills a day , my morning started with a pill and ended with one.

When you have been on drugs for this long , your brain gets used to them and when you miss them for a day also , they cause terrible effects. In my case , if I miss my pill for even a single day , I can't function normally , I experience ***BRAIN ZAPS***or ***BRAIN SHOCKS*** . Brain zaps are like *electric shocks* in your brain , they don't let you even stand properly , disturbances in brain are difficult to control. ***They are worst***.

Finally , In November , I was prescribed a SNRI - Serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors. This changed my entire course of treatment , I started feeling better and within days I started feeling normal actually felt happy . My energy level was better , I was engaged in things , I slept better , I ate properly , I started talking to people. Things starting changing and *I was happy.* This was not just one medicine , along with SNRI , I was on anti-epilepsy and anti- anxiety pills too.

>Patience is all we need!

On days i felt tired , I hated being on so many medications to just feel normal whereas people around can be normal without any drug. This is the time when I was close to giving up , I didn't want any more pills , I was sick of these , I feared brain zaps . But again this was the time when I needed to be calm and have some patience and I kept my clam & patience and continued with the treatment.

>*NEVER MIX YOUR PILLS WITH ANY KIND OF ALCOHOL OR OTHER DRUGS.*  
>  
>Medications can be frustrating but remember they are necessary and they are changing you.  
You won't feel the change in a day or two , it take months to feel the change , you need to keep patience. DO NOT GIVE UP!!!

📷

Since last November to this October , again I have been through several ups and downs , intolerable behavior , suicidal thoughts , self harming , brain shocks and a lot of changed medications but I'm still hopeful.

As of right now , I'm on an anti-depressant and two anti psychotic drugs and i have to keep anti anxiety pill with me all the time . Yes , all this sounds too much but actually it's not , I might feel like giving up on days but I pull myself together and continue my medications without a gap. Soon , I'll be beginning my DBT - **Dialectical behavior therapy** and hopefully my tryst with medications would end real soon.",1538740452.0,False,3,5,tanvi_0506,None,9lllcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9lllcs/battle_with_the_pills/
114,One for Teens with Troublesome Parents,"If what I see on these mental illness subreddits is a reliable indicator (and it is, because I see the same thing in the clinic), the plight of the adolescent child of know-nothing (or worse) parents is approaching epidemic proportions. These parents are typically some combination of over-stressed, underpaid, self-involved, substance-addicted, culturally stupidified or otherwise dense. This form of child abuse may not be intentional, but it *is* child abuse, nevertheless. 

Frankly, it is hard for one who gets to see this again and again and again to think that teenage depression, anxiety, substance abuse and other forms of self-harm are the result of much *other* than such lame-brained parenting (though that *does* occur). Sadly, the millennial adolescent too often resides at the bottom of a [Karpman Drama Triangle](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=karpman+drama+triangle) that is at least as often about cultural clodification and parents being in fantasyland as it is about any willful intent to use the children as scapegoats or receptacles for parental frustration.

All that said, here's what you can do on your own:

1) Substance Abuse: IF one is abusing alcohol, nicotine in any form, or other rec or Rx substances, they'll have to stop. SA can cause -- or worsen -- mental illness in people with specific genetics and behavioral conditioning (see below). [Alcoholics Anonymous](http://www.aa.org/), [Young People in AA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=young+people+in+AA) (YPAA), [Marijuana Anonymous](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/) and/or [Narcotics Anonymous](https://www.na.org/) (a bit scary at first in some locales, but often a great introduction to the 12 Step ethos) can be helpful. Or use the [SAMHSA facility locator]( https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/) online to find a detox & rehab. 

2) Support Groups: [Alateen](http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/for-alateen), [Adult Children of Alcoholics / Dysfunctional Families](http://www.adultchildren.org/) (ACA), [Emotions Anonymous](http://emotionsanonymous.org/) (EA), and [Codependents Anonymous]( http://coda.org/) (CoDA)... where you will find others in similar boats who have found explanations, answers and solutions. All of their websites have meeting locators.

3) Books and academic, *professional* websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). Here are some recommended examples: 

. . . a) Van Dijk, S.: *Calming the Emotional Storm*, Oakland, CA: New Harbinger, 2012.

. . . b) Van Dijk, S.: *Don't Let Your Emotions Run Your Life for Teens: Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills for Helping You Manage Mood Swings, Control Angry Outbursts, and ... with Others*, Oakland, CA: New Harbinger / Instant Help, 2011.

. . . c) Willard, C.: *Mindfulness for Teen Anxiety: A Workbook for Overcoming Anxiety at Home, at School, and Everywhere Else*, Oakland, CA: New Harbinger, 2014.

. . . d) Shannon, J.: *The Anxiety Survival Guide for Teens: CBT Skills to Overcome Fear, Worry and Panic*, Oakland, CA: New Harbinger, 2015.

4) Mindfulness Meditation: Try the Vipassana or Zen Meditation styles? (For a *lot* of people with anxiety, unwanted mania and depression, this stuff handles them all chop chop. Many of the modern ""mindfulness""-based psychotherapies are actually based on these now.) The article ""The Feeling is Always Temporary"" at pairadocks.blogspot.com provides a nice summation of it.

5) Therapy Workbooks: One can get a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive, adult-oriented workbooks built on CBT, ACT, DBT, MBBT and MBSR workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+stress+reduction+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=DBT+therapy+workbooks).
 
6) Moderate Exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to ""massage"" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.

7) Diet: A lot of people with depression, mania and/or anxiety eat *very* poorly. Junk food -- not to mention too *little* nutritious food -- will definitely impact those who are overly stressed and make symptoms worse. High-quality frozen meals are better than McFood of almost any kind, but HQ *fresh* (especially Mediterranean -- though not *pizza* -- and Asian) food appears to be best for pts with C-PTSD symptoms. *Healthy* fats (e.g.: avocado) in moderation, btw, are known to be good for depression. Add a 1000 IU soft gel of Vitamin D3, too.

115,My recovery from a personality disorder (BPD/AvPD),"TL;DR: I’d like people to know it’s possible to heal from a personality disorder and I would also like to warn those who have been diagnosed and told “there’s no cure, you need to learn to live with it” that it’s not true. Healing isn’t easy but it’s not impossible. You can get better and be completely happy. It’s not just my experience, there’s research confirming people can recover from personality disorders. So, if a therapist tells you otherwise, just look for another who knows what they’re talking about. 

\*\*\*

I’ve been thinking about doing this for a while because I would like to help others who are going through a similar experience with a personality disorder, feeling there’s something deeply wrong with them and believing they’re unfixable. I can’t promise the same things that worked for me will work for others, but I’d say at least give them a try, especially the therapies that I mention near the end. Since it's very difficult to summarize my whole experience/life, I think I'll just list the more relevant symptoms and events since my childhood until I began my healing process, which I think it's the most important part:

* Since I was a child I had symptoms of anxiety, I had the first episode of depersonalization/derealization when I was 5, and kept having them mostly in social situations throughout my childhood. 
* Those episodes were rare and lasted for just a few minutes, but at the age of 12 they became more frequent and eventually became permanent until I was 17/18 (it gradually went away, no idea why). 
* When I was 12/13 years old I started feeling empty and having suicidal thoughts. This went on for the next two decades until I started my recovery.
* I quit school at 17, then went back later in my 20s but had to quit again due to anxiety problems. 
* Around the age of 20 I went through a period of abusing alcohol and occasionally did other drugs too. 
* My anxiety got worse in my mid 20s, started having panic attacks every time I went out so after a while I stopped going out completely.  
* Having visitors at home made me extremely anxious and I also stopped taking showers for over a year, since I had panic attacks in the bathtub too. 
* I spent three years with severe agoraphobia, only leaving my house to go to the hospital whenever I felt my heart beating too fast during a panic attack or to go to the cardiologist to test my heart (I was convinced there was something wrong with it). 
* I saw three psychologists but none was able to help, so I ended up thinking nothing would ever work for me.

Now, my recovery process. 

In those years with agoraphobia, I read a lot about anxiety and how the brain works but in that time, even if the information made sense, I still couldn't do anything to reduce my anxiety. Things finally started improving a little when I took an online mindfulness course: my panic attacks at home started to disappear, I could start taking showers again and eventually I also started going out a little to a park nearby, although it was still pretty hard because I'd get physically tired due to being so inactive for so long, and getting tired (shortness of breath, tachycardia, dizziness…) kept causing me anxiety.  

I wasn’t making much progress going out and I thought it would be good to move from the city to a more quiet place with less people and noise (so I could start going out more often and spend more time out), so I decided to move to an empty house my family has in a rural area hoping I could keep making progress there. That meant I moved away from my family as well (over 3 hours drive), which seems to be something that's usually scary for people with anxiety, but I've always preferred to be alone even when having panic attacks (I guess because I see my parents as a cause of more distress, not comfort).

When I got to my new place I had no other option but to go out to take the trash out myself and take my dog for a walk, but I'd get extremely anxious about it. Around that time I read another book that finally helped me ""conquer"" my anxiety (the book was ""Rewire your anxious brain""). I learned that every time my amygdala was activated (whenever I was feeling anxious) it was a chance for me to change the way my brain worked. The theory wasn't so different from what I had read before, but with this book I was able to ""see it"", to apply it in my life.

So, my anxiety kept decreasing, but my depression was not. I was slightly proud of what I was achieving regarding my anxiety, but I still felt completely useless, a failure in life, a waste of space... Then I had the idea to do some voluntary work at a nursing home that was right in front of my house, as a way to feel useful for others and prevent me from killing myself, which is what I really wanted to do. And there, at the nursing home, I had one of the most important epiphanies I could have had. After spending time with the elderly, caring for them and talking to them, I asked myself: ""So, are these people useless?"" They aren't ""productive"", they can't do much for others, some of them require help for everything, even to eat or get dressed... In that moment I realized how dumb it is to use or apply the concepts of useful/useless to people. Useful/useless is something you say about objects, not people. I realized people have inherent value, regardless of what they do. Those elderly people are valuable and deserve to be loved, so why shouldn't I deserve it too? I also understood that thinking like that is more like a choice, an action, so I could choose to begin to love myself and start taking action. Thanks to my experience with anxiety I knew that my brain could change, I just needed a lot of practice, repetition and mindfulness... 

Remembering this epiphany would help me a lot later in my recovery process, but at first it was really hard because I was at one of the lowest points I had been in my life, completely exhausted, hopeless and suicidal. I was also seeing a therapist and he was the one who diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder, although I think I had more avoidant than borderline traits. This therapist, while he seemed very dedicated to help me, just kept pointing out everything that was wrong with me and offered me little guidance on how to improve. By his recommendation I went to the doctor to ask if they could give me some pills for my mental state and they prescribed me antidepressants, which helped to lift a bit of that heaviness that was crushing me. 

After a while I quit going to that therapist and started working on my own with Marsha Linehan's Dialectical Behaviour Therapy manual, which was how I realized that what I was actually craving was external validation of my emotions and pain. Reading my old journals to try to understand myself better I could see that what I seemed to repeat and desire the most wasn't to feel better, but to feel understood. My obsession was to have someone who would understand and validate me, because I hadn't learned to do it myself. That’s where my feelings of emptiness came from. I followed the six months program and learned a lot of skills with the DBT manual, but most of all I learned to listen, validate and love myself. 

Later I also read about Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Schema Therapy, and it seemed I had also used some of the main concepts in those therapies without knowing it, especially Schema Therapy, so I recommend them too for people with personality disorders. I believe the main thing when it comes to healing from a personality disorder is changing our core beliefs. In my case, my main core beliefs were something like “My emotions aren’t valid, I don’t have the right to feel” (which led to suppressing emotions and eventually overflowing either in anger or anxiety) and “My existence is a mistake, I shouldn’t be alive” (which led to shame and avoidance). I managed to change them thanks to DBT and a lot of other stuff I read, and that’s why I think I no longer have a personality disorder, since not only my symptoms but also the foundation of that disorder is gone, hopefully forever. 

It’s been almost three years since I started my healing process and I can’t believe how much my mind has changed. I no longer have suicidal thoughts, I’m not afraid of my emotions, the world seems more colourful and I often find myself thinking “I love life”, which I never did before. I also got my driver’s license at the age of 34 (in the past I was too afraid to lose control while driving so I never tried) and I went back to university and I’m doing pretty well (one more year to finish, fingers crossed).

Earlier this year I went through a period of not feeling so good, but honestly it was a piece of cake compared to everything I dealt with in the past. Now I can have these normal ups and downs like the average person and feel confident in my abilities to deal with whatever life throws at me :)

116,How I transitioned from being toxic and abusive to being empathetic and understanding.,"I apologize for length and I am also on mobile. Awesome if you read through the entire thing. 

There are a couple of buzzwords going around lately in the r/mentalhealth subreddit and relationship advice subs. You'll almost be guaranteed to see someone use the words, ""toxic,"" ""gaslighting,"" ""projecting,"" ""abusive"", etc., in any post involving a person that is having some kind of major or minor disagreement with the OP. 

A lot of these comments are pretty derogatory in nature towards the individuals in question, and whether or not they warrant it is not the topic of discussion here, rather, I would like to share my first-hand experience of truly being the epitome of the abuser that you guys all might be imagining when you read those posts, and I will be discussing how and why I changed my ways. I am writing this in hopes that I will inspire some hope and self-awareness into readers who might be experiencing these behaviors, themselves, so that they may learn to change them and attract positivity and joy into their life. 


I will give a brief backstory because it is important when discussing the root of the problem. I am a 24 year old female. I was heavily abused and neglected as a child by my alcoholic mother. When I was a teenager, her boyfriend punched me in the face, broke my cheekbone, and it caused me permanent nerve damage and my full time job at the time. I was re-victimized by the criminal justice system when I was forced to testify as a witness in court and forced to see the pictures and deal with the event all over again. 

My trauma as a child had caused me to develop specific behaviors because some of my needs were not being met, and I needed to manipulate others in order to compensate for that. As a child and as a teenager, my entire purpose for these behaviors was to achieve the social and emotional needs that I was missing from my life. I was not thriving, just surviving. Sometimes, these behaviors would be rewarded because they worked exactly as I had calculated them, and other times I was not presented with the reaction that I wanted. When this happened, my behaviors would evolve and manifest in other ways, but they always seemed so immature because they were rooted in more simple behaviors that I had learned from a very young age. 

I feel that I should mention that I was completely unaware of what I was doing, or the fact that other people didn't do this, also. I thought everyone manipulated their loved ones in order to maintain peace or in order to guide situations to be what they wanted them to be. As I started getting into relationships, my behaviors immediately adapted to the new setting, and the affections from my partners were the positive reinforcement that I needed in order to fulfill my deep rooted need for companionship and compassion. The void that was left by my family was filled with the affections of a stranger. And, I couldn't get enough of this new experience. 

Now, the symptoms in my relationship varied. I was the person that would throw tantrums when things didn't go as I expected them to go. Minor inconveniences were major problems and I will self-sabotage by cancelling entire plans if it didn't go exactly as I expected it to go. My boyfriends were on the receiving end of constant suicide threats if they implied breaking up, and also of threats of me leaving them because they, ""would be happier without me."" I was the girl who would text cryptic messages such as, ""we are never going to talk again after this"" after long-winded messages complaining about basically nothing. It wouldn't be too long before I would get anxiety that the other person was truly not going to talk to me again, and I would text them extensive apologies. I would cast the bait, hope they would bite, and reel them back in when they got too far out of my control. I would take criticisms very heavily and become extremely defensive. I would try to turn those situations around on my partner to make it seem like my actions were a result of something that they were doing. I thought that it was okay to slap and pound on my partner when they had me frustrated beyond belief. I would get frustrated when they didn't want to engage in sex and guilt trip them by accusing them of hating me or the way I looked. I constantly accused them of lying and cheating. 

There was an array of other things, but a lot of these actions are unjustifiable, even in the claim of mental illness. At first, I kept wondering why I was attracting these shitty men and women to be in relationships with. Then, I kept wondering why they continued to lose interest in me over time. The breakups were always long, drawn-out, and horrible. I would go through major depressions after each of them until someone else filled the void. 

It wasn't until I dated one particular man that I snapped back into reality. At that point, I had already taken an interest in the field of psychology and humanities, but I never really considered that I might be one of the people I had to learn about in all those textbooks and discussions. Even if someone explained me to myself without saying it was me, I wouldn't have recognized. All I knew is that I had a deep passion to help people because of my own experience with abuse in the home. He sat me down one day and told me, ""this is what you're doing, and this is how it makes me feel. This is why it is wrong. This is why you have to change."" He was very point blank. Just laid it all out on the table. He said it in words I could understand and made sure that I could relate the connections between my behaviors and his responses. It was that moment of clarity and self-awareness that pulled the lever and changed my course of direction away from the impending train wreck that was about to happen. Now that I was aware of my actions, I would always think back to that conversation when I had the urge to act out, and I was slowly learning not to identify with them. 

My college career was put on hold so that I could attend an outpatient mental health rehab program that offered dialectical behavioral therapy for trauma survivors. I attended for 7 months, five days a week, for about 6 hours a day in group classes. Together with my care coordinator, we learned the root cause of my behaviors, how to finally come to terms with my trauma, how to forgive, and how to move on. I learned amazing mental wellness exercises that taught me how to live and behave in a manner that would attract joy and positivity (the law of attraction). I learned essential coping skills for stress. And most importantly, I learned about boundaries and goal setting in relationships. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD, borderline, and bipolar. These initial diagnoseses really shook me deeply, and I remember crying that night because I realized I finally learned a name for my problems.  I successfully participated in, and completed, my treatment plan. Today, I continue to address my mental health issues as they arise, and my BPD symptoms have almost completely subsided. I have better personal relationships. I have been in a loving, committed, and understanding relationship for going on six years. 

Also, I am well on my way through my criminal justice degree for a specialty in forensic psychology. I'll be helping victims and abusers overcome their traumas and behaviors while navigating the mental health and criminal justice system. 

I could no longer fathom treating anyone the way that I used to treat them before. What got me through it was simple self-awareness and a desire to change. Understanding how to achieve mental wellness is also very important because most of us are trained in therapy to suppress and address symptoms rather than learning how to actually be happy. We don't learn these skills in school, and it honestly makes a worlds difference on your view of yourself and the world around you. 

Next time, don't ask them how to deal with the anger or sadness, ask your therapist, ""what can I learn to become more happy?""

Edit: If you're someone who is diagnosed with BPD or Bipolar and you're interested in learning about your own behaviors that are associated with these illnesses, I would recommend googling, ""living with someone who has BPD/BP"", or, ""my partner has BPD/BP,"" or any variation of those. Read the stories and accounts of other people who are living and dealing with people who have your disorder, and it will really paint a clear image of how your actions might be seen by others. You'll inevitably come across some nasty and hateful posts, but, unfortunately, people aren't inspired to change unless they are uncomfortable.

117,Positive Psychology and the Wellness Model,"  

The disease or medical model of ‘mental’ health focuses “on a deficit, disease model of human behavior.” The wellness model focuses “on positive aspects of human functioning.""[\[i\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn1) This disease model ‘defective’ emphasis has been the overriding psychiatric perspective for well over a century. 

We must move away from the disease model, which assumes that emotional distress is merely symptomatic of biological illness, and instead embrace a model of mental health and well-being that recognizes our essential and shared humanity. Our mental health is largely dependent on our understanding of the world and our thoughts about ourselves, other people, the future and the world.[\[ii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn2) 

In 2004, the World Health Organization began promoting the advantages of the wellness perspective, declaring health, ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.""[\[iii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn3) The World Psychiatric Association agrees, stating, ""the promotion of well-being is among the goals of the mental health system.""[\[iv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn4) As positive psychologists point out, ""psychological wellbeing is viewed as not only the absence of mental disorder but also the presence of positive psychological resources.""[\[v\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn5) 

The wellness model's chief facilitator is positive psychology (PP), which originated with Maslow's[\[vi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn6) seminal texts on humanism, and was legitimated by Seligman as American Psychological Association president in 1998. The focus of positive psychology and other optimistic approaches, is on virtues and strengths ""not only to endure and survive, but also to flourish.""[\[vii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn7) PP describes recovery as people ""(re-) engaging in their life on the basis of their own goals and strengths, and finding meaning and purpose through constructing and reclaiming a valued identity and valued social roles.""[\[viii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn8) 

Positive psychology is a relatively new field (since 1998) that ostensibly complements and supports rather than replaces traditional psychology. ""Positive psychology serves as an umbrella term to accommodate research investigating positive emotions and other positive aspects such as creativity, optimism, resilience, empathy, compassion, humor, and life satisfaction.""[\[ix\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn9) 

PP has been defined as the science of optimal functioning, its objective ""to study, identify and amplify the strengths and capacities that individuals, families and society need to thrive.""[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn10) Cultural psychologist Levesque[\[xi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn11) describes optimal functioning as the study of how individuals attempt to achieve their personal potentials and become the best that they can be. 

Research has shown that positive psychology interventions ""improved well-being and decreased psychological distress in mildly depressed individuals, in patients with mood and depressive disorders, \[and\] in patients with psychotic disorders.""[\[xii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn12) Studies supports the utilization of positive psychological constructs, theories, and interventions for enhanced understanding and improvement of ‘mental’ health. ""The things that allow people to experience deep happiness, wisdom, and psychological, physical and social wellbeing are the same strengths that buffer against stress and physical and mental illness.""[\[xiii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn13)

A range of approaches promoting wellbeing have been tested in intervention research.  A recent study found positive psychology interventions showed ""significant improvements in mental well-being (from non-flourishing to flourishing mental health) while also decreasing both anxiety and depressive symptom severity.""[\[xiv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn14) Continuing research suggests that a positive psychological outlook not only improves life outcomes but enhances health directly.[\[xv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn15) A meta-analysis of 51 studies with 4,266 individuals utilizing therapies focusing on mindfulness, autobiography, positive writing, gratitude, forgiveness, or kindness, found PPIs ""significantly enhance well-being . . . and decrease depressive symptoms.“[\[xvi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn16)  

The academic discipline of positive psychology continues to develop evidence-based interventions that focus on eliciting positive feelings, cognitions or behaviors.[\[xvii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn17) Independent research shows PPIs ""decreased psychological distress \[in individuals\] with mood and depressive disorders \[and\] patients with psychotic disorders . . . improving quality of life and well-being.""[\[xviii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn18) Positive psychology offers promising interventions ""to support recovery in people with common mental illness, and preliminary evidence suggests it can also be helpful for people with more severe mental illness.""[\[xix\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn19) 

**Positive Psychology 2.0.** One of the early challenges of positive psychology was its inattention to the negative aspects of the individual. Recognizing this imbalance, psychologists advocated a more holistic approach to embrace the dialectical opposition of human experience. Positive Psychology 2.0 (PP 2.0) evolved as a correction to this singular focus on optimism so that it could ""move forward in a more inclusive and balanced matter,[\[xx\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn20) incorporating both positive and negative aspects of the holistic individual. As one psychologist put it, ""people are not just pessimists or optimists. They have complex personality structures.""[\[xxi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn21) PP 2.0 recognizes the individual achieves optimal human functioning by living a meaningful life that comes through full engagement. PP 2.0 is a balanced approach, one that ""equally considers positive emotions and strengths and negative symptoms and disorders.""[\[xxii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn22) 

The positive psychology perspective maintains that individuals with a ‘mental’ disorder can live satisfying and fulfilling lives *regardless* of symptoms or impairments associated with the diagnosis.[\[xxiii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn23) Positive psychology aims ""to emphasize the positive while managing and transforming the negative to increase well-being.""[\[xxiv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn24) 

Positive psychology focuses on enhancing wellbeing and optimal functioning rather than ameliorating symptoms. By emphasizing wellness rather than dysfunction, the positive-psychology movement aims to destigmatize ‘mental’ illness. Positive psychologists believe ""the constructive use of positive psychology perspective is generally needed in contemporary research to complement the long tradition of pathogen orientation.”[\[xxv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn25)

118,"I choose to share with you all the struggles I've endured from Major Depressive Disorder and how I feel about the misery it has caused me; misery so bad I couldn't even move to end my life like I so badly wanted to. It's been a year, and I'm now the most fulfilled I've ever been in my life.","Small victories are very important in my mind. Extremely important. 

Important enough that I believe every Human being should focus on maximizing small victories and healthy pleasure in their lives.

So, I'm gonna come right out and say it. I live with major depression. (**WARNING BLOCK OF TEXT IN BOUND FEEL FREE TO SKIM ONCE YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.... I KINDA RAMBLE ABOUT MY CURRENT LIFE AND THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO GET ME GOING        TL:DR AT THE BOTTOM**) She (trust me, naming your pains really helps) comes and goes as she pleases, but generally she tends to follow a pattern of intensity depending on how healthy I am in mind and body.

Even at this point in my life, at this point where I would consider the past two months of it to have been the most liberating and self-awareness-boosting months of my entire lifetime, ~~(no fucking joke! I just had to edit all of this grammar down to really drive home the point I'm trying to make when i say~~ **~~LIBERATING~~**~~)~~  I **STILL** experience bouts of horrible depression. 

The type of depressions that numb the human in me down to a resentful and violent-minded ball of fire while ripping my body of so much of its energy that not even the fucking adrenaline can fuel me enough to move a god damn muscle. 

Like, scary type, ready to kill something type, like myself or a relationship or a state of mind or an entire day or sometimes even other beings type depression. Horrible stuff, and I wish it upon ABSOLUTELY nobody at this point in time.

As such, I actually couldn't see *anybody* that I know personally benefiting from some of the more sinister aspects of depression, such as:

|*Psychological*|*Physical*|*Both, at the same. time.*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*Extended periods of hopelessness*|*Body fatigue so overwhelming it puts athletes' recovery periods to SHAME*|*Suicidal ideation* (feeling suicide physically is NOT fun)|
|*Delusions*|*Entirely absent appetite*|*Persistent, intense rage.* This wreaks absolute havoc on the  body. Both during and after.|
|*Anhedonia*, which is the mental state where ""interest in anything, even that which you've previously loved"" is difficult if not impossible.|*Thick grease from not showering*|*Loss of interest in human connection*. Without our brothers touch we really struggle to thrive, imo.|
|\^ This is a main reason that *Joy can feel impossible*|*Shocking fluctuations in weight*|*Loss of empathy towards yourself and others.* Really turns ya sour.|

 At the moment I run cross country and sprint for my school. I train individual muscles whenever I feel like I can. Weather permitting I practice and engage in tennis. I have cycled 50 miles, albeit before I ever experienced my devil-degree depression, with very very little rest to the point where my legs gave out on me. Whenever I lift weights or use my body I go all out. I'm no stranger to intense exercise so while I might not have been worked at a slave camp or anything, I certainly have put myself through some incredibly painful workouts. Considering, I believe exercise to be overwhelmingly beneficial for a variety of core reasons; one of the most important of which being that Humans **NEED** *some* degree of pain and suffering. 

I'm largely pacifistic overall but I think every human needs to hurt in order to heal.

I also try my hardest to speak as much of my experience as possible when attempting to spread knowledge. 

I feel like experience is what teaches us the most. So, when I speak my ""sermons"" as I've been calling them lately, I always try and add in some stories and real world examples from my past.

Piggy backing off of that, I've done exercise to the extent that I have been taught that there is no pain we can inflict upon ourselves during consensual, healthy exercise that can ever outmatch the physical pain, exhaustion, misery, and even suicide that we as human beings can sense on our skin and in our muscles -- from a depression or not. I might not have cracked rocks or mined ore for a whole day, but I understand nearly puking and nearly blacking out from exhaustion; Intense exhaustion, slow burning exhaustion.

All of our suffering (and joy!) is totally real and totally tangible. 

It's also real to believe that you aren't depressed when you are. We can reach a certain point in our misery that we finally lose the last part of ourselves that cares for the Human in us. Once we reach this point I believe that it becomes very hard to feel empathy for ourselves. It becomes very hard to ever speak nicely about what we do. Or create. Or even what we think. 

It becomes very very very difficult to wake up, eat food, *exercise??? exercise while depressed??* (that shit seems impossible when im depressed like god cant someone just carry me to the fridge for..... haha nevermind too depressed to eat)

It's not always possible to be functional during depression, either. 

Humanity boasts about the resilience of himself but **beneath his pride is hidden the importance of being weak.** Of being a sniveling, disgusting mess, screaming on the couch after breaking a glass or something. Like sometimes we just got so much shit in our heads that something so stupid and minor as dropping glass in our home can send us off the deep end.

As such, we might be resilient in the marathon but god DAMN those blisters hurt!!!! We're pussies short term! We're weak, mushy, clumsy, and erect sacks of meat and meat-juice (blood). Of course words are gonna hurt us, our bodies are made for brain function for Christ's sakes....

As such, people can, but ***definitely*** shouldn't be able to make you *believe that you're* useless and sub-human/lesser. It's not fair to those of us who already hold that belief anyways. It's not fair to those of us who suffer, and it's not fair to themselves. Why are they okay with degrading their own sense of worth like that? Making someone's misery worse? And then watching their reaction to you, either ignoring it or missing it entirely, then living life after???? Like nothing ever happened?????????Who ever asks to hurt more? Is that even? Morally acceptable? Uh, duh? Why do I even have to ask myself this question???? No it's not fucking morally acceptable. 

Feeling that way is just part of the human experience, but if you regularly define your worth based on the negativity of others you're bound to succeed. 

Succeed how, might you ask? Well let me tell ya!

**Humans love negativity!!!!!!** So much so that we can focus on it so regularly that it becomes all we talk about. So much so that the news is all about death and all of the wrongs in this world that would take hundreds of people collaborating all at once in a single group to fix. So much so that gossip even has its own dialects. So much so that there isn't a single school or a single workplace on this planet that doesn't have a human in it that bullies others. Or even *themselves*.

Ever think about that? We bully ourselves all the time. Check the definition:

`v. seek to harm, intimidate, or coerce (someone perceived as vulnerable)`

Must I say any more? I personally don't believe we allow ourselves to be as open, compassionate, loving, understanding, considerate, gracious, honest, and/or trusting as we should be (if we care about mental health, of course! ) 

I have done further thinking in the past on all of these verbs **and** the subject in which all of these verbs rest under, and it is **vulnerability**. As such, I have come to the resting belief that vulnerability is one of the most important pains we must experience based off of the benefits we gain in the face of the negatives. It even seems too good to be true, as with due time it becomes second nature. It becomes necessity. A sometimes painful necessity. When interacting with truly kind people, though,  I believe that vulnerability will be reciprocated and accepted. I believe everyone deserves some vulnerability in their life.

I also just so happen believe that the root of vulnerability could, when involved and utilized in appropriate ways, potentially be able to create the solution to any problem we're having in this world. **And the root of vulnerability is** ***love.***

So, once you really get thinking about it, depression doesn't have to be a disease. The word disorder has already gained so much hate and controversy that it's not even worth calling it one anymore. The word **disorder** is defined in **psychology** as **a condition or state of mind that inhibits smooth functioning in every day life.** I think we have to find another word to describe this. I think we need to find a better way to communicate our pains to eachother, including those who don't suffer like we do. 

While we all may get depressed as human beings as it's part of life, the ""disorder"" part of MDD (major depressive disorder) comes into play when our suffering is so harsh throughout the day that we begin to lose functionality in ourselves long after we've already lost uninhibited functioning in society. I absolutely believe that there are Humans out there, myself included, who are much much more sensitive both emotionally and physically than many others are. This makes a perfect environment for pain. Add on some curious genetics and you have a recipe for Major Depression. 

It's this major depression that, when left unchecked, will undoubtedly knock us off our feet. If we don't realize our mistakes by then, well, best of luck to you. You'll be soon on a train to nowhere, my friend. **The horrid, absolutely revolting darkness that is inherent in all of life, Humanity especially,** ***has no bounds***

So, then, after all this, please answer me this question: If society can consider perpetual versions of Inherently Human Psychological States *(depression, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, obsessive compulsion, delusion, psychosis, etc.)* deemed inherently negative *(You know, like when people say stuff along the lines of ""How could anyone alive* ***possibly*** *benefit from something like* ***that****????)* can be considered a disorder, then **maybe its our** ***collective society*** **that's the diseased one**. 

Just think about it for a second. I'm not accusing anyone of anything nor am I proposing any solutions to any deep-rooted problems that exist here in our society. Society is necessary, I believe that with my whole heart and mind. Logic and emotion tells me so. But nowadays, it's pretty fucking hard to be spiritually healthy in this country; America. Let me break it down some. Some spiritual necessities, in my opinion, are....

&#x200B;

|Mind|Body|Spirit|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*Meditation*|*Meditation*|*Meditation*|
|*Vulnerability*. It's soul food, and love is very important. It's how we connect with other human beings and other beings, like animals. Life is the most important thing on this planet, am I wrong?|*Raw foods*. Not many cans, cut back on packaging. Always read ingredients/nutrition facts so you know what's in what's going into your body.|*Gratitude.* To be thankful boosts our morale and teaches us what truly matters in life. We always learn as we go, and we should be thankful that we can learn in the first place.|
|*Introspection/Reflection.* It's how we gain empathy, learn to solve problems, and connect with the world. Oh, and it makes us better.|*Sleep.* I say this as I write on a computer at 2:49 for the third hour straight now. We underestimate so strongly the importance of sleep on our body, mind, and spirit. If anything were to be listed under an ""All of the above"" category, it would be sleep. I'm just up so late because I'm editing this to a degree I deem comprehensive and cohesive. I want to make sense, all of this means a lot to me. Oh, and I've read this entire thing aloud to myself, as well.|*Reading, and any art consumption for that matter.* Think about it. Another human being just like yourself took their sweet time to express themselves in *language with grammar* that they have passion for, then re-read it multiple times so they could edit it for human consumption. Sounds like a recipe for purity to me!!|

And some reasons it's so damn difficult to do these things could be.....

&#x200B;

|*Inhibitor*|*Opinion*|
|:-|:-|
|Money|I feel like money plays a huge role in spirituality and overall human health for plenty of reasons. Pure foods are much more expensive than processed garbage I wouldn't even want to see a squirrel eating. Consumerism and capitalism sure can work together in curious ways.|
|Culture|I feel like spirituality is highly misunderstood in today's world society. I'm just recently budding into my own skin but what I know for sure about spirituality is that it has *little to do with religion.* What I thought spirituality used to be for years and years was absolutely shattered once I began to experience and have faith in the largely hidden powers of this Universe. Without curiosity the Universe will never let you in, and without faith you will never come through to the other side. This is a very pseudo-scientific concept, and this society conditions us to stick to the facts. Science and research can't even *touch* certain things. Just look at the history of entheogenic compounds like True Psychedelics (LSD *(lysergic acid diethylamide)*, Magic Mushrooms *(A metabolite of psylocibin called Psylocin),* DMT *(*Any *Dimethyl Tryptamine),* San Pedro *(Mescaline, which is extracted from a certain cactus)* and so on.) These gained traction in the 40's when Albert Hoffman accidentally tried LSD in his lab after synthesizing it 15 years prior. He was simply searching for a respiratory stimulant and was granted something he believed to be truly magical. Not long afterwards the CIA began experimenting on us, some with the knowledge of it and some without, in order to see if LSD could be used for mind control. Funny enough it had the exact opposite effect. Soon after the exponential growth of love and true freedom took place in this country it was then shut down and labeled Schedule I. Only just now are we coming around to allowing *researchers* to take a look at it. *I firmly believe that we as Humanity should be legally and ethically encouraged to indulge our curiosity in a safe manner, regardless of what is considered ethical.*|

It's expensive, its pseudoscientific, it's highly emotional, it's intense, it's culturally unacceptable; it's against most if not all of the models created by whoeverthefuckrunssociety that have been placed upon us in order to.......... In order to what? What is the purpose of the way this world is organized? Is it for the gain of the Collective Human or is it for the gain of the Individual?

Okay, I'm getting exhausted here. I need to circle back to depression.

I could go on and on with details and stories about how psychologically miserable and tortured I have been for quite a hefty length. I have suffered through so many different varieties of mental affliction that by this point I can no longer even *hope* to keep track of all of it. My memories will come in as they choose and I guess just have to live accordingly. I want to be open to my pains because they are what will ultimately aid me in my years years years long journey to becoming the truest version of myself I can be. As such, I can only summarize my suffering as such: I have suffered mental pains harsh and intense enough to bring myself and anybody not on God damned heroin down to their knees. 

I wear my struggles as a badge of honor because it's toughened me up into the individual I am today. They've also pounded me to a mush, making me the most soft and loving I have ever been in my entire life. Not even as a child have I loved like this.

What I don't do, though, is brag about them. Thank you for reading, and thank you for sorting by new. I appreciate all of you, *especially* those who choose to leave a comment! ;)

133,Self harm and anxiety attacks and feeling utterly alone.,"For a lot of my adolescence when under extreme emotional torment, I would hit, bite, and scratch myself.

I've recently moved from North America to Australia to be with my partner. I had not hurt myself in a few years, and certainly not regularly or in any intense way for close to 10 years. A week ago, after experiencing anxiety attacks for 4 months and nearing 2 weeks of interrupted and reduced sleep, I started hitting myself again. I have been hitting my face and punching my thighs. My partner caught me doing so a couple of weeks ago. I'm going to the doctor today for a follow up appointment.

Last night after having an argument with my partner - one of those arguments that doesn't make sense, where everything you do seems to make things worse, not intending things to go where they go, and suddenly there's just ugliness between you - I beat the shit out of myself 3-4 times. My thighs are swollen and bruised today. I beat the crap out of myself in front of my partner - which I have NEVER done before. Never hit myself in front of another person before. I think I wanted him to understand the duress I was under, and to see what I'm doing to myself. Or maybe I just lost control and instead of shouting, I hit myself. I don't really know. 

I'm so sick of feeling like I have NO power. I'm so sick of feeling like nothing I say or do means anything. I'm sick of feeling attacked when i'm asking for compassion. 

The thing is... My partner is emotionally exhausted. I've asked a lot from him. I love him so much and I know that he loves me, and I honestly don't recognize this pathetic creature that I've turned into. I try to communicate that I know my feelings aren't related to him, but it often turns into him hearing a complaint. I don't understand what has happened to me. Who IS this? Why can't she just get a GRIP on herself and life? 

And why can't he understand that I'm doing everything I can? That I need his help, compassion, and understanding? 

I'm afraid to talk to him about any fears or concerns I have because it may lead to one of these arguments. What can I say to him? What can I do for myself? Why am I feeling this way?

136,Husband has revealed his suicide plan to me,"I always knew he had severe depression for the past 8 years, but he was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder which actually answers.so many questions and fills in the blanks.

This diagnosis has severely been messing with his sense of identity and confirming in his mind that he's just crazy and will always need treatment. For him, this has just solidified his justification for killing himself.

This morning he said he was at peace with himself because he finally figured out how he was was going to do it. (Not posting the method to avoid triggers, but involves ordering medication online.)

He said he will either do it with my support or without and it was a courtesy to tell me.

From the timeline he described it sounds like I have about a month to work with - sometime before his birthday in May.

He said if I tell his therapist, parents, or call 911, he will just disappear and do it without me.

No amount of pleading or how much I need him to be around is convincing. He says he can't love me if he hates himself so much.

Please, what do I do? If I contact anyone, he'll see this as a betrayal and I risk him disappearing.

For background, we've been married 7 years and in our 30s. No kids, we both have great jobs, live comfortably.

I'm worried, scared, and I just don't know what to do. This BPD diagnosis has created havoc and he only sees himself as a burden.

137,Ethics of Suicide for BPD?,"I posted a reddit about this earlier but unfortunately lost my password for it so please excuse a double post. I was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and I'm considering suicide. This isn't a cry for help, a means to get attention, nor a condoning of the act, although borderlines are known for attention seeking. I want a personal opinion on whether or not you believe this is the ethical decision. I have been the primary source of my families dysfunction for the past few years, I would make an almost weekly suicide threat, and have recently turned to drugs. My parents, sister, and best friend are all pretty worried. I don't want them to worry, but I honestly and truly believe that they would be better off without me. My sister has crippling anxiety, so losing her primary stressor would relieve a great deal of that. My parents are going through financial hardship, so no longer need to pay for a second child's college should assist in that regard. Moving on to why the way I am, growing up I always viewed myself as the type of person who is filtered out during natural selection. I described myself as a defective product that needs to be removed from the assembly line. However, with this new diagnosis, it seems more like I should be putting down Old Yeller. Borderlines are generally viewed as abusive and unstable. All my relationships have ended in disaster. BPD's are essentially incapable of long-lasting relationships, so a family of my own is impossible. I will only be happy if I am loved so I need a family, my parents are quite old and won't last forever. I also display very manipulative tendencies. I have a romantic inclination toward my best friend. BPDs are defined by having and unimaginable fear of abandonment, I would often threaten suicide if I even remotely feared she would leave me. Her father left her so she doesn't want to give me the same fate, but I see I am taking my toll on her. But if I can so easily manipulate the one I love the most, perhaps I deserve to die. I can feel empathy for others so I know I'm not a sociopath, but I feel emotions on a rare occurrence. I only feel them when I can no longer control them due to intensity. So a life lived without love, hardly any feelings, and being a burden on my loved ones does not seem to be an ethical life.

138,"My story, and plead for help.","I would like to share my story (long) and see if anyone might know where to start looking for what might be wrong with me.

I can't really go back to what started everything, mostly because I really don't know, but I have an idea what may have pushed me over the edge. I'm not quite comfortable going into everything here, but I'll start with what i can.

As a kid through my mid teens I had anger issues, I was very angry and would hit myself. I never cut or burned myself but I did punch myself, give myself black eyes and large bruises on my chest and stomach. 

Right after my 12th birthday I started having, what a counselor told me were, ""white outs"" (laps in memory where I would lose consciousness, but lash out in anger and hurt or fight people). It would always happen right after this voice I had in my head would start screaming. 

I have always had this voice in my head for as long as I can remember. I use to think it was my ""imaginary friend"" as a young child and I would call him Bear, he would give me advice or tell me what we should do. I still remember him being very innocent. but as I got older the voice got ""meaner""(?), He would  tell me people were dangerous or trying to hurt me.  It made it hard to make friends.

Skip ahead to me at about 11 and he would start telling me to hurt people ""before they do it to us."" I had gotten use to him enough to not talk to him out loud, I would just think he would ""talk"" back. This went on until a few months after my 12th birthday, I know when it was because there was an event. I'm not going to say what happen, just because I'm not ready to (not that you don't already have your own ideas, I'm sure).

After that my anger was worse then ever and finally one day I snapped. A kid (13is) was bullying me (not a rare thing for me at the time) and all the sudden the voice started screaming about hitting back and to ""Stop being weak and fight like I (himself not me) can"".  Next thing I remember I had a two adults holding me down and telling me to stop thrashing.

One of the adults had a bloody nose and a ripped shirt, the other was dirty but otherwise fine. The kid was crying curled up in another adults arms, bloody and bruised up. I remember my hand really hurting and I could see the bone of a few of my knuckles.

I was told later that I had jumped on the kid and started punching him in the face and chest with his arms pinned by my legs. when the adults made it out one grabbed me and the other grabbed him. When I was grabbed I headbutted him and he tried to stop me but I ripped his shirt trying to get away from him before a third adult got to me and pinned my arms to my side and I thrashed with them both in the dirt for a while.

They chalked it up to me ""finally having enough and defending myself.""  it wasn't until it happened a few more times before I was finally sent to a counselor. He told me it was all from an over active imagination, to much sugar and ADHD. My mom didn't want to put me on drugs so I never took any. My mom never really saw what was all happening because it never really happened around her or most my family, plus my mom was working her ass off to feed and house me as it was.

The voice only got louder and angrier all the time until I met my best friend when I was 16. For what ever reason I never had a white out around him. I think it helped that he kept me busy and we would yell and fight for fun. The voice seamed to like him too (if that makes sense). 

I started learning how to keep my temper down and stay calm. No more white outs or screaming in my head. I could/can still hear him, but it's more like a whisper or calm (angry but calm) talking level.

Then I met my wife. Almost all my anger went away when I was with her. I could hear the voice and he didn't completely like her but he was calm and even quiet for a long time. I thought that I might have ""grown out of it"" but then he started coming back. It was really wierd, he was like like he was when I was a kid, talking to me, telling me what he wanted to do instead of yelling at me... it was nice.

But I am nothing if not an idiot.

I started ruining my relationship with my wife and now we are getting divorced.

The voice is getting loud again, he yells and tells me to hurt people who talk to her and I find myself hitting myself again as well. My chest is almost covered in yellow/brown and purple spots.

I know that I will never hurt my wife or children but I'm very scared to what might happen if I start having white outs again.

I plan on seeing a therapist soon but it won't be for a few months at the soonest due to the lack of them where I live. I want to start looking into what might be wrong and see what I can do to help myself now.

If you have any suggestions on what this might be I would very much appreciated it.

also quick note. I work 14 hours a day on an island  with no Internet, so for the people out there who are kind hearted and worry about people, I am perfectly fine out there. The work keeps me busy and I don't have time to be angry out there.

 It is actually very nice.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and for any help you can offer.
