1,Dialectic Behavioural Therapy (DBT) - Please Share Your Experience,"I have been diagnosed with several mental disorders, including Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which is the most troubling. Mental illness has been a struggle my whole life. But only 3 years ago, I began looking for solutions. Recently, I read this book on DBT, called ""DBT Made Simple"" and overall I understand how the treatment is administred and the fact that DBT is clinically-proven to be effective specifically for BPD because its principles once fully absorbed by the patient transform behavior from unhealthy to highly adaptive. 

Have you or someone you know received DBT? Please share your experience. Thank you.

3,Regular DBT Sessions,"Finally getting back into regular sessions with my worker, and currently looking at boundary setting in addition to building on my DBT skills.

I’m still not in a good spot, my physical health is in a scary situation right now and I messed up my knee so getting from place to place or doing my usual tasks is a lot harder now. I’m looking at surgery and I still haven’t had a specialist look at my knee so it’s been up in the air for the most part. 

Getting regular support for probably most of my life is something I’ve accepted now. I’ve increased my meds and I should be on an upswing soon. I feel myself being more productive, I was able to make a meal for myself without the assistance from my partner (made my own dressing and cooked some mushroom bacon for a salad)

4,therapy issues and cbt/dbt technique,"Please refer me to another thread if this is not the correct sub. I hope my post make sense . F late 20s here. I am sorry in advance for the very long rant.

in my opinion my current therapist is the best I ever had thus far . I am planning on working through my personallity diagnois , but I need to double check that she is 100% knowledagable on DBT. Also, she use to be an addiction couselor , but I do not understand how that is the case because she just tells me to attend meetings ( reachout , 12 steps and find a sponser). I feel like it not for everyone... In addition, I struggle with trichtilomania as well. we have been over the basic coping skills ,but nothing really helps . 

 I obviously relized that I have to put in the work too and continue to take my medications.  My freind (had bpd) recently mentioned the idea of switching therapist.  I have a lot to think about and at this point I am just making my owns notes of coping skills and googling reading material to learn more about how to help myself with these  multiple disorders.  I do not mind putting in the extra work , but it is very exhausting mentally.  I heard that CBT technique is  great for people whom struggle with addiction and Trichtilomania.  I was wondering if has that been the case for anyone else? 

 I am planning to dicuss this all with my therapist in my next apt .So i can figure out if i need to change therapist of not. For context My therapist always tell me that  she is not usually offended and i should not worry about hurting her feelings. If I am rude in anyway she calls me out for it which I do appreciate .  FYI This situation is now the 2nd time that I messed up boundaries. Anyways , My upcoming apt is in the new year and we had our weekly apt before she went on holiday/trip. That night I was organizing my emails / notes for my therapy sessions.  I accidently sent them to my therapist very late in the night. The email referenced referenced self harm , but no intent to harm myself at all. I had no idea i even sent to her until the next morning. I woke up to calls,emails and text ( phone was muted overnight). I called her right away that i was okay and I was sorry . She could not hang up fast enough which i do not blame her for ( she was leaving for her trip that day). my therapist then proceeded to send an email stating "" if it is not true emergency"" please do not reach out and gave me a crisis number etc. I just know when we have our apt that it be the first thing to dicuss. the worst part is that I spiraled and acutally ended self harming because of  how anxcious / guilty i felt. there were other reasons , but that was the main reason. I am not sure how to even explain this in a kind way. I am not blaming her , but it could come off mean.

13,is ISTDP good for CPTSD? if not - what kind of therapy is? DBT?,"PLEASE HELP.

had been doing CBT with brakes for a few years and depending on a therapist it was either nothing or finding a true mentor i was forced to leave bc of my age (the clinic was for teens and young adults up to 21)...

i delved into EMDR and felt true compassion; learned how to take care of my brain through my body, it was truly amazing, however, with such a strong focus on the topic of trauma and me still living with the oppressors (although without physical violence, still with emotional and financial) after a while i found it too overwhelming + the realization of their behaviour being worse than i thought made me angry which in turn made me act out and suffer more on their account.

recently after an almost a yearly break i tried a couple sessions of SFBT (Solution-focused (brief) therapy). it worked only with very small and short-term stuff. otherwise i didn't get enough emotional support from it and even the therapist themselves said at our last session that i've been through a lot of hurtful life events and that perhaps i should try a different kind of therapy. they suggested ISTDP.

i looked ISTDP up and the depth of it sounds really tempting however, i do not want to get retraumatized; i think one of my two EMDR therapists used it on me at some point and made me supper triggered and angry, that was also a joined session with my parents, and although we were all against each other, we could agree on one thing - that it would be my last session with him. perhaps, given that he had only started training with ISTDP back then - that's not the best example of what this therapy is truly like?

i also heard good things about DBT when it comes to OCD, which i'm not sure if it's an outcome of CPTSD or the way i was born (lol).

Is it normal to feel completely invalidated and  belittled by the way the session is run?


 A woman walked out of a session today as her questions were interupted with no answers. She said she felt gaslit and I totally agree with her.

I'm thinking of sticking with it until the end of the module then switching to another organisation for classes. 

If you happen to run a DBT class can you tell me the therapeutic value of just ignoring questions?

 I see how I'm supposed to refraim statements but the classes are not question friendly places.

A few weeks in and I'm starting to wonder if there is no place for compassion toward the person undergoing treatment within a DBT program.

The first organisation I worked with was very cold and the therapists were inexperienced. I made good progress with the new group but now the replacement Therapist suggested I switch to a talking therapy even though those have made me worse in the past.

I have a few family members that will respond abusively regardless of how skillfully I approach them. I get the feeling the new therapist does not believe me where as the one that left was quite validateing

25,13 year old self-harm & DBT outpatient program?,"My 13 year old daughter (7th grade) has been cutting herself and feeling suicidal. We did not realize the severity of her suicidal thoughts nor the degree to which she was cutting herself. A few months ago she had taken a small knife to school with her and someone reported it - months later. She was not carrying the knife on this day in February but admitted carrying it previously. She was suspended out of school for 10 days. She was looking forward to returning to school though stressed out about the ""rumors"" going around that she had a knife and had been cutting herself.

Long story short, she has a psychiatrist (for adhd) and a great therapist, who has only seen her twice but it is a good fit. She began taking Lexapro two weeks ago and her mood is MUCH improved.

My daughter was accepted into an Intensive Outpatient Program (locally considered the ""gold standard"" ) that uses DBT for self-harm. I have heard outstanding things about the program.

The program is 30 days / 6 weeks. She would be out of her middle school for the six weeks. The entire family would do Family Therapy weekly and my DH and I would have to attend weekly Parenting Group that focus on utilizing DBT - I'm assuming. The location is over an hour from our house and would mean ""commuting"" 2 - 2 1/2 hours daily in downtown metro traffic. All of this is quite fine and we are MORE than willing to do it. I'd MUCH rather do this than have my beautiful, brilliant daughter hurting herself or killing herself.

We are concerned about this because she was already stressed by missing two weeks of school. She loves her teachers and enjoys her classes. My husband and I can't decide if we should send her to the program OR if the intensity of the outpatient program will be traumatic and detrimental to her sense of ""fitting in"" at school / school rumors, etc.... The whole, ""my parents put me in a psych hospital"" bit....

This is also on our minds:

If we do the Outpatient Program, we will all be home during Spring Break.  She is REALLY looking forward to the trip we've planned (the destination is her pick), as are our other children.

DH and I are going to ask if there are additional start date options, including summer - which would be ideal because it would preclude the whole school drama. However, again - our family travel plans would be impacted, changed, or dropped entirely.

Again, our daughter's well-being is the highest priority and we just want to make sure we are making the best possible decision for her and NOT causing her additional trauma and harm.

28,How did you find help? (DBT),"I'll get straight to the point...I've been looking for help for about a year now and its been difficult. 

I always get rejected and the following is a list of things that have happened when seeking help:

1. ""You just have child ptsd, and mild depression you're not your sister""

2. ""I can't be your therapist anymore; you need DBT I'll help you find someone who can help"" (and I got a list of places that do not take my insurance 2 months later)

3. ""I see that you marked that you have a possible ED. I'm sorry but we can't take you in even though this isn't why you are seeking help; here is a list for places that can help you with your ED"" 

4. ""You are too high risk""

5. ""We don't take insurance"" 

6. ""We don't do DBT"" (even though they listed it as one of the things they offer) 

If not one of these I try looking for someone that has DBT listed on their profile or on their website but last place I called they told me that they couldn't take me in because they had a waiting list and it was full and they wouldn't even put me on the waiting list... 

I've seen 2 therapist the first one diagnosed me within the first 10 minutes with a mild depression and the 2nd one was nice enough to take me in but didn't know my history of problems and had to stop therapy with me because she said that if she continued with me it would do me more harm than good. I appreciated the honesty but then I was promised help looking for a place that takes my insurance and that would help and I did not receive that... it was disappointing.

I'm mentally getting worse. I've been getting more frequent panic attacks and my emotions seem to be a bit more explosive. I SH and as much as I would like to stop I don't have any other outlet to get rid of the negative feelings that I feel. I think about drinking sleeping pills to get through the harder days but I don't want to waste my days away sleeping because its too painful to be awake. I have constant nightmares and sometimes I'm scared of myself, I feel like I'll snap at some point and hurt someone else. 

I feel like I'm too sick to get any help because I keep getting rejected by the people that are supposed to help me.

I'm struggling a LOT though. Everything is so unstructured, and I'm tired and suicidal all the time. 

I'm looking into TMS with my family and psychiatrist, and at my appointment today, I told her about how I felt like I needed more structure. She recommended looking into a DBT program (so like, going there Evey day) or a residential program (living there. 

The thing is, there aren't any good residential programs for mental health in my state, so I would have to go out of state. And this is IF insurance covers it.

39,Can anxiety get better over time? I don't think I can handle DBT,"I (16F) have been battling anxiety for so long, ever since I was little. My anxiety manifests with some OCD characteristics but my diagnosis is GAD. I also struggle with depression that stems from my anxiety being so bad. 

Some of my main problems are obsesiveness around cleanliness, severe emetophobia, as well as excessive worrying about my health. I've done some anxiety exercises and tried a little bit of exposure therapy with my therapist but I just. Can't. Do it. We've even talked about it before: she says that I'll start off motivated, and trying, and then all of a sudden a switch flicks and I give up. 

I just don't WANT to do it. It's uncomfortable, I have trouble focusing, and I just. Don't want to. I want to get better, but I can't do it. Well, I CAN, but I don't WANT TO. (That sounds like it should just be a mind over... Well, mind, but I've never had to make myself do things I don't want to do. Never had to study, was pretty good at getting out of things I didn't want to do).

I've also been on some antianxiety meds: prozac, paxil, buspirone. Prozac worked really well but made my depression world. Paxil made me super suicidal. Buspirone didn't do anything. 

I guess my question is, can my anxiety get any better without any ""work"" on my part? My parents are working to get me into a DBT program but I don't think I can do it. I know it would help, but I just don't have the mental energy to do it and still have to do all the other life things. (I've considered residential treatment but because I haven't tried a DBT program and I'm not in acute crisis, I don't think I would fit the criteria).

I am faced with the decision of going to a DBT ward for another 9 weeks as an inpatient. Or outpatient therapy twice a week and try to return to everyday life with additional outpatient help. 

Unfortunately, there is no outpatient option for DBT here.

I was previously an inpatient in a psychosomatic clinic for 3 months and was diagnosed with a severe depressive episode and borderline. Afterwards, I spent 2 months as a partial inpatient, which unfortunately didn't really help. 

After the clinic, my problems were only really tangible. All of a sudden my emotions really threw me off track, I had to deal with enormous fear of loss and failure like never before. I am completely blocked for many things. I can't judge for myself how unstable I am right now and what I need. 

Now when I could start this DBT place next week I can only see someone for an hour a day because of Corona, no time off or weekends.

The feeling of being locked up and even more forced distance from my boyfriend and few friends is extremely upsetting and frightening. 

My job training (Germany) would have to be extended by a year as a result. 

In the scenario with outpatient therapy... 
In the best case scenario, I would be able to finish my job training in time. But after that, I'd be right back at work. And I have no idea whether I would be able to do that.

This can include people who might warrant a diagnosis of anorexia, longstanding depression, or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Would love to have you join the subreddit and participate, and feel free to ask any questions you have!

53,Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) how does it work?,"Quote from nhs on dbt therapy:

*""Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a type of therapy specifically designed to treat people with BPD.

DBT is based on the idea that two important factors contribute towards BPD:

you are particularly emotionally vulnerable – for example, low levels of stress make you feel extremely anxious

you grew up in an environment where your emotions were dismissed by those around you – for example, a parent may have told you that you had no right to feel sad or you were just ""being silly"" if you complained of feelings of anxiety or stress

These two factors may cause you to fall into a vicious cycle – you experience intense and upsetting emotions, yet feel guilty and worthless for having these emotions. Because of your upbringing, you think having these emotions makes you a bad person. These thoughts then lead to further upsetting emotions. 

The goal of DBT is to break this cycle by introducing two important concepts:

validation: accepting your emotions are valid, real and acceptable

dialectics: a school of philosophy that says most things in life are rarely ""black or white"" and that it's important to be open to ideas and opinions that contradict your own

The DBT therapist will use both concepts to try to bring about positive changes in your behaviour.

For example, the therapist could accept (validate) that feelings of intense sadness cause you to self-harm, and that behaving in such a way does not make you a terrible and worthless person.

However, the therapist would then attempt to challenge the assumption that self-harming is the only way to cope with feelings of sadness.""*


So the goal of dbt is to find coping mechanisms to replace self harming.

What sort of things would be recommended here? Or am i taking this to lightly.

54,Brother with BPD refusing DBT treatment. Need HELP!,"My brother has recently been diagnosed with BPD, though i suspect he's been living with the disorder for much of his adult life. His symptoms have progressively grown worse and now the entire family is walking around on eggshells because no matter what we say or do, it seems as though we're exacerbating the issue. He's torn up books/worksheets that we've left for him in his room and became irate when we left suicide prevention information in his room to browse through. Communicating has been very difficult. I've done a lot of research online and have just ordered a few books which will take a few days to arrive (local Barnes was unfortunately out of stock so i have to get them delivered). The only time he's made the attempt to communicate is when he's asked for money. My family and I believe he's recently undergone some financial troubles due to compulsive gambling as he grows deeper into despair. My mom has adopted the caretaker role to provide immediate support, but i've in some ways advised against it as i know he has to come to terms with the responsibilities/consequences of his actions. I've read that we shouldn't give into ultimatums, but at this point it feels like the last resort where we'd provide the financial support if he in turn sought DBT treatment.

I also would like to make an attempt to distract him or show him a good time but he's remained isolated in his room.

62,Does anyone find CBT/DBT–type therapy just... shallow and hard to identify with?,"For the **tl;dr** peeps: since long before being introduced to CBT, I've been TRYING to look for positive ""angles"" to motivate myself: I try to remember good experiences from the past, imagine incentives for the future, etc. to connect to the present; and though sometimes it works, I've also noticed that the longer it goes on, the HARDER it becomes...as the level of challenge rises, the ""angle"" I have to take becomes more far-fetched and convoluted, ever taking more energy to overcome the basic emotional/intuitive understanding that **there is something wrong here**:

The act of ""positive thinking"" itself has become poisoned, untrustworthy; my own voice gaslighting me, like an abusive partner, frequently telling me that, ""*no, this is OK. it's YOUR fault if you can't appreciate this.*""

*****

Quick diagnostic background, for context:

- Treatment-resistent depression/[cyclothymia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclothymia/symptoms-causes/syc-20371275)

- ADHD (*untreated till recently as an adult*)

- Had OCD has a child (*grew out of the worst symptoms, but I think possibly that just drove those habits ""underground"", so to speak*)

- Was previously treated for BPD (*based on emotional sensitivity/lack of regularity*), but don't relate AT ALL to many of the hallmark symptoms, e.g. [""splitting""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology), cutting, angry outbursts

- At least 8 years of childhood bullying/abuse, including being stalked home and having older children wait outside in the morning to harrass/beat me before class. These were pre-Columbine days when it was typical for adults to respond, ""*You have to stand up to them. They'll go away.*""

- Anxiety. That isn't an official diagnosis, but an obvious outcome of the above and massive problem in itself.

- Was tested for Asperger's with results just slightly off the Autism spectrum—an ""infrared Aspie"", if you will.

If there's one thing I've learned, it's that psychological diagnoses are, at best, vague pigeonholes based on symptomatic expression, meant to expedite the identification of an effective treatment for as many people as possible. That's fine.

Yet, roughly 80-85% of the professionals I've met with have had some sort of CBT/DBT agenda (for lack of a better word) upon meeting them. You know: ""*change your thoughts*"", ""*you can do it!*"", ""*it's important to learn* **skills**"", etc.

I'd go so far as to say that it's become an ideology in that field. An absolute truth.

...

—Look, I *get it*, okay? This is a big thing they seem to be missing: not everyone with a mental illness is new to these ways of thinking. The ""self-help movement"" is as old as the printing press†; we're NOT all of us incapable of realising on on our own basic ideas like, ""*your emotions affect how you think*"" (—Christ, lady, I was consciously working around my mood cycles and trying to regulate them by the time I was a pre-teen, if not earlier.)

A lot of us have been trying, some way of another, to ""*change our thoughts*"" etc. much earlier in our lives than when you started your degree, Ms PhD ""clinical psychologist"".

And the behavioural approach really is quite simplistic, idealistic even. Quick example: has anyone else noticed that there are a lot MORE than just simply ""*positive*"" and ""*negative*"" thoughts floating around in their head? And that even the ""negative"" thoughts can have value sometimes?

One more example: DBT teaches something called [Wise Mind](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/wisemind.htm). Quite simply, this isn't a thing. It's portrayed as the intersection between an ""emotional mind"" and ""reasonable mind"", but if you ask me *every* thought has some component of reason and emotion, so *what, exactly, is the* ""wisdom"" *here*???

Indeed, DBT in particular seems a lot of AA (*from what I've read of AA on reddit/experienced via people I've met*): it's an out-of-the-box, ready-made worldwiew applied to its audience via methods that more than slightly resemble a cult. It's not my place to insult everyone who has bettered themselves this way, but at the same time, tbh, I've met more than a few who talk about their experience in a way that feels, to me, suspiciously *prescribed*: ""*Yes, DBT has taught me to be much more mindful and regulate my emotions.*""

I just ...I don't like that approach. I hear the words, but I've never been able to relate to the meaning. Am I really supposed to just say things like this until I finally delude myself into believing I'm ""better"" because I belong the group? Is there no actual hope of understanding and regulating myself coming from what I already done?

...

^†I ^made ^this ^fact ^up. ^Point ^being, ^these ^ideas ^are ^REALLY ^not ^all ^that ^original

*****

I've gotten away from my point a bit, but here it is: these values/ideologies feel like they're frickin' *everywhere* now, it's the go-to POV for most school counsellors (though luckily I've found a good one), primarily care physicians, psychologists, ER personnel, and anyone you're likely to talk to on the suicide hotline.

Yes, it's an improvement on stigamatising mental illness outright, but... gosh, it's still pretty rubbish. In some ways, I think, we've even gone backward, because, ...well, I'll put it this way: boffins performing lobotomies and electroshock therapy to ""cure"" people is shitty, but at least these types of people have got some track record of improving their methods over time (from blood-letting and leeches to modern surgical practice). Behavioural therapy feels more like putting my mental health into the hands of those kids who converted to Wicca in High School: ultimately benign, Gods bless them, maybe even helpful sometimes, but not always the best agents of critical thinking.",1549929664.0,False,3,8,almostambidextrous,None,apmv5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/apmv5f/does_anyone_find_cbtdbttype_therapy_just_shallow/
63,Reducing Distress with CBT and DBT skills by Dr Fardin Jussab,"There may have been times in n your life, after a certain situation arised, when you may have thought, “I wish I had reacted differently” and/or “I could have dealt with that in a better way!”
 
This article will outline techniques you may want to use, to control impulsive reactions  to a distressing situation. The techniques discussed below are from Cognitive and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.
 
Distress is a combination of extreme emotional, physiological, cognitive and behavioral responses that one experiences following an event. When a situation causes us to feel distressed many of us may have a fight, flight or freeze response to the situation. An example of impulsive responses to a situation whereby there is a conflict between two colleagues results of a shouting over one another, finger pointing and shaking. 
 
The aim of the skills discussed below is to help you not to act upon impulse but make a more informed decision of how you would like to deal with a distressing situation. 
 
The skills are a way of distancing and distracting  oneself from the distressing situation, allowing the rational part of the mind (pre frontal cortex) to make a more informed decision and not act upon impulse and hopefully this may reduce feelings of distress. 
 
Situations where these skills could be useful to reduce levels of distress can include: Conflicts and disagreements between colleagues, feeling under pressure from multiple work load demands, feeling isolated and overwhelmed. 
 
Before going through the skills, a pre-foundation base is required. At the time of the distressing situation:
1.Take a deep breath and move away from the situation.
2. Use the distress tolerance skills for at least 20 minutes.
3. Remind yourself that the distress will pass in time. 
 

Below are some examples of the distress tolerance skills: 
 

1. The 54321 technique skill is based upon our senses in which I would like you to notice  5 things you can see right now, 4 things you can hear right now, 3 things you can touch right now, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste. 
 

2. Name as many things as you can in a room. So for example, if you are in your office, look around the room and name as many items as you can see e.g. clock, computer, desk and so on.
 

3. Do a meaningful activity for 20 mins. Choose an activity that you enjoy doing and is meaningful e.g running, gardening, walking or meditation. 
 

4. Positive filters: at times of distress we often reflect on negative issues and struggle to think about any positive things around us. I would like you to try and recall the positive, encouraging and feel-good moments of your life. 
 

5. Create a Magic box/bag: The items in your bag will be related to your sense, so A FAVORITE: 1.Picture or video 2.Smell 3.Taste 4.Touch and  5.Sound. At the time of feeling distressed use the magic box/bag mindfully to help reduce the feelings of distress. 
 

Besides the above skills, breathing exercises and using mindfulness techniques discussed in previous issues are also very beneficial in reducing feelings of distress. I hope you find these skills useful to use.
 

Overall we all feel distress and experience it differently from one another. 
 

We have to remind ourselves that it is okay to feel distress and that it is an important human reaction. 
 

In the end what matters is being kind to ourselves, as we often are our own worst critics.

65,Is DBT useful for anything other than borderline personality disorder?,"tl;dr - Not diagnosed with borderline, and don't think I have it. Will DBT help me with emotional issues?



I've been experiencing some mental health issues for a couple of years now. I have self-diagnosed with depression and anxiety (I've been diagnosed and medicated for both in the past). I suspect there may be something more going on, possibly some flavor of bipolar disorder, but have had no luck getting in to see a mental health doctor/counselor so far. (I have insurance and am in the US, but after calling down a lengthy list, have struck out and have yet to try again).



All that being said - one of the most troubling things is feeling strong inappropriate emotions all the time. I bought a [DBT workbook](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516VuY2krdL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg) recently because it sounded promising but later realized this is a treatment specifically designed for BPD. If I don't have this disorder, will it even be helpful?



I read up on BPD and while I can relate to some of the emotional experiences that people with it describe, I don't relate to the behavior they describe. What is giving me such a hard time is that my interior emotional state is not appropriate to reality so that I'm ALWAYS having to try to do the appropriate thing, when my emotions are leading me in a different direction. Example:  when my coworkers say good morning and want to make the typical small-talk, I react (on the inside) with extreme hostility and irritability for no good reason. However, I react appropriately by saying good morning and making small talk. I fake it, in other words. And I'm GLAD I am able to fake it because they are nice people who are just being friendly. I'm just exhausted by the bad feelings and exhausted by the effort it takes to always do something other than what I feel like doing, if that makes sense. I want the inside to match the outside. It shouldn't take so much effort to be friendly to a good-natured coworker asking about my weekend plans.  I'm also tired of my lack of motivation, wanting to sleep all the time, lack of life goals, and feelings of sadness (the sadness is also generally inappropriate to my circumstances), hopelessless, and lack of interest in things I used to enjoy.  All day every day is full of these sorts of things. 


Is this DBT workbook an appropriate jumping off place for self-help until I can see a professional?

67,Seeing a clinician for possible DBT therapy tomorrow. What was your experience?,"Hi all, thank you for reading. I’ve never posted anything on Reddit before, so I hope this goes well. I’m on mobile, so forgive any bad formatting. Also, I do not know any proper terminology, but please know that it isn’t my intention to offend. I’m truly curious because this might be my own experience. 

I suffer from bipolar disorder and primarily-inattentive adhd. I’m going through a particularly dark time and I’ve sought out help via my normal means - doctors for the most part. Because I’m so down, my DO decided my condition had reached a point that she couldn’t treat me anymore, so I found a great new psychiatrist. I’ve been recommended DBT therapy by two psychologists (one of them is my current therapist) and my new psychiatrist. I didn’t want to do it before because of the intense time commitment, and the cost. This time, things are bad and I’m tired of feeling this way without any kind of coping mechanisms.

I was wondering what any of you who took DBT thought of it. What was your experience? Did it help you, either right then when you were in the middle of the mood swing/episode or in later episodes? What was it like opening up to strangers? What kind of tools did it give you to cope? And most of all, what was the most valuable thing you took from the therapy once it was over?

69,I have BPD and I feel like DBT is a terrible therapy. Is there another way to get help? Am I alone in this?,"So, as the title says. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and am doing Dialectal Behavior Therapy. I've been doing it since August of last year... and I don't think I'm getting any better. This therapy is useless to me. Most of it is distraction/meditation (which I already did way before I was diagnosed) and radical acceptance, which is bullshit. Why am I supposed to accept everything? Not even a normal person does that.

I have spirals all the time about everything, and when I bring them up to my therapist, I feel like it's just a ""Why Neuro is Wrong"" hour. I'm told to do the radical acceptance, and learn to control my emotions. Yeah, I'm working on that, it's obviously not making things better. I don't feel validated in therapy, so much so that I make it a point to spend my sessions venting about what happened the previous week so by the time the hour is up, there's no time to tell me I'm feeling the wrong way.

I feel like my therapist should at least validate my feelings once in a while. I feel like I'm not allowed to feel the way I do, and that sucks, because I can't control it initially happening. My feelings and emotions are so heightened and it really hurts when even my therapist is basically telling me stop being a baby (she doesn't say it this way, but it feels like that's her point).

Am I the only person who feels like DBT is a crap therapy? Is there another type of therapy that may be better, or maybe I just need to get on some medication? I'm just so frustrated and I feel like I've been doing this therapy for months and it's just the same thing over and over: distract and accept. I don't think it's facilitating growth.

73,Treatments for Cluster B?,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everything, we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

I’m wondering if anyone can relate to my situation. I feel like a tulip in a rose garden. I’ve had two prominent diagnoses: bipolar 2 and borderline personality disorder. 

I have tried antidepressants and TMS.. both were not effective or long-lasting 

I recently tried to do dbt. I only made it 6 months, before I hit my breaking point. It stressed me out and I had a hard time relating to others in group. 

My DBT therapist was heavily leaning towards a more “quiet” BPD diagnosis. 

My CBT therapist is weirdly certain of bipolar 2. 

This is absurd. I’m trying to make it easier for those around me to educate & support me.. but I cannot go back and forth on two different diagnoses. It makes me look like an idiot. It confuses me & others, rightfully so.

90,Which therapy for BPD with conscious self sabotage?,"Hi, I'm really sorry this is so insanely long, I've been unironically re-editing it for 2 hours 💀 even with chatgpt and stuff, I'm finding it hard to express myself, the original text was twice as long :/ I'm self aware of how childish and kind of narcissistic I sound as a person.

So I have BPD and probably ADHD, and I was thrown out of DBT (and another time I left myself, even though I had sacrificed a lot to get that spot) because they said I need more intensive (individual) therapy due to my lack of motivation. Basically only 40% of me wants to get better, and at least 60% actively and consciously wants to get worse, because of many reasons. It's been like this genuinely my entire life. It's a love-hate relationship, but tbh my disorder is all I have, I love it, and I don't really regret any of the things it's caused. Even though I'm miserable. I go in circles: I pretend to myself I want to go forward, but subconsciously I know I always go one step forward, two steps back, because I really just want the freedom of never having to commit to either hell or heaven, but always allowed to oscillate between the extremes, enjoy both of them, never truly change anything. Few days ago I read the term ""approach-avoidance repetition compulsion"", and it struck a cord with me. With everything.

Ofc I don't JUST struggle with conscious self-sabotage and emotional masochism, I have the full range of BPD symptoms, but it's a barrier to even working on them. I'm not sure how DBT can truly help me if I'm not even sure if I like happiness, or health, or responsibility, or in fact lean towards a no.

Recently I've want to know about psychodynamic therapy. I used to dismiss this as ""fake Freud mumbo jumbo,"" but recently I'm not sure. I feel like I need something that's less surface level than DBT... There are aspects of my psyche and childhood that genuinely puzzle me, and maybe understanding and processing them is essential before I can move on. I don't think so, but people often suggest there's repressed childhood trauma; obviously DBT couldn't care less. Subjectively I feel like a not crazy severe, but complex case, with a weirdly convoluted inner life. Maybe it's my annoying personality, but I always feel subtly broken in intricate ways that me and others barely understand, which must be impossible to untangle... :/

So, my question is, can psychodynamic therapy help me with this? Or is motivation a strict prerequisite there too? People say ""I can't help you if you don't want to get better"", but I don't know what they want from me. I can't change what I want and believe and feel on a deep level. And some part of me does want change. Would any sort of TFP, MBT,  or idk, ST or whatever, be able to help me WANT to change in the first place when I'm deeply resistent to change and very comfortable being sick? Or am I just doomed, or need to go down a darker path before I can get better? I'm not really sure who the therapies are for, or which presentations they help most

93,I can’t get out of my own way.,"I’ve been in a Radically-Open DBT program for over a year now. Originally I assumed I would complete the program in 9 months and “graduate,” but I have not been making improvements or using the skills, and therefore I’ve started the program over again. 

I can tell that the skills we learn would likely be so helpful, and I can tell they are designed to benefit us and help us feel better in the long run. I believe in DBT and I trust that mental health professionals know more than I do. I trust the current DBT center I’m working with and believe they have everyone’s best interests at heart. But for some reason, I just cannot seem to implement the skills being taught. I am insanely scared of losing control, being in uncomfortable situations that I can’t escape from, and losing myself completely. 

For some context, I did have a bad experience with a former therapist who chose to quit on me spontaneously mid-session and then kicked me out when I had a panic attack about it. I have a lingering fear that my current individual therapist will quit on me, tell me she can’t help me anymore and that DBT isn’t working and send me on my way to figure out something else. I’ve told her about my trauma and my fears of being abandoned, and she’s reassured me that she’s not going anywhere. But my friend from our skills class got kicked out for not giving other people enough chance to talk, sharing too much, asking too many questions, etc. so I know they could kick anyone out of the program if they wanted to (they were nice to her and suggested that a support group would be better for her needs but the fact that she got kicked out scares me). 

I have such a hard time implementing the skills that are being taught. I can’t stand small talk, talking to strangers, etc. and I have an extremely hard time making eye contact, displaying open social signaling, etc. I’m scared of people taking advantage of me so I feel like I have to be a frozen brick wall at all times. 

My individual therapy sessions have gone downhill significantly. Ive always cried a lot in our sessions because she tells me a lot of things I don’t wanna hear, but lately it’s increased tenfold. I feel insanely inferior around her, like I’m a terrible student and she’s a disappointed teacher. I cannot look her in the eye and I’m finding it harder and harder to be myself in front of her because it feels like everything I say or do is being scrutinized and judged. I know she doesn’t purposefully pass judgment on her clients in a negative way, but I’m “aware of imagining” (awareness continuum) that she thinks I’m a heartless, selfish, self-victimizing person. My crying in session has been pointed out as a “don’t hurt me response,” implying that I’m trying to manipulate and control the situation by crying and acting hurt so she stops giving me feedback I don’t wanna hear. I guess subconsciously I could be doing that, but in all honesty I feel like I can’t help it. The crying is very real and I feel broken inside. I desperately want to be understood but don’t feel like I am. 

I’m too scared to make the necessary changes. I’ve dug myself in so deep that if I were to get better, I would feel bad about myself for being “wrong” and my therapist could be thinking, “I told you so.” I feel that I’m incapable of making the changes, but every time I say that, she says “what are you trying to communicate by saying that?” As if I’m telling her indirectly that I’m refusing, but the truth is I’m SCARED that I’m incapable and I’m looking for her to prove to me that I am. But I know she can’t. 

Not to mention the program is insanely expensive, my mom is paying for it, and I feel extreme guilt that I’m not making the most of it.

106,struggling with an accurate diagnosis and disorder criteria 🙏 || lil tw for mention of sh but very brief and not detailed,"Hello! So I’ve been struggling with a very specific set of symptoms for about 3.5 years. I am currently 15, almost 16. I’ve cycled through many therapists, eventually working my way up to my current one who specialises in DBT. I was originally put into therapy for just like oversensitivity/social anxiety ig?, self-harm, and ADHD at 12. Then I was put into DBT for my bipolar diagnosis and “being too complicated” for other therapists. I told my current therapist (I love her! She’s great!!) that after doing more research on bipolar disorder, I just don’t think I resonate with it at all, to which she said she agreed!! (I’m so thankful that she actually listens to me cuz I am almost 100% sure I DO NOT have bipolar). Anyways, she brought up borderline personality disorder after I got into some lore, and we did a little research on it. It’s like everything suddenly just clicked, like it all made so much sense actually seeing it in words and everything I’ve been struggling with since like 12-13 was just DESCRIBED, idk how to explain it. I also did a good amount of research when I got home and I related even more the more I read in a rlly intense way. However, the one issue is I do not meet the criteria for the disorder since I’m a minor. She said she wants to treat me like she would a patient with BPD but I don’t meet the age criteria. I guess I’m just kind of confused? I’ve never been super focused with getting an exact diagnosis/label, as I always just figured it was a number of things or just something wrong with me as a human (and I’m not attempting to self-diagnose), but every single part of my brain was just described so specifically. If I didn’t stop myself I could write about it for HOURS. I know it’s very typical for teenagers to be moody/unstable, but theres nothing I can say to possibly explain how much MORE than that it is. The one thing that actually makes complete sense to me I don’t meet the criteria for. Can somebody explain to me how this works, and why the two year gap between 16 and 18 is such a big deal? It’s just kind of frustrating because it’s the ONLY thing that actually pinpoints how I’ve been feeling for so long, and I’m just not allowed to actuallllly have it because of my age.",1714129582.0,False,1,0,van__72,None,1cdik8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cdik8c/struggling_with_an_accurate_diagnosis_and/
107,"Need help on finding resources for friend with ""school-anxiety""","hello everyone, will be making a short summarized post   
a friend of mine (who i'll name X for anonymity) seems to have an awfully dreadful time with school. the gist of it is that they constantly feel the need to work / study, and if they do anything else they start feeling awfully guilty. X confessed that they worry immensely about failing and fear disappointing themselves, so they don't make time for anything else like a hobby for themselves, and studies consume X.  
i was looking into different ""research-backed"" therapies and ways to deal and cope with anxiety in general, by googling it and looking up on those subreddits. i want to do this to help guide them towards a therapist who could help them with it, and give them resources on understanding how one type of therapy could help them.   
from my research, I have noted down talk-therapy, EMDR, CBT and its offsets, ACT, DBT (being an offset of CBT), exposure therapy and somatic therapy. i've also noted down a few notes from my little research ; they have to \*decide\* they want to get better was a big one.  
my feelings are that the best ones for X could be a mix of, by order, DBT to help ground things and have a way to reduce harm and stress. then, CBT to deal with the source itself. exposure therapy seemed interesting but mainly because of my lack of knowledge on it i'm (ironically) a bit scared by it. if the source of the way of thinking of it was trauma-related, maybe EMDR would be needed. then, of course have some additional support by way of being with friends, mindfulness, ways to cope like breathing exercices, etc...

112,Something I've learned in the healing process,"From a decade of Dialectical Behavior Therapy with meds I've learned to separate from my emotions, observe them and discriminate between what's real and what I can let go of but it occurred to me recently that indeed of things that are depressing, matters of grief, these things must run their course. Mourning the loss of a loved one for example. These things take time and it's okay to give ourselves permission to grieve, to be sad. It's healthy to be sad and it's healthy to take mental health breaks when necessary. I struggle with a bipolar 1 disorder to include psychotic features but with DBT I am no longer a victim of my emotions.

120,a form of therapy or tips when part of you wants to get better and another part wants to give up?,"and i don't mean as in dbt (it felt too shallow and requires a lot of genuine willingness that i seem to lack), i mean more of a possible form of therapy or general approach of a therapist for people who are willing to admit they have a problem (personality disorder specifically) but feel an immense resistance for change at the same time. like is there an approach that can naturally increase willingness in a gentle way, that you go in feeling like you really want to give it up and slowly see a genuine light of hope start steadily growing within you again?

i feel like there's such a binary sorting with most healthcare professionals: either you want help or you don't. and if you aren't clear in wanting help, you obviously don't and therefore cannot be helped and get dropped because ""you can't make someone change who doesn't want to"" but nobody seems to consider it's more of a spectrum. and that sometimes wanting to give up comes from years of discouragement, disappointment and nothing really giving you a good reason to try.

this is kind of rambly but what i basically wonder is if there's a way to inspire the desire to get better deep down in someone who seems to be standing in their own way, fully aware of it, but unable to stop? any experiences, any pointers in therapist choice or alternative stuff? maybe something that can basically make it possible to do dbt in the first place and have it last? i hope this makes sense",1685402667.0,False,1,1,fightless1,None,13v9w3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/13v9w3v/a_form_of_therapy_or_tips_when_part_of_you_wants/

We both think some therapy alongside it will help. Cannot wait for NHS waiting times. What types should he look into? Eg. CBT, DBT etc.

125,I'm getting worse the more I explore. I'm afraid I'm slowly losing control,"Hi, my name is Phil, and I have schizoaffective disorder, bpd, ptsd, and general anxiety. I've had a few breakdowns in my life but have always been able to flip and switch and carry on to be ""normal"" - working, socializing, dating, exercising, etc. Unfortunately, it always comes back to the breakdowns, and they get worse each time.

This current patch I've been going through had me realize that my state of normalcy has always been repression. The lack of emotions, apathy, sociopathic behaviors, etc. are all ways for me to unhealthily cope with my conditions. As I recognized this, I decided to explore on trying to open myself up to emotions this time around.

It's not going well. My mood is unstable as hell. I'm impulsive as ever. I can't hold a basic conversation in person. I haven't worked in over 2 years. I have no friends irl (tbf I do have a few online friends). I feel like I'm slowly losing control of myself. This isn't for a lack of trying though. When I got out of residential last year, I started going to meetups, played rec sports, joined Discord/gaming groups, went on dates, practiced my skills, went on hikes, joined a gym, picked up an instrument, trained to be a volunteer, joined support groups, and so much more. Of course, I continued to see an outpatient therapist and a psychiatrist. Yet here I am. Alone and insane.

After my recent hospitalization due to mania, my therapist has suggested that I go back into higher care, but I already know what to expect. Higher level of care no longer does anything for me other than provide structure and imprisonment. Rogers, Sheppard Pratt, or any other hospital program will regurgitate DBT (rarely RO-DBT), a little CBT, and exposure work down your throat as if it's the cure-all for everything. If you're not familiar with skills, yes, these programs can be helpful. However if you've already been through these multiple times via inpatient/residential/php/iop, it simply becomes a waste of money. Then of course there are things like TMS, ECT, and ketamine that can relieve symptoms temporarily from time to time. Unfortunately, nothing has worked for me.

So, where do I go from here? Keep trying while I see myself slowly deteriorate into an uncontrollable thing? Maybe flip back into repression mode again for things to get even worse later? I guess I'm just tired. I want to live but don't care to live if this is what I am destined for.

132,Help finding appropriate therapy/Alternatives to CBT?,"Hello All. First time poster to this sub. I’m writing in about one of my best friends (Markus) he’s in his early 20s and has anxiety, depression and BPD. We  went to the same school but I was a couple years older than him, we became friends initially through extracurriculars and because I have a similar diagnosis so we understood each other and got close very quickly. While we have a lot in common, the area we differ is how we deal with our conditions. 

I have been seeing the same therapist for almost 5 years now. She’s very easy to talk to and has helped me so much through our time together. Markus has previously tried CBT with a therapist when he was around 16/17 for 6 months and he felt as though it didn’t work for him, he says he felt judged by his therapist and found it extremely difficult to know what to talk about in sessions. 

I tried to explain to him that therapy is a long process and it took me nearly 2 years before I started knowing “how to talk” in a therapy session in a way that allowed for constructive solutions and development. I also tried to explain that it often takes going to several different therapists over the course of a few years before finding one who you like and stick with. 

Markus is extremely intelligent, he was always one of the smartest kids at school, and has even been pretty close to top of his classes while at University. He’s an incredibly capable and highly logical person, except when it comes to addressing his mental health and emotional well-being (you can blame his childhood situation for this).

He’s adamant that CBT doesn’t work for him and is not eager to try it again despite it having been a while since he last did, but I’ve known him for a very long time and I know he’s been going through a hard time recently and it’s been worrying as he has previously ended up putting himself in danger due to not addressing his emotional state. We see each other only about once a week but we text and call to catch up more often, he regularly talks about wanting to get professional help but never actually follows it through.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar I and this is important.,"The app is called [Stop, Breathe, and Think](https://www.stopbreathethink.com) and anyone who struggles with emotion regulation can benefit from it. He showed me through the app, first you choose how you’re feeling physically, then mentally, then you can sort and pick through specific emotions to really gauge how you feel for that moment. You can check in at any time. Further, once you’ve entered all of your feelings, it will suggest mindful practices to correct or balance your mood such as timed meditation or walks, etc, based on how you’re feeling. Over time, it will create an algorithm and you can then see if cycles are present in your mood if you haven’t seen them already. This also helps you scout out triggers or anything that is emotionally distressing that you can avoid in the future, if possible. 

As someone with incredibly extreme ups and downs and a really hard practicing reality acceptance, I need to view the cycles on a chart to confirm with myself that it is actually happening.

Also after 2 sessions with my therapist for CBT, I was discharged because they did not believe they could help me out and that someone would be in touch with me to assess me for a personality disorder. 

I’ve been waiting to hear from someone to assess me but heard nothing. I checked my health records on the NHS app and saw 2 letters saying that they will not assess me because they don’t believe i fit the criteria but I do and don’t know why they would say that.

But i’m not, i just go through extreme mood swings daily and don’t know how to explain it to them and for them to take me seriously. 

I’ve been crying non stop from hearing this and just feel like all the abuse i’ve been through (and still going through) has been for nothing because now i’m not getting any therapy or treatment. All i’ve been advised to do is to stick with antidepressants but that alone isn’t helping me heal from all the trauma and abuse i’ve been through in my life. I also hate taking medication but they’ve told me that i have to take them and should not stop taking them.

Should i ask them to review me again and if i can directly speak to the person in charge of the personality disorder team?

138,What types of therapy work best for bipolar spectrum disorders?,"The treatment of bipolar spectrum disorders typically involves a combination of different approaches, including medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle adjustments. There is no single best therapy for bipolar disorder, as treatment plans should be tailored to individual needs and preferences. However, several types of therapy have been found to be effective in managing bipolar symptoms and promoting overall well-being. Here are some commonly utilized therapies:  
  
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to mood instability. It focuses on developing coping strategies, problem-solving skills, and relapse prevention techniques.  
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): DBT combines elements of CBT with mindfulness practices. It helps individuals regulate intense emotions, improve interpersonal relationships, and develop effective coping mechanisms for managing distress.  
Family-Focused Therapy (FFT): FFT involves the individual with bipolar disorder and their family members. It aims to improve communication, reduce family conflict, and educate family members about the disorder. This therapy can help create a supportive and stable environment.  
Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT): IPSRT focuses on stabilizing daily routines and sleep patterns, as disruptions in these areas can trigger mood episodes. It also addresses interpersonal issues and aims to improve social functioning.  
Psychoeducation: This involves providing education and information about bipolar disorder, including its symptoms, triggers, and treatment options. Psychoeducation helps individuals and their families better understand the condition and actively participate in managing it.  
It's important to note that medication management plays a crucial role in treating bipolar spectrum disorders, and therapy is often used in conjunction with medication. Collaborating with a qualified mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, can help determine the most suitable therapy approach based on individual needs and preferences.",1684234036.0,False,1,0,Sam_Bhandary,None,13j1ox0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/13j1ox0/what_types_of_therapy_work_best_for_bipolar/

I was diagnosed 8-9 years ago, later in life (29). I did DBT. I did therapy multiple times until each time I was discharged for being too well. I haven’t had a therapist since late 2019.

My life has crumbled slowly, I am now at personal rock bottom. I’ve destroyed all family relationships, countless friendships. 

Last night I took my last shreds of dignity and presented to the emergency department for help. I was discharged this morning due to my poor attitude. 

Please help me. Someone, please help me find an avenue to get better because I do not see any way that my life can improve or how I can get back things that I have lost. 

If I had the guts to end the suffering for everybody’s sake I would, but unfortunately I am weak. So I guess that’s why I am here asking for help.

140,A question for those suffering,"For those of you like me, who are living with trauma and chronic depression: what is your motivation to keep moving, keep living?

I’ve been through homelessness, lived in an attic and a garage, and I currently have a lovely wife and two dogs but I feel so sick that I don’t want to live right now… and I’ve been through years of therapy, including CBT and DBT. 

I feel like a complete asshole because I know this was all triggered by a stupid doctor appointment, and I’m a grown ass man that shouldn’t be suicidal over feelings of embarrassment but something broke, something got brought up from the deepest recesses of my psyche when I felt compelled to sit there and take it and I haven’t stopped feeling nauseous since.

My wife is sick of hearing about it and frankly she’s not a therapist and doesn’t deserve to be stuck dealing with me like this for months. She caught me hanging myself about a month ago and I’ve only not repeated the attempt because I don’t want to see her hurt like that again.

I’m sorry to rant into the void about this but I’m sitting here at work trying not to break down with my boss just the other side of my office… and I don’t think it’s going to work.

141,Feeling Invalidated by Family for Getting Help,"(29F) I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. And I’ve been seeking therapy for years, and finally have a therapist who listens and offers good insights and advice. I’m also working on finding the right medication.

Recently, my therapist and I are starting narrative therapy and DBT therapy. The narrative therapy is supposed to help me change my perception of my past so I can think more positively about the future. And the DBT is supposed to help me regulate my emotions.

But my mom, who lost years parenting me the way she wanted due to illness, is against them 100%. She’s also protective of me because I also have several medical issues. 

She doesn’t see the point in either of them because I shouldn’t focus on the past and I haven’t had that many emotional outbursts. But actually, I’ve had breakdowns almost every night for months. So I feel like I need it.

I explained clearly why I think they’d be helpful, but she’s still upset that I’m going to another person with my feelings and not her. But I know trying to express my feelings to my mom is virtually impossible because she has so much going on medically she can’t take it. 

I am so concerned is that while I’m handicapped, I’m also an adult…who happens to be her at-home caregiver. So I can’t just ignore her. We can’t get help and my dad works all the time to make ends meet. And I’ve been unemployed all year, but am hopefully going to get accepted by an agency that should help me find work as a handicapped person. So I can’t move out for a while.

The only reason why I started telling my mom about my therapy sessions is because my therapist wants to go into the early years with my narrative therapy. And I don’t exactly remember what happened when I was a baby/toddler. So I had to go to her and my dad for details.

Now she’s mad at me because she feels like I’ll forget about her by going to someone else. And she still sees me as a child rather than a grown adult. 

I told her I’m old enough to make my own decisions, and that not all of them should have to please her. But she threw a guilt trip from an incident that happened between her and her mom. 

I’ve always been a people pleaser, but now I’m just angry and don’t know what to do or how to feel better about this.",1700494559.0,False,2,0,Orchidlove456,None,17zr7c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17zr7c7/feeling_invalidated_by_family_for_getting_help/

(sorry for bad english, it's not my first language) 

Like the topic name suggests it.  Im starting anafranil in a few days.

A little background on me: i was siagnosed wigh bpd ptsd and ocd some years ago.

Ive been taking anxiety meds (themesta)  for over 10 years..  Ive been into mental health clinics 2 times for 2 months and one time 1 week.  Ive done normal day therapy and DBT.  I had my share of bad docs..some tried to take advantage of me.. Some just filled me up with pills..

At my 'highest' i took
150 venlafaxine
400 seroquel xr (600 when needed)
20 seroxat
200 seroquel ir
1 trazolone
Alprazolam
Dipiperon

Now i just take
200 seroqurl xr (600 if needed)
20 seroxat
Alprazolam

The meds didnt work.. Never have in 4 years..  Ive been though bad childhood trauma.. Lost my child.. Life has been a rolercoaster...

Dbt did help a little bit.. My bpd waves have slowed down and made room for long episodes of depression but now my ocd is having a party..

So they are reducing my seroxat to 10 a day..  200 seroquel xr.. And then sloweling stating with anafranil    and seroquel xr.. With bloodwork check ups. Atm withdrawl is okay.. Just angry.. Im so angry and tired

I am sacred..  They are running out of meds.. Paranoia is high.. Meds make me numb outside but inside i scream.. 😔

I am looking into emdr therapy but next month they are taking out part of my uterus (like life hasnt been hard enough)  so planning therapy is hard now.

150,Teen has inappropriate sexual urges,"My teenager (ftm, 16 last year) came to us with invasive sexual thoughts about their siblings and other people last year.  We immediately started seeking help beyond what he was already getting (we are in family therapy, intensive DBT, and he is in individual therapy and sees a psychiatrist for Oppositional Defiance Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, OCD and compulsive lying).  

Most of the clinicians kept saying ""it will be okay as long as they're just thoughts"" but understood our fears and helped try to treat the thoughts and other issues.  But we still pressed for more help, but nobody really seemed to know how to help us, which is fair, I am sure this is not a majorly common thing.  We have been pretty stressed and sad and afraid, of course.

Yesterday our son came to us and said it's gone beyond thoughts to wanting to act, and we called CPS, several emergency shelters, his therapist and his psychiatrist.  Psychiatrist did not answer and has not returned our calls, and CPS referred us to the shelters, who said they could not help.  So upon our therapist's recommendation, we took our son to the behavioral emergency room, where the doctors there seemed confused about what we wanted.  They said they could hold him until we found residential treatment, but that can take up to six months.  He said there are often cases where kids stay here six months, even a year, because they can't go home and there's nowhere else to go.  He indicated that the wait list for residential is long and  you often have to go through a lot of other options to show need.

&#x200B;

We have no family.  We don't want our child languishing in an emergency room for months, but nobody seems to have answers or solutions.  How is this possible?  How can this be the state of things?  

&#x200B;

And before anyone says ""this is above Reddit's pay grade"", that is such a thoughtless thing I see posted here a lot.  I would assume that Reddit was for others, like it is for me, a last ditch effort.  We have exhausted every resource we know of.  The reason people come places like this for such serious advice is because they are lost, overwhelmed, or  have tried everything, and you would be surprised how often a nugget found here can lead to change- someone may know of a treatment, a specialist, a program, a home, someone may have gone through this themselves and can offer support- as you can probably guess, searching for any sort of support group was chaotic- I got results that were bothersome, and few people seem to be able or willing to discuss this openly, which will just make it harder for others to seek help.

158,What treatment options are there when nothing I try seems to work?,"**TL;DR** I've am autistic and have tried different medications and therapies and nothing has worked. I'm struggling a lot and don't know what to do or where to turn to. What options do I have? 

I've struggled with my mental health for most of my life. I'm turning 20 this year and it feels useless to continue trying to get better when nothing seems to be working. I am diagnosed with ASD and suspect a lot of my mental health struggles are due to the autism but I am also ""high-functioning"" (choosing to use that term because I don't find 'low support needs' to properly describe my situation) which means I don't have access to any care specific to my autism. I have learnt to cope with my struggles as I went undiagnosed up until I was around 15 years old (even though it was heavily suspected all throughout my childhood). I have been on multiple different medications (SSRIs, SNRI, mood stabiliser) with no effect. I am currently not taking any psych meds, most recently came off Venlafaxine since it only caused excessive sweating and did nothing for my mental health. 

I've done different therapies, DBT, CBT, ERGT, and just talking to someone once every week/two weeks. I'm about to end my current therapy contact and will just be on my own after that. We have two more sessions planned until I'm sent away into the dark on my own. I don't think I can handle that though and I don't know how to bring it up with my provider because ERGT didn't give me anything and I'm still doing just as bad (if not worse). I don't want to just do talk therapy again like I have for so many years because it doesn't give me anything but I can't manage all on my own. I need to get better but I don't know what I can try because it feels like I've done it all. 

I'm currently clean from self harm and my restrictive eating disorder is calm **but** I'm not well internally. I'm not showing it physically through these harmful behaviours which means they [the healthcare system] don't see a reason to treat me even if I'm miserable. They only treat the symptoms, not the problem. If I'm not actively hurting myself they won't do anything, so as long as I'm able to handle my impulses I'm ""cured"" to them. I can't live like this though, it's only a matter of time before I relapse or try to take my life again because I can't manage the urges and impulses. All my energy goes towards distracting myself which makes living life *extremely* hard. My school work is suffering and work exhausts me so much I'm unable to work multiple days in a row. Lately I've had a lot of close calls where I almost gave in and it's getting harder and harder to not give in each time. 

I'm at a point where I'm seriously considering self medicating because I feel so hopeless and out of options. I don't want to go that route though, it can jeopardise my career and relationships. 

I also really give everything a fair chance, I don't just give up on stuff because it doesn't show results right away. I have taken each medication I've tried for at least 6 months (most of them multiple years) before giving up on it. For therapy I always put in the work and follow through with the whole program. I only stopped DBT early and it was because it made me so suicidal to do group sessions. Even when I feel like giving up I remind myself to give it an honest try and push through trying to be positive. So it's not like I'm not seeing progress because I'm not fully giving everything a chance. 

I also want to add that I am limited in what support I am able to access as I'm in a country with 'universal healthcare' and I don't have private healthcare insurance. But if there is some form of treatment that is highly likely to actually work I would be willing to put money towards it but I'm unable to try a bunch of maybes out with a private provider.

159,"It got better, holy sh*t","I apologize in advance if this isn't the type of thing posted on here.I just thought this may be a useful place to post this on.

To give you some back story, I was raised in a very abusive home and was sexually abused for a little over a year when I was 16. I was diagnosed with traits of BPD, bipolar 1, ptsd, and an anxiety disorder. I am 20 now. I've struggled intensely for my entire life, dropping out of school, quitting jobs due to mental breakdowns, but over the past couple of years I began trying CBT and DBT therapy and this is my life now.

So what’s been going on with me? Life has gotten easier to live. That’s quite the statement, isn’t it? I don’t entirely know what to do with this newfound ease. School, work, exercise, chores, and homework are a thing again. There isn’t a word to describe how magical this is. I’m setting and staying firm on boundaries and am in a relationship with the absolute love of my life. Things got better. Wow… It feels so deeply unusual to say that. Sure, I’m still struggling, but it seems as though I’ve exchanged or retired my debilitating worries for more beneficial worries.

Being away from family has been the most profitable factor in this whole healing thing, also getting a job holy shit, and group therapy. All of these components are really quite the recipe. There have been no mental breakdowns within the past three weeks. Like, holy shit! That’s huge! I can slowly notice myself comprehending information in healthier ways as opposed to the habitual toxic default. A weird byproduct of this is it’s gotten easier to sing. I can genuinely feel and hear the ring of passion in my voice.

I was looking through my old, angsty, journals and thought it would be valuable to document this feeling and state of mind, as a majority of my writing is just a display of my suffering. My god, it feels like I can breathe again. I can watch movies or listen to music again, and actually digest and remember what I’ve just seen or heard. Life isn’t as faint and blurry and hazy as it was before. Colors seem distinct and lively. Noises sound unique again. And every breath doesn’t feel like it could be my last anymore.

And I’m in love! Super, proper, love. Loving fucking passionate, feverish, hilarious, disgusting, love. I’m with my best friend and he is truly the definition of what it means to be a genuine person. I could write 20 novels in a series about my appreciation and absolute adoration for this stupid, lovely, guy.

There’s much more detail and nuances that are happening in my world right now that I’d love to focus and expand upon later, but I had to give a brief summary and capture the glow and gratitude I’m feeling in this moment. It feels good to be back.

The reason I'm posting this, and disclaimer this will be very cheesy so get a napkin, I did not think my life would get better. I've had multiple suicide attempts, in and out of psychiatric wards, and I felt as though there was no such *thing* as getting better. When you live a certain way for so long it's natural to theorize that this may be it for you right? I was under this belief that I was treatment resistant, immune to getting better, but, and I can't believe I'm saying this, it does get better. With baby steps, albeit, and a horribly frustrating amount of patience, it does get better.

160,My doctor said I can’t take fluoxetine every other day but I’ve read studies that say otherwise.,"So I was on fluoxetine 20mg for 2 years from March 2020, and I wanted to try and come off it because it’s been 2 years.

I read up on how there are studies that say you can take fluoxetine once every 3 days and this can help, but I won’t feel as bad about being on it because it’ll be less and then maybe I can try and practice the DBT skills learnt, with a bit of support mentally but not every day.

161,How BPD can become a superpower once you’ve treated it successfully,"

Hi all. 

I’m a former BPD. Diagnosed with BPD traits at 15, and then the full diagnosis the second I was legally an adult at 18. 

Now I’m a therapist that works with BPD. 

So let’s start with the downsides, okay?
This is the most deadly psychiatric disorder you can be diagnosed with. 70% of BPDs try to kill themselves at least once. 10% end up finding success in completing suicide eventually. In male and female prison populations, prevalence for this disease are up to 48%. 

Basically, without treatment (DBT specifically), the paths for people with this disease are either suicide or doing some fucked shit to land you incarcerated for life. 

Now let’s move to the positives.. 

Once you are able to emotionally regulate and act appropriately in situations (acting vs. reacting to things constantly), this condition is actually a gift. You’re wired differently, and there are advantages that come with that. 

Let’s talk about Cluster B. Within Cluster B, you have your sociopaths, your borderlines, and your narcissists. Essentially, when you have one Cluster B diagnosis, you bleed over into the other diagnoses in the clusters. That’s why they’re all clustered together; there are so many similarities. 

Regardless of being diagnostic or not, you’ll always be wired a little different, right? 

So let’s talk about the crossovers in Cluster B. Sociopaths understand emotions on a cognitive level. They’re able to size people up and see their weak spots, what makes them vulnerable. They’re quite intoxicating people, with lots of charisma and charm. That’s often how they’re able to abuse people and make others do what they want. 

Borderlines, on the other hand, not only understand emotions cognitively, but they understand them personally and emotionally. Because of this, you also naturally have more empathy than the average person. You truly are able to put yourself in someone else’s shoes emotionally.  If you are BPD, you naturally have what is referred to in therapy as a “higher emotional range”. What that means is, you’ve experienced more emotions and more depth of emotions than the average person. 

You’ve felt sad? We’ve felt despair. 
You’ve felt happy? We’ve felt euphoria. 
And it goes on and on. 

BPD is driven by trauma and the fear of real or perceived abandonment. In the ways that sociopaths can size someone up for their weak points, BPDs actually have incredible gifts for seeing where someone has not had their emotional needs met. Why? Because the entire BPD experience is never having your emotional needs met. So many *untreated* BPDs that are still driven by this insatiable need to avoid abandonment borrow that sociopathic intoxicating charm and charisma, quickly size up where your emotional gaps are, and in order to avoid abandonment, they become the person to fill those emotional needs for someone so they don’t get left behind by them. 

Just how skilled are borderlines at seeing the emotional needs of others? It’s kinda scary, but fascinating. There was a study done where all these different mentally ill groups and neurotypicals were shown just pictures of people’s eyes, and asked to then guess the emotion that’s being experienced by that person. OVERWHELMINGLY, the borderlines were most accurately able to correctly guess the individuals emotions just solely by seeing a picture of their eyes. Here is that study, by the way: 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427787/

My point in writing all of this is that I know this disease is hard. Like I said, deadliest one you can be diagnosed with. 

I want to write this to encourage you to find healing, to do the DBT skills training in combination with individual therapy, because you will find that once you are no longer constantly on the edge of suicidal cliffs, you inherently have a LOT of gifts in being wired this way. 

Trust me, I know how stigmatized this disease is…

But once you’ve treated it, gotten it under control, learned how to emotionally regulate, learned how to stop being self destructive, you’ll find that you are actually somewhat super human. It’s not fair that we have had to suffer with this. But I’m here telling you, from the other side of healing, work like hell to get there, and you will discover that this is actually a blessing.

165,Being afraid of starting therapy. (Open discussion),"Starting therapy can be scary,  because then you have to talk about your problems and things that might be triggering.

It’s normal feeling this way, there is nothing to be ashamed of and it can really be difficult.

The thing that people  that struggle with mental health need to remember is that reaching out for help doesn’t mean being weak or anything like that.

There is nothing to be ashamed of.

Therapy can really be a life changing experience, and the question is

**was is the worse thing that can happen?**

Not also this but remember that you can always change therapist if you don’t like your current one, if you had a bad experience with a therapist it doesn’t mean that all of them are the same.

Find also what kind of therapy works for you, like if you want to focus on trauma there is specific therapist that can help you to work on your traumas.

Then there is _DBT therapy_ that is different.

DBT may be used to treat suicidal and other self-destructive behaviors. It teaches patients skills to cope with, and change, unhealthy behaviors.

So they are a lot of options, never be afraid of asking for help and sometimes the only thing that you can do is trow yourself out there and just do it.

171,I need advice/support,"Lately I have been having a really hard time. About a year and a half ago I got out of a really abusive residential program I got sent to because my parents didn’t want me anymore. Long story short, that program messed me up. I had childhood trauma that had already messed me up but that program really was the cherry on top. I’ve never gotten to process what happened there. My current therapist doesn’t think talking about the past is relavent and he’s a dbt therapist and I don’t agree with dbt especially not for my trauma. There are things I need to process but I’m too afraid to tell him that. I stay very cold to him because I tend to get attached to therapists but unfortunately I don’t think it worked because every time I think of switching therapists, I can’t follow through. He’s not helping me. But I am reaching the end of my rope. I lost my job and I haven’t been able to find another. I’ve applied to 30-40 jobs already and most of them are fake listings. I’ve started having panic attacks that are sending me to the er. My therapist the other day told me that I’m doing better than ever and I am doing worse than I ever have while working with him. Yesterday, I found my old stash of blades on accident. I ignored it but today coincidentally one of my glass candles broke. I sound crazy but I think the universe is just telling me to give up. I got clean and I committed to trying to live when I got a job and tried to pull myself up by the boot straps when I got out of that place.

I could go on but the point is I am realizing that I need help but I don’t know how to tell that to my therapist. He always assumes im fine.

Today I am not sleeping all night, took a week dose of my antidepressants, my date blocked me and my friends stopped talking to me. 

Have you ever got into a stressful/anxious conversation and it starts a rage within yourself so violent that you cannot control and felt like you could only kill yourself to make it stop? That's what happened to me the day before yesterday. When I was feeling insecure, he seemed off through his text, and I felt so bad but too afraid to ask him whats wrong, texted him in panic, ended up passed out on the pills I took because the feelings would just not went away, and ended up feeling ashamed, humiliated and disgusted with myself the morning after. 

I was so ashamed of facing him, that I broke up with him on a long rage-filled messages, and he just blocked me. I went on attacking my friends as well and they also stopped talking to me. Everyone just deeply hurt, but also I cannot bear to do anything other than some pathetic  apology texts because I'm still so hurt and it still wont go away. 

I am fully aware that from my bf's and my friends POV I'm a textbook narcissistic bitch, but if I AM that way then why does it hurt so much? Why did I have to wreck every relationship in my life because a simple cold message can set me off to the point of wanting to kill myself?

I wish it's just easy as I am a bitch with no sense of boundary and trust issues, but they won't understand that before I put it on them, I went through 8 hours of contemplating if I should text him to ask him whats wrong, decided against it, tried medication, meditate, playing piano while cannot stop sobbing, and ended up almost ODed with the pills just because my normal dose could not put me to sleep and I am so afraid and angry and terrified?

177,Mental health is waying,"So, back in March I checked myself back into a partial hospital program after loosing my job on January 1st. I was cycling rapidly between being manic and hypo-depressed. While I was there my case worker suggested I try DBT therapy instead of going back to traditional CBT. I was referred to one of their therapists and also assigned a new psychiatrist to manage my meds.

Once I had a slight med change and started seeing the new therapist for individual sessions, things got better for me. What I didn't know initially was that with DBT programs, you usually meet your therapist for individual sessions as well as a group therapy session once a week. I'm bipolar and also a workaholic so I was picking up hours and doing everything my boss asked me to (mostly because I felt lucky to have a new job and be employed during some of the worst bits of COVID) so I missed a group session here and there.

My therapist broke it down for me that if I wanted to stay in the DBT program I would need to start attending group more regularly otherwise she would have to dismiss me from the program. My boss then basically said screw you, I need a doctors note or else I can't excuse you from work. Eventually I got a note that said I wasn't allowed to work more than five days a week and I was only allowed to work 28 hours per week (I had been working between 50 and 65 hours spread over 7 days).

So now I have a new job (again) and my therapist is threatening to kick me out again because I was hired in as a full time employee who works rotating weekends. I asked work if we could adjust my weekend schedule to accommodate for something that I am required to attend and they quickly shut that down. I tried to explain to my therapist that I can't make it to group for a while because I am a new employee and even though I'm working on boundaries, I can't change my schedule. And she thinks thats a load of BS.

So what am I supposed to do? I could tell work that I have to go down to 32 hours a week, but I might loose benefits if I do... but if I don't ill probably be kicked out of this program before the year is out. And like to make matters worse, both sides are trying to invalidate each other - which is driving me mad. Yes, I DO need to be working because nothing in this world is free... and Yes, I DO need DBT therapy because I don't want to check myself into a hospital again for the fourth time in four years and DBT is literally saving my life.

I can't start a normal conversation irl with anyone about the slightest personal issue without tearing up which leads to crying when called out. I can't comfort anyone without also bursting into tears, hell just recently I embarrassed myself in front of my DENTIST; I got an appointment to fill a hole in my tooth but wanted to mention to my dentist about how terrified I am of needles (they cause me to shake uncontrollably which is really bad when you want to not mess up the anesthetic)
As soon as I start taking about it, my eyes start to water. I end up fighting against full blown crying in the dentist office and became extremely frustrated and embarrassed about it. I am 20+ for christ sake, why do I cry this easily?! I hate it do much. Is there anything I can do to make it stop or at least a good way to stop the crying as soon as the prickle of tears arrive?",1650401084.0,False,1,3,Ill-Lengthiness-5751,None,u7f1sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/u7f1sl/crying_way_too_easily_possible_remedies/
183,How to support my boyfriend (31M) struggling with long term therapy and hopelessness,"My boyfriend (31M) has been undergoing DBT therapy for nearly a decade for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). He's been on a journey to improve his mental health, and is to the point now where he actually no longer fits the symptoms required to be diagnosed with BPD - this is a huge milestone - but he still constantly battles with feelings of hopelessness, feeling ""trapped"", and self-doubt. It's gotten to the point where he feels like he's factually more of a lost cause than most people, despite his efforts. He says he's felt this way for a while.

Lately, he's been expressing how he's struggling to see a way forward. He feels like he can't continue living this way because of how it affects those around him and has urges to push people away because of this. What's more, he's convinced that because he's been in therapy for so long, he's exhausted nearly every approach and avenue. When people suggest that he might be catastrophizing, he feels invalidated, as if they're implying he hasn't been trying hard enough – even though he's tried numerous approaches over the course of many years. I can say that I believe him, and I can see how hard he tries every day.

As someone who cares deeply about him, I find myself grappling with my own sense of helplessness. I want to be there for him and provide meaningful support, but it feels like I've run out of things to say. Offering suggestions that he's already tried over and over seems redundant and unhelpful. Additionally, the well-intentioned phrase ""it gets better"" comes across as belittling to him, further deepening his frustration.

He's currently taking antidepressants, and has been on various other medications throughout the years. He has a new therapist lined up, and has seen many before this over the years. He firmly believes that his situation is not a result of catastrophizing or lack of effort; instead, he's convinced that he's genuinely stuck without options. He feels that people tend to disengage when he talks about it because they can't fathom what it's like to run out of choices. He has expressed that this ongoing battle and years of effort he's spent trying to little avail has led him to loneliness. He's even come to terms with the idea that he might need to simply learn to cope with it and there is no way to actually fix this, after a mental health professional seemingly affirmed this notion a few years back.

What does one do when one feels like you've truly given your all, tried countless options multiple times, and yet is still facing a seemingly insurmountable struggle? How do you keep hope alive when the path forward seems to have no clear direction? I want to be there for my boyfriend, offering support that truly resonates, but I'm at a loss for what I can do or say. It feels like anything I can think of saying gets countered by him pointing out that I'm suggesting something he's tried countless times before, I'm invalidating how he feels, or I'm out of options because that's the reality of the situation for him.

I'd be extremely grateful for any advice, suggestions, or personal experiences you're willing to share. Your insights could make a real difference, not only for me but for him as well. 

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend, after nearly a decade of DBT therapy and various treatments, feels trapped in his struggles and believes he's exhausted all options. He's facing loneliness and hopelessness. I'm also struggling with feeling like I can't provide meaningful help, as I keep suggesting things he's tried or offering clichéd reassurances and I don't want to validate the idea that there's no way to get better.",1692845183.0,False,2,3,JeJappe,None,15zp8cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15zp8cf/how_to_support_my_boyfriend_31m_struggling_with/

I go out and meet people but none of them I consider friends. All my hobbies are single person activities because I have noone to do anything with. People keep gaslighting me into believing im a “nice guy” even though I don’t pretend to be a nice person at all and I got no alternative motive. Ive been going to therapy for 2 years and taken anti depressants and DBT and group therapy and all that shit and my social life hasnt gotten any better. I stopped going to the gym. I spent all my money on impulsive guitar purchases. People on reddit keep arguing with me which is hilarious because when I respond defensively its always me whos the issue not the person antagonizing me. My dating life is utter dog shit. I had a few “online girlfriends” that used me for money and I caused my BPD to be worse by associating with them. I seriously don’t think my life will get any better. Im not a lazy fuck either I actually tried to go in remission with my BPD but every day I get suicidal thoughts and I feel like people are taking advantage of me and like life is pointless. I don’t think anyone out there can be friends with me even though unlike a lot of assholes out there, I don’t argue or fight with anyone and I keep all my problems to myself. Im really a punching bag for other people. Inside I do have strong opinions on certain people in my life but I don’t let them know because theres no point in starting fights.

A bit part of me would rather nap. 😰 I have sleep problems/insomnia, I have all of this muscle tension after work, I have CPTSD and a severe eating disorder.

I'm not suicidal, I still want to get better. I'm just SO stuck. I've tried so many things: neurofeedback, started some small guided psilocybin-assisted therapy and integration sessions this past year, EMDR in the past, inpatient treatment for eating disorder and trauma 12 years ago, CBD, some DBT, group therapy, some psychodrama in treatment, some martial arts in treatment (a self-defense class), some somatic therapy and a lot more.

We spend entire sessions talking about the most superficial boring stuff, or she'll get hyper fixated on one topic, get super deep into it, but not actually address any of the issues. I just feel bad after sessions now because she asks questions that bring up all these emotions but never addresses them. She also talks a lot, telling me things I already know, or just stuff about her life and her daughter, which is nice but if I'm being completely honest, I want her to help me with my issues, not tell me she has the same ones as me. It's just beyond frustrating to feel like I have to keep her on topic as well as myself, because I can barely stay on track as is. She is a human being, so maybe I'm being too critical, but I really don't know what to do.

189,i don't know what to do anymore,"I (F21) have been struggling with my mental health since I was 12 years old. I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts at 13, and put in residential for an eating disorder last year. I'm severely depressed and I'm pretty sure I have BPD (one of my old psychologists diagnosed me with it, my current psychologist says i have 'borderline traits') or at LEAST something else because I don't think this is just depression, but maybe it is and it's just really debilitating, I don't know.

I have been on 5 different medications, probably getting put on new ones next week. I have gone through DBT, CBT, and traditional talk therapy and nothing has helped. I have periods where I feel okay (sometimes for months on end), but I'm still at a baseline of moderate depression during those times. I don't know what else to do, it feels like I've tried everything even though I know that's not true. I'm genuinely desperate to get better because if I don't, I think I'm going to end up dead. I used to be very empathetic and caring but depression has made me so hateful towards myself and I don't have the energy to have empathy anymore.  I made an alt account to post this because I'm honestly ashamed.

Nobody knows how to help me. I think not even my psychologist knows how to help me anymore. I keep getting more and more destructive and it's affecting my grades and general functioning in college because I can't focus in general.  I call crisis lines, the suicide hotline, etc. and none of it helps. I have used every resource available to me and I'm not getting better.

191,On depression - options exhausted,"I’m diagnosed with treatment resistant, atypical depression. It manifests itself in acute social anxiety, pessimism, self-hatred, exhaustion, and despair about the world’s and my future. In the past ten years, I have tried:

- 8 long term therapists, including those who work with CBT, DBT, EMDR, groups, Somatic healing, and Buddhist koans
- medications such as Prozac, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Lamictal, two MAOinhibitors at high doses, some adhd related meds, and more
- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (three rounds)
- Mindfulness, Zen, guided, group, and Transcendental meditation
- exposure therapy in the hopes that I gradually feel more comfortable around large groups of strangers
- blood tests for possible thyroid problems
- diet and exercise regimen in a vain attempt to transform into more of an upbeat go-getter
- journaling
- Landmark forum
- psychics and astrologers
- people’s advice to “just relax, be happy, go easy on yourself, might as well enjoy the only life you get”

None of it has helped. At least not for more than a week or two. And every time I look for articles on struggling to find something effective , they go over the list I just made. The only other things I’ve heard of are ECT and psilocybin trials. The latter are not an option until I wean myself off my MAOinhibitor (Nardil), and my attempts have been quite painful. That’s my history with antidepressants: if they’re effective for a little while, that will pass and their only noticeable effect will be anguish if you forget to take them. My doctor doesn’t want to go for ECT and just assumes that it’ll all work out because of the time 4 years ago when Nardil initially made a difference.

195,"In between insurances, coping mechanisms & advice pls","Let me know if there’s another subreddit that would be better for this & sorry for the throwaway account!
Posting this as I’m in between insurances so can’t afford therapy at the moment & looking for some relief. Not looking to self diagnose, just mainly for some advice from anyone else who goes through this or coping mechanisms. 
I’ve recently gotten out of a codependent toxic 4 year relationship that I’m working through the trauma from. This has also brought up childhood trauma in the process. I’m basically trying to figure out why I am the way I am. 
I have about 4 main moods that are extreme throughout the day. They interchange at any moment:
-Feeling extremely happy, love life, very optimistic about my situation and the future. 
-Feeling depressed, hopeless, wondering what the point in anything is, I’ve been suicidal before but never acted on it. 
-Feeling ‘normal’ no particular things stand out. This is probably the time I feel the most disassociated during 
-Being pissed tf off- little things can me mad (things not going how I planned, etc) but sometimes is absolutely the smallest things that I shouldn’t be mad about and i often disassociate and lash out. 
These ‘mood swings’ can happen randomly or things can trigger it. Things that happen in my day to day life or things I think about can trigger them. 
I know these seem like normal emotions but to me they’re extreme and I have no control over them. Once I get in them it’s very hard to snap out of it. 
I also have constant disassociation that I have no control of. It effects my day to day life and interactions with other. 
For example: at the grocery store I can’t even focus on why I came and I just find myself roaming sometimes before I figure out the groove. 
During normal conversations I often disassociate & it makes me feel like shit because I can’t focus on what people are saying. I have terrible long term and short term memory. 
Sometimes the disassociation will be at a regular level. Or when I get very triggered by something specific it’ll come on sudden & strong and result in a panic attack. 

Looking back I feel like I’ve always been like this to an extent but I feel like it’s getting worse. My ex used to tell me I had mood swings and things but I think it was manageable (or it could’ve been just as bad and I wasn’t self aware then). I started to notice the disassociation about 2 years ago.
I’ve resorted to posting on here because I’ve become aware that it’s affecting my daily life and my ability to live normally and have normal relationships. 
As far as relationships go, I’m very untrusting and suspicious. I’m in a new relationship right now and can just feel myself pushing them away so I don’t end up getting hurt. I don’t want them to feel like they have to walk on eggshells around me. 
 It’s hard for me to decipher between reality and the trauma I’ve had. I feel like I read way too far into things they say or do and end up over thinking. Sometimes when they say/do something I completely twist it to have some negative intent.  

While I’m waiting for my insurance to work out for therapy I’m looking for coping mechanisms. I’ve been smoking weed a lot lately which I don’t particularly like but I feel like being numb is better than the drastic mood changes I get throughout the day. That way I also don’t end up lashing out at people or being too dramatic. I’m so tired of getting in these shit moods and having to explain to people you don’t know why you feel like this.  All I want to do is just be normal. I try to keep a positive mindset, I’m into spirituality a lot and that helps tremendously.

Kicked out at 15 - my other medical problems cost too much.

45 now.  Diagnosed with bipolar, DBT, PTSD, ADHD, insomnia.  Insomnia rules my life, I take Belsomra, Ambien, Seroquel for a CHANCE to fall asleep.  I take Prazosin for nightmares.  Lithium and Seroquel for the mental issues. I’ve had TPMS, it didn’t help me.

I used to lose my shit once every 3 or 4 months.  By “lose my shit” I mean I lose my temper, go into psychosis, and destroy everything I can around me - physical and emotional.  I’m an asshole in every sense of the word.

My mom - the primary abandoner - died in 2019.  The shit in my head exploded, accelerated.  I’m losing my shit every month or more.  I am trying to do better but everything I do makes everything worse.

Psych wants me to see a therapist.  First problem:  I won’t talk to a man.  Thanks, I’ve had enough unwanted dicks in my mouth.

Therapists who are women are okay but 1) because of COVID there’s a wait list of 6 to 8 months.  2) I don’t trust the system because of the past and abuse, so I am afraid to be honest as to my thoughts.  “Health and well being” as defined by me doesn’t match up to what they think.

Specifically, ECT.  You can say what you want, you can extoll it’s virtues, I’m not arguing against ECT in general.  BUT I DON’T WANT IT DONE TO ME.  My grandmother had it done, it destroyed her and all her creativity.  It screwed with a friend of mine’s head so bad she killed herself.  I don’t care how much “better” it has gotten.

As soon as you go into the system you lose control.  ECT where I am only requires 1 signature as it being necessary and boom, you have no say or recourse.

So how do I get help from a system where ECT is constantly mentioned to me but I don’t want it done?  As long as I’m not in the hospital I have the right to choose, I maintain my “adult” status.

If I see a therapist and lose control and she throws me in… the best way for me to avoid this situation is to avoid “mental health professionals.”

I’ve tried to teach myself DBT.  (The only school for it here is $1.5k USD a month and I cannot afford that.). Sometimes I can defuse, more often I can’t.  At least the DBT group would be more accustomed to violence, not as quick to stuff me away.

I honestly don’t think I’ve gone a single day without smoking weed for the past 2 years. Honestly I use it because it helps me with my insomnia and on occasion I’ve used it as a coping mechanism or during a crisis to calm myself down.

So the past year my life has improved drastically but I still find myself coping with weed even though I’ve gone through DBT and other forms of therapy. Recently my boyfriend and I have stopped using protection. We’re not actively trying to get pregnant but we’re not trying not to either.

Basically I’ve gotten the rest of my life together except for this problem, but I want to be sober because there’s a possibility I could become pregnant in the next year. I want to find a healthier way to manage my stress. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop or been in this situation?

It’s more of a curiosity at this point, but I just want to know if I will ever have a shot at living life.

205,Advice on dealing with mental health services,"CW: Mention of self-harm and suicidal thoughts

I live in the UK and I have been having ongoing issues with my local mental health team and I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice/ any personal experience with this.

Firstly, the mental health team are refusing to formally diagnose me with BPD. Multiple GPs and mental health nurses have stated that they are very sure that I have BPD, and my current Senior Practitioner said that she couldn’t think of anything else that it could be. Their reasoning for not pushing through for a formal diagnosis, is that I am too young (I am 20 and have had symptoms for nearly 8 years now). I have asked to speak directly to a psychiatrist to discuss a diagnosis and a possible change to the medications that I am taking. My GP has sent a letter to them asking for this to happen, as they do not feel comfortable with changing my medication and they would like to seek some expert advice. The mental health team replied saying that they were not considering a formal diagnosis at this time and ignored the request for a psychiatrists input regarding my medication.

Secondly, I spoke to one of the GPs in January who referred me for DBT, he explained that it is preferable to access DBT rather than adding in more medication. After waiting and attempting to get an update on what was happening due to the pandemic, I was told that someone would be in touch. A few more months later, my case worker explained that because I was actively self-harming and had suicidal thoughts, they could not provide DBT, and so it had basically been cancelled without discussing it with me first. They have said that I need to stop self-harming and having suicidal thoughts before DBT can begin, but won’t provide much assistance in the meantime. This is particularly frustrating as through my own research I have found that the first things that are covered in DBT seem to be how to cope with self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

Thirdly, my case worker claims to understand how BPD is affecting my life but she is only discussing emotional sensitivity, and advising me to work through the workbook that she has provided. I have told her that I am getting worse and worse and that I am really struggling to cope. She said that I should work on the techniques in the workbook when I was feeling calm and just use the techniques that I am already familiar with in the mean time, but those techniques aren’t helping me get better and I just seem to be getting worse.

Finally, I feel like I am not being taken seriously. The crisis team usually tell me to call back during working hours to speak to my case worker. Liaison Psychiatry at the hospital usually just fill in a report and send that and a message to my case worker, asking them to speed up any referrals and to contact me about the support that I am requesting. This doesn’t really help me make much progress. My boyfriend has been trying to look after me for a long time now and he is struggling to do so, he called them a while ago and begged for some support for me, and I still seem to be receiving the minimum support that they can offer. 

I just feel like i’m hitting a brick wall at every turn and I wanted to know if anyone had any advice or tips on what I can do.

208,"I am strong willed, but it’s really hard.","I have a small handful of things I’ve been dealing with since the loss of my home, friends, my accustomed way of life and my Dad just a decade ago.

Now I know I have a lot of things that many people are less fortunate and I count my blessing daily, but I am without a viable outlet to vent.

I am dealing with a mild case of PTSD which was worsened further from other emotional abuse/emotional difficulties. “Severe” Anxiety which I was diagnosed with under Generalized Anxiety disorder which is accompanied with Manic Depression which has been worsening over the past decade, each high being more extreme and short lived, whole the lows being as low as we can get. 

I’ve developed a Dissociative, Depersonalization Disorder which only numbs me out when my anxiety gets to the point where I am crippled, unable to focus on what’s present and unable to reconnect for a while after it begins. It is something that is always present at this point, the only times I am not in that state are very limited.

I am on two medications, Mirtazapine help with my mood, and Methylphenid to help with my focus and attentiveness throughout the day (to actually be able to function) These medications helped me at first, around 8 months ago when I started but they seem to be losing their effectiveness, I am still easily distracted, not by external factors but by what’s going on in my head. Constantly. 

I struggle with my perception of reality to the point where I am always disconnected from what’s around me nearly entirely, I am able to complete basic tasks but most times when there’s problem solving involved I take the backseat until I am left by myself.

I am able to override most situations like the one above, but I am still 95% not with it.

I have never abused any type of drug, or struggled with alcoholism because I consider myself strong willed. I am fighting myself today though. I want to buy cigarettes and whisky, I want to find some type of drug that can help me with my anxiety but I know I won’t, I can’t bring myself to sabotage myself like that. 

I was prescribed an anti-anxiety two months ago which was only meant to help me throughout the day for one month. After taking half of them in the first three days I had to flush the rest, you have no idea how badly I wanted to abuse them, I had to let them go because they were too good.

The best part about depersonalization/derealization/dissociate disorders is that it takes you aside from yourself for the time being until those feelings go away. The issue is that these feelings come back nearly instantaneously due to overthinking and anxiety where it becomes an endless cycle until I finally get to lay back in my bed  and distract myself on my phone until I am exhausted enough to fall asleep, avoiding as much thinking as possible.

I am working out of my home province, for the floods that struck Alberta, Canada and I was distracted enough for the first week, but now it’s beginning to consume me again. 

It doesn’t matter where I am, or what I’m doing, I never feel alive, I never feel like a real being in this universe. I’m simply watching “myself” complete tasks monotonously day in and day out. 

Physical forms are changing around me constantly, but I am merely spectating from another world.

I’m in a small room with nothing but a TV, The only channel is what troubles me mentally, while my real life is simply the commercials in between.

There’s lots of things in my life that are going well and I have to look forward to, I’m very  very very fortunate in that sense. I can’t help but feeling like I have no right to feel this way, there are so many people suffering and dealing with a lot worse. 

I just started therapy again and I think that’s been helping. I’m working through my DBT skills, trying to build a life worth living, focusing on one thing at a time, noticing emotions and checking if they fit the facts, and general emotional regulation. But the frequency of my panic attacks are increasing, so are my nightmares. I’m still waking up in the morning either extremely anxious, or extremely sad and exhausted from spending the day before just getting through the day. 

I’m also trying to focus on the things in my life I can change and take steps to improve my resilience and build up a sense of accomplishment in myself.

I know that growth and strength comes from putting myself in situations that may feel uncomfortable.

213,"I take every single thing I've been told in therapy seriously, and I don't know how to disregard what therapists say. When I get conflicting advice in therapy from what I learned in therapy years ago, I can't process it.","FWIW, I've been told I have a very rigid thought process and have been diagnosed with Asperger's as a child (though it was never addressed and the diagnosis has since been dismissed numerous times). I also do not know how to form my own views and opinions based on things I'm told and things I read - everything is taken in its entirety or completely dismissed. None of my therapists have seen this as an issue and therefore I have nowhere to turn for help with it.

I've been in DBT, a residential treatment center, intensive outpatient, AA, and outpatient therapy. Because I've dealt with abusive family members completely dismissing anything a therapist told them that they didn't like, I feel like I have to take everything seriously, otherwise I'm wasting both of our time and not willing to get better. Unfortunately, I don't filter ANYTHING and that means I have to process what I heard in therapy for MONTHS. Whenever I attempt balancing what I've learned in multiple places, it doesn't work because I'm still giving ideas value that I probably should drop. 

DBT says that volunteering is a way to build positive experiences and self-image. Intensive outpatient said volunteering is a form of narcissism because we do it to feel good about ourselves, and is therefore not healthy.

Residential treatment taught me that participation by listening is a healthy boundary when you're too tired or not in a good mood. Intensive outpatient says this is selfish and if you're choosing to be in group therapy, your peers are entitled to your feedback. Outpatient therapist says some things aren't even worthy of a response in the first place.

DBT taught me how to get my needs met by setting boundaries, since most relationships with people we have issues with need to stay in our lives (bosses, parents). Residential taught me that no, you actually don't need to have those people in your life - quitting your job and cutting off your parents IS an acceptable boundary. Intensive outpatient took it a step further and said that if you don't do this, you're choosing to stay stuck.

Residential and DBT talked about how it's okay to slip up, acknowledge what you did wrong, forgive yourself, and move forward. AA equated self-forgiveness with a lack of accountability - if you slip up once, you're back at square 1.

My IOP facility in particular set me back several notches - I had only just gained a shred of self esteem at residential when a therapist (note: not MY therapist) told me I had antisocial personality disorder in group therapy and lead a psychoeducation group on how to get your needs met by ""a person like me."" I do feel like some of it was helpful, though. I wound up asking my friends if they thought I was selfish and every single one said I was either selfish or inconsiderate. Since I went there, my relationships and friendships are 10x better - but I don't know how to let go of the toxic shit I was fed there without also letting go of what's helpful.

214,How useful is therapy? What are the right expectations to have? From a BPD pov,"""To cure BPD it takes 5-10 years, but also some never get cured, some show improvements and some will go to full remission""

Just a thought experiment, when you read the quote, substitute the word BPD, and change it to any physical illness, and ask yourself whether you would ever accept that as a good enough answer. To me that says nothing, like its as vague as it gets, while covering all angles.

Im 22 and first time i had to go to therapy was in London, age 11 as social services came to my house and determined we had to have family therapy. Well lets just say the family part didn't register for my dad, as he just couldn't accept he was doing anything wrong, in fact, he was convinced no family would want me, and made it know. I went to therapy at 11 thinking i had to be fixed, and after only half a year of weekly sessions, i stopped going. I'd continue with my life have a couple months where you'd think im completely normal until inevitably i wasn't. 

This is what i did every single year till my 19th birthday. Always going to the therapist thinking im a broken watch that needs fixing, worst of all thinking someone knew how to fix it. Looking back, im surprised i didn't just give up sooner. As soon as i finished one therapy, my parents would find another, everytime telling me ""this guy is really different, hes the real deal"" and i would believe it. I guess i really had no choice but to believe it, from a young age i knew i couldn't live that sort of life. From ages 11-18 i probably saw around 9 different therapists, from private to public, ive tried psychoanalysis, EMDR, hypnotherapy, family therapy i mean you name it I've done it.

I never got the cure i was looking for, instead what i did get is a different diagnosis each time; clinical depression, something like problems with authority, social anxiety, agoraphobia, depersonalisation, de realisation. I mean fuck, they threw the whole book at me and with that the more i felt like i needed to be cured. Clearly i was all the way fucked, further proven by the fact that at 18 i still had the same issues i had at 11. Having said this, i never questioned the therapies, clearly i was doing something wrong, or so i was made to believe.

As is expected, after trying so many things while seeing 0 results what so ever, this being when i was 18, i was very much ready to just call it quits. This time i was more serious than ever, suicide was nothing new to me, but it was always in the somewhat near future. Not this time. This crisis was my lowest and toughest to that point, and if i hadn't made the following decision its very likely i wouldn't be here now. (It always fascinates me how strong our will to survive really is)

Until now, i still didn't have the diagnosis of BPD, i didn't know it existed. During this time as per usual, my parents were looking for the next best thing although this time it was different. My parents lived in spain at that point (i was living in london by myself) and they explained how there was this BPD diagnosis that really seemed to fit my problems, and that there was this amazing day hospital in Madrid that was known world wide for being extremely good. I thought to myself, might as well try it for a couple months, i aint got shit to lose anyways.

Soon after, i ended up back in Madrid and going to a day hospital which was specialised in first psychotic epsisodes, which also happened to accept BPD, due to the fact that the one in charge actually specialised in BPD. This was no joke ""95%"" success rate. Im not gonna lie the first few months went better than i could have imagined, fuck for the first time i was able to put a name to my problems, and not 10 different diagnosis. I had a therapist which clearly knew what i was talking about, which seems normal, but in my case very new. This was the first time in 10 years that i thought to myself, this is it, finally. 

I really put an effort to go every day, whenever we were given what i considered ""stupid"" shit in occupational therapy i put my ego asside, i volunteered in anything they offered. I mean shit i was giving it my all. The night before my first day i'd promised myself i would give everything i could, including making myself talk in every session, no exceptions. At first i started to see some very obvious changes, i mean shit suddenly i didn't feel different, judged, misunderstood. We would have group therapies twice a week, and suddenly i realised my problems arent just mine, and turns out people have had it even worse. I guess you could call this the honeymoon period, and very useful at that, everyday that passed the closer i saw an end line (which to me was crazy, as for 10 years i couldn't see past the next day), i was gaining so much insight, the anger i felt towards my parents was getting smaller thanks to venting during therapies. I still was in complete awe of my psychiatrist, never had i felt like a therapist always seemed to understand everything i talked about. Really it was going as i hoped it would.

Months went by, a year went by, and two years went by and at no point did i realise it was long ago i last saw a change. The last two years of me going to therapy was the same it always was, except this time i never stopped to question whether i was improving any longer. I was just going through the motions, wake up, go to therapy, talk about your problems, sleep... every day until the inevitable crisis came. And once again wake up, go to therapy, talk about my problems and so on. Suddenly, therapy is all i knew and ironically at that point my stigma was even worse to how it was in London. But i just continued, whenever i had a crisis i was told that every crisis teaches you something new, that it was my fault cos clearly i was doing something wrong. Once the crisis was no longer there id have my ego boosted by all the staff saying how much better i looked, how very soon ill be able to leave and have a normal life. 

I believed all of this, not once did i question the therapy, i just trusted my psychiatrist whenever hed tell me i just need q bit more time, and try this and try that. Within two and a half years of being in the center, i had been hospitalised plenty of times from the reoccurring crisis, basically failed to accomplish every single task i set myself. However this is easy say with hindsight, because let me tell you, even at this point i had this blind faith that this was all part of the bigger picture, that i had learned something different and that ""soon"" id be cured. 

Just 3 months before i was let go, the cure seemed to be right in front of me. Things seemed to be going fine, i was gonna start school in a month, all the therapists said i had done it. Shit it really seemed that way, at that moment anyways. School started, suprise surprise yet another crisis, although this time, i had a pretty serious overdose. But just like always as soon as i composed myself i went back to the day hospital, apologised, asked to get another chance (this still blows my mind) and was accepted back in. With no time to waste, my therapist made it very clear, if you cant study you have to work. Not one week later i found a job in construction as i was told, after a couple weeks i seemed to be in crisis again. I let my therapist know, but as always told me to ignore the symptoms and continue as i had to fight it. Only lasted two weeks until the next crisis came, and with that a couple more overdoses. Once again i was feeling that desperation i had long forgoten, i started to realise this shit aint going nowhere.

As what had now become a norm, as soon as i was able to function again, i went back to the day hospital with an apology in mind. I sat in my therapists office, and before i could say anything i was given the news i could no longer go there. It was surreal, that feeling of being a family, that i was somehow special because i was the only one with BPD that was left. Stroking my ego as I'd convince myself i was working harder, listening better than all the other ones woth my disorder. And realising its just happened to me.

Its been almost 3 months since that happened. First month was very difficult, with very negative a destructive thoughts and behaviours. At some point i started reflecting on the situation. They way i was just suddenly let go didnt feel right, i couldn't figure out why, but it didn't. It was like a puzzle, slowly finding more pieces. Except each piece had q question, not an answer. First thing was, how did he go from telling me hes so proud of my hard work to saying since i started i have just done things my way? Did i really not follow his method?.

I didn't really go any further than that until the following day. I was in the terrace, and idk how to explain this, other than everything just made sense. But this didn't bring me peace, quite the opposite. Had i ever seen q single person ""cured"" since i was there? No. Why is it that all 9 pacients with BPD were kicked out for ""not following treatment""? Why did i get a tattoo of my therapist? Why have i told everyone hes saved my life? Why was i so convinced that i was always about to be cured? Not one time did i stop to realise i was literally having the same crisis, with the sam frequency, with the same anxiety etc as always. How the fuck is this possible? What the fuck is going on? Where the fuck did he get his reputation from? And why have i idolised him, so blindly without having seen any sort of proof?

I mean the idea, of not having solved a single one of my issues was completely crazy. I thought i was having a psychotic episode. I really just couldn't comprehend wtf was going on. How is it possible, that i was so sure that the end line was always just a couple steps infront of me, yet nothings changed. Its hard to even put in words what i was feeling, but best way of discribing is that to me the realisation of this therapy having been no difference just seemed IMPOSSIBLE. I mean what about the 2 and a half years of therapy i just did, in this ""amazing"" day hospital, with ""one of THE best BPD therapists"" in the world. Always being reminded how lucky we were to be here, just like threating to let someone else ""take advantage"" instead of us. 

I was so confused that i was sure i had just spent 3 years in a cult. I couldn't find any other way to explain any of this. Everything just screamed cult, from the first day, where you get greeted by the ""veterans"", saying how you've finally found the right place, instantly just in awe of my therapist (never happened before), shit even my dad was in love with him. Scratch that, everyone was he comes we shut up and listen. The way they tell you that they have the key that no one else does. The way youd have to apologise and ask for more chances as if it was my fault, id get crisis trying what THEY told me to do. Not once in that time did i question weather things were working, everytime a friend was let go, I'd always get angry at them, as if it was their fault. I mean this one i cringe just saying it, but if there was a new guy that didn't wanna stay, me ""as a veteran"" would say to his face how he was wasting the chance of his life etc with such fucking conviction and somewhat superiority that still just makes my brain hurt. How? Saying it out loud just makes me feel retarded, and confused. Wtf did i really do all this time. How is any of this posible.

Took me a couple days to calm down, and only then did it occur to me that theres no way a public day hospital is a cult. But that doesn't mean it acts like one, giving hope to people that don't have it, promising a cure IF they follow the ""method"", insisting whenever you're not in crisis that youre almost cured, while blaming all the tough moments on you, until they let you go for ""not complying"". Either way, its a fullproof method, if you get cured its thanks to the treatment, if you dont its pacients fault.

To this day, this shit feels like a big fucking manipulation, feels like ive been living a lie, that ive been played with. I decided to share my thoughts with all people from the center that i'd shared time to see what they thought. I can't lie up to this point i was still thinking i was probably psychotic. But no, ALL of them had the same experience. Not of the therapist being bad, no, of feeling played, lied to. I cant put my finger on what the centre is doing wrong, but something here is discusting.

Now, you might be wondering why did i use that title?
Even though i still have a hard time making sense of this. One thing is very apparent to me, I've been looking at it all wrong. There is no step by step method, no one has one. If they did they'd be rich and famous, and in fact the clinical studies indicate that the only known ""cure"" is time. This means im now free to find what works for me, which means its MY responsibility. This probably sounds so obvious but keep in mind since i was 11 this is what ive been told. Its very obvious many aspects of psychology are where medical science was 200 years ago. People theorising, with/without esucated guesses.
In no other field could you say 

""To cure BPD it takes 5-10 years, but also some never get cured, some show improvements and some will go to full remission""

CONCLUSION: Obviously this is a personal experience, and i only realised the ""fraud"" in the therapies claiming they have the special sauce after having spent half my life in these places. I still see the use in therapy for BPD, so long you have the right expectations and don't expect to be cured by someone other than you. Also once you've done enough therapy, start thinking for yourself + knowledge learnt. You're idea will be as good as the therapists (pure guess). 

P.S. the day hospital has its positives; socialize with people like you, you feel understood, you have a daily routine, i learned a lot about myself through talking. All of this is more than any other therapy has done for me. I wanna make clear my issue, is with the fact that that promise a cure which doesn't exist, drag you along for years and when at some point give up and blame it on the patient. I think this is a very useful tool, just not the tool they advertise. Im not exaggerating, in terms of our difficulties, all 9 of us, are exactly where we started off. in our houses, confused on whats next.

Edit: It was awful. Lmao the therapist was fake.. I’ll explain.. it was on one of those virtual therapy apps where they claim to give you qualified therapists, but this was one was clearly reading off of a script. Trust me, it was fake. Her profile said she was a qualified psychotherapist for 15 years, but then she couldn’t even pronounce basic words like DBT and BPD. It was laughable..

217,Trauma Passed from Father to Son?,"Backstory: 

Im currently 19 years old and have been struggling with major depression, generalized Anxiety Disorder, severe ADHD, and Panic Disorder since I was 10 years old. I have tried over 8 medications from SSRI’s, SNRI’s, NDRI’s, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, stimulants, and even Ketamine. 

Almost all medications have failed with some benefits, however not being worthy enough to outweigh the negatives. Ketamine has been the most beneficial, but never lasting enough for a good well-being. 

I have overdosed on stimulants, benzos, and painkillers, causing me to be in a pscyh centre that just kade things worse. I’ve had numerous therapists with different forms of therapy including DBT, CBT, talk, etc. with no relief. 

Main Point: 

I recently had a deep conversation with my family, mainly talking about my father. I have always felt he has been distant, emotionally unavailable and just a negative in my life. I always have wanted a deep relationship with him, and see him 80% of the time in my ketamine trips. 

I was wondering if somehow his shame from his past, and his struggles in his early childhood/adulthood has somehow embedded itself in me and could be partially responsible for my struggles. I obviously know this is a potential, and have talked about this with therapists yet somehow they have never seemed to really understand it. 

My main focus on writing this is to know if anyone has any input in this: should I try and talk to my dad and learn about his past and his traumas?",1691985587.0,False,2,1,Recent-Tax8501,None,15qjn3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15qjn3s/trauma_passed_from_father_to_son/
218,It feels wrong,"{TW: mentions of substance abuse, SH, SA}
I'm starting highschool after summer, I'm 16m. But it feels surreal, ever since I was 13 I've not been allowed to be alone, not in my home, not outside nor in school. I'm seen as too big of a danger to myself because of multiple suicide attempts, severe self harm, substance abuse, reckless sex etc. But it feels like I just can't be a 16yo. I want to be able to be with friends, be outside, have fun, without having to be monitored every step i take, I've lost all the independence I NEEDED when I was a small neglected child. I'm bringing it up with my DBT therapist on Thursday, because I still feel like a small child, which doesn't make my PTSD due to 6 years of SA any better. I just feel so alone and meaningless. I've been clean from cutting since like February, currently it's the alcohol that's the problem... But the control my parents have obviously hasn't worked to stop me from drinking. I understand if they might need to inforce a strict plan if I've like been to the hospital or I'm spirilig, but now I haven't been the to hospital since may last year. Sure I should've gotten stitches and other medical attention latest as of February but after that I haven't really needed any hospital care or ER visits.",1689518075.0,False,2,0,crunchyboiily,None,1517tp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1517tp3/it_feels_wrong/
219,overeating as self harm,"im not sure if this is an eating disorder but it just felt like the appropriate flair


i have a sensitive stomach. i know what upsets it. dairy, and candy/chocolate at either an early point in the day or in big quantities. one of my work places has this jar of chocolates for the employees thats always full. when i feel like shit, which is a lot, i realize i can’t stop eating them. 

today, i didn’t have a lot to eat, so i shouldnt eat chocolates or it upsets my stomach, yet, in the last 3 hours ive eaten about 13 mini kit kats for no fucking reason. i did realize im feeling like shit about procrastinating on some things this month, but fuck. on top of this, i had a whole thing last week about getting a healthy diet and taking better care of myself, going on a sugar diet. so i feel even WORSE about it and i don’t know why i can’t put down the stupid chocolates, even if now my stomach is killing me. is this just a form of self harm? does anyone else relate to this? it just seems like i cant control my impulses or retain self discipline regarding anything single thing in my life and it really starting to wear me down.
