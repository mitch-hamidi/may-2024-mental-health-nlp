0,"I went to outpatient therapy for 5 months (almost all week during the summer and after school during august-october) and it was very helpful, at the time I was also diagnosed with anxiety and depression and didn't see a point in living. The community from the group setting helped almost as much as the actual therapy. Of course it depends on the facility, but I made many friends and the therapists and psychs were all so nice and helpful. I'm probably alive because I went there in my time of need. School is important but your health and mental health is more important. I would consider trying the outpatient place, it could help you",aetsomied,1b0ttx6
0,"I’ve worked in an IOP - the people who go there aren’t “messed up”. They’re just in a space where they need a lot of support with their mental health. 

It’s okay to feel defensive about it and have a lot of mixed feelings. Just know that your therapist probably recommended it because they genuinely think it would be beneficial for you.",StarryCloudRat,18bpi34

0,"Depends on what state/country you are in. 

I would imagine if not being inpatient is contingent on you going to outpatient than you either have to pick one. One will completely affect your schooling and once you will be able to be home and possibly complete your schooling at home after the program.

I don’t reccomend denying both as they can make you involuntary or TDO you.",serpentmurphin,1aeqqhv
1,"This is probably what I’m gonna have to do, but they did give me leeway because I had a (well documented) extremely traumatic series of events when I was put in inpatient two years ago. It was the worst week of my life. 

Some extra context I feel is needed:
The psychiatrist that discharged me did so with the alternative of IOP in mind, however the exact words “if you don’t go to outpatient you have to do inpatient” were never uttered. Nor were they on my discharge paper. The SECOND psychiatrist that I spoke to said that PHP was recommended, which was a phrase the first never used (even though the first psychiatrist was part of the same team) and said that the first psychiatrist recommended that too, and then slowly go into IOP. However, she said that it was a “completely voluntary program.” Never was it said that if I denied, that I’d be taken back. Although I was a 1013, I didn’t have any SI, it was severe SH that brought me in. That’s actually the primary reason that they let me go. Which is why I’m asking. 

I wouldn’t be completely mental care-less, there are still programs I’m willing to take. But not at the cost of my schooling. My school has a VERY strict attendance system.",One_Attorney8557,1aeqqhv

1,"It sounds like you’re taking every step you can to address your daughter’s safety and well-being. Keep in mind that Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) may be exhausting for her at first, so make the best use of the Family Therapy and Parent Group sessions to raise any questions or concerns.

You may also want to speak with her psychiatrist and therapist to discuss her self harm and IOP admission if you haven’t done so already. Continuation of care will help make her transition into and out of IOP smoother. It will also help with follow up care as needed.

Regarding when to start IOP, I’d recommend sooner rather than later, especially if she has recently self harmed. Breaking self harm habits is a difficult process, and not being aware of healthier coping techniques increases the chances of relapse.

Best wishes, and I’m glad you’re supporting your daughter’s recovery as a family.",DontBrainMyDamage,t24w0j
2,"Healthcare professional with a few thoughts:

- Is the IOP for teenagers only or also includes adults? I might have some general concerns if it's the latter. 

- How frequent is/was the self-harm? 1x ever versus 1x every month versus 1x/day is quite important. Has it stopped since starting Lexapro and/or receiving more direct care for it? Just reduced? Staying the same? If it's already reducing while doing regular outpatient, it might make sense to stay the course compared to the risk of missing school, socialization, etc. 

- DBT is helpful when emotional dysregualtion is the root cause of behaviors such as self-harm. DBT skills can still help everybody but if there are other more salient root causes of her self harm and suicidality, it might not be the best fit, especially given the cost of not attending school and missing out on something fun like a vacation, which can be great for one's and 'life worth living goals' which DBT is ultimately aiming to help people realize. 

- Even if not DBT focused, family therapy if everybody (especially your daughter) is on board can be really fantastic. Family dynamics, how your daughter feels like she fits into the system, and parent training can be super valuable.",randomlygeneratedadv,t24w0j
3,"The only problem that I am seeing with it, is that she will be going into a program but without a clear diagnosis. Self harm and suicidal thoughts usually comes from a serious mental illness such as ptsd, borderline disorder, bipolar disorder…. If you do not find the source of the behavior, the program might not be helpful at all. My sister is borderline disorder, she was sent to 2 different programs when she was a teen and they never worked. As soon as she would be out of there, and therapist stopped seeing her, the behaviors came right back and it hurt her for a long time. She only got her borderline disorder diagnosis in her late 20’s but she feels like she ruined her 20’s since borderline disorder is all about self sabotage in a way. She is adhd and borderline now, medicated and followed for the right disorders and now she stopped cutting for real and she isn’t suicidal anymore and she isn’t feeling a void deep inside of her that she feels forced to fill all the time. Those are all symptoms of it and now they are handled. Adhd loves to co-exist with other disorders. I’m adhd bipolar, mom is adhd bipolar, dad is adhd with emotional dependency issues, my best friend, he’s adhd with general anxiety disorder and that’s a mess. It’s my opinion that if she is cutting and having suicidal thoughts, it’s not just adhd.  Once you find the source, those programs can be absolutely vital to remission, but without the source of the issue, it’s really just throwing stuff at a wall until something sticks and that something could be anything.",,t24w0j
4,"People often resort to self-harm as a means of coping with stress. This age is often stressful for a lot of people. I can tell you about some stress management that can help with ADHD.  
  
There is evidence that relaxation with the traditional Asian methods can help with ADHD. Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a 3-part program of mind-body methods - breathing, meditation, and slow body movement. The idea is to incorporate these into your daily life, be aware of changes in mood and respond mindfully, aware of your breathing. Details here -

I technically have two of three children ""in crisis.""

1.  The DBT is only teenagers.
2. She has been feeling suicidal thoughts since April 2020 (she says 2 months into covid).  Self reported cutting monthly.

7,"Since your son is also struggling, I would up the family therapy recommendation. There may be unintentional things within the family environment/dynamics that can be negatively impacting your kids (all environments have these) but they may be more 'sensitive', which can contribute to self-harm and other difficulties. 

One possible option is that if things are more stable now for your daughter to consider IOP in the summer. If she is genuinely feeling better (and her healthcare providers agree), getting back into her routine and feeling like she can participate more in school/socially can do wonders for shaping the expectation that one can struggle with mental health, get help, and actively work towards being better (rather than needing to interrupt life for care). 

But sometimes life does need to be interrupted even with heavy costs in order to work towards recovery. 

Again this is just food for thought and Internet advice is worth infinitely less than actual professional recommendations from clinicians who are working with her and hopefully have an accurate and balanced view of her care. Good luck!",randomlygeneratedadv,t24w0j
8,"Bipolar is highly genetic, usually presents itself as a personality disorders in teenagers until they have a first mania or the problem develops.  Those disorders usually come in full bloom at the end of teenage hood and beginning of young adulthood. It’s complex and can take years to diagnose unfortunately. 

What I am advising is based on my personal experiences, where these programs never helped me and my sister beside forcing us out of school, which means when we came back in school we were bullied for being the “retarded crazies”.",,t24w0j

1,"I cant speak to a particular program, but I did use therapy to go from mentally unhealthy, to very happy (I might describe it more as peaceful) most of the time.

It doesnt sound dumb to me that you would be nervous about being happy, in fact that's very wise of you to notice that nervousness. I think many times people are so used to their unhealthy way of living that their mind starts to identify with it.  The idea of losing it, is like losing part of yourself.

1,You are so strong for getting help and do not undervalue that strength because what you are doing is brave.  One thing to remember is you have some say in the tempo of treatment now because you weren't admitted.  You'll be able to talk through the best treatment options and if in patient is too much you could always do outpatient.,,qqxi8l
2,"They think you may be able to avoid inpatient care, and that's very encouraging.  
  
Here's a tip. Practice some good relaxation and, if you get a thought that scares you, calmly ask yourself if there's any evidence for it.  
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
   
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. 

Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. 

In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
   
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath. The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous.   
  
  
Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise - 5 breaths a min - is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.   
   
   
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
   
   
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.",RWPossum,qqxi8l

0,"I've been to a few IOP programs, and they were mainly geared towards learning cognitive behavioral therapy coping mechanisms in a group therapy setting. 

First, we would process how our day or week was going. Next, the facilitator would teach some CBT technique. Finally, we would discuss the application of the technique in imagined situations. 

Sometimes, it would vary in the format because something would come up in the process part or the facilitator found something more useful in one of our discussions.

They can be helpful if you have a facilitator the group trusts and the members of the group participate. I've been in good groups and challenged groups. The better facilitators will prevent one person from dominating the discussions. 

A good group, with a good facilitator, can help immensely if you really put yourself out there. You have to really participate and engage for that to happen. You have to play an active role for it to be beneficial.

I found them better for recovering from an episode than the groups during hospitalization because you aren't forced to be there-- you can come and go as you please.

Overall, it was a really good experience and it helped stabilize me and keep me out of the hospital. I was struggling with suicidal thoughts and self-harm going into it and I learned a lot of coping skills in IOP.",anxiouspigeon_ta,e43cvy
4,"I’m a therapist and a recipient of therapy. I recently did a partial hospitalization program and stepped down to iop for a couple weeks. I think, ultimately, it all depends on the staff and the program. Hospitalization isn’t therapy, it’s crisis stabilization, whereas IOP is more therapy. I think it can be incredibly helpful.  For me, I wish I would have done partial hospitalization and iop instead of going to the hospital. I hope you find something that works for you.",dark-dad,e43cvy

my one very important piece of advice: don’t befriend people in those centers. be FRIENDLY with them but keep it in the hospital doors. i joined a friend group in IOP and before i knew it, i was the fixer-upper friend. it was emotionally taxing and i’m still traumatized years later because one of my friends i met in there wasn’t in the same stage of recovery as me and she didn’t make it. a lot of hospitals have rules on not sharing social media/personal contact information and they seem stupid when you think you’ve made a lifelong best friend but they’ve made those rules for a reason.

Personally I'd like to have an actual alarm go off at the 45/50 minute mark so that I know the session is almost over and we can wrap up or ask that we put a pin in it and continue in the next session.

The amnesia between sessions doesn’t appear to be a therapist specific problem.

So if I talk about something that needs to be continued over 3-6 weeks, I’ll be feeling unheard because of going over the same stuff like it’s new each time. They just don’t have time to write down good notes and review them before each session.

3,"Some, yeah. It’s not like there’s much to do about it. 

The recommendation was to seek a more intensive level of services, but not crisis care as that’s not appropriate, nor does it speed up any process for getting into intensive outpatient programs, which only last 3-6 weeks anyway. 

So I filled out the 20 page DMH application, therapist wrote a letter, medical records all requested, and now it’s a matter of waiting 3-6 months for them to process the application, after which, unless it’s rejected, I’ll be considered to be added to a waitlist for whatever services even exist in functional form anymore. 

So now we’re just waiting. I can’t just skip therapy, but at the same time my therapist said (wrote) months ago that once a week is “not enough” and that he expects I will “continue to decline” at this level of care. But realistically, what I “need” might not be available anywhere.

IOP can either be residential where you stay at the program 24/7 for about 4 weeks or it can be partial hospitalization where you go to programming for 8 hours in the day and return home in the evening. 

Some start with inpatient and “step down” in care to residential. 

As for your job it depends on where are are located. If you’re in the US look into your benefits to determine if you are eligible for FLMA. Typically there is someone at the hospital to assist you with this. 

Hope this helps. Sorry for formatting, mobile. ",Pavlovingthisdick,a0acqq
1,"Inpatient is short-term for stabilization, though it can turn into residential for a longer term if needed. Residential treatment often lasts a few weeks to a month or so, though that really depends on what's going on.

Partial hospitalization is a step down from residential. Usually you spend a good chunk of time in things like group therapy, individual therapy, etc. Intensive outpatient is, as it sounds, outpatient. This means that you're not living in a hospital, you're getting treatment while living elsewhere. The definitions between partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient vary depending on the place, but typically PHP includes a good amount of time almost every day, whereas IOP is more like 3 hours a few days a week.

As for employment, that really depends. This is where things like FMLA and such come in. It might be a good idea to talk to the staff at a place you're considering. They can give more insight into how other people deal with work and into how their facility works.",roboraptor3000,a0acqq

1,"It might have something to do with reducing anxiety, ironically. Some patients use clocks to facilitate their obsessive compulsive behaviors and the facility might be wanting to encourage patients to feel less rigid when it comes to compulsive structuring.
If there's someone who always paces across the room on the 5's or gets anxious if they're supposed to take meds every 6 hours and they're used to taking them at 6 hours *on the dot,* they might be trying to give them one less thing they can use to focus their compulsions on. Plus, some patients get almost *too* focused on their routine and they might be trying to set a more realistic schedule for them, where they eat lunch when they're hungry, not just always at 1:15, or they want them to get used to the idea of an imprecise routine like that in general.

1,"That’s a hard decision isn’t it. Pros and cons for both. I found DBT helpful and was able to do it outpatient. Mine was an intensive compressed course and I learned great skills for managing intense emotions. There are skills while in the middle of intense emotions and skills when things arent as intense so you can get a better handle on emotions. Great skills. Is there an option to attend DBT therapy support groups if you can’t get DBT outside therapy?

For me, good mental health comes first because I can’t do much without good mental health. And sounds like both options are for doing this. Wish I could tell you which one to choose.

I’m not sure how much time will be spent learning DBT skills in your program. I spent about 4 hours a day learning skills and also some time with a DBT therapist one on one. It was around a couple months. I went home in the afternoons but it was hard for me to work at the same time after experiencing all my feelings and using my brain power to learn everything. So I took a leave of absence from my job. 

If you do the inpatient DBT one, maybe think of it more as a retreat to learn how to heal rather than the locked up aspect. Time devoted to yourself. Like a meditation retreat. And if you do the outside therapy choice, factor in that you’ll be processing emotions and that can take energy to do. I don’t know how intense your job training is and how flexible it is with your therapy appointments. 

And I understand not wanting to be away from your boyfriend. Do they allow you to use video yo talk to your boyfriend and friends? There are also people you may meet that can help support you. I found fellow patients very helpful in giving me someone to talk to that understood what I was going through and that helped me a lot. 

And I understand wanting to get better. And it is hard isn’t it to judge what state you are in. 

Wish I could help you further. I don’t know how nice the inpatient place is. Some are better than others. And I don’t know the type of outside therapy you would be getting and whether youve had that that experience before and if it helped you. 

There is a pro con list for your mind and a pro con list for your gut feelings. And a pro con list on how it could help in the long run and not just short term. And I don’t know what your financial situation is. I’m in the US, so it’s different. But I believe debt for self improvement is good debt. Like getting an education or investing in job or life skills. 

Sorry you’ve been struggling for awhile. I hope either decision gives you relief. And if it doesn’t , that you can have the opportunity to try the other choice or a new choice.",modular-displacement,rx9bg7

2,"First look into your insurance. Call the number on the back of your card, or go online to see what your insurance covers. Find a place you like the best, and give them a call. Tell them what's going on, and that you'd like to start some services. They will schedule an intake with you, where you get to meet a therapist and figure out what's going on, and what kind of help would be best.

If you don't have insurance, this is what you do.

1. Get insurance.
2. See above steps.

If you really don't feel like getting insurance, find some therapeutic services close to you and call them. Ask them if they take out-of-pocket clients, and set up an intake with them.

Outpatient services mean you will go and see a therapist.
Inpatient services mean you will go and stay somewhere for a while and see a therapist.
In-home services means a therapist comes to your home and works with you.
Meds help a lot of people. Look into that if you want.
Group is group. You know what group is.

There are tons of different types of therapy. Finding the ones you like best is key.

0,"It all really depends on the program I guess. I did 40 hours of an out patient program in one month (most of it group therapy) and I found it surprisingly helpful. Most of the people in my group were significantly older than me, so I thought I'd have a hard time relating, but it turns out that depression is the great equalizer.

Just keep in mind that you're a patient...and unfortunately that means you'll have to be patient with yourself and the program.

When I did it, I found that there were certain parts of the program that I found less helpful than others. Each person is different so it's important to have a program like that because different things help different people. So don't expect every exercise/discussion to be extremely helpful to you in particular.

Other advice I would give--the less you want to participate, the more you should try. Can I ask how long the program duration is? How often will you be doing it weekly? Do they also prescribe you meds?

And it is COMPLETELY okay to feel that way. I mean, with all the other things that you've tried, who wouldn't? Even if you're just doing this for your families sake, don't under play how big of a step just attempting to do something for your health like this really is. ",cheesepuff311,4co367

0,">I've been dealing with anxiety, depression, agoraphobia and *probably a mood disorder*

Depression is a mood disorder so I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.

Look, as u/dpbliss said, it's not likely you're going to change anyone's mind about how sick you are.  The fact is that those intensive IOP programs aren't really any different than once a week therapy, except that the advantage is they don't interfere with your life so much.

IOP isn't really any more ""serious"" of a treatment than once a week therapy.  It is for people who are so lacking in coping skills that they are completely unable to function.  If you are thinking a more intensive program will make you  feel better faster, you are wrong.  They are for people who have no skills.  Think of it like a class in how to live with depression, not a treatment.

Understand that they see a LOT of people and many of them are worse off than you.  I know how invalidating it is to hear that but it's kind of true.  You want relief for your symptoms and you think this program will bring it but it won't.  If they've assessed that you are better off once a week, then trust that they are right.  The more intensive treatment isn't always the better one.",pricklycoconut,3ha5ju
1,"I'd recommend against putting your hopes into convincing your social worker and doctor your symptoms are more severe than they think they are.  These people probably have to triage patients based on severity of symptoms, and there may be patients who need the IOP program more than you do right now.  These programs tend to be understaffed and hard to get insurance to cover.  I don't mean to belittle your symptoms -- but keep in mind that however bad your symptoms get, there are people out there who have it worse.  (This is something I'm constantly reminding myself.)

You say you've tried a lot of different treatment approaches.  My question is, what's worked?  Anything?  I find that when the shit really hits the fan for me, I need to go to DBT-style distress tolerance.  The general idea with this (in case you aren't familiar with it) is that you're living with distress, it's not likely to go away any time soon, and, despite that, you have to find a way to carry on.  Treat yo'self, so to speak.  If being in a structured program is what would make you feel good right now, then design one for yourself: Make a schedule of activities for the day.  You might do art therapy in the morning (color in a book), eat lunch at a cafe, go for a jog in the afternoon, and meditate at night.  I don't know.  Whatever works for you.  Whatever you can handle.  Maybe working through a book of CBT exercises or something like that.

Take it day by day, get what you can from your doctors, and chances are, as you find what works for you and what doesn't, things will gradually improve.

> it's time for serious treatment

I hate to break it to you, but I've been to an IOP program, and it isn't any more serious (or different, really) than what you've already had.

Good luck!",,3ha5ju
2,"I'd ask if the program would be available to you as an alternative to hospitalization if the one day a week program was unsuccessful and you began to deteriorate again. I'd hope that they'd be willing to try anything to avoid a re-hospitalization but it'd give you the chance to try creating your own program as the other reply suggested in conjunction with the anti-anxiety program. If that seems impossible to you, stress to the Social Worker that you only see a hospitalization in your very near future with such a non-intensive program. If you are already feeling as though you may hurt yourself or commit suicide please call an emergency service, 911 if you're in the US, or at least tell the Social Worker that tomorrow if you're not in immediate danger, it may lead to another hospitalization but your safety is all that matters. It would be highly unethical for you to be given no choice in your own treatment plan. ",Mspizzu,3ha5ju
3,"> those intensive IOP programs aren't really any different than once a week therapy

The difference is that in the IOP programs, you're in a group of other patients.  OP, if you want that social interaction, you can always search meetup.com for mental-health support groups.  The Depression Bipolar Support Alliance has great support groups nation-wide.

> Understand that they see a LOT of people and many of them are worse off than you. I know how invalidating it is to hear that but it's kind of true.

One perspective is to see this as invalidating, but another is to feel grateful.  OP, you're definitely dealing with some difficult shit.  If you need some empathy right now -- which you're totally entitled to -- I think you're likely to find it at a support group.  But take some solace in the fact that things could be worse: Your neurovegetative symptoms could be so bad you can't even bring yourself to speak or get out of bed.  You could be hearing voices chronically.  I'm not trying to suggest that mental illness is about one-up-manship, but in our society, where it's so difficult for people to get the treatment they need, patients like us are best off taking care of ourselves -- as opposed to trying to convince other people to take care of us.  That said, definitely don't stop being an advocate for yourself.  Working to get the right fit with a doctor *is* taking care of yourself.",,3ha5ju

0,"Hi, I suffered from suicidal depression for 2 years where I basically didn't get out of bed. I tried 14 different meds, lots of therapy and nothing helped. I tried Ketamine infusions which helped a bit, but were expensive and didn't cure me. What cured me was one session of a Ketamine injection combined with intentional therapy. In 1 hour, I was cured. Ketamine temporarily increases your brains ability to form new pathways so while you are in a half sleep state from the ketamine, my therapist repeated the preset intentions (mine were for radical acceptance of my new normal after the loss of a friend and health issues that caused my depression). I heard sometimes it can take a few sessions, but for me it only took one. My wife noticed immediately when I walked up to her after the sessions, that the light was back in my eyes.

0,"Sorry about your experience. I have seen many mental health professionals in my time, some of them just don't click. A lot of doctors lose their passion because they see so many people or never had it to begin with. There are a lot of flaws in the system also. I've had doctors be really rude to me especially when I identified as my assigned sex (female). At the start, when my mental illneses were just budding, I was also treated like I was a liar because of being female, and overall not taken seriously. For me, it wasn't until my schizoaffective became full blown did I start not slipping through the cracks as much. But don't let that deter you, sometimes you have to keep trying and advocating for yourself. He likely wasn't a good fit, even passed the fact he was a male. 

Idk where you are but sometimes switching the mental health place you're dealing with can do wonders if you find switching doctors/therapists do not help. I learned that some hospitals are better than others in my case (not that you have to deal with a hospital or are dealing with one). 

I've been in and out of psych hospitals and ERs and wards for like 13 years, but obviously we have different issues. I have probably seen a plethora of doctors and the like. Some people just don't fit with the client they are assigned to. I too am 27.

31,"Being Sober is Beautiful

I was an addict for more years of my life than I was sober. I used opiates to deal with the mental pain of life. I'm not going to write a sob story, but my life growing up wasn't sunshine and roses as I'm sure is the same for most people who are addicted. I was getting so far gone and pushing the pain I had gone through in life so far down and not dealing with it, that it was rotting inside of me. It was starting to make me legitimately crazy. I cared some, but not much, and not enough to get off drugs. I had tried before just to stop, but I didn't realize how much work was going to be involved, what I was in for, or where to begin. It took me three years of trying different methods like methadone, rehab, suboxone, meditation and therapy to finally get to the starting line of what I thought was the path to sobriety.

While going through all of this it was like I was marching up a snowy mountain with a backpack on. I was tightly holding my shoulder straps, trudging through the snow uphill one step at a time. After a couple of months I would lift my head up to see I was still in the exact same place. So again, I put my head down and trudged on. For over a year it seemed like I was in the same place every time I looked up. I had learned a lot though while walking. I truly learned the meaning of patience and calmness and finally understood this is a marathon not a sprint. I learned that hope was the only thing I had in the most desperate times when I felt like just giving up and setting down in the snow, not to care anymore. In the mind of my mind, I was climbing a ladder or the steps of a pyramid. Every lesson was like an ascension of knowing who I was and what I had to do. Like going through the chakras to start at red over and over again, growing the whole time.

One day things changed a little as I felt some tension release. I didn't realize I was over the crest, just knew it was starting to get easier and I felt myself descending down the other side. Still learning in the mind of my mind lessons to take with me. I learned it is okay to just be okay with yourself. That being ashamed and the fear and anxiety that came along with it weren't going to help me on my travels, so I had to shed that baggage to get where I wanted to be. People don't look at you and see what you think of yourself. They just see what is in front of them at that moment. So, if you're doing better, that is the picture you project. They don't know the challenges you're facing in your mind and body to just make it through the day. So again, my head down I keep trudging through the snow down the side of the mountain.

One day I felt something completely different. I had accepted the snow and the mountain and without knowing where I was, I look up and there isn't any snow. I'm coming into a valley with a beautiful meadow, and I can shed some of my baggage knowing I'm in a better place. I still have my journey ahead but I'm feeling better about each step, still learning in the mind of my mind. I have this energy inside of me that wants to persevere. I want to be a good person and give off a good energy for others to realize anything is possible.

Feeling light and free I walk to the edge of the meadow with my shoulders tall and straight from everything I've carried and learned to cope with. The mind of my mind gave way to me being myself and knowing who I was. I felt whole once more. As I make my way through the trees there is a beautiful little stream. I wash myself and stand up a clean person, free and ready to face the world as I had never known before. As I look around with my eyes clear, in that moment I realize, this is beautiful!",JMCochransmind,xdnpjm

5,"Still never had an official diagnosis of PTSD, however I have been treated for it by psychotherapists and had counselling for it. I'm not sure if an official diagnosis would be all that helpful. I'm officially Mixed Anxiety Depressive Disorder which I always thought was a hilarious acronym.

You're right about the self advocacy though. It was really hard for years because I was so used to being told I was fine (by family, friends accusing me of lying etc) that I downplayed what I was going through, and shockingly, didn't really get the right support. Once I started being honest with how bad I was feeling and how close to suicide I was, I did start getting more help and more follow up calls instead of just being left to rot.

That being said, I was taken to A&E for suicidal ideation once and referred to the rape and incest support team, and they recommended therapy and new meds, but it took nine months for me to get therapy out of them. The person who initially processed my report left her job and instead of passing me on to someone, she managed to close my case instead. Despite being an urgent case, I was pushed to the back of the waiting list again. I barely remember those nine months, it is just a haze of bed ridden depression.

I ended up paying for private counselling for my final year of uni to keep my head above water - thankfully through a charity so it was really cheap, £15 per session with a volunteer counsellor. I don't think I'd have been able to finish my degree without that regular support, rather than pissing about with the limited runs of therapy from the NHS - sometimes as little as 8 sessions per time. Having a consistent counsellor was such a huge benefit. Of course I had to organise it all myself, self refer, book the sessions, pay, arrange transport, inform university if it meant missing classes etc. If I'd been in the state I was a couple of years ago, it wouldn't have happened. People that mentally ill are so withdrawn they become invisible to the health service. We desperately need more mental health community nurses that can monitor people struggling. With that sort of support I could have begun recovery so much sooner. ",wawbwah,9xuior

9,"YES! EVERYTHING YOU SAID! YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!

I had a similar experience as you. Diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I was suffering from extreme confusion about why I did things, and why my family did things (borderline tends to beget borderline).

I don't have an official diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. But what the fuck ever. Self diagnosing *catapulted* me towards finally becoming a functioning human being. The haze of confusion was lifted off me, I finally *understood* what was happening to me. I still view this epiphany as a major turning point of my life. 

I finally healed and became the stable, peaceful person I am today once I shifted my perspective towards having borderline personality disorder. So I don't give a damn that I'm not diagnosed. This perspective *healed me!* That means something!

I *clearly* have a weak emotional throttle. I *clearly* am massively triggered by any *hint* of rejection, and had tended to freak the fuck out, and still to this day will jump through hoops to protect that vulnerability I have.

But, diagnosis is through *observation*, not how one is functioning *internally.* And there are many ways for someone with BPD to cope with the core internal problems they have. But, clinicians pretty much only see those with BPD as flighty excitable girls who self harm and/or repeatedly attempt suicide. If you don't fit that presentation, you don't get diagnosed.

Check out the book ""Understanding the Borderline Mother."" Fucking *awesome.* It goes over four different presentations of BPD from the perspective of a mother -- waif, hermit, queen, and witch. I finally understood why my mother did the things she did (queen with a dash of witch). *And* realized I am borderline, too. I am the hermit. But the vast majority of clinicians only envision the waif as having BPD.

I spoke to several people about getting diagnosed with BPD, and they all rejected it. They acknowledged that I *lean* towards BPD, but that it isn't at the level of being a ""disorder."" So, I stopped that avenue and just worked on it myself, doing research and commiserating with other people with BPD. I now tell my mental health folks that I believe I have BPD. They try to talk me out of it, but I'm like, ""Guys. I am SO MUCH BETTER when working through the perspective of being borderline. That's of huge value.""

I started with my current therapist when she was a student, so she's still learning things. For some reason, after seeing her for 2 years, she suddenly needed to classify me with a diagnosis, and she got wicked anxious about me self identifying as BPD. She wanted to respect my self diagnosis, but was conflicted with also wanting to record what she considered an accurate diagnosis. Plus, there apparently is a problem if I am diagnosed with a personality disorder. Something about meaning she wouldn't be able to see me any more (her level may mean she's not allowed to have PD patients...?).

I was honestly surprised she was anguishing over this. Everyone else just puts GAD and MDD and moves on. But she wanted to be *accurate.* 

Finally I told her, 

1) I am a *recovering* borderline, kind of like being a recovering alcoholic. I'm OK now, but it's always there as an underlayer of myself that I continuously have to maintain at a healthy level. At this moment, I would not be diagnosed as borderline in a clinical definition. Nevertheless, I *do* need to remember I am borderline in order to remain stable and wield the right tools to self soothe.

And 2) Clinicians really don't care about an accurate diagnosis! I have NEVER had a discussion about my diagnosis. No one has even told me unless I specifically ask. Clinicians also notoriously put the *minimum* diagnosis needed in order to maintain care, because big problems can occur for both the clinician and patient if someone is diagnosed with a personality disorder. So, they avoid it like the plague (*especially* BPD due to the percieved drama and suicide risk). I told her my psychiatrist just flags me as GAD and MDD, so she's very safe to follow suit and flag me with the same diagnoses.

Your experience and my experience absolutely exposes the problem of such conservative diagnosing. Clinicians don't attempt to help us understand ourselves. I had to do my own research on psychology to finally understand myself, my family, and the world. And that understanding was *critical* for me to become stable.

Proper treatment also gets withheld. Folks with BPD improve with DBT -- NOT CBT! Using CBT on a borderline patient is like hitting them over the head with a brick to get them to stay in the ""healthy"" lane. Sure, CBT can help them see the lane and understand they're not in the lane, but no amount of bashing them over the head is going to get a BPD person to get into the lane and stay there.

I had a round of psychological testing by a team of specialists. I spent *16 hours with them!* Their conclusion was that I needed DBT. *My therapist didn't sign me up for DBT!* I imagine it was from the negative connotation associated with DBT being for those with BPD. This guy *withheld treatment* from me because he was afraid of BPD. I gave the report to my next therapist, and he ignored the recommendation, too. I lost years of my life because of the fear of BPD.

I didn't understand the psychological report until after I began teaching myself about psychology. Once I read it with my new knowledge I was utterly floored that a *team of professionals* who had *intensely evaluated me for 16 hours* had recommend DBT for me 5 years prior and two different therapists completely ignored it. They thought they knew better. That was 5 years of my life I had lost.

So, yes. You're peering into a major problem in the mental health system. It's a fucking shame, and I hope they listen to what we're saying about our experiences so we can get better, more swift treatment for our problems.",workerdaemon,9xuior

One day, I suddenly presented with both mania *and* physical symptoms. My heart felt like it was going to explode. My body felt like it was vibrating at such intensity that I'll burst. My energy level was rediculously high, and I had a strong drive to do everything. Not crazy things: normal things for me, like items on my TODO list. I have a natural drive to help people. And that drive got turned up to 120%.

I finally realized something was wrong, and went to the ER. The pressure on my body actually felt like irrevocable damage could occur.  It was an utter useless experience. They just saw mania and couldn't see anything beyond it.  Since my drive was to be helpful, I wasn't a danger.

They put me in a completely empty room and had a guy sit with me. I overheard something about how he should talk to me so he can learn more about what mania looks like 🙄

I was told I was bipolar and this was my first manic episode. I was 35 years old with 12 years of intense psychological management that never saw signs of bipolar. I rejected the diagnosis. I wasn't there just because I was excited, I was there because *it felt like my body was going to collapse.* I insisted on seeing a psychiatrist to rule out bipolar. The psych department rejected evaluating me, so the ED reafirmed their bipolar diagnosis.

And then I crashed. This did not deter their insistence that I was bipolar. Nah, I just had an 8 hour episode of mania that dropped into depression in the span of 5 minutes. Totally normal bipolar presentation to them.

I didn't crash because I fell into depression. I crashed because my entire adrenaline reserves had been exhausted and I literally didn't have enough chemicals/hormones necessary for functioning. I was rediculously weak, couldn't talk, and barely could move. But, these symptoms did not concern them.

After a social worker confirmed I have a mental health provider they discharged me.

Total waste of my time.

Turns out it was a side effect of a medication. The doctor asked, ""Have you made any medication changes?"" Why yes, yes I have. I increased my dose 3 days ago. He ignored it. Didn't bother fucking looking up the potential side effects of the medication. 

The doctor just thought I was a basket case and went on his merry way. And today he still thinks he was totally correct in diagnosing me as bipolar, further solidifying his stance. And he taught another up and comer in the medical field that I was a prime example of bipolar mania, so now that guy also thinks he understands someone who presents like I did is merely bipolar. And the cycle of misdiagnosis continues and reinforces itself.",workerdaemon,9xuior
33,I find it odd that there was a difficult time getting a diagnoses of BPD since up here (Ontario) it is the diagnosis of choice ignoring all others almost. I am very sad you had this experience. 😞,lovelyboredom,9xuior
34,I’m sorry you have bad experiences with the mental health care system and it has made you so bitter and upset you feel the need to personally attack people online. I’ve had terrible experiences as well and can relate to that feeling. ,swild89,9xuior
35,"This is exactly how i feel, the emptiness that you described. I have been on antidepressants in past and it didn't work for me. I'm from India and in my city it's hard to find a therapist because there are very few in my city. May I know what other symptoms you showed of borderline personality and how old are you? Do you have any siblings? How's your relation with your parents? I have grown up in traumatic house conditions, my parents always fight and still do. I'm trying to make sense of world around me and myself. I have sucidial ideation since teenage years and I'm 22 now. ",,9xuior
36,"Oh man. I forgot about that emptiness feeling. God, you're totally right, it is physically painful. I remember describing it like a reverberating huge empty metal barrel.

Well, know that the emptiness *can* eventually go away! I don't experience it any more, and even forgot about it.

I also had that extreme difficulty with my emotions just flying off the handle in every which way. It was torturous. It was like being yanked around by a 200lb dog.

So, again, know that you can get your emotions under control. The key for me was identifying my triggers and *why* it was triggering. The first time I realized I was on the path to recovery was when I quickly self soothed. I had received an innocuous text message from someone I hadn't ever met, and never would, which welled up my emotions. I was just about to snap when I realized, ""Oh. This made me feel rejected. But it totally doesn't matter if this stranger rejects me. And besides, he doesn't know enough about me to reject me. This is probably a misinterpretation of the intent behind these words."" And voila, just like that, my emotions settled right down. I was able to go on to the rest of my day rather than losing 4 hours from overwhelming emotions.

Now it's mostly second nature to self soothe those little triggers. If something gets by my automatic soothing, I take a moment to consciously listen to my emotions to see what's going on. 

That was another key: *listening to myself!* Eventually, it was like my emotions learned to ""trust"" me that I will take time to address them. They don't scream as loud if I quickly sit down and give them my full attention to hear their grievances and help them soothe or promise to address the problem. Now they trust me enough that I'm able to tell them, ""Ok, got it, we'll talk in a bit,"" so I can continue what I'm doing first. Then when I have some available brain power I'll go back and ""talk"" to my emotions to figure out what happened. 

These days I know my major triggers and have adjusted my life to minimize my triggers (like low contact with my mother...). So the vast majority of the time all I need to do is soothe the emotion and it settles back down quickly. Sometimes there is a bigger issue where I need to make a change... and I'll make that change. I just have to in order to keep my emotions settled and stable.

My mantra is: My sanity is my number one priority; if I lose my sanity, I lose everything.

So if I have to change something, or cut something from my life because my emotions can't handle it... well... then I do it. Ruthlessly. No matter the cost, because my sanity comes before *anything* else in my existence.

So! That's how I've reached this stage where I feel stable and peaceful. I'm sure you'll get here, too!",workerdaemon,9xuior
37,"Omg, the exhaustion. I did the same thing, already amped up and then being in there I went to 11. When I got home that night I had picked about half of my beard out and felt like I had... taken the SAT for 12 hours while running a marathon. So drained. 

I was in for about 12 hours. It did absolutely nothing constructive, and like I said, left feeling way worse. I begged them to tell me *something* and they wouldn’t. 

They also tossed a student in the room with me at one point, he was the most helpful out of the 5 people I talked to; I think he felt bad. Then someone came in the room and told me I didn’t deserve to be there and I was taking up resources from the community for people who were really sick.

It was so fucked. And I got to pay $2000 for the privilege. ",atticus__,9xuior
38,I'm sorry that calling someone out for their bullshit you take as personal offence. ,dawn990,9xuior
39,"   Other symptoms I have is an intense fear of abandonment, which messed me up way more than I had originally thought once I started analyzing all of my past friendships and could finally see how this intense fear actually caused me to self sabotage and ruin a lot of good friendships. Before becoming aware of this, I just viewed these failed friendships as evidence that everyone will leave me, which made me even more paranoid of getting abandoned. It go to a point that I stopped trying to make connections with other people because I was convinced that it would be pointless because I'd be abandoned by everyone eventually.  

.

   Another one that messed me up was idolizing and devaluing people. Like I'd go from thinking that someone is the greatest person in the world who I want to be around constantly to feeling disgusted by their very presents. I honestly hate this one the most because for the longest time I thought that these feelings were real and my own, and I actually believed these emotions and treated them as valid, when in reality thats not how I truly felt about that person it's just that sometimes I get blinded by the emotional intensity of BPD and fall into this trap of sometimes believing the the symptoms of it are how I truly feel. Now that I'm aware of it, it's easier for me to deal with it. Especially when I start to feel myself devaluing people. Now when I notice myself getting easily irritated/disgusted by them I'll just ask them for space because I'm just feeling really irritable and I don't want to say or do something I don't actually mean. I do this to avoid hurting people and for my own sake too, because as weird as it is the person I usually really enjoy being around can become a massive trigger and just being around them feels unbearable because every little flaw or mistake they've made feels like it's been amplified by 100, to the point that the person your angry at isn't even them anymore, it's this shitty version of them that your head created.

.

   Another thing is becoming paranoid or disassociating when you're stressed out. I get EXTREMELY paranoid when I'm very anxious to the point that I once was convinced that there was a man in my hotel room who was going to kill me. But I caught myself while I was frantically searching my room and had this moment of self realization where I was like ""what the actual fuck am I doing?"". It was then that I remembered that stress in people with BPD can cause paranoia. That made me realize that I wan't in any danger, I was just anxious because of my flight the next day and that anxiety had manifested itself into paranoia. I also dissociate when I'm really stressed out or overwhelmed, it 
makes me feel like I'm in a weird day dream.

  But to answer your other questions I'm 20, I have a sister and I have a questionable relationship with my parents.

40,"If you have an unstable home life during childhood you are very likely to develop BPD (my pet theory is that a significant portion of the world currently is suffering from some degree of BPD).

Getting a diagnosis is not critical. I didn't get one, and had professionals keep telling me I didn't have BPD. Well, F- them. Changing my perspective to that of having BPD *revolutionized my life.* I am so much better now.

You can work on this yourself. Even if you had access to a therapist I would strongly recommend you do your own studying and introspection.

Read websites for supporting people with BPD. Get books *for* those with BPD (avoid anything about living with someone with BPD because it'll just unnecessarily depress you). Seek out support groups with other people with BPD (There's good subreddits, I think /r/BPD is one). Focus on reading from those who have BPD themselves, rather than someone else trying to explain it when they've never experienced it.

I *really* liked the book ""Understanding the Borderline Mother""

Branch out beyond just BPD. Learn about why people do the things they do.  The book ""Why Do I Do That"" was great for me. I also like that author's blog. He focused on our base level of shame and how we cope with it. He has a lot more books now, fictional stories exploring psychology, but I haven't read any of them.

Get the ""Dialectical Therapy Workbook"" -- although you may not have access to DBT, the workbook can still be really helpful.

Look into the woman who invented DBT and consider reading her books.

Read my recent comment history to see my other thoughts and experiences on BPD.",workerdaemon,9xuior
41,"Hey! I saw a super helpful comment by u/hurt_kid and I thought it could help you out since you might not have access to DBT.

""DBT teaches two handy skills in this case. One is [distress tolerance](https://www.sunrisertc.com/distress-tolerance-skills/). Basically, if you can't do anything, ride out the storm as best as you can. This can be good when feeling suicidal because those feelings do pass. Three days tops. Which can feel like forever, I know. I do want you to understand that you're talking about some very serious suicidal ideation (which is usually extreme pain + problem solving). It's okay if you need to talk to someone about this. https://crisistext.org has been a lifesaver in the past.


Another thing when not in extreme distress is [emotion regulation](https://www.sunrisertc.com/dbt-emotion-regulation-skills/). I think in this scenario, I'd look at the opposite action idea. That is, feeling os being kidnapped for going outside are a little irrational, so try to act oppositely on emotions when they don't fit the facts (e.g. don't try to act oppositely in a legitimately sad time).

I'm completely isolating myself these days because I'm unable to cope up with my negative emotions and extreme self-criticism. I feel suicidal daily, I keep myself busy but it's not working. I just want to fill up this emptiness I feel and I have started friends with benefit with one of my friend from class, it was limited to make out but now I'm tempted to have sex, I'm still confused about sex whether to have it or not because I can take wrong decisions when I'm depressed and suicidal and it creates a cycle for me. My friend has demanded it too, I don't want to lose him. He's the only one close person in my life right now. I push him away when I feel I can hurt him due to my emotional instability, I can't really leave him. 
I have extreme level of anxiety too. There was this guy I met online on 7cups. He was my listener, we got close and he said something which hurt me. He first said he loves me even when he knew about my fwb. I liked the attention and care he showered on me but I couldn't reciprocate the feelings and something I said hurt him so he said something like "" I'm a joke to you and I'll find a woman who doesn't think like you"" this made me feel abandoned and hurt.

The video begins with a series of questions that serve as red flags for suicidal feelings.  
  
Hospitals are good for keeping people safe but not ideal as therapy resources. I'll give you therapy advice after this suicide prevention info.  
  
The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
  
  
Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down, also a safe hotline. No one will bother you if you call.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yBXl81QPyY&t=7s  
  
What I usually tell people who have a problem with money -  
1) Your GP may be helpful, perhaps in directing your search, helping you with your priorities, or giving you a prescription. You might get help at Mark Cuban's affordable drug company online. This  company is getting a lot of attention lately. Some are saying that it can radically change the drug industry.  
2) There's a variety of things that can help - low-cost, low-risk things that are easy and can be combined with each other. I have advice from experts in my comments.   
  
  
 https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/o52kin/tips\_on\_how\_to\_cope/  
  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEM\_jlDRZI  
  
  
  
3) Do research, including study of the online therapy reviews. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.  
  
Do what you can to get a therapist. You may have to do a lot of research about this. Don't give up. Call your local social services (211?) and ask about Medicaid and Obamacare. Also, you can google ""affordable psychotherapy."" The cost of therapy can vary a lot.

1,"Unfortunately, a provider can’t be forced to take on a specific patient. 

Generally speaking, of the 3 disorders listed, anorexia is by a huge margin the riskiest condition to manage outpatient due to known mortality rates associated with the disorder. 

Add on metabolic and biological processes being impacted by both untreated anorexia and possibly psychiatric medications, I can understand why an outpatient psychiatrist may feel this is out of their scope of practice. 

If treatment for anorexia is an option, that may be a prelude. That care may also be interdisciplinary and can include psychiatry with a specialty focus on intersections of eating disorder and other mental health concerns.",randomlygeneratedadv,smaw06
2,"Talk to a GP - might get a prescription for a mood stabilizer.  
  
As the video shows, teenagers with anorexia do much better with family-based treatment than with individual therapy with office visits.  
  
Something that can help with anorexia and also mood disorders - relaxation.  
  
As this article explains, studies show that relaxation methods help with anorexia, although of course you have to be extremely careful about exercise, as this is usually part of the problem.   
  
https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/the-benefits-of-relaxation-training-in-anorexia-recovery  
  
About relaxation, the research on controlled breathing is amazing. A study with war veterans convinced the VA to recommend this for vets with PTSD.   
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPyiddgWlfE&t=115s  
  
DBT - an excellent therapy for behavior problems - recommends a number of coping methods, including paced breathing.  
  
It's very important to calm down. It's good for you at the dinner table and your parents.  
A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
   
   
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
   
   
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
   
   
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
   
   
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.

  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
   
   
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication. 

  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety and bipolar disorder.  
   
   
Video - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg  -

1,"The ER (IMHO) (CA,USA) is there to isolate the issue, and keep the patient safe. If there’s a rule there that is uncomfortable or seems unnecessary, it’s because it sadly had to become one due to the high rate of SH/SI patients acting out within hospital limits. 

There are generally social workers who work on placement at the ER. I don’t know what psych facilities are like in IL but they vary greatly out here. Total hit or miss as far as care. And you really don’t get any choice on where you’re transferred. 

She may have already seen a psychiatrist or a tele-psych who put her on a hold. 

If you have any questions, any AT ALL, fee free to ask away. I’m unfortunately quite well versed in this area.

2,"I ran into a similar situation with my adult son who lives at home with my husband and me. The patient can sign permission to share info with family members, but the healthcare team’s focus is stabilization in these early days, as they attempt to sort out exactly what is going on. Unless your wife signed consent on admission her care team is likely to be focused on other things and you may just need to ride this out. That said, you may have success with orgs like NAMI who may be able to help you navigate things. 

My son had signed the consent forms and even then it was extremely difficult to get any information during his inpatient stay. 

What I needed most was a “what to expect” /what is the process here type orientation. It was our first journey with inpatient services and we didn’t know a thing. I was finally able to get that after a lot of phone tag. As he has progressed through the outpatient part of his program we have been able to get more involved, even participating in a family program for two days last week.

I can say that this has really made us think differently about healthcare POA’s. It used to be cut and dried: if my dad had a stroke and was unconscious we could speak on his behalf. but what about an adult son in the middle of a psychotic episode who is present, alert and oriented one moment and paranoid and delusional the next?

3,"I accidentally 1013’d myself earlier this year for suicidal ideations and they sent me to a nearby hospital. spent a little over 9 hours there until they took me to a mental health facility. they took my phone and clothes when I got to the hospital, gave them back otw to the facility (the ambulance ppl were nice), then took it again when I got there. I stayed at the facility for about a week before they let me go and they didn’t really help much lol. if I didn’t have insurance I would have been in even more debt so I’d say ask about what your insurance will cover for inpatient care. this might seem dumb but make sure your wife has your phone number memorized so she can use the public phone; I didn’t remember anyone’s numbers but I sure did after I left the place lol. 

you don’t really get a say in anything, everything just kinda happens especially if they have reason to believe that she could be harmful to herself. if she gets transferred to a mental health facility make sure she just stays honest and cooperative or they’ll keep adding days to her inpatient stay. if this is her first time on any meds/antidepressants/etc then they’ll have to keep an eye on her for longer. the place I was at didn’t allow visitors bc of covid so that’s why I just kept calling everyone to let them know what was going on and how I was. they might let you bring some of her essentials over and comfortable clothes; make sure no drawstrings/etc and if you’re bringing shoes then no laces-pretty sure they’ll go over this w you but just wanted to let you know. they’re very picky about what goes in and out of those facilities to make sure no one can hurt themselves or others. pack her a nice thing of underwear socks and something to keep warm. talk to your insurance to see how much this will be. they might be like the facility I was at and have set times for people to use the public phone. the one I was at said 15 mins on the phone per person 3 times a day, but sometimes they would be lenient on that.

10,"As an adult who recently was just in the hospital for the very same thing, and have done this 4 times as a minor, ima walk you through what they do. 

First they isolate you’re wife in a room specific for behavioral health patients. They’ll likely have a doctor and nurse come in a check on her (run blood tests and urine tests). 

After the doctor and nurse have been in a social worker will visit her next and give her a psych evaluation. Through the psych evaluation the social worker will determine wether or not she needs to be admitted (if they’re talking about transferring facilities that means she will be admitted). 

Then it’s a waiting game until there is an open bed in a mental health hospital. Last month I was in the ER 26hours as they waited to place me. It’s not fun, the bouts of anxiety will increase, especially if this is her first time. The doctors will help her with that however, most ERs are very accommodating to behavioral patients who don’t pose a threat to others. 

You most likely will not get a say on where she goes. Not unless she’s been admitted before. 

As for the outcome of where she gets transferred to? It’s a toss up, I’m being serious here. I was hospitalized 4 times as a minor and visited 3 different facilities. The one facility I went to twice was wonderful and helped me so much. The other 2 absolutely horrible. Now the hospitalization as an adult, helpful for the first 3 days and then a vast trauma happened there that I’m now having doctors starting to diagnose me with PTSD.

16,"First of all, I'm so sorry your wife has been struggling. I've been through this twice in my life, ER wait and all. I will say that you both may very well feel a little pushed around by the system, because at its core it's somewhat flawed. But there are always individuals who care - nurses, attendants, doctors who do this because they truly want to help. They're what to focus on.

Some tips: She should be polite but firm in asking for what she needs (water, fresh sheets, information, meeting with the doctor, etc). If possible, check in and ask if she feels heard by the nurses and attendants. Find out if she's getting documentation of meds administered, treatment she receives, etc - physical papers she can hang on to. It can be hard to process so much information at once so she'll be glad to have something to read over again later. The fact that she's there voluntarily means she'll hopefully be more receptive to the programs/groups they offer, and that participation is one thing the doctors like to see.

Ultimately, the experience is so different for everyone that it's hard to say what to expect. But I hope it's helpful for your wife, even a little.

Feel free to PM me if you have any questions at all. And good luck to you both.

Edited to add: For me the ER was by far the worst part of the whole thing. I was in no state to advocate for myself and really needed to, several times. They do their best, but they aren't really equipped for holding psych patients, and that's one of the ways the system is seriously flawed. But once she's through that part (and hopefully she already is), it should get much easier.",gayerthebetter,qvxhqd
17,"I'm not sure about Illinois in particular, but in my corner of the United States she could have a say potentially on where she goes but they don't like to mention that because a lengthy process can take even longer because of that and because the emergency department gets people out for more incoming emergencies.

Hopefully they have someone like a crisis worker coordinating her care because (and no offense meant) ER staff generally don't specialize in mental health.

The default is probably to get her to the first accepting and closest facility for treatment (if she is going into inpatient mental health treatment). Often there are shortages of beds available and then potentially transportation that lead to a wait.

An inpatient mental health unit should help, though, once all that is good. At least to the point in which she is stable enough to follow up with outpatient care.",,qvxhqd
18,"Hey there I work in emergency inpatient care. After the ER can be uncertain but often times they will bring in to an acute inpatient care facility on a 72hr hold (US). You need to be insistent on being a part of the process and making sure you follow along and get started on an ROI ( legal release of information) as well as getting on phone lists wherever she goes. Make sure you have all the right numbers set up for the facility and treatment team. Make sure you get a patient number so you can keep contact at all times. 

After a hold, there is a likely chance of being put on a short term hold until the drs feel she is stable enough for release (in cases like these, that could be 10 days or less). 

These kinds of facilities are only for stability, they aren’t necessarily for therapy. It is the first stepping stone. 

She could easily be released straight from the ER if they don’t believe she is a danger to herself or others or could be asked to check in voluntarily to a therapeutic facility. 

Make sure you get as many resources moving forward as you can. It’s not about just now, it’s about what comes next.",Addisonmorgan,qvxhqd
19,"I self admitted about 5 years ago (in California) they were confused at the ER, but called around and transported me to a MH hospital nearby where I was checked in for a week and kind of left there. Other than nurses checking my vitals at night and being called in for group therapy once a day, nothing much happened. I was given medication for anxiety to keep me from pacing the halls but otherwise was kinda just left to socialize with other patients. I saw an actual Doctor once, for 5 mins who said I an leave if I wanted to.

You can also contact the hospital to ask questions but they won't be able to give you updates on her without her consent.",Sinsemilla_Street,qvxhqd
23,"Sadly, no. You cannot trust the system. I implore both you *and your wife* to be her biggest advocates. However, because she is currently in crisis mode, the majority of that responsibility lies on you right now. This is a great first step, OP. I’m sending you both love and light. 

Immediately call your insurance company and see which mental health facilities are in-network. Google them, but don’t rely on the reviews too much. Just make sure they look like a clean, legitimate facility. If you do not have insurance, unfortunately I don’t know what facility they would transfer her to.

If she is having *just* suicidal ideations and does not have any intent or plan, I don’t see them keeping or transferring her to a facility unless *she wants to be*. They might keep her on a 24-hour psych hold with a chaperone to ensure her safety, but if you both are comfortable with her discharge, they might let her go after that or 48-hours (it’s really state/hospital dependent).

Thinking of both of you. But ultimately, remember this: she did the right thing. And that’s a good thing. That tells me she wants to be here.",keep_it_sassy,qvxhqd
24,"So I worked as a ER RN for many years so I can offer some insight.  They will not treat her.  The ERs job is to R/O a medical issue that would preclude transfer to an inpatient psych.  You have some say in where you go, but inpatient psychiatric beds are EXTREMELY LIMITED in illinois.  The insurance you have will make a difference.  Hospitals technically have to listen to the transfer request, but as a rule a lot don’t take state insurance.  In my experience I’ve seen on average a day to day and a half wait for a bed.  I’ve seen people wait for up to a month in difficult circumstances.  You can expect her to stay 3-4 days at an inpatient psych facility.  The US model for healthcare is to “treat and street”.  This is for all diseases not just mental health.  Inpatient care is incredibly expensive and hospitals try to transition to outpatient care as quickly as possible.  You can expect her to have a visit with a psychiatrist, a couple of counseling appointments, and get a months supply of meds or meds adjusted.  After that they will hopefully set her up with a follow up (if they’re good) or just tell her to follow up (if they’re not).  Let me know if you have other questions.",EugeneDabz,qvxhqd
25,"I self-admitted myself for suicidal thoughts. I ultimately had a positive experience. Part of that is because I was able to go to a good psych ward after my ER visit. Most of it was because I knew something needed to change and I was open to making that change.

If your wife admitted herself, that's a *really* good sign. She wants to live, despite whatever is pushing her towards suicide. She wants to fight. I know it's scary, but trust me, this is a good start.

Ask your wife if she wants any help finding a place for her to seek treatment. If she says yes, get looking up psych wards in the area. If she says no, that she wants to handle it on her own or have her doctors choose for her, then as hard as it will be, you need to respect that.

I really hope your wife can successfully recover, and I wish you the best in your difficult position.",purplepluppy,qvxhqd
26,"I went to the ER yesterday because I was having suicidal thoughts. 

I walked in and said that I’m really depressed and I’m scared I’m going to hurt myself. They checked me in, brought me into a room where a nurse asked me some questions, had me empty my pockets and a police officer checked me for anything hidden. They then brought me to a bed where I changed into hospital scrubs and they took all my belongings and placed them in a safe so I couldn’t harm myself with any of it. From there a doctor came over and got me a dose of my antidepressant I am on, and a nurse came and took a blood and urine sample. A social worker came and talked to me and determined that I was low risk of suicide and that I had these thoughts because I hadn’t been on my medication. I was discharged after about 3 hours. The hospital contacted my school and told them about what happened and I had an appointment with a counselor today.

Every hospital is going to do the same thing, and it is out of safety. The patient has emergency contacts for this exact reason, they may take your phone but they will contact your emergency contact person. Had the social worker determined I was high risk for suicide, they would have admitted me there or to a psychiatric facility for 5-7 days. It’s all about the current risk. Trust the system, they are all there to help her. They will make sure that she is safe and gets the help she needs. They probably don’t know where she will go because the beds are full and they are trying to find an empty bed for her, and they may not know how to handle a long term situation like your wife is in. What I mean by that is they may know how to handle the situation for mediation at that current time, ex a person comes in with a wound, they stop the bleeding and stitch it. That’s what they’re doing, but they might not know how to handle the situation long term after “the stitch”.

TL;DR, trust the system. They are there to help her",SlothyDoorMatt,qvxhqd

So far my experience has been identical to yours.You're totally right about the difficulty in getting any information, and I 100% agree with your last paragraph. I feel like nobody in this system realizes how problematic it is for a patient to not only lose their freedom, but have virtually all authority stripped from themselves and loved ones. My spouse had no authority to speak for herself, I couldn't speak on her behalf until she signed a form, and they heavily medicated her before she had the opportunity to sign. How is that ok?

49,"Good luck to you! I am finding the outpatient program to be a lot different and better than the inpatient phase. They still will require patient consent to share info, but the patients are in a lot better place to be able to process the pros and cons and give consent. The case managers are a good bit more communicative as well.  
The one thing I have learned about outpatient: it is a HELL of a lot of work for the patient, but if they lean in they can make tremendous progress. It took my son a few days to begin to trust the team in the outpatient setting but once he did he really started to accelerate his progress. He was to the full day program and by the end of the day, he was exhausted, but he was still hypomanic for most of it so he kept powering through. He graduated to the part time program and shortly after his switch flipped to depressed. The exhaustion has reached an entirely new scale. Early on, I was driving him to/from the program because he wasn't in the right headspace to drive. 

I share this with you to help you manage expectations for what to expect when she comes home. We have agreed that the ONLY expectations of him at this point are 1) to get out of bed each day and 2) participate in program. Anything else is a bonus. If he can drive himself, great. If not, we will drive him. Every day is still a struggle as we work to get the meds right and get him feeling better.

Finally, one thing that I hadn't anticipated was my son's need to process and understand his inpatient experience. He was highly paranoid, detoxing from THC and nicotine and delusional. He's still not sure what was imagined and what was real. I hope your wife's experience is different, but be prepared that there may be some lingering things she needs to work through relative to her recent experience.",GArockcrawler,qvxhqd

I understand that doctors are supposed to help in those situations-it’s the same thing I did when I felt suicidal-but it just ended up causing me more issues and no one likes being held up in those places lol. I’m glad they let you talk to her; hopefully she’ll only be in there a week tops if they don’t find anything else wrong. I definitely believe that the facilities like that try to keep a patient in there well past what their insurance will cover for inpatient care. if I had been in there for one day LESS, my insurance would have covered everything and I wouldn’t have to pay shit, but that one extra day owed me a couple hundred lololol.

That being said, we have graylands mental health campus which is a completely different kettle of fish but generally its reserved for people with more complex needs.. 

The only Private clinic i know of in WA is like a country club for the rich and shameless.. but they dont even take in anyone who is actively suicidal.. after visiting a friend who was staying i swear most of the people were just taking a holiday lol.. its like chalk and cheese comparing the two.. but they actually were a lot stricter than the public wards ive been in",hotdigetty,qvxhqd

0,"Yes, people who have agoraphobia sometimes react to feared situations with a panic attack.

Also, because panic attacks tend to be unpredictable, people can develop a phobia about some situation in which there was an attack. Someone can have a phobia about taking a shower because he had an attack while showering.

You can get professional help for this, but some people prefer self-help for phobia. The reason is that a therapist's time is costly, and the program may proceed faster than the client is comfortable with.

One approach to exposure therapy is using slow breathing to get good and relaxed, then imagine the feared situation. This lets you associate the feared situation with relaxation. You can start by imagining a fairly easy situation and progress to more challenging ones in other sessions.

Psychiatrist David Burns is the self-help author recommended most often by mental health professionals.

Basically, therapy for phobias, explained in The Feeling Good Handbook by David Burns, is making a list of situations, ranking them according to how scary you find them, and using that ranked list as your objectives. Imagining a situation can be an objective. Start with something really, really easy. 

The thing to remember is, never go from objective A to objective B until you feel completely confident with A. Things that give you confidence are experience and slow breathing. There's enormous laboratory and clinical evidence  that slow breathing is effective for calming people down quickly.  

Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of their slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is therapy. Early morning and bedtime is best for this.The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.",RWPossum,1bc4j71

A study by a researcher named Meuret at Southern Methodist University showed that a biofeedback method called CART that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self-help successfully.

There's a treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It's teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms - for example by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise.",RWPossum,1bc4j71

1,"When someone has depression- that is their world. For a person with depression- it's all about me, me I'm bad, I'm doing something wrong, I'm inseure and so on. That's the perspective.

Now they have to shift that perspective outwards. Pets help for this exact reason- you have something that relies on you. You have to feed it, clean it, you have to bear responsibility and that shifts the perspective outwards - even if it is for small periods of time. 

Try to make them feel useful and relied on, but still keep the person accountable (u have to be VERY careful with that tho- cuz it can be counter-productive).  Start with the first two- ask the person for very small and subtle things- something that takes literally 5 seconds and no thinking but they still have to get out of bed and maybe go outside. Then move onto some bigger things- it will help if you live together. If you don't live together - something small that takes 5 seconds would be- can you send me picture of the clouds from outside- or something stupid whatever works for you.

I hope this gives you some ideas. Don't give up. And definetly talk to ta them- but when you do encourage their good behavior and focus on the positive things. If you focus on the negative it can have huge impact on them and be counter-productive -  so again careful.",pistealth0,10crov8
2,"Thank you so so much for the suggestions. The cloud picture already worked. I do have to ask though, when you say bigger things would you mind giving an example of what exactly I could do? We don’t live together.",banskush,10crov8
3,"It could be anything really. The cloud thing was off the top of my head. It really depends on what they're interested in. You can be creative- also the cloud thing is really neat because it kind of makes the person look at something pretty like the sky and it can be a regular thing (but don't get too anoying with it- I would say every time you know your partner is in bed scrolling on their phone- you can use it- I would say optimally- every 3-4 days- so it's subtle) And also maybe ask them for a word you don't remember- ""what's the thing on the end of the shoe lace called?"" Make them feel useful.

For bigger things I was having in mind something like- can you help me throw out the trash, or can you help me find something in the house- but those are for when you live together.

Off the top of my head - maybe draw something on a piece of paper - and make em draw something else. Or maybe write on a piece of paper 3 things that start with the letter N.  It has to be paper- no phone. It has to be something real- that you can touch and feel.  If they like flowers it could be a picture of a flower, leaf, bug - anything to get them out of their head and preferably outside. I would say that would be the next step.

And from there you can transition into something bigger- and by bigger I mean it takes more and more effort and focus. Also if the thing benefits you or someone else they care about it's perfect.

If they are the romantic type - tell em let's say to find you the nicest leaf - or clover, or something like that- the more nature is involved - the better. Tell them you need it for something and it's important. And thank them when they do it- small favours makes someone feel useful.

It all depends on your siuation, where you live, what you do, any hobbies or something. Be creative and whatever you ask for be extra grateful and make it seem like a big deal even tho is a small favour! good luck! And maybe hit me up with an update!",pistealth0,10crov8

Can you or someone call and maybe find that out to ease your anxiety over it? If they allowed at least the patch (I know it's not the same and it still sucks) I'd say it would make me feel better.  Either way... from what you explained i really feel it's time to go get stabilized.  Hugs",Nadia_Cee,188rgrj
8,"It sounds like you're going through an incredibly tough time, and it's really important that you're considering seeking help. When you're feeling this overwhelmed, and it's affecting your daily life to this extent, reaching out to professionals can be a crucial step. It's understandable to worry about how you'll cope without your vape or the impact of hospitalization on your relationship, but your well-being must come first.

Remember, the hospital staff are there to support you and can help you through the withdrawal from vaping if that's part of your treatment. They're also trained to help you find strategies to manage without it.

If the cost of therapy is a barrier, you might look into community mental health services that offer support on a sliding scale or even for free. Many areas have hotlines or services that can guide you to affordable options.

Taking that step to go to the hospital can be scary, but it can also be the beginning of getting the support you need to start feeling better. You deserve that chance. Your health and peace of mind are invaluable, and getting help is a brave and important step towards recovery.",The_Mindful_Warrior,188rgrj
0,"Recovery doesn't happen overnight, but when you're doing the right things you should be able to expect steady improvement.  
  
There's a simple thing that helps in more ways than one. Relaxation eases the symptoms of depression. It helps us in getting to sleep. In a moment of crisis, it makes us feel better and helps us to think clearly.   
  
The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
  
The famous Mayo Clinic mentions relaxation at bedtime in its insomnia article. Of all the Asian methods, slow breathing is the one with the best evidence for helping people.  
  
  
About support from others, our friends are not therapists but friendship is great therapy.  
  
Our friends will sometimes try to be therapists, but it should be left to the professionals. Friends can help us take our minds off our problems for a while, which is very good. If you don't feel like talking much, there are things that don't require a lot of talk - watching movies with a friend and playing games. Especially helpful - going for walks with a friend.",RWPossum,17njmff

I kind of felt hopeless at that point, and spent well over a month procrastinating and not doing anything. However, what helped was having time alone.  ""Me time"" as some would call it. Just take a moment to sit, cry, think, whatever you need to really get what you're feeling out. Maybe take a walk outside if you're feeling up to it.

1,"Depression means your brain is not producing the chemicals you need to feel any kind of motivation. 

When one reaches that point- when depression becomes major depression, when it becomes physical/chemical, no amount of self-care or exercise or philosophizing is going to “cure” you. 

It’s like trying to spray Windex from an empty bottle and then blaming yourself that the glass never gets clean.

At that point, you need to find a psychiatrist to help you figure out what kind of meds your brain needs to function more healthily. No shame in taking meds. 

It’s a journey, but once you find the right meds, it’s feels like life’s difficulty setting gets changed from “tenth play-through of Dark Souls” back to “normal.” 

A brain with major depression is like a broken arm or a severed leg… it will not heal on its own.

Major depression doesn’t mean a person is sad and mopey- depression is no sadness, no happiness, no motivation… no nothing… it’s boredom. Total boredom. Bc nothing hits. Bc it can’t hit. Bc your brain is sick. 

Major depression is a serious medical condition.

I have it, too. I’m not ashamed. 

You shouldn’t be, either.

It’s not your fault. You didn’t ask to be sick.

I found this post bc of your recent post on unpopular opinion… I saw the thread where people were being super judgmental and saying you’re probably an unpleasant person to be around… and that’s just not fair to you at all.

Some people act like they’re so woke on mental health awareness and suicide prevention then turn right around and tell some stranger they’re worthless based on a reddit post. Incredible.

I hope you did not take their words to heart, and I hope you don’t mind me chiming in on this post.

Every day blended together into one monotonous lifetime. 

Then, summer break came.

My mom told me to check my school email to see if my final report card came in. When I checked it, I saw an email from a classmate:

""Hey. This is [name] from Computer Tech. and Bio-Chem. I wanted to get your number before school ended so we could get to know each-other over the summer, but I didn’t really have it in me to approach you in-person, so here’s my number if you’re interested.""

I'm an atheist, but in that moment, I thanked God. I've told this story so many times, but I can't convey how happy I was in that moment. I immediately texted him and we talked for a while and he seemed really nice. Eventually, he introduced me to all of his friends, who were really nice as well.

15,"I lost my soulmate ten years ago. Her name was Celeste, and she was the most kind, thoughtful, and beautiful woman I've ever known. She was tragically and brutally murdered in the summer of 2012. 
The grief and the depression that followed after her passing was paralyzing. I felt lost and hopeless and didn't care about living or dying. 
One night I was unable to sleep due to my depression and I went to a housing project in the worst area of town around 3 am to buy Xanax. As I was walking through the hallway of the apartment building, I heard footsteps behind me and I was hit over the head with something. I scuffled with the guy who hit me and grabbed what was in his hand. As soon as I felt it, I realized it was a gun. It was now pointed at my head and he pulled the trigger. The gun clicked, but didn't fire. We both stood there in stunned silence for a couple of seconds, and then the dude ran out of the building like he just saw a ghost. I looked down the hallway and saw an image of Celeste standing there looking as beautiful as ever. I have no doubt that Celeste, working through God, saved my life that night. The police and paramedics didn't believe that was true. The police said I grabbed the slide of the weapon, which prevented the gun from firing and the paramedics said that the concussion I sustained made me think I saw something that didn't exist. I was there and they weren't, so I know what I saw. 
My whole life and prospective changed after that night. Celeste always encouraged me to go to school and I never listened to her when she was here. So, I enrolled in college and double majored in criminal justice and human and social services. I decided to devote my life to helping others in order to keep Celeste's memory and beautiful spirit alive.

It’s very complicated, it’s like the night of my breakthrough got split by the trigger, so my mind was opening up to the sensitivity of true love, but then got split and traumatized, so I feel this fragmented love and almost some sort of hatred-like aversion for my dog, when I know if the trigger never happened I would just love and adore the shit out of him, along with my girlfriend and mom, and now this trigger has developed in the same way for them.

It is a shame. If this trigger didn’t happen I would’ve healed snd been fully connected and shared so much love with my girlfriend and mom and friend (and dog). But now this broken attachment has manifested in such a disgusting way where I can’t feel connected even how used to when I did my OCD routine and certainly not how I would have if I had had my breakthrough.

I can humor you and see if he’s around to spend some time with, but I still see it as my future and life trajectory and brain chemistry and mind and body and heart and soul have been destroyed forever.

I appreciate your continued input.

0,"Here is my two cents

**You state here**: *It started very suddenly in September of 2020 for what I assume was me lagging behind on schoolwork because I walked into the lions' den by starting to play video games during breaks, which then little by little grew until I was faced with more assignments than I was used to (in retrospect it was only like 3 late ones which to me feels pathetic now lol but it was so overwhelming at the time that I avoided it and it grew exponentially). Ever since that relatively small event I felt like there was something wrong with me, like something clicked:*

This sounds to me like an **inner perfectionist/critic** that created **anxiety** that you then used avoidance ( video games) till you got overwhelmed and it created a cycle. At the root of OCD is anxiety. The OCD is the way the brain avoids the anxiety with magical thinking. 

You cant ignore it because it wont go away but you can dismantle the cognitive distortions that are creating the loop and rein in your anxiety and inner gremlins.

&#x200B;

good luck !",strange-seraphim,13llgz5
1,"Haha my inner gremlins lol.

I wonder if it's possible to deflate the perfectionistic and OCD tendencies to a normal, healthy level permanently (assuming I don't artificially create it again, but I think even average Joe's can create anxiety through nurture). I hear a lot that my problem will forever be there and I just need to cope, but that sounds like bs to me, like they think it's just a gene or that upbringing is permanent.

Also thanks for portraying it as dismantling the thought loop, many have described it as ignoring it until it goes away and that never say right with me. I guess the way forward is a gradual disassembly of the previous OCD tendency, with the help of meds for a little while, until I'm back to a new normal where I have a stronger resilience to perfectionism and am more carefree.

There are all kinds of things that can trigger and exacerbate anxiety and some of those are health related. Western medicine is fucking AWFUL at getting to the root cause of problems. I’ve read plenty of stories where people don’t respond to medicines and that’s because the medicine is just acting as a bandaid and isn’t stopping the the thing causing the “pain”. 

If normal medicines and therapy aren’t working I would do a full heavy metal and parasite detox. I’d also get proper blood, vitamin, iron studies done and Thyroid studies done. Like proper. Not just TSH but the full shebang. There’s all kinds of scientific data that shows that these kind of imbalances can causes severe anxiety, depression and panic attacks. Have a little read about Hashimotos and panic attacks etc.. 

These physical issues can also hinder how well proper mental health medications work. So sometimes sorting them out is the first step for your other medication to work.

2,"hi!! As someone (26 y.o., female) who has been in two residential/'rehab' type facilities (one for 1 month in 2017 when I was 23 and one for 3 months when I was 25 last year)... I can say it can be amazingly helpful when you truly feel 'stuck.' However, that being said I know I am/was privileged to have the treatment I have had. Even though I am an adult, I am not financially independent quite yet (mostly due to my mental health learning disabilities, although I am a student)... anyways the point is that my parents were able to pay for treatment for me. I know not everyone has that opportunity. 

So, let's just say you can't pay for inpatient rehab. If that's the case, I would suggest accepting that whether you were to go inpatient or stay home, hard work is come, regardless. If you want to get better (which I'm guessing you do), first thing's first:

1) You need to be completely honest with not only yourself/the the people of reddit, but also your therapist and psychiatrist. 

2) If you're not physically addicted, but are mentally/behaviorally, you need to wean yourself off of the alcohol, with the goal being 100 percent abstinence. I'm not saying no alcohol forever, I don't know you personally, but maybe an alcohol 'break'? Idk, just a thought. I hardly drink anymore (granted I was never 'addicted') because of my bipolar meds and borderline personality disorder (BPD + alcohol, in my experience, is a bad combo, often dangerous). Find friends to support your sobriety. Or your family. Or religion. Or a support group. Your cat, your dog. Anything!

3) Find someone, maybe your therapist, maybe a family member or friend, to help you get organized and create a schedule for yourself. Structure helps me so much, especially w/ depression and ADHD.

4) I'm saying this cause you have BPD but also because really it can help anyone-- DBT therapy changed my life. Not at first, but with time!! Cheesy, but I really mean it.

5) Be open to taking meds or even trying TMS (I got insurance to cover it outpatient for me)... I realized, at this with a diagnosis like bipolar/depression, I cannot be successful without meds. And that's okay.

**Anyways,  hope this helps. If it doesn't no worries, maybe it'll help someone else!!! GOOD LUCK**",kmac2018,nw1orx
3,"Hi! I am also bipolar 1, although a few years older than you. I don't drink so unfortunately I can't offer advice there... but I want to say that inpatient was only helpful to me in the sense that it got me on the right track to get me on meds and with a psychiatrist. But that was pretty much it. It took a long time to find the right meds for me - I also had the zombie issue with various meds. Others caused blunted emotions which sucked as well. I am on what I would consider the ""perfect"" cocktail right now and I feel pretty good... but it took a lot of trial and error. It's just a matter of not giving up and having a good psychiatrist. You need to be honest with the psychiatrist or you won't get the help you need.

In your case I think an inpatient detox rehab program combined with a psych program might help get you on the right track. I think you need to get off the alcohol - I am pretty sure alcohol makes the zombie effect of the meds 10x worse.

I wish you the best. Don't give up on medication. You really need it when you are bipolar and when you find the right meds you will feel SO much better. It is life changing.",insignificant_am_i,nw1orx

Even if by some miracle they did, and chose not to hire you for that, that is illegal as hell. Refusing to hire someone based on a disability is a violation of US employment law.

I guess the biggest question one needs to ask themselves is, do I want help? If you don't, that is up to you. If you do, spilling the beans about your personal info to a trained professional is extremely private, and according to your initial post, you are 16 years old so all those records should be sealed when you are 18 anyway.

A little personal background on me, I was committed at 17 for suicide attempts and homicidal thoughts. Got help, put all my issues in remission, and never ever had a problem getting a job in high tech fields and am super happy in life now and don't even take meds anymore and haven't for years now.",Khuzah,ryousx

I hated 1:1 therapy.  I hated inpatient treatment.  But the IOP that was 9-1 was the best thing I went through in my mental health journey.  I was also worried about it, like you are, but to be honest with myself, I needed it to get through.  Nothing else was working.

I was hesitant, but it really did help me to just open up and try to gain something from it.  It was difficult to share with a bunch of strangers, but it was necessary, because nothing else was working for me.

0,"It is normal and it is not normal, let me just say as an older brother who has been in hospital and had suicidal tendencies, he is almost 100% copying your behaviour.

He will see how you have reacted to things and will do the same.

It's very rare a 9year old had the emotional capability to understand suicide or the severity of what it takes. 

I have seen this behaviour in families before, even with other things like ADHD or OCD, I have seen younger siblings almost mimic mental illness that is in their family.

This is not me blaming you for his actions this is me saying you don't need to worry, he is just a kid he will grow out of it, just be a positive big brother and a good role model for him to aspire too don't spend time worrying about him leaving, spend time making the most of his presence

Tomorrow may never come to anyone :)",smashyland44,aqdf6b
1,"Hi there. I can relate to this and I am so sorry for you. However, there is hope. When I was in middle school (7th grade), my older brother (9th grade) began talking about suicide. It completely devastated me. I remember crying and begging him not to leave me here alone. I told him that I couldn't make it without him, and we had a discussion about why he felt the way that he did. Please don't get me wrong here. By no means am I saying that you should beg and plead. Instead, I would recommend being there for him. Don't constantly check on him out of paranoia---do it out of love, and make sure that is known to him. You value him even when he doesn't value himself. Let him know that you care for him and be his friend. That's all most of us need. To love and to be loved. I am now 20 years old and my brother turned 23 in December. We both still struggle with mental health issues but we know that we will always have each other. ",linszay,aqdf6b
2,"Honestly, I agree with the other comment here. The best thing you can do for him is to just be there. That being said, OMG you sound like such a lovely sister! I wish I had siblings like you. Good luck to you and lots of hugs! <3",Fenrir-2003,aqdf6b
3,"I’m the oldest of 4 boys, I’m almost 26. I spent age 18-24 in the Navy, and wasn’t there for a lot of things an older brother should have been there for, like the second oldest of us going through opioid addiction and suicidal attempts as a teen high schooler. I was going through my own mental trials and tribulations far from home, but one thing that I learned from moving from having 3 brothers to having 83 of them was how important it was to be a model for them to work off of. I always communicated my issues to my parents back at home when I could, and the senior sailors around me who had faced similar challenges. Even though I felt like I was weak, I appeared strong even from a distance, and that helped give my brother something to set his sights on. This upcoming March 31st he’ll have been clean for 4 years, and we live together. Now, having lasting mental health issues from the Navy, my younger brother is looking out for me. There are very few things in the universe as strong as a brotherhood, you are each other’s reason for doing, and being. Communicate, clearly and meaningfully. As an older brother, no matter what, give your younger brother something to strive for, because once you show him the way, he could be the one that does the same for you. ",deafwishh,aqdf6b
4,"In my honest opinion I understand where you are coming from i really do. I think the best thing you can do for yourself and for your brother is for you to become closer, bond with him and make good memories and have fun. Build a great bond with him because having somebody there with you is always great :) ",,aqdf6b
5,"That's a lot to go through.  Whatever it is that you might get out of this thread I hope it's positive enough that it's some encouragement over the longer term for you to keep reaching out.  There's no set age where any given person has to face up to something that's sort of lacking in pop cultural scripts for how you're supposed to approach it, but that's what I think you're facing right now.  When you're in a situation like that, it can really help to find people who can just hear you say your words and reflect them back to you compassionately.  When you don't know what to do, you don't necessarily just need someone else to fix the problem for you, what you need is your own understanding of it.  Putting your uncertainty out there with the right people who can just recognize it and express care without having to take control of it can really help you build that up for yourself.  I'm sorry you're having to face that at this point in your life, but there is growth and knowledge and wisdom that can come out of it, as awful as it might be.

>I feel like I have to check on him all the time, especially before I go to bed , or after he gets really angry.

That sounds healthy on the face of it.  You care about him.  Being physically present is a way to express that.  

He is probably a bit too young to be able distinguish for himself and clearly communicate whether what you're doing feels good for him, or whether he wants more of it.  You can probably pick up on signs of that if you look out though.  Does it seem to calm him down when you do that?  Maybe often does but sometimes he seems to want to be alone?  I'm asking because being there and being comforting towards him matters, *AND* it's something to keep in mind to keep your eye on whether your sense of how you want to do that seems to be in sync with what's working for him.  It's not rocket science, in fact it's a bit the opposite of science, it's best done by feel.  You can also ask him for input, just keeping in mind that at 9 his ability to put words to it will probably be limited.  He may still really appreciate being treated like a real person in that way though.

I'd also recommend really keeping an eye on your own state.  You're 16.  You're doing a very mature and humane thing by reaching out like this and in the actions that you describe having already taken.  I hope that you can find a way to do that and maybe really let it grow into something special within you, and also have some teenage years for yourself at the same time.  How you do that is up to you but I can offer some concrete recommendations to keep yourself on track with that if you want.

Good luck and thanks for what you're doing.",incredulitor,aqdf6b
6,"That's interesting, a teacher caught me trying to choke myself to death with a window cord when I was 7, and nothing ever came of it other than a visit to a psychologist.  I guess your school cares about the mental health of its students.  How abnormal.

Frankly, there are ENORMOUS psychological/biological barriers to killing yourself.  That's why I'm here typing this.  I'm not saying he will be perfectly fine, I don't know you , but by and large suicide attempts don't come out of nowhere.  It's possible he could think about killing himself 100 times in a day, and then just manage to forget about it and go to bed.  This might happen more than you realize, it happens more than society realizes.  Keeping open communication between you two will do the most in terms of suicide prevention.",Othernamewentmissing,aqdf6b

It sounds like you experienced a traumatic loss in your 8th grade friend. You may be experiencing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: the intrusive and overwhelming fear and unwelcome reminders of the trauma/loss, the vigilant checking.

9,"As a younger sibling who had suffered through suicidal tenancies (and still do to soms extent) the biggest thing I wish my brother did and something that he is working on now is just talking to me. He was never home in high school and he never checked in on me. It very much felt like I was an only child and had to suffer through it alone.

Talk to him. It means a lot. Even if it's not any deep or meaning full conversation. Talking to my brother about video games or our dogs and even just sending each other memes helps me out so much, especially on hard days and it reminds me that he is there for me even if he's not here physically. ",punkassunicorn,aqdf6b

11,"I know when I was hospitalized when I was 16 my brother would cry every night. He took it really hard. When I came home he made me promise him that I had to tell him everything, which as his older sister I 100% did not do. There are just certain things I didn't want to tell him. Me and my brother are only 21 months apart. Just a bit over being irish twins. We had a falling out when I was 18 and he was 16. I moved in with my boyfriend at the time and my mom's abuse shifted on to him. I blame myself for him becoming so depressed. Last year I had my daughter, I have my life what I consider to be together, even though I'm still young (relatively) I'm 23 about to be 24. Like I said me and my brother are very close. If he had a bad dream he would come into my my room and wake me up and keep me up all night instead of say my mom. He would make sure I would come to his sports games. I made a lot of sacrifices for him so that he would never be alone i.e. sacrificed what little social life and personal life I had to make sure he was ok. Very recently my brother had basically a mental breakdown for lack of a better description. I made him stay at my house for the night this happened as he had gotten into a fight with my mother. He told me the only person he ever had to talk to or really knew how to talk to was me, I was the only person he could be himself with. That wasn't news, I always knew this because he is very introverted. He then went on to tell me that he feels less obligated to tell me when he's depressed because I have a child of my own I need to worry about and that he doesn't want to be my burden. Not in a manipulative way, he was just scared about feeling so alone. What I've learned from this is that as a big sister I will always worry about him. I find myself thinking about him just as much as I think about my daughter. it's just an instinct. You can't live vicariously through your brother, nor should you worry too much about him although I understand that feeling of desperation. I've had dreams about losing my brother to the point where I wake up sobbing and my whole day is ruined. I'll leave you with something very important I was told at the beginning of becoming a parent. In order to be good to anyone you must be good to yourself first. It is hard to detach yourself from someone you care about so much but believe me it's healthy for you both. I hope this helped.

13,"You need to break your thought pattern somehow. Your thought pattern is like a circle. When you feel yourself obsessing over your brother you need to break the thought pattern.

Because both you and your brother are amazingly strong people. ",rcg8594,aqdf6b
14,"It made me so happy to hear he's doing better now! Hang in there man, you're doing an amazing job, just make sure you let him know how much you love him every chance you get. Because even if he's not unhappy, there's still not enough love in this world ",tooshortfk15tirelire,aqdf6b
15,"Hi, hope everything is working out right now my dude.
To be completely honest I can't relate to your story, since I'm not that close to my older brother, but I think that it's admirable that you are that worried and feel so much love for your brother.
While I can't really give some motivational advice like the rest of the comments (like god damn you got stories from veterans how am I going to top that) I can say this.
The suicide from 3 years ago was not your fault (since you were 13 then and 16 now I'm assuming it's 3 years) you can't blame yourself for something you had no control over, so don't beat yourself up over it. Second I'm sure your brother loves you to bits too and checking on him is normal considering what you've been through, just make sure that he knows how important you are to him. Suicidal thoughts (at least the ones that I've had) can sometimes be pushed by the thought that ""no one will notice, care if you do it family-wise"" or that ""no one will miss you when you're gone so might as well get it over with"". So my ultimate advice is be the person that he can use as a shield against these thoughts, make sure that he knows you love him and will miss him.
I hope that when you're older the both of you can sit together and laugh about this someday. I think that you're a wonderful sister (kinda jealous to be fair but keep it a secret).
Hope this helps!",Lucian_Azratron,aqdf6b

I think every victim of childhood trauma should see this -  
  
In this video, author Anna Runkle talks about her study of CPTSD and summarizes treatments shown to help. She says that as a CPTSD survivor, the thing she has found most helpful to her is dealing with the symptom known as dysregulation, which is getting very upset. I would definitely see her videos on dysregulation.

Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that’s most responsive to self-help.   
  
I heard someone say that although slow breathing is good for moments of panic, the attacks keep coming back. So, it looks like cognitive therapy is also helpful. Cognitive therapy for panic disorder involves understanding what the attack is. The symptoms are nothing but your system's natural responses to whatever seems threatening. You shouldn't get upset about them. You don't worry about fast heartbeat when you run, and there's no reason to fear it with a panic attack. Source - When Panic Attacks by Dr, David Burns..  
  
You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need. This could help you with your problem.  
  
Psychology Today online says that Dr. Dave Carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias and the author of three self-help books, including Panic Attacks Workbook.  
  
In this video, Dr. Carbonell demonstrates a breathing exercise that he says is helpful for panic attacks.  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIV2R3jzaQ&t=49s  
  
  
One of the best treatments is time. You know the old saying ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" After a while, the attacks are seen as a nuisance instead of a threat.  
  
I’ll tell you about two other things that you probably won’t need. It’s good to know they’re there if you need them.  
  
A study by a researcher named Meuret at Southern Methodist University showed that a biofeedback method called CART that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self-help successfully.  
  
There's a treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It's teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms - for example by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise.",RWPossum,ttdoc3
3,"Same. For me , I was hyperventilating. I carried around a lunch bag size brown paper bag, folded up, in my pocket for awhile. If I felt like that, I’d breathe in and out of it. The trick is to learn to control your breathing. I’m sure there are tons of things online - YouTube, articles, etc on how to breathe to prevent hyperventilation. I learned years and years and years ago but it’s a continuing process of practice. It -the breathing techniques - also helps with relaxation.",Cushla1957,ttdoc3
4,Yes. I’ve had panic attacks so severe I *did* pass out. The first time was the first day of a new job and they called 911 and everything. It was one hell of a first impression.,blobfish_brotha,ttdoc3
5,"Thank you so much! I'll definitely give those a look, and that's perfect because I also don't have apple. And yeah, I'm learning that with my outpatient OCD program 😅",MamaTried-Me,ttdoc3
6,"This is wonderful, thank you! I follow Lysa Terkeurst on Facebook-what a fabulous person. The Highly Sensitive Person is also on my bookshelf - literally!!",Cushla1957,ttdoc3
7,"Thanks so much for all of that! I'll check out that video too. And that makes sense, I remember my former therapist mentioning she made her husband go hiking to get his heart rate up a lot and to hit with it!",MamaTried-Me,ttdoc3
8,"Interesting you should mention slow, shallow breathing. There is a company, Freespira, who provides, well, biofeedback I guess, though they don’t use that term. They send a pre-programmed tablet, a nasal cannula, and small containers of ?, haha. Small containers of something that helps measure your breathing. I got 5. Put that together twice a day and you are taught to breath in more and more shallow and short, more and more long and deep on the exhale. You breath in sync with the tones from the tablet. 

Free for me when approved by insurance. Kept it for 4 weeks. As the weeks progress, you breathe learn to more and more shallow. And the tablet program shows you how deep or how shallow your breathing is, for a 15 minute period. 

It’s fascinating. I really thought this type of breathing would make me hyperventilate. It did not. Several years later and I still practice this breathing, though it’s still difficult to deploy it when I need to. 

Anyway, there’s that. They have a website of course.",Cushla1957,ttdoc3
9,"Ah, I meant to add that I don't hyperventilate with my panic attacks! Sorry about that. But yeah, I'll do some looking and see if I can find anything, sometimes hearing it first hand from others with their experiences. Thank you!",MamaTried-Me,ttdoc3
10,Oh man 😭,MamaTried-Me,ttdoc3
11,"Sorry, but I have to be skeptical, although a lack of evidence does not necessarily mean something doesn't work.

By ""work"" this can mean the placebo effect.

As I said, panic does respond to self-help, and I wonder how many people can learn good breathing without CART.",RWPossum,ttdoc3
12,"How do you know you’re not hyperventilating? I have the art of hyperventilating down to a science, ha!, so I can’t imagine what the opposite sensation would be.",Cushla1957,ttdoc3
13,"You know, what’s really great about Reddit, and this particular sub, is that we can all have opinions and can share them without being faulted. Freespira did indeed teach me a different way to breathe. And when I’m laying in bed at night I use this breathing to settle and relax. Placebo effect? I don’t think so but if it works for me then I’ll take it. 

I’ve been struggling with panic attacks for 45 years, before they had a name (at least in my area). There are lots of tools, and of course we each have success with some and not so much with others. I’m thinking I’ve tried most of not all of them. Self-help is great but I don’t think it’s an end all be all.

Nothing is. I’m a testament to that. After more of my life with panic than without, I’m thinking my brain doesn’t know any other way to be. 

I just reread your initial post. I read it wrong the first time, I thought you’d said that slow breathing *is* a good method to deal with panic. (Actually you said both things…) Regardless, if it helps  take away that feeling for the short term, I’m going to utilize it as one of my tools. 

My negative mindset tells me I’m too far gone for removing panic altogether. But then there’s the hopeful side of me. 

YMMV

Edit: what’s CART? I get the gist, but what is the meaning of the acronym?  And exposure therapy absolutely sucks. 

I haven’t yet watched the video you posted. I’ll do that later today. 

I do know people for whom time and stress management and other tools have completely freed them of this insidious thing. And that’s the hope, isn’t it?",Cushla1957,ttdoc3

I've also been in an outpatient day program like you're speaking of, and me and my fellow patients just say, ""when we were inpatient"" or something along those lines.
Saying ""psych ward"" kinda scares me, I'm not offended by it, but something about ""ward"" makes me uncomfortable. For my first stay I refer to it as the psych unit.. I'm not sure why I've switched it up so much. Haha. This is a good question, though! Got me thinking. <3",uhlanuhlynn,54g72h
1,"I'm cynical, and if my dad had said that, It would make me think he was trying to convince himself of that more than trying to put me at ease. (Not in a hateful way, my dad has been the most supportive person in my life) but my dad feels a whole lot of guilt about all of it. Blames himself and what not. 

I think the people around us, most of them anyway, are trying. They want to help and want to make us feel better but they don't understand. 
""Just be happy"" seems perfectly reasonable to them because..they just..wake up..happy. Which is such a foreign concept. For me atleast. I don't really know why I've branched off into this topic. 

I guess my convoluted ass brain decided that your dad said no one thinks you're crazy, or something along those lines.. of speaking for others. I don't know if you feel this way or not, but since we seem similar... I honestly don't really care if they think I'm crazy, cause.. I kind of am. But not in a bad way. 
In my most recent stages of therapy, a therapist told me, ""I don't think you're crazy.. the people (ie. my mom/sister) who aren't getting help are the crazy ones."" 
I've actually gotten somewhat abrasive with my explanations. 
""Where have you been?""
""Oh, I was admitted to the psych ward. My crazy was acting up again.""
""Oh....*stutter* well..are... you okay now?""
""Yeah! I'm a lot better. I don't wanna throw myself in front of moving traffic anymore so that's a good thing!""
People usually laugh and realize I'm being lighthearted about it, or it freaks them out and I don't have to worry about having another conversation about it with them.""

9,"The stigma is created by using shaming language like ""mental illness"" which implies the person is inferior/ill.  When really these are persons accused of ""bad""/immoral things which they practically all deny and there is no actual evidence they're guilty. 

The truth is no behavior/feeling is an illness just because people pretend it is.  No one is ""mentally ill."" People can have mental conditions.

Calling so-called ""mental hospitals"" anything but a prison is a lie.  Calling it a ""hospital"" is actually creating the stigma by assuming/pretending these are brain damaged ""mentally ill"" people, when in reality these are fake/imaginary illnesses and these are people just accused of something ""bad""/immoral without evidence (ie conviction) of any c rime.  They're just assumed guilty.

10,"I have a little story that I need to figure out how to tell correctly, because it's going in my novel, but here's the main idea: 14 years old, christmas break from school, lots of drinking, suicide attempt. I had been in the guidance counsellor's office all semester and he kept telling my parents I needed to be in the hospital and they didn't believe him. But so on January 4th, I think, I made a very serious attempt. I'm through the ER, done with the charcoal, and I'm being transferred to a unit close by. I'm on the stretcher in the hallway downstairs from the unit, and my dad is just holding my hand while my mom deals with some paperwork, or maybe an issue of personal items or something. There's a sign on the wall right in front of my. It says ""psych."" My dad says, ""honey, you know 'psych' is just a prefix, and it's short for 'psychiatric,' not 'psychotic.' No one thinks you're psychotic."" Within a week I was diagnosed with Psychosis NOS, which was what the counsellor at school had been trying to tell him for months.

I thought with the way that you react to the words, this might be an interesting, or funny, or maybe sad story. But aside from that, I use very similar language to you. Every once in a while if I need to mention something about being an admitted inpatient in a medical facility, I'll say I was in a hospital, and if I reeeeeally need to I'll fall back on the fact that one time I was admitted overnight for migraines, ha. But yeah, it's much nicer for everyone in my life that I deal with to know what I'm talking about.",pennycenturie,54g72h
11,"I'm ok. But I take umbrage with a lot of things you're saying. Your surface-level understanding of the difference between those diagnosed and those not diagnosed (ie without illness) does more to hurt our reputation than to bring theirs to a less inflated level, in that you're making such dramatic generalizations that it looks like you're not even tuned in to the topic. For instance, no, adults do not have any pattern of living lives where they ""wake up happy."" That's just ridiculous. Some individuals are kind of mindful and content, but the difference between those of us who require medical assistance and those who don't doesn't come anywhere near issues having to do with ""happiness."" Like, when I was at my most sick, I was joyful and in love, and every molecule of my body was filled with pleasure and every thought in my head was like solid gold rainbows. It was pointedly unhealthy. Now I'm better and I'm never happy. That's normal.

I also think your use of the word ""crazy"" is distasteful, and your therapist's use of it is just downright unprofessional, and they should know better than to say that. Further, the chant of our distanced loved ones (such as people who want to make it clear they give a shit about us but aren't particularly important to us, or else failing at understanding us) that ""there's no such thing as normal"" and other people who don't have a mental illness are the ones with ""the real problems"" because they, like, bottle up their emotions and don't seek therapy, or behave in emotionally reckless ways because they're the ones in a setting -- unlike us -- who are free from hallucinations and suicidality and therefore less likely to do real harm... Like, no. Just no. If you're saying ""there's no such thing as normal,"" you're fucking normal and you're insulting me by not recognizing that I have a disability. You're erasing my very existence.",pennycenturie,54g72h

And then when it comes to the differences between two units at the same hospital, veterans will be like, ""I was in Lodge, obviously... wtf did YOU do to end to at Northgate, threaten someone with a broken CD?!"" This was, uh... back in the time of CDs.",pennycenturie,54g72h
13,"I agree with what you're saying but I do sometimes say ""psych ward,"" and maybe that's regional. I live in NYC. ""Ward"" is a strange term, though, and I think there's something about it that makes outsiders more comfortable with saying it. My ex insisted on saying someone was ""in ward,"" and I constantly corrected him. I told him that no one I had ever met would ever say that  -- and I've met thousands of institutionalized people -- and he would just say that he knows *someone* who was in a hospital once who uses that wording. And it absolutely is about intent, and that's what I mean when I say that ""mental hospital"" sounds fetishistic to me. Intent, like if a young med student (or some other person speaking on the subject without much experience) were to speak of institutionalized patients with superiority or disdain or with the implication that we're a nuisance, than really any phrase would be offensive. But I want to acknowledge the ways in which the media has romanticized my disability, and the consistency of certain phrases in that romance. I find ""mental hospital"" to be *just* detached enough while still being accurate that it lends itself to commodification.",pennycenturie,54g72h

14,"Oh my god that is terrible :( I am so sorry you had to deal with that! That is not normal whatsoever, and it appears whatever this professional was doing was more in their interest than yours. I would definitely look into reporting them so a supervisor/medical board of some sort. You are validated in how you are feeling and again, I am so sorry that you had to deal with such a calloused nurse. 

As for how to deal with dysmorphia, yes there is hope. I’ve dealt with body dysmorphia for as long as I can remember. I’ve gotten better at it, though some days are harder than others. Here are some thoughts that have helped me get through my darker days and helped shift my perception of beauty:

1) Beauty truly is in the eyes of the beholder. I can still recall when one time, I was talking to a guy friend of mine and happened to come across a photo of a model who I though was absolutely gorgeous. I remember turning to him and saying “wow if I looked like her, I would be the happiest person alive.” And he responded with, “really? She’s not even that pretty.” I’ve more or less been in similar situations like this where I thought a person/celebrity was absolutely stunning, just for another person to think they were average at best. This just goes to prove that everyone’s version of “pretty” is not uniform and varies from person to person. Even if I were to meet the conventional norms of being “attractive,” there would still be that one person who would say otherwise. 

2) Your perception of beauty is linked to your mental well being. I remember even at my skinniest thinking I was fat. And no matter what I did to change my face (micro blading, botox, lip injections, etc), I still found something to be unhappy about look-wise. Overtime I realized I wasn’t doing this to fix my outer appearance, but to fix how I was feeling inside. And over the years, the more I invested in my mental health, the more I became aware of this connection (e.g., being bullied as a child, abandonment issues, never having the conventional features I thought were needed to be pretty, etc.). As I’ve become aware, I’ve worked on activities that help me address these inner demons and cut out the toxic influences in my life (family being a big one). Though I still focus on my looks, I don’t obsess with it nearly as much as I did before. 

3) Beauty is not everything. Im sure you’ve heard this before, and admittedly it gets tiring hearing this time and time again. But let’s just say you’ve achieved peak attractiveness…now what? There is so much more to life than obsessing over your looks. There are so many places to explore, skills to learn, hobbies to enjoy. Why waste all of that just to be considered visually appealing to people who don’t even matter? Plus, looks aren’t everything. I can’t begin to tell you how many times I’ve gone on dates with men who were easily a 10/10, but the moment they opened their mouths and showed their true character, their attractiveness quickly deteriorated. 

4) I look like my family. I’ve always been self conscious of my nose- it’s bigger than I would like and has a bump at the top. But then I remember I have my grandpa’s nose. And I remember always thinking how handsome of a man my grandpa was, from when I looked at his pictures as a young man to his last day on earth. The same nose I thought made him look so well-defined and statuesque, was the same nose I came to hate on myself. And I know how much it would have broken his heart if he knew that. The older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve come to love these characteristics because they represent all of the people that I love and who played a role in making me. 

5) Beauty is transient. What is considered “beautiful today” will change in the next decade. One day your body type is in, the next day it’s considered too skinny, then the next day you’re considered too fat. Not only is it nearly impossible to keep up with these trends, but they were literally created by the beauty industry to make women feel self conscious and to spend more money on different products. 

I know it’s not easy dealing with these thoughts. And at times they become so consuming and can really interfere in your life. I think my biggest takeaway in dealing with body dysmorphia is that it’s all in my head. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve come across old photos of me and thinking to myself “why did I feel so ugly?” Or “why was I so hard on myself? I look so cute here!” There have also been times where I’ll point out an imperfection to someone just for them to respond with “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” The things we notice in ourselves are barely noticed by others.

You sound like an amazing person and I promise that whatever you’re self conscious about is either not noticed by others and are what make you beautiful! Take it day by day. Find a therapist that can help you work out these feelings. Pick up a new hobby. Participate in activities that help you enjoy life more. Make sure you have a solid support system around you and remove negativity from your life. Some days will be harder than others. But just know that you will come out on top, and that this internet stranger is cheering you on :)",melisssasup,17dqqlu
15,"Wtf that's absolutely inappropriate.  I understand that certain treatments might be more complex and hard for patients to understand, but I see absolutely nothing good coming from this.  Maybe if the anonymous staffers were people that your therapist secretly knew would gas you up and make you feel better and use those results for talking points at future sessions.  But not THAT.  That's such a vile thing to do to somebody and completely unsatisfactory for a professional to do.  I'm sorry you were treated that way.",,17dqqlu

17,"I've been in various therapy groups, and with multiple different therapists over the last 10 years. I can only assume why they may have done the questionnaire. 

Maybe the thought of intentions were meant to be good,but it's also about knowing your client.
Not to take away from you, but with me for example.

I'm a guy, I have binge eating disorder, and because of excess fat now high estrogen.

The eating disorder clinic says no intermittent fasting, diets don't work, and things like that 

My family doctor was like yeah just intermittent fast, and lose weight. Where a quick look into my health charts would show in not the person Todo that too.

When I was physically able to I was muscular and skinny. I always thought I was fat..I. That aspect I can sympathies.

But I'd say what they did for you wasn't correct, they could ha e changed their treatment plans, and accommodated you better.

There definitely is therapy options that can work,but it's specific to the person. You've said you've done them for a while now.

There are plastic surgery options that could help, but there's risks as well, and you may not like the end product either.(or you may love it). And it's expensive.

You mentioned anorexia and self harm, I'm speaking out of my lane, but continuing therapy I think would be beneficial, you just need the proper support system. Some people react well to what they did, some don't, you didn't and told them you wouldn't. 

The fact that some people rated you a 10 though is significant. It's not like it was all 4s or something like that. So maybe more people find you attractive then you think? Though I definitely understand if you don't think you are then that doesn't matter. 

Physical Appearances are always changing, getting in the right headspace is important.

22,"While I agree with the comments regarding that mental health facility, that's not what I'm going to talk about. Firstly, beauty is very subjective. I've seen people who will rate absolute 10's in my eyes as 2's. You just need to learn what works for you, and learn how to take care of yourself. 

We learn about our skin type before finding the right serum, the right moisturizer, the right scrub, face wash. We absolutely need to do the same for our bodies. Find out your body type, don't go on Pinterest or Instagram, look at the people around you. Be realistic, be firm with yourself. Do not go online. 

I can guarantee you, you're way more beautiful than you think you are. As for the body dysmorphia, you need supportive friends to guide you and be honest with you. I remember when mine was so bad that I spent a full year not looking at myself in the mirror, I basically became an expert at avoiding reflection. But you will come out of it.",bleebee,17dqqlu

1,"I think it depends on the group and the leader. If the leader sees mental health problems as having one cure and pushes that on people, that's not a good group. But if it's people commiserating and supporting each other with empathy and making connections and friendships, that could be a good group. I think since most people struggle with their mental health anyway, you may be better off in a group of interests - like taking dance classes, language, cooking, etc. You're sure to make connections there as well which could improve your mental health too (unless the person needs actual therapy and meds for a critical state). Idk I generally like group therapy after being in a few sessions.",,1520vt7

3,"I totally agree with dance classes, language classes and cooking these can be very beneficial to people with mental health conditions.  But others are not good they push their personal ideologies on people, what got them out of a temporary blip that lasted a few weeks.  
They push the idea of distractions to people that can’t manage these yet or at all? 
For instance a person thinking about suicide is hardly gonna pick up a novel and read it, they are not gonna be that headspace. 

Neither can someone whose psychosis is really bad or schizophrenia or the side effects of medication.   Where simple things such as colouring is impossible. 

Plus a person in psychosis is likely to experience the plot of the book in their psychosis.  And they aren’t gonna want to chose to a bland and boring topic to either. 

Plus what people talk about in these groups is unreal. From recycling , to what they had for breakfast to weather hardly gonna make me wanna show up again.  I spent most of my time in these places asleep  or dosing off due to boredom. 

Plus also a person is likely to feel worse when the group is finished, then if they are not working that day they may feel unmotivated doing their next task of the day or if they are working they may underperform at work because they sat listening someone at group saying “I can’t do that,”  “ i am useless at work”  “I can’t even read a book” “I don’t like” when then it is repetitive every time you are there or people who put themselves down for spilling a bit of water that day.  

You start believing it yourself., as shit stinks.  Plus also staff can be quite patronising and tell what you should do and how you should behave. Rather than given free will.  

Some staff can be like “you mustn’t drink that Dr Pepper cos of the high sugar content” when you can make your own choices in life.  “Have a cuppa tea with us”

When the tastes like cats piss and they’ve over used the same ten tea bags over and over and milk is well off by a week. That trading standards, food standards agency would shut em down.

I was actually recently hospitalized when I committed myself for heck knows what reason ..i guess there was a reason that I see now, I was really overwhelmed. Idk hard to describe as I think i had psychosis. Anyway. My point is at the hospital, the groups really seemed to help me just get out of my head. They talked about DBT, CBT, ISATP (all these therapies and worksheets) as tools for recovery and I thought that was really a lot better than someone sitting there talking about feelings the whole time or pushing their own agenda. So I think it's possible but maybe rare to find helpful groups like that. Sometimes it's also how you look at it, I guess. Did I have fun at the hospital? Well, no. It was really hard being there.

0,"Unfortunately, police are rarely trained in dealing with anything through a mental health lens. They're trained to use varying levels of force to maintain control of every situation. That's why I NEVER advise people to call 911 on someone for a mental health crisis and to call a crisis line instead. People think calling 911 is what you're supposed to do but you have the potential to cause a lot of emotional damage or, depending on the nature of the mental health crisis, even get someone killed by getting cops involved. 

You did what you could to educate and that's all you can do. The only thing I will say is that it's never going to work to ask the cops to leave once they've been called to your home.

If you got his badge# or name or can call the precinct and politely/quietly find them out (tell the desk you were impressed w the way the officer handled the situation and would like to send a letter to their superior. It's not a lie and sounds positive to the desk person), you should then find a friend or pro to help you file a formal complaint.

A lot of things help with depression, some of them surprisingly simple. I have advice from experts about the self-help for depression recommended by therapists in my comments.  
  
For CPTSD It’s important to have a therapist who has experience treating trauma.  
  
In this video, author Anna Runkle talks about her study of Childhood PTSD and summarizes treatments shown to help. She says that as a CPTSD survivor, the thing she has found most helpful to her is dealing with the symptom known as dysregulation, which is getting very upset. I would definitely see her videos on dysregulation.  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSlAfoJiAg&t=8s  
  
ADHD expert and author Dr. Russell Barkley has a number of YouTube videos. You can check Barkley’s impressive credentials at his Wikipedia article. The Adult ADHD Toolkit by Tony Rostane (co-author) - a CBT approach. Also, advocacy and support groups such as CHADD can be helpful. A relationship between ADHD and insomnia has been found, and treatment with the supplement melatonin has been shown to help.  
   
There is evidence that relaxation with the traditional Asian methods can help with ADHD. Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a 3-part program of mind-body methods - breathing, meditation, and slow body movement. Incorporate these into your daily life. Be aware of changes in mood and respond mindfully, aware of your breathing. Details here -

There's also IOP (intensive outpatient). This may be something you'd do after stabilization at the hospital. This entails usually going somewhere during most days for a few hours of groups and possibly individual therapy as well.

I would begin by calling your insurance - or, at least, that's where I began. They told me the hospitals that were in-network for me where I could go to the ER. At the ER, there was a very long wait - so be patient and prepared. They then had me meet via telehealth with an insurance representative where they asked me questions about my mental health history and any suicidal plans or attempts.

For your case, it is better to stay in a mental hospital if it is a sucidal attempt. Psych wards is more extreme and is given to cases that are very extreme. For me, the cops drove me there when my therapist called them to my dorm room. I was put on a voluntary hold, if they think you're really sucidal then in cali, they put you on a 5150.

1,"For a diagnosis you will need a psychiatrist. 

I'm in Canada and psychiatrists also usually do the initial prescription. They will then send you back to your PCP who will be in charge of refills and they can increase your dose as needed until you reach the maximum. If you need to have your medication switched your PCP will usually send you back to a psychiatrist, and so on.

A psychiatrist is going to be your best bet because PCPs just aren't knowledgeable enough. There are such minute differences, and so much overlap between different disorders that even psychiatrists have problems with diagnosing. There are also a million different possible medications and different combos, and different disorders tend to respond better to certain drugs.

I also just want to warn you that the first med you try might not be right. You can have some side effects or just find it's not working, but try not to get discouraged too quickly. Some people need to try multiple different meds before they find what works for them, and each med can take up to 6 weeks to feel the full effects, so sometimes it's a long process. It's worth it though. You could also just be lucky like me, and respond to them well with minimal side effects.

Good for you for recognizing what you need and taking that step.",iamacraftyhooker,v7wu82
2,"The best thing to do is see a psychiatrist. Going through ur pcp can only do so much. They can only prescribe you certain meds where with a psychiatrist can give you more a variety and try things out.

My pcp said she couldn’t prescribe more than two thing bc she doesn’t know how medication will react to each other, but that’s my experience.

When looking for a psychiatrist you can go onto your insurance website to see who is covered and contact them through email or phone.",Its0hs0qui3t,v7wu82

Could be smoothies, a little bit of soup, or ensure.  Just start with a little, multiple times per day.  You will eventually condition yourself to eat at the alarm.  You can gradually start eating a little more and more. 

If you’re not used to eating much, trying too much at once can make things more difficult. Remind yourself that you are taking care of your body, and it isn’t necessarily about enjoying it.  

This is one method people who work out a lot use. They have a mindset of “fueling” their body rather than eating for enjoyment.  They understand they must eat certain things at certain times in order to maintain or gain physique.

Make sure it’s nutritionally dense enough to get what you need, and maybe supplement with a multivitamin if you need to. It can be hard getting a good balance of trace nutrients when it’s hard to eat at all.

As someone who struggles immensely with mental illness. This is a sign he really needs the help, it does not sound like a lie. He says he wants to go back to extensive therapy.. He needs help to be held accountable for this because he is not able to follow through on his own.",teamsaxon,1cidlnb
1,"Your son needs help. He’s very symptomatic as you point out. He asked for help in very specific and plain terms; he’d like inpatient care. 

First, you are very fortunate to be in a position where your son is verbalizing his wants and needs. The rest of your post is your *personal perception* of his wants and needs. You have the benefit of addressing his wants and needs directly, vs so many young people who struggle to admit they need help or to ask. Especially male. *It’s simply up to you to now recognize you cannot help. This is a medical issue. Medical expertise is needed.*

To address your points:

1. Lies. Yes. He needs help.

2. Refuses to help self. Wrong. He went to the people he trusted most in the world and got as vulnerable as he could be and asked for specific help. That is helping himself. Your definition is how you define someone helping oneself, but it’s defined in many ways.

3.  Not sanitary. Yes. That’s a symptom. Because your son needs help.

4. Eats too much. He’s a 22 year old male. And/or bingeing is a symptom. Usually associated with childhood neglect. He needs help. Also still really not sure why this is on the list.

5. Steals. A manifestation of many possible maladaptive behaviors. Your son needs help. He has already asked.

**’Your family is at a loss’.**

I suggest getting your son help. Just like he asked for. Inpatient treatment. And that’s only because that’s what he specifically asked for. You have no idea what he wants or needs which is indicated by your list. 

IOP’s aren’t one and done treatment, FYI. 

Your list is a list of estrangement and absenteeism. It sounds like you’re talking about a pesky mosquito. His “list” of “problems” contains eating? Really?? 

Do your son a favor and offer this post to any of his future doctors. It will cut years off the process of getting to the root cause.",traumakidshollywood,1cidlnb
2,"Depends what meds his on.
Point 1, could be substance use due to dopamine seeking. Meds change your whole brain chemistry. 

Point 2/3, Meds don’t always work they come with a range of side effects. People don’t want to take them for legitimate reasons. Therapy does not always work sometimes it makes people worse. People with mental health conditions end up not being sanitary that is a part of it. Although it would be hard to deal with. 

Point 4, if he’s on certain medication you can’t control your hunger. You will crave food an hour after you have your meds or you’ll wake up in the middle of the night and eat it’s normal. 

Not being rude it sounds like you need to talk to someone that’s not a doctor because if you act like this it will lead to a lot of resentment. It would be challenging to deal with but there’s a lot more to the story then your imagining. The doctor will tell you anything for you to pay money for appointments, therapy and medication.

He insisted a psychiatric stay was needed, but he acted worse than before. 

He's just like my uncle though, my uncle lives in the basement of his parents house still and he's 48.

During that time, i was going through my anxiety disorder, i was falling down into depression and was literally hopeless. I wouldn't mind if i die then and there. 
I had that mentality. No one would care if i died. For a while people will mourn but will forget me eventually. Im just a speck of dust, so what? Dying is better. I was in a terrible terrible place. Im better off dead.

When that happened, everyone was in shock. I couldnt believe someone like him would do that. It didnt look like he was suffering ( He's always smiling and happy). We had exams the coming week, so our school cancelled that. They cancelled our class for a week. Our lives stopped. I don't know him personally but it was very hard for me to deal with. 

Then, it came to me. Yes, the world goes on even after you die. But the world of those close to you and cares for you , stops. And a hole is punched in everyone's lives.

When the fog cleared and I got better, I looked back and saw that it was always a good choice to wait to decide anything with my mind clearer.

I hope she gets tired of saving me from myself and leaves me. I hope it happens soon. I'm not strong enough to leave her and I don't want to hurt her that way. But if she leaves me I can finally get this over with and she'll never even learn of it.

I understand what you're saying but when you tell someone that you're suicidal, you're obviously not caring about your own life as you want to take it so the next best thing is to talk about the impact and try to encourage the person feeling suicidal to get help. 

In the past, Whenever I try to comfort, it never gets anywhere and the outcome is still the same but they just get in a cycle of ""I don't care, I'm gonna do it, I've had enough and sick of fighting and there's nothing you can do."" Why would I want a suicidal person to keep that mindset? I wouldnt. I want them to get help. 

But the heartfelt sincerity of explaining the outcome and knowing you have more to live for than just for yourself, should be just as much needed. Why do you think it's acceptable to punish people around you when you can ask for help? If you're not heard then ask again. Suicide effects more than yourself and I'm not arguing either and do sympathise but people need to be aware of the aftermath too.

If the guilt of killing myself because of other people stops me, then that's a reason to stop. 

Most people are just fed up and want help but at the end of the day it's russian roulette and you never know if it's too late. 

Suicide is not about wanting attention, effection and words of begging and crying. Suicide is about feeling you're at the end of the line and stuck and don't know where to turn.

I’m only here to provide another perspective, because for me—and some others, the “what about me” attitude honestly drove me further down the spiral and I would not be here had I kept in touch with the friend I talked about.

Besides the extra down time due to no new clients at our unit the past two weeks, I'm hanging in there ok.

They won’t allow individuals into our building if their temperature is 104.0 or above. We have no proper PPE for this. At first we opted to not accept individuals who weren’t local, now we’re back to accepting whoever. A lot of us are overworked due to short staffing so our immune systems are lowkey compromised from lack of sleep. The head honcho basically said we will still take clientele showing symptoms as long as they’re not “that bad.” It’s a lot of shady shit going down and I feel helpless.

3,"Hey, I am all too familiar with your situation but I was the one in your spouses shoes. I’ve gone through it 3 times now with the most recent time already separated from my spouse. I know each time took a massive toll on her but reading your post gave me all new insight. I hope what I say helps you and your spouse in any kind of way because I don’t think my wife and I ever truly recovered from my first one. Please know that your spouses actions are not reflective of you. I know I’m a stranger but based on the fact that you came onto Reddit and posted the situation shows me that you care deeply for them and that will have a great impact on things moving forward. Your assessment is spot on about peer groups being extremely helpful. The difficulty is finding the right group. https://nami.org/findsupport is a good resource. States have different regulations on peer support specialist (person who has experience with mental health issues but is successfully in recovery). And at least where I live they cost money and scheduling one can be a challenge because there aren’t many available. I hate how negative this is sounding. My heart hurts for you both. I know it seems a bit shallow but I honestly believe your spouse could benefit from posting in this sub. It helps me a lot. And if your spouse is hesitant at first I highly recommend you continue to post. There are some really good people here that genuinely want to help any way they can because they truly know the struggle. Helping you in any way helps them as well. Mental health resources are still vastly underdeveloped and I believe the best thing we can do in the meantime is help each other. ❤️",UknownMentalDisorder,1955zge

6,"Firstly sorry if this is ranty,  it’s early, cold af and I hardly slept last night because the puppy wanted to be snuggled up to my face all night. I appreciate you so much.  Stranger or not,  I come to Reddit and the  herd of the internet to gain perspective from the collective and welcome anything that is given.  I find it helpful to hear real world  learned experiences from normal peope on top of the procedural steps you gain via doctors and therapists…who would have thought talk therapy does me little good despite seeing therapists from 5-15 but getting on a bike and crushing 35 miles of dirt helps open my brain allowing me to reach inward to explore the rough topics in life with full clarity and focus….r/mtb did!  Maybe not the most healthy mechanism,  but it works magically for me. 

I am sorry to learn about your story,  but am so so glad you are here to pass your experiences along and confirm that we can get back to a healthy spot,  even if that life looks different than it does currently and they ultimately decide they need to find a life outside mine,  which would crush me but be something I would fully support,  because I will support whatever actions they need to recenter,  rebalance, and thrive. 

I like to feel that this all happened for a reason and I came home when I did for a reason,  everything happened because it was supposed to….nothing is happenstance,  at least in my person.   And I am not sure how I am processing that because it sounds ridiculous when typed or spoken aloud. 

We looked in to some services last night and found a few free resources,  they plan to give those a try when they can fit between a very busy work schedule.  We also found a few clandestine (fb based community groups) outdoor focused based MH groups in our area they want to explore as nature is their happy spot.  If a paid option is necessary,  that is not an issue,  I’ll bankrupt our bank accounts if we have to.  Money is fake,  it comes and goes; the love of your life is a one time thing so you protect that asset more than your gold.  

I will try to get them to post,  but honestly part of the culmination of emotions leading to this event is isolation and fear to express emotions.  It’s been a very long road and progress has been made but that has been one topics they have been focused on with their therapist since day one: being open and honest about emotions.  When you come from an environment where you get reprimanded for being in the way by simply existing or speaking out of turn….no wonder it’s hard to speak up for yourself;  even if removed from that reality for a decade.  

We will get there.  They are my person,  I’m by their side until they ask me to leave or u til the very bitter end! 

The analogy that has been carrying me thru the week:

It is sunset, We just set out on a cross-country roadtrip and have decided to take the back roads.  Problem is the gps won’t turn on and we left the old atlas on the kitchen table.  We decide to send it anyway knowing we will take some wrong turns and maybe end up on a few dead-end streets.  This is ok though,  it is part of the journey. Next we talk about how we will prepare for when we face the stress of a wrong turn on a long road trip.  We can’t say when those wrong turns are coming up so we can’t remove them from our journey,  all we can do is prepare for them knowing they lie ahead and respond appropriately when faced with that stressful situation.",brokedownbutthriving,1955zge

If I can get her on side in terms of a mental health assessment it would be a lot easier to proceed. 
I suppose I’m also scared that he will act completely fine during the assessment and they won’t admit him and then the situation will be worse. Its worth a try. Thank you again 🙏",GuiltySetting7355,1b8yhnp
