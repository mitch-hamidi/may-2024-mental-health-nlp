It's the same thing. Our brains aren't working correctly. We lack some chemicals, like some people lack insulin. The medication gives us the chemicals we need, but sometimes it may cause side effects because the pros outweigh the cons. Side effects go away after a while, and if they don't, you try again.

And then do nothing or they cause extreme suicidal ideation I have never been through such bad withdrawals from medications as I have from mental psych ht meds. On my paperwork it states that I will need to be medicated the rest of my life to function normally.. but those same very medications affect every aspect of my life from sex to thinking sleeping if I do not take those medications it affects my life from sex to thinking to sleeping.. I have tried them four at a time one at a time tapering doses increasing doses switching different things here and there and nothing helps sometimes because some days I still feel as hopeless as I did when I started the whole journey... I remember being impatient at a facility and they started me first thing on four different medications about 3 days in to taking those medications I could literally hear myself and answer myself and I would hear myself talking to myself out loud these are things that I do not normally do so you have to consider medicines and their side effects not just the medicines and their ability to control mood there are so many variables and people just assign a medication to a person without caring what that person is going to experience later. if you had told me all those years ago when I started taking these medications that I would never be able to stop that I would always need them to feel normal I probably would have never started them.

You have to weigh whether the benefits you receive are worth the risk of unintended effects. Sometimes the answer is yes and sometimes it’s no. Many people are willing to take the drugs because they can also provide a chemical restraint effect for family and friends, making it easier for them to be supportive and helpful. These drugs often have unpleasant effects like weight gain and loss of libido, which will resolve when stopping the drugs. And some neurological effects after long term use can be permanent. There are also behavioral interventions that can be effective, but they take longer. Often a combination of both can reduce the length of time meds are needed.

What i class as evil is the knowledge that things can be made much much better for people without having to bombard them with a drug for every ailment....and not telling them about it OR reserving that knowledge for the 1% because they can afford it.

There is a plethora of other reasons why things aren't, ""working correctly."" And its very important to understand what is practically important in your life to spend your time on. 



I personally find lots of strength of my identity in asking questions. But I'm also often second guessing the usefulness of some of my deeper dives. 



My very bold truth of ""the way of the world"" is that for most of us we are told NOT to ask questions. And even if you do -  many people have ""given up"" on finding answers. Finding a good mentor or a resource for answers is hard. And it often compounds with the issue of what is practical to spend your time on.   
  
Medication can sometimes help with that. Both the frustration of questions without answers and helping us prioritize whats important. 

  
I guess what I'm trying to say is that imperfect analogies are good to start with. The same way with saying that imperfect mixtures of medications and drugs are OK to start with too.

I actually had the rare experience where the very first psych meds you try are the right ones - and ironically, I didn't get on them for my mental illness.

The mechanism of diabetes seems to be quite well understood. It's apparently caused by [too little insulin in the body, or the body not responding properly to insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes).

Perhaps antidepressants are a bit like alcohol, in the sense that alcohol can make you less shy, but that doesn't mean shyness is caused by an alcohol deficiency.

You say that ""the pros outweigh the cons"" regarding psych drugs. I wonder about that a lot though.

9,"So as someone that recently went off meds after being on them for 3+ years, I can say that I do feel emotions more intensely, which includes anxiety. However, I find what has helped is telling myself, feeling anxiety, sadness (also had depression), guilt, rumination, etc is all normal human emotions and they have to be felt at SOME point. But if I start having anxiety/panic attacks frequently, experience more negative than positive/neutral emotions, or cannot function daily, then something is wrong with my mental health. The very first time I ever came off meds, I relapsed so hard and that is very different from me having a ""very anxious ridden day"" off my meds. 

It's a lot of self awareness and all the skills and tools I learned in therapy, I've never had to rely on them so hard than I do now off meds. The medication kind of just ""dulled"" things to make it a little easier to get by life. But now I have to feel the full intensity of the anxiety (at a smaller scale though), and then use those coping strategies to manage. 

Only you will know if you need to go back on meds because this is not mentally healthy, or shifting the mindset that anxiety will always be apart of your life, it doesn't disappear, and this is manageable.",Amyishida,cw44j4

She was misunderstanding how her body responded to the medical intervention, and she made the exact same mistake 3 or 4 times.


It sounds like your problem is similar: there's no particular sensation that tells you ""this bit of non-anxiety is due to the meds"". So you're going to have to write a diary to yourself about what it feels (felt) like when you were confident that you could stop the meds, and what it felt like when you did. And that needs to be something that you refer back to. You need to remember and trust your past. Writing it down and re-reading it can help.

44,"Because Anxiety is a tool humans developed to tell you something is seriously wrong, usually mentally.  It means you got to deal with whatever is causing that anxiety...
Edit: everyone has anxiety, if you didnt you wouldnt be human.  Thats normal, the abnormal thing is the medication not in the sense of looking for relief because thats normal too, but in the sense that human beings did not evolve along side anxiety releiving medication, we evolved around anxiety.  

It can and often is crippling, and seemingly impossible to get over.  Personally I used to walk around in a constant state of anxiety.  Just hearing my name I would freak out and quickly turn around/jump, my rib cage was always shaking (this is not an exaggeration).  It felt like I was cold all the time, so cold that my body would shake to warm up, but never could get warm enough to get rid of the shakes.  I would have daily panick attacks, full on hyperventilation, kept a brown bag just for tyat reason, and would try and duck out somewhere quiet, smoked like a chimney to quell it.  Smoked pot too, which only made it worse, then upgraded to Xanax, then moved on to Opium tea, over time the anxiety would break through the medication.  

The one thing that did help, was focusing on 1 thing at a time and getting off the drugs.  Later I found out this is how agoraphobia is treated (fear of everything, and constant anxiety).  Find 1 thing that makes you anxious, probably not hard.  And dip your toe in the water.  Realize that its going to be ok, become focused on 1 thing as a coping mechanism.  For me I had 2 jobs and was renting a room and got off all the drugs cold turkey.  I found that all forma of social interactiona made me anxious, especially close forms, so family was out of the question.  So I worked really hard, and did my best, I focused incredibly hard on the single task at hand.  Stocking the shelf, cleaning the photo lab, organizing the overstock.  Etc etc.  Little by little I would talk to my coworkers,and let out the tiniest little bit about myself, like tiny.  ""I like chinese food"" and i would anxious about that, full on freaking out.  But then I realized I didnt die and no one cared i liked chinese food and it was okay.  So on and so on.  I was petrified to let people know i played video games, or let them see how I worked because perhaps that wasnt good enough, or let them see how I drive perhaps I was a bad driver.  I kid you not I was fucking petrified of my own shadow, but over the course of 5+ years, little by little I started to mend everything, and realize its ok.  I realized I was human, then I realized others were human too and made mistakes.  Then I started to learn a bit about paychology, why people do the things they do.


In the end, there is a way out, and its long, its hard, its grueling, it seems impossible, you are going to fail many times along the way, but *you* are the sort of creature that can handle that sort of thing, because *you* are human like the rest of us.  Its not about not having the hardships, its about overcoming those hardships, and when you do, youll start looking for the next hardship to overcome, and trust me they never stop lol.

Edit: I'm not sure why I'm being downvoted. I'm only pointing out that the placebo effect may be at play here. Taking the medication and EXPECTING it to have a positive effect could be helping OP feel better.

Saying that it's definitely a chemical imbalance is oversimplifying anyone's mental state. We have no idea about the multitude of other factors that could be at play, such as stress, physical activity, behavioral patterns, lifestyle choices, etc. If medication helps, by all means take it; I want everyone to live happy and fulfilling lives. I do believe that it's dangerous to say that taking it ""proves"" a chemical imbalance because the medical community states that the chemical imbalance theory itself has never been proven.",lightandlux,cw44j4

I’m glad I at least tried life without them, otherwise I would have just wondered if I could do it.",chugged1,cw44j4
120,"I don't see how this definitely proves that at all.

Meds help with the biological side of things, they temporarily help regulate systems that should be able to regulate themselves. However, they don't tackle many of the underlying causes of anxiety, such as dysfunctional cognitive processes.

If you come off your meds and go back to how you were before then yes, it could mean that you have some biological dysfunction that is causing the anxiety. However, it could also mean you haven't addressed behavioural or cognitive issues that were causing the anxiety. 

This is why generally you see the best evidence for effectiveness in combined medication + therapy treatments. Medication gives you that little boost while you work on the cognitive and behavioural side as well",Cedow,cw44j4

I don't see anything wrong with attempting to get off meds, if someone is in a good place and thinks that sounds like the right move for them, I say go for it. If it doesn't work out, then it doesn't work out and you can get back on them.

A few years ago, my therapist told me when you're having an active panick attack, submerge your head in cold water. Get a bowl of cold water, add a lot of ice, hold your breath and dunk your face in it. Make sure the bowl is deep enough you can submerge your ears. Hold your breath for 20-30 seconds and when you come up take a deep breath. 

This forces your mind to simi shut down. Your mind and body will act on survival instinct and start to conserve energy, essentially stopping anxiety mid attack, because it needs all its energy to ""survive"". I know it sounds silly, but I've done it a few times and it really works!

During the pandemic, I got laid off. Which meant insurance was cut.

So I check, and that’s not an option for me because my insurance was dropped.  

Now, they make it real simple to transfer a prescription from a CVS store to Caremark, but not the other way around.  I’m sure I could have called my doctor and had one sent to a store location.  But instead I opted to quit cold turkey (note:  DO NOT DO THAT).

I worked on the relationship between mind and body, first (and no one’s gonna like this) GETTING OFF BOOZE. My alcohol habit was making 90% of my anxiety - something about alcohol and cortisol yada yada. But why would my body trust a mind that decided to poison it every day? You’d think alcohol relaxes you, actually it does the opposite if you drink it regularly. Get off that shit immediately, go to AA if you must. 

I then did things that were good for me like regular exercise (no brainer), healthy sleeping habits, cutting out sugar (especially close to bedtime!) and caffeine. I do other things like meditate (1000% recommend), yoga, sensory deprivation tank, microdosing mushrooms, cold immersion, breathwork, journaling, solfeggio frequencies…

25,"Learn how to regulate your nervous system. Google or YouTube ‘nervus vagus’ stimulation or excercise. It’s not hard, but it takes discipline,  and it really helps.
  
When we experience anxiety the limbic system in the brain is activated, which is responsible for lower order emotional processing. We can regulate this response by doing some simple breathing excercises that help calm our nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system predominates in quiet ‘rest and digest’ or ‘feed and breed’ conditions, which is the state you want to be in generally, while the sympathetic nervous system drives the ‘fight or flight or freeze (or fawn)’ response when we experience stress and anxiety, which is a state you don’t want to be in for too long. These responses can be regulated by employing simple breathing techniques. Look into it, it could help. 
  
When you feel anxiety, breathe in through the nose, and at the end of the breath briefly inhale again before exhaling. Repeat a couple of times. You’ll immediately feel relief. Best!",wisefoolhermit,17vqxfe

45,"John Green, the author, has severe OCD and he did a video where he said the key to maintaining his mental health is “meaningful, consistent work”. 

This statement was a game changer for me. Meaningful = something that serves a purpose outside of you. It is different for every person. Your parents’ meaning is not the same as your meaning. And it can even change for you over time too (which is why several people in this thread, including me, found their anxiety dropped when they switched to a different job). Consistent = you do it most days of the week and it is part of a routine. Work = it is at least a little bit challenging - you have to push yourself to do it some days.

It is worth mentioning that this does not mean the work has to be perfect, or that it always feels meaningful 100% of the time. It also does NOT necessarily mean having a paying job. Some people are limited in what jobs they can have, or even in having a job at all, for all kinds of reasons. That is OK.

65,"Behavioral cognitive therapy. I do my exercises in a journal because I'm not great at doing them in my mind. The BCT exercises help me separate real struggles and thought distortions. Then, I can focus on what I can realistically do and what is completely outside of my power.

Regular therapy sessions. Talking things out with an objective person who calls me out on my bullshit and doesn't judge me makes a huge difference in my week.

A good support network. My therapist is great, but venting with a friend or having a giggle fit when things are messed up has been its own therapy. That also sometimes extends to cutting people out of your life who are a major source of stress. Or, at the very least, learning how to say no.

Daily journal. I call it my ""today I"" journal.  I struggle with imposter syndrome and severe lack of confidence. CPTSD has its own effects in this respect as well. So, having a consistent way to write at least one thing I am proud of or happy about daily helps boost my self-esteem. Sometimes, I can only write that today I have been able to write in this journal, and that's OK.

Small, consistent repetitive actions. If I find something that I've found helpful, I try to repeat it. If it's too much, I try to break it down into tiny manageable bite-sized actions I can do daily. For example, I find creative things helpful, but I'm not always up to working on a painting. So I joined a d&d group, and I'm creative in my character play. I play once a week, or two weeks, depending on the group.

Seeing the green stuff. While I find exercise helps my depression and anxiety, I don't always have the energy or willpower to follow through. So instead, I go for a little walk with the dog, or just stand on my balcony and stare at my plants. If I really can't force myself outside, I do the rounds on my plant care ( I have a lot of plants). Looking at the green stuff is calming. If there's a water source like a little stream or river, even better!

Planning ahead. OK, so I can't control everything, but if let's say I have to travel, I like having things prepared for what I can control. Feeling prepared helps me cope with my anxiety. 

Decluttering my thoughts. I tend to ruminate a lot on things that may or may not be valid. If I find my thoughts coming back to something that I actually have to do, I map it out on my calendar in manageable bits. Same for chores, reminders, appointments, etc. If I have a bad day I can see what might be able to be moved, usually ahead of time so I'm not caught procrastinating or missing appointments which just makes my anxiety and low self-esteem worse.

Saying things outloud. So if I'm stuck in ruminating about something, sometimes saying things outloud helps me. Like words of encouragement, or validation, or just calling out what is happening like: I am having x thought, I accept it, but I am not my thoughts. That also goes for a full-on panic attack. I don't have them often these days, but when I do, I try to focus on my immediate surroundings. What can I see, taste, hear, touch, etc. If I can I name them outloud. Anything to ground me in the present.

Breathing exercises. There are many, available through many means. Try some, see what you like, and practice them daily. Not just when you're not feeling well.

Diet. This is a big one for me but rather specific to my situation because of my IBS. IBS is directly linked to stress, but what I eat also has a huge effect on it. With the help of a nutritionist, I found food I can enjoy, but that lessens my symptoms like pain, bloating, and diarrhea. 

Medication. This one is so different from one person to another, so I can only speak to what has worked or not for me. SSRIs and I don't mix well together. I usually stay in depression for much longer, and it tends to augment things like suicidal thoughts. I have found one medication that helps if I'm bordering on a panic attack called rivotril. It's not advisable to take it too often tho or it just stops working for me.  Amitiptyline and Pregabalin have been helpful at very low doses in dealing with chronic pain. Less pain has mean more focus and energy. I found the side effects have helped me sleep a bit more as well since they cause drowsiness. Having my ADD diagnosed and treated will also likely help. My doctor is still adjusting the doses of the other two drugs before having me try vivance, tho. She wants to be certain we know what medication is doing what before adding another. 

My advice with meds is to keep a journal of what you've tried, what it helped with, what the side effects were, and the doses. Having this information made my discussions with my doctor much easier for both of us. Also, never let a medical health professional invalidate what you're feeling. I spent a long time letting doctors dismiss my pain and prescribe me antidepressants instead of dealing with what I now know to be endometriosis. Don't be afraid to have a friend or family member accompany you.

I'm probably forgetting things, but this is all I can think of off the top of my head. I'm rooting for you. My struggle is ongoing, but overall, my quality of life has improved. Wish you all the best!",smarmcl,17vqxfe

177,"That's the thing with anxiety.. You start to avoid more and the anxiety for the thing gets bigger and bigger. Helping thoughts, finding out about what anxiety is (how does it work in your brain, what signals does your body give and why & how to calm them) is key while exposing your self to scary situations. Knowledge is power. It maybe won't help much the first time, the second or the third even.. maybe even the 10th time it still will be scary. But probably not as scary as the first time. What makes you scared about school? Is the thought reality or only based on an assumption? Ask your self critical questions about your anxiety induced thoughts. 
Things that might help you calm down is grounding yourself by making contact with your body or your environment (pinch yourself softly or try to focus of 5 things you see, 5 things you hear & 5 things you feel, lots of things to try out, Google is your friend), mindfulness based things and breathing techniques (practice these while not being scared otherwise they can make the panic worse).

178,"Yeah I'm glad someone said this, I smoked multiple times daily for about 8 or 9 years. The last 2 years I smoked it was fuckin horrible. The biggest problem was if I ran out before I could re-up I would get extremely depressed and 9/10 times suicidal. Also my paranoia was RIDICULOUSLY high, at one point I remember I was fully convinced that my ex had set up cameras in my house and was watching me. Despite me knowing this was blatantly false and even after looking everywhere and literally seeing there was no way; I still was completely convinced I was being watched. I thought he was trying to sabotage my life and had it constantly running on a Livestream and was somehow sending it to anyone I was trying to date. I was fuckin miserable, thankfully delta 8 came out shortly after this incident. Since I could never go cold turkey and cutting back on how much I smoked didn't help, I started delta 8 to try to transition off entirely. Initially I had to smoke a lot of the delta 8 to keep the negative emotions from occurring, but after about a year of that I had been able to cut back each month until I eventually stopped altogether. I still had a rough time and craved it, but I didn't end up suicidal or having crying fits so it worked out in the end. So yeah nah I think suggesting weed isn't a good alternative unless it's medical or at the very least sporadic usage and not a daily thing.

I do not know your full situation (and you should discuss w/ your doctor), but pseudo-tachyphylaxis is the loss of an initial placebo response.

0,"*I am speaking from lived experience (I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD) and so take what I say with a grain of salt.

Depending on where you live and your insurance, you may be able to just see a doctor and describe your symptoms to be medicated. In my experience (United States), this isn't something that is up to a therapist at all. I've even been on medication in the past without being in therapy. Anxiety can be situational or chemical but most likely both, and so medication can be a huge help, and can be, if you are comfortable, a temporary help. If you have been trying therapy with little success then medication may be helpful for getting you over anxiety hurdles.

After looking through your account's recent activity, I think that your mental health struggles may be more intense than your therapist is understanding. Are you not medicated for your mental health at all? You should meet with someone able to prescribe medication (ideally a psychiatrist or mental health nurse, people who are working with brain medications all the time) and discuss with them your symptoms and the effect they're having on your quality of life. It sounds like you may also have depression and ADHD, and these illnesses can interact in unpredictable ways that may make medication that much more necessary. 

I am also kind of concerned by the way you've described your therapist: it sounds like he has a very specific idea of what your anxiety treatment should look like, and is perhaps not willing to deviate from that. If you like your therapist and feel that you are making progress despite his unwillingness to recommend medications then no worries but don't be afraid to try other therapists if you're not satisfied.",PanicAntique,1cbmmgr

Yes, maybe my therapist isn't fully understanding my struggles and that's probably due to my difficulties with communication. Time there is very limited too, we have only 1 hour and sometimes that's not enough for me to say everything.

I don't think i am making any progress. To be honest, i had one or two good insights, we could work some ideas i have, but it's not like they're having a real impact in my issues. He wants me to face my fears in order to put an end to anxiety, which honestly, i agree it's what should be done. But that's way too painful for me and the outcome could also destroy me completely.

0,"I haven't taken an SSRI, but I did do some research on this when I started taking an NDRI, because before I started the medication, I didn't remember my dreams most nights, and the ones that I could remember, I was able to lucid dream. After starting the medication, I started having very vivid nightmares that I remembered each morning, and I wasn't able to become lucid or wake myself up. 

Basically, the gist is that SSRIs, SNRIs, and NDRIs are all considered 'activating' anti-depressants, since they can make you feel more awake or energetic, but that can also disrupt your sleep. Medication impacting your ability to sleep is pretty common. There are less studies specifically about dreams, but definitely some stuff out there that indicates that it's at least possible that different meds can make your dreams more intense, or make you more likely to remember your dreams the next day.

If it does bother you, I'd suggest talking to your doctor about tweaking your dose? I switched from taking 2 regular tablets throughout the day to doing one extended-release tablet early in the morning, and that helped settle things, since it would mostly be out of my system by the time I went to bed.",AliceInWeirdoland,1cgi97h

1,"There's not that much evidence for anti-anxiety medication.

This article from the American Psychological Association says that most people with anxiety disorders do better with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) than with medicine.

[https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/medication-or-therapy#:\~:text=For%20anxiety%20disorders%2C%20cognitive%2Dbehavioral,improve%20outcomes%20from%20psychotherapy%20alone](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/medication-or-therapy#:~:text=For%20anxiety%20disorders%2C%20cognitive%2Dbehavioral,improve%20outcomes%20from%20psychotherapy%20alone).

Although self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.

In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.

When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.

One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.

Don't make mountains out of molehills.

Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.

The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.

Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly. Just a few slow breaths is good.",RWPossum,1aiv8cp

1,"Hey OP! I was in this exact situation when I started my mental health recovery. I started with fluoxetine and for me it didn’t do much. Once I started bupropion was when I saw a difference. One thing that I need to tell you is ALWAYS. BE. OPEN. WITH. YOUR. DOCTORS. They’re not trying to hurt you, they’re trying to help. Remember they work for you, not the other way around. You don’t have to start meds if you do not want to. If you’re scared, tell your doctor how you’re feeling. 

Every SSRI has a large warning about increased depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts. Everyone reacts differently, it had a horrible reaction for me and it did just that. But you know what I did? I told my doctor “I don’t think this is working, I feel even more depressed than when I started.” And you know what— they stopped that medication and started me on something different. 

The first, second, third, etc. med may not work and that’s okay! It’s healthy and great to have your doubts and worries, it’s what makes you aware of yourself and what you put in your body.

The most important thing is that cold turkey is dangerous when you're on an antidepressant. Ask the prescriber how to quit.

There are things other than medicine that work physically on your system. I'm not saying that these are as good as medicine but there's a variety of good things and you can combine them for a greater effect.

If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr. Steve Ilardi's book (""a splendid book""). He's the therapist and researcher who headed the Univ. of Kansas lifestyle-depression project.

Relaxation eases the symptoms of depression.

Also, you have to be careful of what other people experience.

Literally a day into starting Wellbutrin I could not believe the difference in how I functioned. 

I will say that it’s not easy; we all have our own internal stigmas, never mind the stories we hear/see online and wherever else. But, in the long run, I think it is worth the search.

56,"In my experience, meds have been the best thing for me when used in tandem with therapy. 

It depends on your individual body, your mental health diagnosis, what meds are available, etc. and it can take a long time for your body to adjust to the drug. Drugs may not work out for everyone, but that doesn't mean they won't for you. If one treatment doesn't work for you, that doesn't mean an alternative won't work. Many of them do have side effects that aren't favorable, but most drugs will have that regardless of what the med is. Some medicines also only work when a secondary treatment is applied (ie a med that requires you to eat a certain way or exercise or therapy, or whathaveyou). Even non-mental health drugs have that. Your doctor or pharmacist can walk you through the process too. 

It's about finding the one where the benefit outweighs the negative. Sometimes what your body responds to changes over time, too. My antidepressant causes me to be exhausted, but I will take having a hard time waking up in the morning over the brain fog, not sleeping at all, rumination, suicidality, not caring to eat, lethargy, lack of interest or motivation, headaches, poor hygiene, etc.. My antidepressant also has a long list of other side effects that I had no idea whether I would get, some that could even worsen symptoms. I also have the highest permitted dose for it bc of the severity and longevity of my depression (over half my life at this point lol). Mine also didn't respond at all or responded negatively to other meds. 

Try it out. Try it in tandem with your current treatments. You may even find that therapy works better after going on them. (Or, you can also see about finding another therapist; sometimes it's not you, it's them. It could also be the type of therapy. I'm personally a fan of CBT). Give your body time to adjust to the meds. Pay attention to any changes. It may even be helpful to journal what you notice so you can show your doctor during follow up appointments. Mental health meds are not always as immediate or exact as something like Tylenol that will kick in an hour, and certain severe disorders that require stronger or more specific medications may merit a lifetime commitment. This isn't a bad thing. A need is simply being met to improve the quality of life.  

Another thing: if/when you start feeling better, don't come off them until you speak with your doctor. The fact that your symptoms have been reduced is a sign it's working. It is not a sign that you've been cured. I think a lot of people who complain may not fully understand what exactly the med is supposed to do, or set an expectation for them based on their experiences with somatic meds. Neosporin is used to prevent bacterial infections that would delay healing of a skin wound. You'll see the direct result in the speed at which the wound heals. Mental health is not the same. It takes paying attention. 

Lastly, if you're nervous about trying meds, that's okay. It's normal. It's change. It's commitment. You may experience things in ways you never expected, or have never experienced at all. That's okay too. And, if ultimately they don't work out for you, you're not obligated to continue that treatment. It's awesome that you're considering this. It's strength to recognize when you need support, and strength to ask for that support. You're not alone in your journey. 

Good luck!!",Ram-brose,1cq56rq

For ADHD it **can possibly** help; but, ADHD is pretty complex, and the experience of ADHD widely varies.

I wish MDMA therapy was legal, because it's supposed to be a great option for people with anxiety.  I did Psilocybin therapy too; but, I don't have anxiety.  Some people with anxiety can't do psilocybin, because the ""come up"" can cause a level of anxiousness, which isn't ideal for someone who already has anxiety.

You can also consider researching some natural anxiolytics like Magnesium. Ashwagandha has anxiolytic properties. Vitamin D3 and Magnesium supplementation (recommended to do together) really helped with my depression and anxiousness transitioning between tasks. I've done write-ups on these.

Surprisingly enough, Nicotine is being recognized as a treatment option for ADHD. We are building a knowledge-base of this on our Discord, and I can link you some stuff if you'd like.  I'll admit this isn't a topic that I'm the lead researcher on.  Nicotine is known to be addictive but apparently there's protocols to avoid being addicted.

4,"Hi there, as a psychologist I'd say no. Think about it this way: people with hypertension or hypothyroidism need to take meds to keep those in check. If someone with hypertension stops taking their medicine because they think that their tension is already within normal values, their tension will spike again, and it can be quite dangerous. Same happens with meds for psychiatric disorders with a strong biochemical component, such as BD or psychotic disorders - you're alright because you're taking the meds, which stabilise the chemical aspect of the disorder that causes you to have the manic and depressive stages of BD, and the positive symptoms of psychosis (the meds act mostly on positive symptoms, not so much on negative ones). If you stop taking meds, it's quite probable that you'll relapse, even if you now have some more tools with which to handle your (medicated) symptoms thanks to therapy. I'd definitely not quit meds.",throwawaypistacchio,194y9rl
5,"Finding a psychiatrist that you can trust and work with over the long-term would be the recommended route, particularly if you know that bipolar is present — medication is proven to be the most effective treatment for bipolar disorder. It's rare that a bipolar person can manage a stable lifestyle without being on a daily regimen for the rest of their lives, and there's research showing that each manic episode that takes place ""in"" an unmedicated bipolar brain leads to literal brain damage. If psychosis is already present, that would suggest that the bipolar is already somewhat severe. 

As for tapering, I would be surprised if it would work — but that's a question that a psychiatrist should be answering, because it's so dependent on the individual's biochemistry. The best analogy I've heard is to think of bipolar being like diabetes. If you're a diabetic, you simply have to take medication for the rest of your life in order to keep your levels stable. Maybe if it's caught in the early stages, it can be managed in a more effective way. The only difference is what fluctuates — a relatively consistent self / state of mind versus blood sugar. 

But medication isn't for everyone — and it can be a long road to find the right mix.

8,"As others have said, yes they work, but they don't make everything suddenly 100% better. They also don't make you 'happy' or stoned (unless they are benzodiazepines, which are only for short term use usually). 
They generally work by making your negative emotions more manageable, and helping your brain recover it's emotion regulating and reasoning ability. 

Studies have shown that it is likely that most antidepressants work by stimulating neuroplasticity. Over a period of stress the brain loses connections, and thus the ability to control the lower (inner) parts of the brain which are responsible for 'fight or flight' and automatic emotions.
It seems that antidepressants work by stimulating regrowth of these connections, and reducing the impact of stress on the brain. This is also why therapy combined with antidepressants is generally more effective that either alone.  Building healthy connections rather than unhealthy ones can make sure that you actually feel better and don't go strait back into the same place when you taper of medication later.

The particular antidepressant that suits your brain without giving unwanted side effects can sometimes take a bit of trial and error, but it's very possible to find one that works for you, there are loads of different options and your doc will advice which is the best to try first.

If you had an alternative modality to address it. That would be one thing. You just do not want to treat it. Pretend like you don't have a problem. How long has this been going on?

I would be very concerned about the anxiety. If that turns into a panic attack, there is a good chance that it will cause permanent changes within you.

You need to start looking up your illness and be a much more involved patient. Don't be that person that is still suffering from it 10 years from now talking to a friend about it. Saying you ""tried medication for it years ago, it didn't work for me."" When in reality you took it for a few days, had an adverse reaction and stopped taking it without talking to you Psychiatrist to change to something different.

Take the damn meds and participate in your care.",Dizzy-Job-2322,18b8tw9
1,"You should most definitely take the medication since it is prescribed. I understand your hesitation though. It‘s gonna be okay, you can do it.",-GhostSpider-,18b8tw9
2,"I suggest you begin taking your medication, as long as it has been prescribed by registered and practicing physician. If you’re feeling anxious about the medication research it a little , look up the potential side effects and benefits and how it works etc. . That might give you some insight and a more confidence with this new medication for you.",Kindly_Entertainer_7,18b8tw9
3,"Taking medication for a legitimate condition does not make you any less of a person or any less worthy.

Try them for a while and see if they help, if they don't tell your doc and they will have you try another.

Taking the medication won't make you less 'you"" or make your life less interesting. It should do the opposite and help you live better.

Its okay to feel fear about the diagnosises. It's okay to feel like you shouldn't even need medication. However you do have to accept   that you have anxiety and depression. It's the only way you're going to get better. 

I promise that psych meds will help you.


I have bipolar disorder and it was a little hard to accept in the beginning but I did and my life has been the better because of it. I also deal with anxiety and my meds greatly help both my bipolar and anxiety. They help me live life, they help me enjoy life. Before I was drowning and instead of pulling me under more they lifted me up and help me thrive. They have literally been a life saver if you get my drift.

Because of my meds I have a life and am able to hold my head up high.

I know this whole thing is scary and that anxiety and depression can be terrifying on their own. But the meds are a tool to lessen that fear and lessen the impact they have on your life.

If you're able get into therapy then I highly suggest you do. It's a game changer.

If you're not able to afford it or have limited access to therapy, look into DBT. There's a bunch of stuff online for free. DBT changed my life and helped me learn to function better, handle stress better and to handle people better.

Take your meds, at the very least try them for a while and see how they help. You don't absolutely have to take them but we highly suggest you do. You won't become addicted to them (be careful if you take a benzodiazapine though because they can be addictive). You have nothing to lose if you try them and everything to gain.",MyLife-is-a-diceRoll,18b8tw9

5,"Hi there,

Medications, especially in the early course of treatment, are meant to aid you in the ability to properly do treatments and therapy. If you are anxious and depressed, it is very difficult to trust and have the energy to properly participate in your own recovery. 

For some people, medications become a permanent part of their lives because they need them. Some, upon treatment with licensed professionals, can slowly lower or even eliminate medication usage, depending on the type of disorders. As you are receiving treatment, your diagnostics may also change as you adjust treatment and the professionals are able to see deeper into the issues. 

""Denial"" of needing it is really a piece of denial that you are mentally ill. You are sick. Just in a way less visible to others directly. Sickness requires attention, treatment, and medicine to heal. Do not ignore your sicknesses. Take care of yourself. <3",Acquainted-Faith,18b8tw9

Please, tell me about your personal experience with panic attacks. What triggers you? Do you crawl on the floor and roll up in a ball? I would really like to know.

Do you use any kind of medication to control it, when you have no control at all.

Tell me all about.",Dizzy-Job-2322,18b8tw9
10,"Okay, I appreciate the work you put into explaining anxiety for me. It's good to have what I believed to be true challenged. I don't purposely want to tell anyone incorrect information. My thought from my experience was that a panic attack I had did change me. It was thirty years ago, so I considered it permanent. What I experienced was what I thought was a panic attack. Maybe it was something else. What is a mental breakdown now called?

I do see a therapist weekly and am getting a refresher course on what I learned in the '90s. In a few weeks I'm going to bring what you mentioned up. I wanted to get it clarified by him and how it relates to me.

I also see a Psychiatrist once a month for medication management. So you don't need to send the mental health bots after me offering help. 

As far as telling the person that the damage is irreparable. Calling it a dick move was a little harsh and unwarranted. So, considering we are criticizing each others work today. You could have been a little softer in you're approach. If you truly want to make a change with a persons behaviour. You will catch more flies with honey. But, all is good. I'm a big boy and can take it.

I was attempting to give the person a little shake. Wake them up a bit to the fact it's important to address their health. Be compliant with the prescribed medication.

It was a different experience  meeting with you today Mr Napoleon. I learned something. Thank you.",Dizzy-Job-2322,18b8tw9
0,"hey there. In general, in order to remember things to make new habits its good to chain them together with something you do every day. So, for example, if you shower every day you can keep the meds in your bathroom soyou see them when you go to the shower. If you have breakfast, keep the meds where you can see them when you go to the kitchen, you can have the meds on the table you keep your phone during the night so you see them when you wake up",Kkntucara,13m4qji
1,"I also take ADHD meds + an antidepressant and antipsychotic for moods. I have found that taking the antidepressant and antipsychotic before bed helped me greatly. It's much easier for me to remember to do something before bed when i'm relaxed vs in the morning when i'm distracted by whatever the day has going on. (it helps that my meds make me sleepy, because now my body relies on them to sleep, so me being up late reminds me i probably didnt take them) the adhd meds however... I still struggle with, especially cause I need to take it in the morning. But! Immediate release / short acting adhd meds makes a huge difference! With extended release or long acting meds, if i forgot to take it by 1pm it was ""too late"" cause id have trouble sleeping, But with shorter acting ones I can take them when I need them or whenever I remember in the day without any issues. I keep my other meds right on the nightstand by my bed, And I take them both at the same time and go to sleep. Alarms never worked for me, but being like ""Ok im gonna lay down now, Ill take my meds then get under the covers"" is so much easier to keep up with. And if laying in bed i realize ""ugh i forgot"" i will be way more inclined to just readh over to my nightstand and take them vs if they were anywhere else id be like meh ill skip it 😂 
So yeah, associate meds with sleepy time! unless they're immediate release formulations there is no ""best time of day"" only what works for you!",caledenx,13m4qji
2,"I know the pain, I had a hard time remembering for myself too, my mom helped in High School when I was first diagnosed and towards now, to me it's just been worked into a routine. Kind of how people tend to wake up before their alarms on a workday, it just drills in after you start getting it more into your  head. I also got a Medicine Box that has the Days of the week on them to take them on their day so 10 PM Mon I take my 3 medications and if you think you forgot them you can check the box and see it empty your golden. More medications at certain times like 6AM to 6PM you can get 2 of them and mark them for the times. If you have a hard time with the times maybe you can ask your doctor if you can be more flexible with the times, then work it into a routine. Also if it says ""With Food"" please do that personal experience it sucks if you don't. Good luck my friend you've got this.",FallenPine75,13m4qji
3,"Alarms and pill holders for me. I have a months worth of pill holders for morning/noon/night. Weekly and daily containers. I keep my dinner ones by where I eat dinner. My morning ones by my toothbrush. My afternoon ones depend on my schedule. If I know I won’t be home I take the holder and put it in my pocket. Even if I miss the alarm at some point I’ll feel it in my pocket. 

When we travel I keep them by my wallet. This can work at home too. I don’t leave room/house without my wallet so I’ll see my morning ones, grab the others. Verify my alarms are set and off I go.

Then, after the withdrawal is over and it's out of our system due to that change we can feel heightened moods and emotions. Doesn't mean you won't ever need them again, but if you feel pretty stable ride the wave and see how far it takes you. I'd still be cautious if you have Bipolar that your recent upswing in mood and emotions isn't mania or something that could turn into that. I'd be cautiously optimistic.

Sadly sometimes doctors are not trained to deal with mental health issues and you need to seek actual mental health professionals. There are a lot of people around the world like you where meds simply don’t work for them so they need to try other things. Various therapies, group sessions etc. I was reluctant to try group therapy I imagined it more like some kind of AA meeting or something where people would judge you but it was quite the opposite. They taught me a lot and if I wanted to share my feelings I could, if not that’s okay too. Maybe see if there are any groups for people who are suffering from the same things as you local to your area.

I made a good friend at school who was going through something worse than me and we talked about it a lot and that helped, but unfortunately she had to drop out because of her mental health. Now that she's at home we still text but she's joining a therapy trial thing but she told the doctors that if it doesn't work she will unalive herself and if I lose her I don't have anyone I know that's going through the same things as me.",Ameliasaurus_Rex666,18axgtg

2007 after years of trial and error, I finally found an antidepressant that worked.  Brilliant!  I can finally get off of the antidepressant merry go round.  But it causes insomnia.  Like brutal, wicked, unending, chronic insomnia - the kind where you're absolutely exhausted after days of barely 2 hours a night but still can't fall asleep.  That's ok.  It's easier to find a sleep med that works than an antidepressant that works.  4 sleep meds (at the same time) later, I can mostly manage to get halfway decent sleep most nights.  But the antidepressant combined with the Adderall that I take for ADHD and causes tachycardia.  Ok, we'll add a BP med.  BP med doesn't help my anxiety, though, and SSRIs are contraindicated with the antidepressant that works, so lets toss some day time benzos into the mix...  

Gotta admit that when I was on that combo of meds, it was the most mentally stable I've ever been ever, and I stayed on that mix for more than a decade.  It was worth the stress and frustration of trying to find the right combo to get my wonky brain functioning pretty darned closed to normally. 

Lost my job, lost my health insurance, ended up off of all meds for a few years.  Got a new job but never really got back on track.  Trying to get back on track now, but I can't find a doc to continue that crazy regimen, so I'm back to the drawing board.  New antidepressant.  Fingers crossed.

I will say that it probably won't help that you were self-medicating rather than using recreationally, as that's actually more likely to cause addiction due to the use being (presumably) more frequent. Lots of people try cocaine and move on with no issues, whereas people who self-medicate tend to have more issues.

I also don't think tolerance will be an issue. It's not like anesthesia where a high tolerance could cause serious complications. Worst case scenario the meds just won't work as well. Best case scenario, you might adjust more quickly and get less of the jitters. If you go in like, ""By the way, I used cocaine a lot and might need an unusually high dose of Ritalin,"" that will raise some very justified red flags with the doctor.

8,">Not with cocaine because it is not physically addictive but rather psychologically. 

I don't quite understand what you're saying. All addiction is physical and psychological, there aren't distinctly ""physical"" and ""psychological"" subtypes. Cocaine addiction is quite clearly a physical, chemical phenomenon as the drug predictably causes addiction with repeated use in a wide range of subjects, famously including rats.

>As I was only using it therapeutically, I did not develop a psychological need for it.

Well, first, cocaine therapy is just a nice way of saying you were self-medicating with a highly addictive, toxic substance. That you put a socially acceptable spin on it doesn't reduce the very real danger. There is no protocol for using cocaine ""therapeutically"" for ADHD, which means you were dosing yourself based on what you felt you needed, which is often how people get addicted to prescription stimulants.

It's easy to think that addicts are all just frivolous hedonists, but MANY of us started out using drugs to manage a medical problem. Nothing you've said rules out that your cocaine use is any less dangerous, and in fact seems more dangerous because you seem so convinced you're a special exception to these near-universal rules about how drug addiction works.

No it isn't. There is physical dependence whereby the body has a physical need for the drug to remain homeostatic, and sudden withdrawal can cause serious physical symptoms. For example, my mother is prescribed opioids for her pain. If she doesn't take her pills for a few days, she experiences physical withdrawal symptoms. She has no desire to take the pills but does so to alleviate the symptoms (and obviously the pain) 

Psychological dependance is where it is a mental and cognitive process. You feel a need for the drug and so take it. This is the same mechanism by which people can addicted to gambling, porn, and gaming. It is due to downregulation of certain neurotransmitter receptors such as dopamine. Some drugs can cause both but most tend to be stronger in one than the other.



>Well, first, cocaine therapy is just a nice way of saying you were self-medicating with a highly addictive, toxic substance.

ADHD medicine is also highly addictive. Stimulants in general are highly addictive. Most drugs are toxic and have side effects. Method of administration and use is important. 

I would never snort powder cocaine firstly because it is cut with God knows what and secondly because it leads to a high and brief peak which has little practical use and increases tolerance and risk of addiction.

I used coca leaves which contain cocaine at lower levels. I would chew on the leaves, and never developed a need to increase my dosage. I have never used it recreationally and haven't used it since receiving my ADHD meds.

>and in fact seems more dangerous because you seem so convinced you're a special exception to these near-universal rules about how drug addiction works.

I am not an exception. However, I have studied psychology, I have a lot of history dealing with mental health conditions, and know the process by which addiction creeps up on people, which is why I only ever used the cocaine for therapeutic purposes, and never to feel good or when I was in a bad mood.

All stimulants can cause addiction. I know how drugs work.",Novel_Candidate3068,1b4porf
12,"Well, you didn't mention you were just using coca leaves. Processed cocaine is a very different animal but one that people with ADHD are prone to using, often with good intentions, but with harmful results.

As for physical dependence, that's not a form of addiction and is a separate phenomenon. People confuse them because one drug, morphine, served as the prototype for understanding both conditions.

Sorry for not being clear. In my mother's case, if her pain was to stop, she would be able to slowly decrease the dosage. She is not addicted. However, some people can become addicted purely because of the physical withdrawals. This is separate to psychological addiction where they are mainly mental symptoms.

>Processed cocaine is a very different animal but one that people with ADHD are prone to using, often with good intentions, but with harmful results.

And this is again due to people snorting the stuff. If you snort adderall, you're likely to become addicted as well. And not to mention powder cocaine is never pure which makes it more dangerous.

And even if that would be true, the reality is that most likely it will go in waves. Some easier to handle than others.",macnmouse,1ce7hl8

Pills on their own do a lot but you need to really dig into yourself. I still see pills as the mental Painkiller. Unfortunately you don't really ""fix"" the pain by using painkillers. For me the pills lost their effects around a year in. Doctor had to increase my dosage. It was during the time that i didn't have a therapist.

10,"I’ve tried basically every meds available, I believe a large part of it is psychological and social and that needs for more focus but some things we can’t change 

I have extreme treatment resistant depression as well trauma and BPD plus anxiety& OCD, 

I actually am on opioids, and there’s alot of stigma but if you are feeling like you want to die all time, I think it’s a better option, and in the last case scenario, if considering suicide especially this should be a more acceptable option 

SSRIs personally just made me feel more numb, and I know some others like that, also they have severe sexual side effects IME, 

Opioids seem rather to soothe snd increase distress tolerance so I get to feel sad snd bad emotions but I feel I can handle them more easily.

Medication often has trade offs, but id say antipsychotic drugs which are frequently RX and actual cause brain damage, opioids are actually much safer and don’t cause organ damage on their own, so other depression meds, I’d say do your own research learn a bit 

I’d say to learn a bit about basics brain biochemistry (dopamine serotonin endorphins etc) and learn actually which receptors medication acts on, and then give it a try and if you have side effects you can taper off 

But don’t expect medication to automatically make one feel better, even something as strong as opioids I have a lot of issues and I need psychotherapy, I would recommend psychotherapy first but problem it’s expensive 

I’m saying just be careful and be sure to do one’s homework basically 

Sorry for rant",JuliustheWise,w5jgw4
11,"Yeah I get where your coming from, yes one must work on themselves and find purpose in one’s life, but sometimes someone needs a painkiller 💊 to help be able to not repress one’s feelings and be able to improve ones self 

Same BPD I believe is cluster B, just means I’m very emotional, and I feel emotions extremely intensely 

Studies have shown that the brain processes psychological and physical pain the same way so it would make sense that opioids can help depression plus endorphins are very important for hedonic tone, if those path ways are distrusted 

Basically I think the brain chemical thing is real but it’s not separate from psychology our thoughts and life influence our brain development and if one suffers trauma and invalidation emotionally, like malnutrition it makes sense that these brain chemicals can be disrupted 

Basically I’m saying I guess that meds can be a tool to help one get one a better tragectory but to actually change those brain chemcials one needs psychological healing",JuliustheWise,w5jgw4

20,Low mood. Suicidal thoughts/self harm. Stuff like that. Also spending most the time in bed. Didn't want to be alive. All bad stuff. Still have issues. But you learn to not act. Sorry if response isn't as detailed I vomited on myself last night after having takeaway for tea. So feel not the best. I've self harmed on occasion with not being on them. And occasionally relapse with issues. But I still had issues on meds and when I did something to myself on them I did it worse. Depressive episodes were worse on them. Also I just didn't feel like myself and that is a scary thing. Like yes I may feel more depressed off of meds but it is me and something I can deal with. Unlike on meds you feel fake slightly happy/empty and then end up super depressed all the while still occasionally sh even when you felt happy. It was weird. I'll be blunt. I think I would definitely kms on meds. Yes I want to kms a lot  but I'm less likely to act on it even though I feel like it but that's because I'm used to feeling it rather then feel  nothing but still end up picking up something sharp or pills and taking them feeling nothing towards doing it. I could tell I would have done it.  Luckily I had another super bad depressive episode on them first and that stopped me taking them and then decided not to take them anymore. Luckily I don't experience withdrawal. Hope this helps.,Suk1Sak1Wood,w5jgw4
21,"I'll give you my best guesses because I think my depression gets worse for personal reasons and the fact that I also have Anxiety and P.T.S.D. complicates things. I don't remember what the names of each drug was, although I could look I up on my medical records it would just take awhile. Anyway, I don't think any of them made my mental health worse, but it did get worse while I was taking them, and I just don't think the antidepressants were the direct cause. All of them made me gain at least a little weight and all but 1 or 2 upset my stomach at least a little. I've also had aches and pains, sometimes to the point where I felt like I couldn't move (I could though, it just hurt), and I'd get mild to severe headaches, sometimes I'd get a popping and/or shaking sensation, and they made me dizzy. 1 of them made me ravanouusly hungry all the time, I mean I would finish an outback dinner, sides and everything, and still feel like I normally would if I hadn't eaten all day. The stomach pain wasn't severe on all of them, but a few made me feel constantly very nauseous and I had to stop taking another 1 because I was throwing up anything I ate. They also tend to make me either jittery or drowsy. I can't exactly say I would encourage anyone to take antidepressants based on my experience, and SSRIs (not all of the antidepressants I've taken are SSRIs, but most of them were because those are the most common) might not even be as effective as they are given credit for being.

Not all mood stabilizers work on mania, lamotrigine/lamictal specifically works on improving depressive symptoms instead for example. It also helps with some types of seizures. 

While many medications are initially created for one type of illness like antidepressants or blood pressure, they can be used for other reasons because doctors have learned about their helpfulness. It’s really cool that we as humans can make something that we later learn can help more than one targeted group of people. 

I hope this helps. I hope the medication helps you feel better as well. It can take a long time for something to kick in, but doctors are your teammates and ultimately want to see you healthier and happier. That sounds so cliche but they really do.",Cats_and_Cheese,1872qej

2,"It is really important to discuss medication changes with your doctor. It sounds like you're feeling better, and that's great! Deciding whether or not to continue taking a medication is a very personal decision and could be dependent upon a multitude of factors including any other medications you may currently be taking, physical health concerns, past history of depression/anxiety, family history of mental health issues etc. 

I would recommend speaking with your doctor about whether continuing the current course of treatment would benefit you long-term at this time. Alternatively, if your doctor agrees after assessing all these factors it might be appropriate to reduce the dose in order to start weaning off the drug gradually under their direct guidance. If there are other treatments available for managing specific symptoms (like cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety), these can also help support an ongoing recovery without relying solely on prescriptions drugs.

If  you stop taking them, at least make sure you've got a few weeks of supply at home. Make sure your prescription doesn't expire for the next few months at least, if you can afford it.

You might not feel better straight away, but the knowledge it shouldn't take more than a few weeks has always been a comfort for me whenever I tried.

NOT READY :

“ I lost weight and eat healthy “ 

“ My room is now tidy and I know where everything is “ 

** some time later with a life stressor ** 

“ I stopped going to the gym because I got overwhelmed with -put stressor- and it’s been 6 months since I last went”

“ I got so busy and occupied lately I can’t find time to eat healthy and I gained so much weight” 

“ Aah it is so busy these days I can’t find time to clean my room and it is frustrating me grrr” 

READY : 

“ It’s been 6 months since I started the gym, I had to deal with -stressor- which stopped for two weeks but now I’m back stronger and better. I got this. “

“ It’s been very busy lately but I’m proud that no matter what I found the time to make myself healthy meals no matter how simple they are “ 

“ My room is always tidy and whenever it starts to get messy I immediately realise it is due to -stressor- and I try to remediate the situation “

Neuroticism is an artificial barrier created by the person. A negative thought loop that gets out of control.

For example, if you have migraines, psoriasis, depression, arthritis, and high blood pressure, then being on appropriate medications for each would be fine; no magic number. To start, please know you do not need to answer the questions I pose below for me or the rest of Reddit.  These are questions I would ask myself and my physician in your situation given my personal experience with some of these medications.
1. What is each medication treating? (I was on topiramate for no logical reason—not bipolar, no migraines.)
2. Why am I on this particular medication?  (For example, Paroxetine-Paxil-is one of many SSRIs, but I know the withdrawal from Paxil is often much more severe than other medications. It was for me, and it required slow tapering for months to get off of it using an expensive liquid formula)
3. Are any of my medications being prescribed just to counter side effects of another medication?  If so, is there an alternative medication that treats the underlying condition with fewer side effects?
4. What’s the role of each medication in my treatment?  Is this something I’m going to be on indefinitely?  If temporary, what are the withdrawal issues if any?  Will stopping one medication for whatever reason impact the effectiveness of any of my other medications?
5. Does my physician know how much I really use my HHC vape?  (No judgement; I didn’t even know what HHC was. Your physician would know if there’s an adverse impact on your mental health or the efficacy of one or more medications.

I did ketamne therapy through MindBloom, and it helped for about 2 days at a time. It was too expensive to be sustainable long-term, and that's also not the point of the program.

Effexor might be a good option if your medical provider recommends that. Lifestyle factors and therapy are the best ways to treat depression and anxiety though.

A thing I learnt from my therapist was that, anxiety isn’t a bad thing, it’s the bodies warning sign that something isn’t right and needs addressing.  Meds tackle the anxiety symptoms but not the root of it.  Changing and challenging things in your life is harder than taking meds for sure (and often people don’t even know what to change).

This is all mental health education really.  I have always said that the best thing about first going to therapy is the education.  I just didn’t know any of this prior to therapy and it has stayed with me ever since.
Things like positive strokes, parent-adult-child ego states, what our personality drivers are - what other people’s driver are, how I cope and soothe myself etc etc.  I would come out empowered by what I had learned.

Personally I would stay off the meds, especially at this age, if it's not so debilitating that you can't function. 
Meds are hit and miss, and often come with a lot of bad side effects that shouldn't be taken lightly; they are in my opinion excellent as a temporary, emergency measure so that you become able to get the help you need (in form of therapy, exposure). In severe cases, it's so debilitating that even getting out of bed feels impossible, or anxiety overwhelms your ability to do any basic interactions, preventing you from getting any help. Meds make sense in that case.

Depression, in my case, stemmed from anxiety. If there's no other medical reason for it (thyroid issues, sleep quality, etc.), the anxiety itself stems from low self esteem, lack of confidence and compassion for oneself, feeling worthless. Working on this specifically helped, it takes a conviction that you can deal with all that stuff that scares you, alone. 
How would you treat your best friend? You would be compassionate and console them. Pretend you are your best friend, all the time.

Also, self confidence isn't built with positive talk. It takes actions, you have to show yourself that you can accomplish something, just take it in small steps.

It took me months. Don't expect it to immediately work well, and pay attention to side effect etc if you decide to go for it, it could be important to have a doctor you can talk about that with for the first couple weeks months at least, for me that was a psychiatrist, but that could end up costly as well. A different type of doctor could work as well, depending on how they work where you live. Try and learn if there are free psychiatrist available to you! Different things help different people, but that might be a good reason to try those different things if you can.

Ok now that’s out of the way. I was on a long journey with this from the time I was about 17 until basically today, I’m 34 now. My issue was more depression but anxiety was a part of it. I tried antidepressants a couple of times and they worked temporarily and then the effects wore off, and they had to up the dose which again wore off. I had an alcohol addiction problem that further complicated this though as well. 
What I did after that really worked though. I said look, I’m just going on this medication as a kind of short cut, I know there’s other stuff I can be doing to improve my mental health before I resort to drugs. So I started doing all those things: journaling, meditating, therapy, regular exercise, getting my sleep schedule worked out, working on my diet (it sounds like a lot but I worked at it one by one). When I went down to eating meat once a week, my depressive episodes seemed to get much less severe and less frequent.

2,"Dealing with a case of depression with just a bottle of pills is not a very good solution. There are therapists who specialize in helping teenagers because these people present special problems. That's one of the reasons why the lifestyle therapies are so important. They are things that are mostly easy if not downright fun, ideal for teenagers.  
  
The treatments for anxiety and depression are not exactly the same, but they have some things in common. For example, relaxation helps with both problems. Reducing stress is good for anxiety and depression. Calming down helps you to think carefully about the thoughts that bother you. Slow breathing is especially good for this. Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend a breathing exercise in the morning and at bedtime for anxiety - breathe gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.  
  
The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.  
  
There's something very important to understand - the energy problem.   
  
  
People say, ""I know there are things that will make me feel better - getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I'm depressed and I don't have the energy."" The thing is, people do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.    
  
  
We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks (video) -

You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise. As little as 20 min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit.

If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Ilardi's book (""splendid"").

I was on anti-depressants 20 years ago, and I wish I was presented with a plan for how to combine various efforts to work through it. It was another twenty years until I could sort through issues that cleared the way for me to see my depression, some of its sources and some of the things I needed to work on. I can't say enough about getting exercise - I am an athletic person and exercising, especially alone like in the gym, really helped. Just doing something, for no reason or end purpose, other than to occupy my mind during the activity helped immensely. 

All this to say, teenage years were the hardest times of my life. I felt and imagined the full weight of the world and I thought I had to bear it, instead of work to see it clearly and understand it. 

If my parents engaged with me in my depression, from an authentic, vulnerable place and shared some of their struggles, it could have helped maybe - it could have helped me feel less alone, which is what depression wants to do; just spiral away from everyone else, and oneself. Not a suggestion, just some food for thought. 

The turning point in my own depression was learning that part of it was to cope or protect myself from hard, challenging, unacceptable feelings and not knowing what to do about them. So I shut my whole self down, because I didn't feel like anyone could relate to me nor could I do the same for others. 

That's the essence of my story, just to put it out in the open and share some points for thoughtful consideration.

I personally think that the brain likes this and it is an effective way to cope for some time. I'm in my 40s and still do arts or making things with my hands, though I've found different things like soap, graphic design, reading, writing, poems, singing, trying out some musical instruments.

This article from the American Psychological Association says that most people with anxiety disorders do better with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) than with medicine.

Although self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.   
  
In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts..  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.  
I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

Not overjoyed, just happy. That's a good start.  


Now I'm back to the place 'from hence I came', and I had to start using medication again. Been on it steadily for at least six months, still too depressed to work properly, but functional enough to plan moving again, far away from my wrong impressions. Obviously some people are more prone to melancholy than others, I'd know since I also have what we call 'Reaccuring Major Depressive Disorder' in my country.   


Most of the time depression is due to environment and your situation in life, and in my personal case, **which I can't stress enough is different for everyone**, medicine only gives me the little push I need to make incrimental changes until I'm... somewhat content. Sometimes happy.   


I believe that it sucks seeing your peers have an 'amazing' time on meds, but realistically, you shouldn't seek to be overjoyed, just start with happy. And start thinking about if maybe some changes or goals would make you happier, new friends or new surroundings.",,1877rlt

**Conclusion: Non-amnestic mild cognitive deficits are consistently induced by first-generation antihistamines** and tricyclic antidepressants, while benzodiazepines provoke combined amnestic and non-amnestic impairments.

1) Your GP may be helpful, perhaps in directing your search, helping you with your priorities, or giving you a prescription. You might get help at Mark Cuban's affordable drug company online. This  company is getting a lot of attention lately. Some are saying that it can radically change the drug industry.

2) There's a variety of things that can help - low-cost, low-risk things that are easy and can be combined with each other. I have advice from experts in my comments. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17o9qp1/comment/k7ynq3p/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17o9qp1/comment/k7ynq3p/?context=3)

3) Do research, including study of the online therapy reviews. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.

Do what you can to get a therapist. You may have to do a lot of research about this. Don't give up. Call your local social services (211?) and ask about Medicaid and Obamacare. Also, you can google ""affordable psychotherapy."" The cost of therapy can vary a lot.

You can, however, do things to mitigate your symptoms:

* Challenge negative thoughts, cognitive distortions. Search this topic and you'll find free resources online.
* Exercise is as effective as therapy (both cognitive and pharmacological). A 20 minute walk does great things for you, you don't have to jog or push really hard.
* Healthy eating.
* Get enough sleep.
* Mindfulness and meditation.
* Social connection.
* Set comfortable goals, make them small and reasonable.

0,"Unfortunately, you are. The long-term benefits outweigh the side effects, at least for most people. But it would be foolish to pretend it doesn't happen. It damages your central nervous system a little, so that over years you develop problems like ""the head snapping thing"" or thrashing in your sleep. It also dulls your experiences a bit.

But if u still have these concerns at the end of the month, then yes I would definitely discuss the dosage. I’m sure he’d agree that it will need changing if it’s not helping ur anxiety, depression, and mood swings :)

1,"Anxiety medication helps to reduce the severity of the symptoms, but depending upon the medication it can come with its own issues.  Benzodiazepines, for example, are highly habit-forming and potentially addictive.

The truth of the matter is, though, anxiety medications are a stop-gap measure designed to help you manage from here to there.  There, of course, being a life with less anxiety and better skills (through therapy) to manage the anxiety you do experience.

My recommendation, if you aren't already in therapy, is to go to counseling.  Develop the skills needed to limit your anxiety and to limit the impact that it has on your life... then stop using your medication as an excuse for not making the decisions you need to make.

You're literally putting your life on hold for a pill.  Maybe it's the best decision right now... I don't know.  I don't know your life or the decision.  But I do know that if you're using it as an excuse now, you'll use it as an excuse in a year, too.",,xinzsx

It taught me the basic principle of having healthy relationships with emotions, what anxiety really is and how to manage it and listen to it properly, how to think better & manage overthinking, and taught me some techniques that actually worked for me in de-escalating anxiety. 

I didn't have regular panic attacks, though I had a few, but my experience with anxiety was mostly sort of paralysing. Like an invisible wall stopping me doing things.

Short: take sunlight, do something that you are good at, go for a walk or listen to music

Long: focus on slowly getting good and things that make you anxious, and avoid the ones you don't need.

But it depends on each case obviously",Biscoff-in-hotdogs,17iidyt
3,"You now panic attacks have their triggers, what caused them, why, if you can see through the root cause, than you will understand that solving your panic attack you will have to solve or deal with your life problems/struggles that caused it, or triggered them. It’s easier said then done, probably it could be the best remedy, and what you really need to pass this through for good. 

Sedatives will tranquilize you for the moment, but they are not recommended taking them regularly, only when you need them, as less as possible. When you take them they will calm you down, but calming down doesn’t mean curing the problem, it’s still there, for that you definitely need professional help, psychiatrist + clinical psychologist it would be even better, 

Hopefully you might not need a psychiatrist, but don’t ignore such problems, if you could have solved them by yourself you would have done it, The sooner you seek professional help, then your state will not get worse with time if you have professional help, the easier will be to cure them, and a better life quality, i’m 35 now, and i’m on meds since 19, don’t complain, i’d rather be on meds and fine then with no meds and a mess. 

Doctors say the first step should be going to a psychologist first, if he can help you, than that’s awesome, probably
you won’t need a more powerful treatment, i.e, with drugs like me. 

Don’t fool yourself you can do it all by yourself, no one can, there are psychologists who go to another psychologist.

Maladaptive daydreaming - this is not officially recognized as a disorder but some people are getting therapy for it. An expert recommends going to a support group online, such as Wild Minds Network.  
  
  
Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that’s most responsive to self-help.

2,"I do not have experience with medication for MDing, but I do see people who want to stop or greatly reduce their MDing. Unfortuntely, medication can stop MDing for some people.  Entire worlds built by the imagination just disappear—which can be traumatic for those who have been MDing for years. Many people would just like to daydream less during the day, while others want to stop completely.  


Do you wish to continue having the quietness in your brain or are you looking for a balance of still having your imagination while also being productive & relaxed?",,10tubnh
0,"Are you talking about prescription meds or vitamin supplements? Or both? 
Most vitamin supplements are pretty easy to avoid with diet. For example two eggs is half your b12 for the day. 
Cheese has a bunch of b12 too, meat and fish are good for it and if you are vegan, fortified breakfast cereals have it in abundance.
All essential vitamins are accessible in a fairly typical diet barring certain conditions. It's how we evolved. 

Prescription meds though, I hear you, I was terrified of the dependency and the responsibility for a long time. It still bothers me a bit. I did talk to my therapist about it which helped a t lot.",doitpow,ysafh1

In that time, I've never chronically abused alcohol to the point of getting drunk.

0,"Yes! I'm on two antidepressants, one that works better for anxiety and another that works best for depression. When I was going through multiple panic attacks a day, my throat would be too tight for me to eat or drink anything. I would have starved to death if I hadn't taken these meds. When I wasn't having panic attacks, my throat would remain extremely tight. I'd eat maybe two spoonfuls of mac and cheese and a couple sips of water. I had to quit my job because I couldn't function as a person. But now, I have a new job, I can go places without fear of collapsing from a panic attack, I can do all of my hobbies, and I'm happier overall.

4,Medication is not for everyone. That being said I am happy I am taking antidepressants. My brain suddenly felt under control and I can focus my energy towards things I actually care about. But it takes a while to find the right medication for you. And idk if it's just me but I tried different brands of the same drug and only one worked for me so maybe that's also a factor.

If I miss a few days of meds, I don't have the energy to get out of bed, I cry about everything, and I have panic attacks at the thought of leaving the house. Obviously my experience isn't universal, but meds make it so much easier for me to exist.

Meds don't *fix* things. They make it easier to fix things. Their purpose isn't to make you happy and forget your problems and be completely normal. Their purpose is to help you be less sad, help you have more energy, and be a little more normal until you can face your problems. Meds can't and won't fix everything. It takes work to learn coping skills and address trauma and such. Meds work best when paired with some sort of therapy, so that's also something to consider.",ColorMyTrauma,twvsuk
13,"I wasnt on any meds for a long time. It took my life falling apart to start trying. It took another 2 years and a couple dozen meds later i had my “core meds” as i call them. Still contantly tweaking everything else.

What I’ve learned: 

Meds wont fix everything. They just give you some of ability to function. But meds wont give you money or stop a friend from being an ass to you.

Meds arent for everyone. Having understanding of if theyre helping not is so important. Do you have any small goals? Are your meds helping you do them or making it harder? You dont have to be happy all the time. That doesnt mean your feelings should dull or or numb lr disconnected. This isnt just for your doc. But yourself, if it is or isnt what you want thats what matters most.

17,"Yes! I’m on an antidepressant, and I have an as-needed anxiety medication. The anxiety med has worked from the get-go (calms me down and helps me get past anxiety attacks faster). This is the second antidepressant I’ve been on. The first one worked but had too strong a side effect.

Depression-wise I’d compare the medication to storm levies. They don’t get rid of or control the problem on their own, but they help lower the feeling / hold it back enough to give me a better chance to use therapy against it. It’s been very helpful, especially when i was in situations that were making it worse but that I could not change quickly. It definitely helped me get through that.

Be aware that it can take time to find one that works well for you and also that your body can adjust to them over time, making them less effective. I know someone who had to switch antidepressants because one that used to work stopped working so well.

Luckily, there are many different kinds that work in different ways, so there usually will be one that helps you if you put in the time/effort to find it. (With doctor oversight, of course)

Side note: It’s very important to be honest with your doctor because without knowing what you’re feeling/how you’re reacting, they can’t treat you properly. And if you’re not comfortable doing that with your current doctor, that can be a sign to find a different doctor.",SMKnightly,twvsuk
18,"I'm sorry for whatever you're going through. Have you ever had a doctor mention genetic testing for medications? I don't think it's a standard practice but it was helpful for my son. In one of your comments you mentioned a diagnosis of bipolar which is what my son has. He struggled with the diagnosis for a long time but seeing that he was compatible with bipolar meds vs not with some depression ones helped him to come to terms with his illness and work to manage it. Keep in mind also if you're under 25 that your brain is still developing and whatever works in the moment might change. Watching him go through the trial and error of meds for the last year has been very difficult but as an outsider I can tell when some combos work better than others. It sucks that there is so much variation in the meds and treatments. I highly encourage you to find a therapist you can trust, it's going to be extremely difficult for anyone to give you the proper diagnosis if they don't have all of the pertinent information.
For me personally, I have situational depression, I'm not a great pill taker but they can help when I need a little boost to get out of it. I think proper medication is a part of the treatment but having a good therapist and taking care of yourself are just as important. I guess what I'm saying is there's no magic pill but taken with all other factors can affect mental health positively.",peanut_692me,twvsuk

42,"When I was in the 3rd grade I was diagnosed with ADHD. When I was in the 5th grade I was diagnosed with Juvenile Rapidcycling Bipolar Disorder. This was back in the 90s when pretty much any kid that acted out was suspected of ADD, instead of, yknow, just being bored at school or someshit. 

When I was 15, after going to some group therapy and deciding I was sick of being floated between varying medications that didn't work and/or made me feel emotionally dead, I made the decision after consulting with my psychologists to go off all meds and see what happened. 

I was alright until my 20s, when I was diagnosed with Hashimotos Thyroid, migraines, anxiety, and acute depression within a couple years of each other, and later a suspected diagnosis of very mild autism. After a bit more medication testing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and simply getting back to work part time, Things seem to have evened out some. 

The big concern right now seems to be maintaining memetic excercises for my anxiety to keep me from spiraling into an attack, which still happens but less often, figuring out how to handle migraines so I miss less work and feel better, and keeping my depressive episodes to a minimum...no easy task with the current sociopolitical climate and the pervasive nature of political nonsense into pretty much every place that used to be an escape for me.",SmithAnon88,twvsuk
